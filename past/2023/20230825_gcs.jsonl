Much has changed, but not necessarily in ways China or Russia could have predicted.\n\nThree weeks after meeting Xi in Beijing ‚Äì and just days after the Winter Olympics ended, Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He had expected a quick victory, but seven months in, Russia is far from winning. Its forces are exhausted, demoralized, and fleeing territories they have occupied for months.\n\nA destroyed Russian tank overgrown by plants in the village of Lukashivka, in the Chernihiv region of Ukraine. Sergei Chuzavkov/SOPA/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nAnd that is making China nervous. Having grown ever closer to Moscow under Xi, Beijing has a direct stake in the war‚Äôs outcome. A defeated Russia will strengthen the West and become a less useful and reliable asset in China‚Äôs great power rivalry with the US. A weakened Moscow might also be less of a distraction for the US, thereby enabling Washington to focus more squarely on Beijing.\n\nXi has a fine line to tread. If he leans too much into helping Russia, he risks exposing China to Western sanctions and diplomatic blowback that would harm its own interests. The backlash would also come at a sensitive time for Xi, who is only weeks away from seeking a norm-breaking third term at the 20th Party Congress.\n\nSo far, the two authoritarian powers have not come any closer to shaping the world order in their favor ‚Äì if anything, experts say Russia‚Äôs war on Ukraine has served to strengthen Western resolve.\n\nHigh stakes\n\nFor Putin, invading Ukraine was likely a first step in removing Russia from the post-World War II ‚Äì and post-Cold War ‚Äì international order.\n\nA swift seizure of Ukraine would have dealt a painful blow to NATO, expanded Moscow‚Äôs sphere of influence and significantly shifted the balance of power in Europe, in Russia‚Äôs favor.\n\nA Russian victory might also have set a dangerous precedent in regards to China, which has vowed to ‚Äúunify‚Äù with the self-governing democracy of Taiwan ‚Äì by force if necessary.\n\nUnder Xi, Beijing is already stepping up military activity around the island. An easy win for Putin would have further deepened Xi‚Äôs belief the West is in decline, and provided a template for an attack on Taiwan ‚Äì a hugely consequential event that could reset the global balance of power.\n\nTanks fire projectiles during a Taiwanese military live-fire drill, after Beijing increased its military exercises near Taiwan in September. Ceng Shou Yi/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nBut Ukraine fought back and instead of sabotaging the US-led order, the invasion has reinvigorated NATO, strengthened transatlantic ties and united the West.\n\nPutin‚Äôs meeting with Xi, meanwhile, could not have come at a worse time. Russian forces are retreating en mass in the northeast of Ukraine, losing more territory in a week than they captured in five months.\n\nWhile it is still too early to predict the outcome, even the prospect of Russia losing the war is enough to make Beijing anxious.\n\nRussia‚Äôs setback in Ukraine is already starting to draw considerable political backlash within Moscow, and a complete defeat could potentially create political instability in the Kremlin ‚Äì and serious headaches for China.\n\nWhile the growing ties between China and Russia are primarily driven by their tensions with the West, they are also partly propelled by the close personal relationship between Xi and Putin. During his decade in power, Xi has met Putin 38 times ‚Äì more than twice as many times as he has met any other world leader.\n\nThere is no guarantee a Russia without a strong Putin would be as keen to pursue a ‚Äúno-limits‚Äù friendship with Beijing; in a worst-case scenario, it might even grow more friendly to the West, adding to long-running Chinese fears about geopolitical encirclement by the US.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Map shows how Ukraine pulled off counteroffensive 04:19 - Source: CNN\n\nSelf-interest calculation\n\nThe question, then, becomes how far Beijing is willing to go to ensure Putin remains in control, and that Russia remains a powerful security and strategic partner to counterbalance America.\n\nFor its part, China has abstained from voting against Russia at the United Nations. It has blamed NATO and the US for the war and decried Western sanctions on Moscow. It has also stepped up economic assistance to its neighbor, boosting bilateral trade to record levels.\n\n‚ÄúChina is willing to give Russia some tacit support politically, diplomatically and to some extent economically, but the bottom line is that it isn‚Äôt going to go out of its way and undercut its other strategic objectives to support Russia,‚Äù said Brian Hart, a fellow with the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nSo far, Beijing has carefully avoided actions that could violate Western sanctions, such as providing direct military aid to Moscow. Access to the global market is crucial for China, especially when its economy is already beset by severe problems ‚Äì from slowing growth, skyrocketing youth unemployment to a collapsing housing market.\n\nOne area to watch, Hart said, is arms sales. China has long been one of Russia‚Äôs largest purchasers of arms. ‚ÄúI wonder if Russia‚Äôs own defense industry is overstretched, would it turn to buy weapons from China,‚Äù he said.\n\nBut even then, China would likely seek to send spare parts or items not on the sanction list, or ship them via convoluted routes that are difficult to trace.\n\n‚Äú(Beijing and Moscow) have said over and over again that they don‚Äôt intend to create a formal alliance that binds them in ways that go against their interests. That didn‚Äôt work for them during the Sino-Soviet alliance in the 1950s, and I think they really view that as a lesson of history,‚Äù Hart said.\n\n‚ÄúI think China will only continue to strengthen relations with Russia, to the extent that it really is in their overall interests.‚Äù\n\nGrowing unease\n\nBut even before Russia‚Äôs battlefield woes, its military aggression toward Ukraine ‚Äì and Beijing‚Äôs tacit support for Moscow ‚Äì had already alienated some countries outside the Western orbit.\n\nWhen Xi and Putin meet other leaders of the eight-nation Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Uzbekistan on Thursday and Friday, the war in Ukraine will be the elephant in the room.\n\nHaving watched Russian tanks roll into Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, Central Asian leaders of former Soviet territories are worried that Russia could encroach on their land too.\n\nKazakhstan, in particular, has refused to toe Moscow‚Äôs line. It has sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and its President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has publicly refused to recognize Russia-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, enraging some Kremlin officials.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping with Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as he arrives in Kazakhstan on Wednesday. Yao Dawei/AP\n\nChina‚Äôs refusal to condemn Russia has caused unease among Central Asian countries, said Niva Yau, a senior researcher at the OSCE Academy, a foreign policy think tank in Kyrgyzstan.\n\n‚ÄúChina is at odds with countries in the region because it is still looking at Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine from this anti-West narrative ‚Äì like it‚Äôs about to bring down Western hegemony,‚Äù she said.\n\nThat risks hampering China‚Äôs efforts to build stronger ties with its Central Asian neighbors, an endeavor China has invested heavily in for two decades, according to Yau.\n\nDuring Xi‚Äôs state visit to Kazakhstan on Wednesday ‚Äì his first foreign trip in nearly 1,000 days ‚Äì the Chinese leader sought to allay such concerns.\n\n‚ÄúChina will always support Kazakhstan in maintaining national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,‚Äù Xi told Tokayev, the Kazakh President, according to Chinese state media.\n\nAn anti-West world order?\n\nXi‚Äôs trip to Central Asia isn‚Äôt only about showing support for Putin, though. It is also about strengthening ties in China‚Äôs periphery and reasserting Beijing‚Äôs global influence.\n\nFounded by China in 2001 to combat terrorism and promote border security, the SCO was shrouded in relative obscurity for years. Under Xi, it expanded in size and profile, granting membership to India and Pakistan in 2017. After years on the waiting list as an observer, Iran is slated to become a full member at this summit, according to Chinese state media reports.\n\nAfghanistan is also an observer, and the Taliban ‚Äì having taken over Kabul following a chaotic US withdrawal last year ‚Äì is sending a delegation to Samarkand.\n\nBut it is Iran that has set off most alarm bells in the West. Since 2019, Iran, Russia and China have held three joint naval drills amid deepening ties. Now, Iran‚Äôs expected inclusion in the SCO is stoking fears long held by some observers that the grouping is emerging as an anti-West bloc.\n\nBut some experts say in its current state, the SCO is not really the ideal platform for China and Russia to push that anti-West world order.\n\nAs a multilateral organization, the SCO is a much weaker regional bloc compared to the European Union or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n\n‚ÄúThere has actually been some tension at times within the SCO. Russia has tried to advance some of its interests which aren‚Äôt always aligned with China‚Äôs in the region. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs perfectly set up to be this kind of platform for shaping a new world order,‚Äù said Hart at the CSIS.\n\nAlso complicating the picture is the presence of India, which has strong ties with Russia dating back to the Cold War. But Delhi has also seen relations with Beijing nosedive due to conflicts along their border, and has moved closer to Washington and its allies in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nIndia is a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue alongside the US, Japan and Australia, a grouping driven closer together by China‚Äôs threats.\n\nNevertheless, Xi will use the SCO summit to show both the home crowd and the world that, despite being diplomatically isolated by the West, China still has friends and partners, and is ready to take on more leadership on the world stage.\n\nBut if the war in Ukraine ends up being a major inflection point for Russia‚Äôs weakening, it could deal a setback for Xi‚Äôs plans.\n\n‚ÄúChina doesn‚Äôt really have any other large powerful partners in the way that the United States has many European and Indo-Pacific allies that it can rely on. So Russia is by far the most powerful state that is somewhat closely aligned with China,‚Äù Hart said.\n\n‚ÄúI think that is something Beijing worries about ‚Äì that Russia will overextend itself and it could undermine their collective efforts to shape the world order.‚Äù", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/china/li-zhanshu-vladimir-putin-china-russia-high-level-meeting-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Putin claims Russia has 'lost nothing' over actions in Ukraine, as ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN ‚Äî\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia had not lost anything as a result of its ongoing military actions in Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking at an economic forum in the far eastern city of Vladivostok, Putin attempted to defend the costs of what he termed his country‚Äôs ‚Äúspecial military operation‚Äù in Ukraine, despite recent Western intelligence reports that indicate Russia is facing severe shortages of military personnel and equipment.\n\n‚ÄúWe have lost nothing and are not going to lose anything. Our main gain is the strengthening of our sovereignty. We didn‚Äôt start anything, in terms of military action, but are only trying to finish it,‚Äù Putin told the audience.\n\nIn a statement Monday, British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said more than 25,000 Russian soldiers are estimated to have died since the start of Putin‚Äôs invasion in February this year.\n\nRussia has paid an economic price for its aggression, too. A wave of punishing sanctions from Western nations targeting Russia‚Äôs vital energy exports and its financial system has left the country grappling with recession, and potentially facing a prolonged period of stagnation.\n\nWednesday‚Äôs Eastern Economic Forum, which focuses on building investment ties between Russia‚Äôs eastern region and global investors, comes on the heels of an announcement from Russian energy giant Gazprom on Tuesday that it had signed an agreement to start switching payments for gas supplies to China to yuan and rubles instead of dollars, a development that was referenced by Putin in his address Wednesday.\n\nThe forum also saw China‚Äôs number three leader, Li Zhanshu, a member of the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs Politburo Standing Committee and the country‚Äôs top legislator, meet in person with Putin on Wednesday, in what was the most senior-level, face-to-face meeting between the two countries since Moscow‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. The two were pictured together at a forum plenary session.\n\nMilitary junta leader General Min Aung Hlaing and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan also attended the forum, according to Russian state media.\n\nPaving the way\n\nThe meeting between Li and Putin could pave the way for China‚Äôs top leader Xi Jinping‚Äôs face-to-face meeting with Putin in Uzbekistan next week.\n\nXi will meet Putin at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit scheduled on September 15 and 16, Russia‚Äôs envoy to Beijing Andrey Denisov told reporters on Wednesday, according to Russian state news agency Tass.\n\nIt would be the first in-person meeting between the two leaders, who have established a close relationship, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. It would also be the first overseas trip for Xi since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLi arrived in Vladivostok on Wednesday to attend the forum, becoming the most senior Chinese official to leave China since the start of the pandemic, which has seen the country close borders and limit in-person diplomacy. The stop is part of a 10-day overseas tour, where Li will visit Russia, South Korea, Mongolia and Nepal from Wednesday, Chinese state media reported this week.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, center, Chairman of China's National People's Congress Standing Committee Li Zhanshu, left, and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, right, arrive to attend a plenary session at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia on September 7.

Beijing has since refused to condemn the aggression, instead repeatedly laying blame for the conflict on NATO and the United States.\n\nThe two countries have signaled that their partnership remains strong, with China‚Äôs Foreign Ministry saying last month that the two sides agreed to ‚Äúdeepen practical cooperation‚Äù during a meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of a regional gathering in Phnom Penh.\n\nAhead of his expected visit to Russia, Li made similar comments during a meeting last week with Russian Ambassador Denisov in Beijing.

Enormous challenges, some of them barely imaginable when the G7 leaders last met 12 months ago, are bearing down on the world‚Äôs most prosperous democratic nations as they prepare to meet in Germany.\n\nOptimism was in the air at the Cornish beach resort of Carbis Bay in 2021 as the G7‚Äôs presidents, prime ministers and chancellor met face-to-face for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic began.\n\nTogether they vowed to ‚Äúbeat Covid-19 and build back better,‚Äù to ‚Äúreinvigorate economies,‚Äù to ‚Äúprotect our planet‚Äù and to ‚Äústrengthen partnerships.‚Äù\n\nBut global events have since overtaken their best efforts, and it is far from clear if they will be able to build on those goals this year. Russia‚Äôs unprompted invasion of Ukraine is a large and singular cloud, but other thunderheads are gathering too.\n\nOver the next few days, the leaders of Japan, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the European Union and host Germany will meet amid the seclusion of Bavaria‚Äôs luxurious Schloss Elmau retreat.\n\nThe spa resort, nestled in a peaceful valley, usually offers well-heeled visitors a brief chance to escape from the cares of the world ‚Äì but even Schloss Elmau can‚Äôt shield the world‚Äôs leaders from the problems gathering on their horizon.\n\nRussian President Vladmir Putin‚Äôs officials are hinting at nuclear Armageddon, China has become increasingly assertive, a global food crunch is on the way, oil prices are spiking, and a global economic slowdown and a cost-of-living crisis are looming. Climate change aspirations are also being confounded and supply chain problems are hobbling hopes of a post-pandemic return to normality.\n\nAnd on top of all that, last year‚Äôs summit host, the UK, is threatening to break international laws over its Brexit agreement with the EU ‚Äì not to mention its controversial plan to deport asylum-seekers to Rwanda ‚Äì despite the risk of rocking the world order it helped build, and diluting the G7‚Äôs already limited effectiveness.\n\nAlthough G7 leaders can look back with some satisfaction at their unity in the face of Russia‚Äôs unprecedented aggression ‚Äì as seen in that ‚Äústrengthening partnerships‚Äù goal set in Carbis Bay ‚Äì the scale of looming crises dwarfs even that.\n\nPutin is not entirely to blame for the coming storm but his unjustified war in Ukraine is inextricably linked to many of the crises that are brewing. Without it, the fixes required would be easier and fewer, their impact less pernicious.\n\nG7 leaders pose for the official welcome and family photo during the UK-hosted G7 Summit in Cornwall's Carbis Bay in June last year. Leon Neal/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nFood crisis\n\nThe global food crunch is a case in point. It can be blamed, in part, on worldwide post-pandemic supply chain issues, but Russia‚Äôs theft of Ukrainian wheat and its blockade of Ukrainian shipping in the Black Sea, which is stopping Ukraine‚Äôs wheat and other farm products from reaching international markets, is also playing a major role.\n\nAccording to the UN‚Äôs World Food Program (WFP), Ukraine normally supplies 40% of its wheat; the UN‚Äôs Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says Ukraine supplies 16% of the world‚Äôs corn exports and more than 40% of the world‚Äôs sunflower oil.\n\nUkrainian farmers harvest barley fields in Odesa region, Ukraine, on June 22, 2022. Stringer/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nThe global NGO International Rescue Committee (IRC) said recently that ‚Äú98% of Ukraine‚Äôs grain and wheat exports remain under blockade,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúfood prices worldwide have rocketed by 41% and a further 47 million people are projected to experience acute hunger this year.‚Äù\n\nTraditionally Ukraine‚Äôs wheat and grain exports go to some of the world‚Äôs neediest nations: Libya, Lebanon, Yemen, Somalia, Kenya, Eritrea and Ethiopia.\n\nTo improve the situation, the G7 will need to get Putin to back down on some of his war aims, for example by ending the conflict, or restoring Kyiv‚Äôs control over all Donbas ‚Äì but so far there is no indication he is anywhere near doing that.\n\nEnergy crisis threatens climate commitments\n\nRising oil prices are another by-product of Putin‚Äôs war ‚Äì albeit one complicated by the fact that oil production is not matching up to post-pandemic increases in consumption. To fix this, the G7 will need to convince Russia‚Äôs OPEC+ partners, including Saudi Arabia, to turn their back on Putin and increase oil output.\n\nUS President Joe Biden‚Äôs trip to Jeddah, planned for mid-July, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson‚Äôs trip to Riyadh back in March offer hints that the G7 may be making some headway on this, but there are no guarantees yet. Saudi Arabia ‚Äì like Russia ‚Äì benefits massively from high oil prices; their gain is pain for the billions stuck with the bill of getting food to market.\n\nLast year‚Äôs G7 was all about net zero and a green pandemic recovery, but this year‚Äôs scramble by Western nations to wean themselves off Russian oil and gas has given a boost to the biggest single contributor to the crisis ‚Äì coal.\n\nG7 host Germany is now in crisis mode as Russia reduces its gas supplies to the country, weaponizing energy for influence as feared ‚Äì it is now saying it will fire up more coal plants. That‚Äôs a U-turn from last November, when Germany brought forward its deadline to phase out coal to 2030, eight years earlier than planned. After Russia‚Äôs invasion, it also expedited plans to transition its power sector to 100% renewables by five years.\n\nJohnson ‚Äì who said last year the world had reached a point of no return in phasing out coal ‚Äì just this week suggested the UK start mining the fossil fuel again for steelmaking. The country will also delay a plan to shut down more existing coal plants ahead of winter.\n\nAnd to address the oil crisis, Biden is suggesting a tax holiday on fuel as prices at the pump soar.\n\nFuel prices are displayed on a sign at a gas station in Berlin, Germany, on June 17, 2022.

Canceled flights and travel chaos across Europe and beyond this summer are just the visible tip of an iceberg-sized problem that is defying quick fixes.\n\nChina‚Äôs insistence on continuing to enforce a ‚Äúzero Covid‚Äù strategy is confounding not only its return to business as usual, but also rippling through global supply chains, with lockdowns keeping workers from factories and in the worst cases halting production. Despite growing tensions with the G7 nations, China shows no signs of aligning with their new post-Covid norms.\n\nA medical worker takes a swab sample for Covid-19 from a citizen on June 22, 2022 in Beijing, China. Fu Ding/Beijing Youthh Daily/VCG/Getty Images\n\nIn G7 nations and beyond, inflation is rising, central banks are raising lending rates and a global economic slowdown seems far more likely this year than last. The world‚Äôs richest man, Elon Musk, predicts that a US recession is ‚Äúinevitable.‚Äù\n\nProblems are layering in a way that is somewhat reminiscent of the global economic downturn in 2008.\n\nBack then, central bankers rallied and stopped the economic rot, but the geopolitical repercussions rippled on for years.\n\nThe Arab Spring signaled that economic pain had passed a threshold.

He cast doubt on an imminent invasion of self-governing Taiwan, and seemed hopeful his message about avoiding all-out conflict was received.\n\nStill, the US president was frank that he and Xi came nowhere near resolving the litany of issues that have helped drive the US-China relationship to its lowest point in decades.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not suggesting this is kumbaya,‚Äù Biden said at a news conference, ‚Äúbut I do not believe there‚Äôs a need for concern, as one of you raised a legitimate question, a new Cold War.‚Äù\n\nBiden entered Monday‚Äôs talks hoping for an opportunity to take stock with Xi of the world‚Äôs most important bilateral relationship. He described Xi as not overly confrontational but instead ‚Äúthe way he‚Äôs always been: direct and straightforward.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHe was clear, and I was clear that we will defend American interests and values, promote universal human rights and stand up for the international order and work in lockstep with our allies and partners,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to compete vigorously but I‚Äôm not looking for conflict.‚Äù\n\nIn a sign both men arrived to meeting hoping to improve the souring relationship, Biden announced his Secretary of State Antony Blinken would visit China and said officials from each country would begin working together through issues. Formal talks on climate cooperation between the US and China are expected to resume as well as part of a broader set of agreements between Biden and Xi, two US officials tell CNN.\n\nChina previously halted talks ‚Äì viewed by the Biden administration as a key area where the two nations must work together ‚Äì as part of retaliation for the visit to Taiwan by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. The US and Chinese envoys for climate change are talking, but the Biden administration will see what China is prepared to do to make concrete progress, one of the US officials said.\n\nUS Climate Envoy John Kerry‚Äôs spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on whether formal climate talks between the two countries were back on.\n\nThe White House said in a statement after the meeting that Biden raised concerns about human rights and China‚Äôs provocations around Taiwan. But they found at least one area of apparent agreement ‚Äì that nuclear weapons cannot be used in Ukraine, where that nation is trying to fight off a Russian invasion.\n\n‚ÄúPresident Biden and President Xi reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war should never be fought and can never be won,‚Äù a White House readout said, referring to the threat of nuclear weapons use in Ukraine.\n\nBiden did underscore areas of potential cooperation with Xi, including on climate change, in talks that stretched past their expected time at a luxury hotel in Bali.\n\nAnd he sought to convince Xi that a nuclear armed North Korea was not in China‚Äôs interests ‚Äì particularly because further nuclear or long-range missile tests by Pyongyang could prompt Biden to scale up American military presence in the region.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to determine whether or not China has the capacity‚Äù to convince Kim Jong Un to back off his tests, Biden said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident China is not looking for North Korea to engage in further escalatory means.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòGood to see you‚Äô\n\nThe meeting began in the later afternoon with Biden and Xi walking toward each other from opposite sides of a hotel lobby, shaking hands in front of a row of US and Chinese flags. They smiled for cameras and Xi ‚Äì through a translator ‚Äì appeared to say, ‚ÄúGood to see you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAs leaders of our two nations, we share responsibility, in my view, to show that China and the United States can manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming anything ever nearing conflict and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation,‚Äù Biden said as the talks got underway.\n\n‚ÄúThe world expects, I believe, China and the United States to play key roles in addressing global challenges,‚Äù he said.\n\nSpeaking second, Xi seemed to offer what could be interpreted as a pointed message to his counterpart, who has spent more than half-a-century on the world stage.\n\n‚ÄúA statesman should think about and know where to lead his country,‚Äù Xi said through a translator. ‚ÄúHe should also think about and know how to get along with other countries and the wider world.‚Äù\n\nThe two leaders‚Äô talks Monday could have consequences stretching months or even years as the world‚Äôs largest economies veer toward increasingly hostile relations.\n\nThe moments spent together on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit here will amount to only a fraction of the time the two men have been in each other‚Äôs company since 2011.

President Biden has said on many occasions that the US does not support ‚ÄòTaiwan independence‚Äô and has no intention to use Taiwan as a tool to seek advantages in competition with China or to contain China. We hope that the US side will act on this assurance to real effect,‚Äù according to the readout.\n\nXi also defended China‚Äôs human rights records and governance system, saying that China has ‚ÄúChinese-style democracy‚Äù that fits its national conditions, according to the readout. He acknowledged the differences between China and the US, but stressed that they should not become ‚Äúan obstacle to growing China-US relations.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe Chinese nation has the proud tradition of standing up for itself. Suppression and containment will only strengthen the will and boost the morale of the Chinese people,‚Äù the readout said.\n\nA meeting long in the making\n\nThe meeting Monday took place at a remarkably low moment in US-China ties. Biden hoped coming face-to-face again after nearly two years communicating only by phone and video-conference can yield a more strategically valuable result, even if he entered the talks with little expectation they would produce anything concrete.\n\nRelations have deteriorated rapidly amid economic disputes and an increasingly militarized standoff over Taiwan. The tensions have led to a decline in cooperation on areas where the two countries once shared common interests, like combating climate change and containing North Korea‚Äôs nuclear program.\n\nIn a national security strategy document released last month, Biden for the first time identified China as posing ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs most consequential geopolitical challenge,‚Äù and wrote the country was the ‚Äúonly competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective.‚Äù\n\nThere was almost no expectation among American officials that any of those issues could be resolved simply by getting Biden and Xi in the same room. Just arranging the meeting itself required US and Chinese officials to establish lines of communication after Beijing furiously cut off most channels following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs visit to Taiwan over the summer.\n\n‚ÄúEvery matter associated with this meeting, from phone calls to logistics, has been very carefully considered, negotiated, and engaged between the two sides,‚Äù a senior US administration official said.\n\nPlanning for Monday‚Äôs meeting predated Pelosi‚Äôs trip, and discussions continued between US and Chinese officials despite Beijing‚Äôs furor. The process was ‚Äúserious, very sustained and professional in the best traditions of US-China diplomacy,‚Äù the official said.\n\nA second official acknowledged the talks setting up the meeting were not always friendly.\n\n‚ÄúI won‚Äôt say that the conversations weren‚Äôt contentious because obviously there‚Äôs lots of areas where we have differences and challenges,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúThe dozens of hours we have spent talking to our Chinese counterparts has definitely surfaced many of those issues.‚Äù\n\nFor his part, Biden takes meetings like this ‚Äúincredibly seriously‚Äù and reads extensively beforehand. In meetings with advisers, he runs through various scenarios for how the meeting might go.\n\n‚ÄúHe goes through ‚Äòif this happens, then should we handle it this way,‚Äô‚Äù the first official said. ‚ÄúHe understands that this is, in many respects, the most important bilateral relationship. And it‚Äôs his responsibility to manage it well and he takes that very, very seriously.‚Äù\n\nOfficials said in Monday‚Äôs meeting they expected Biden‚Äôs senior-most advisers to accompany him as part of his official delegation. And they said they expected Xi to similarly surround himself with top aides, though the US team entered the meeting expecting to see some new faces on the Chinese side amid an ongoing transition inside Xi‚Äôs inner circle.\n\nBiden and Xi entered the meeting with momentum\n\nFor Xi, the trip to Bali also marked one of his first journeys abroad since the onset of the Covid pandemic, which prompted the Chinese government to impose strict lock downs and draconian restrictions. Xi‚Äôs reemergence on the physical world stage also comes on the heels of China‚Äôs Communist Party Congress in Beijing, during which he secured a norm-breaking third term as its leader.\n\nEven a week ago, most inside the White House were expecting Biden to enter the talks comparatively weakened by Democratic losses in the midterm elections. But better-than-expected results for Democrats left the president feeling as if he was entering his meetings this week with the wind at his back, according to top aides.\n\n‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm coming in stronger, but I don‚Äôt need that,‚Äù Biden said of his own improved political fortunes on Saturday.\n\nUS officials previewing the meeting have stressed the Biden administration is not looking to come out of it with specific ‚Äúdeliverables,‚Äù including a joint statement listing areas of potential cooperation. Rather, the setting is aimed at offering both Biden and Xi a significant opportunity to better share their respective countries‚Äô goals and perspectives.\n\n‚ÄúXi is not an enigma to President Biden,‚Äù a senior administration official told CNN. ‚ÄúHe knows him. And he is mindful of where Xi is trying to take China. He sees China as a competitor, and he feels confident the US can win that competition.‚Äù\n\nChina‚Äôs pandemic-era isolation, US officials say, had made it relatively harder in recent years to get a read on Beijing‚Äôs intentions abroad as Xi declined to travel outside of China ‚Äì but they believe that is all about to change.\n\n‚ÄúWe can expect them to be more assertive on the world stage,‚Äù the senior administration said. But, they added: ‚ÄúWhat that looks like is difficult to know right now.‚Äù\n\nSullivan said this week that finally substituting the pandemic-era video calls with a face-to-face meeting for the first time since Biden took office ‚Äútakes the conversation to a different level strategically and allows the leaders to explore in deeper detail what each of them see in terms of their intentions and priorities.‚Äù", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Mj Lee", "Kevin Liptak", "Mj Lee"], "publish_date": "2022/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/asia/china-xi-russia-putin-video-meeting-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Putin and Xi meet against backdrop of growing crises for both leaders", "text": "Hong Kong CNN ‚Äî\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin told his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in a virtual meeting Friday that their partnership was more important than ever in the face of ‚Äúunprecedented pressure‚Äù from the West, as Moscow‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine leaves it increasingly isolated on the global stage.\n\nWhile Putin‚Äôs war in Ukraine rages on and Xi grapples with an unprecedented Covid outbreak, a call between the two leaders on Friday underlined their mutual reliance amid mounting crises at home.\n\nIn opening remarks broadcast on Russian state TV, Putin said that the stabilizing force of the Russia-China relationship was becoming even more critical against the backdrop of growing geopolitical tensions.\n\nThe Russian leader described relations between the two nations as ‚Äúthe best in history,‚Äù saying they could ‚Äúwithstand all tests,‚Äù and invited Xi to visit Moscow in the spring of 2023.\n\n‚ÄúWe share the same views on the causes, course and logic of the ongoing transformation of the global geopolitical landscape,‚Äù Putin said.\n\n‚ÄúIn the face of unprecedented pressure and provocations from the West, we defend our principled positions and defend not only our own interests, but also all those who stand for a truly democratic system and the right of countries to freely determine their own destiny.‚Äù\n\nPutin added that the two countries would strengthen cooperation between their armed forces, and pointed to growth in trade despite ‚Äúunfavorable market conditions,‚Äù alluding to the waves of economic sanctions Russia has faced since invading Ukraine.\n\nXi echoed Putin‚Äôs message of unity, saying that the two countries should ‚Äústrengthen strategic coordination‚Äù and ‚Äúinject more stability into the world,‚Äù according to Chinese state media Xinhua.\n\nChina is ‚Äúready to work‚Äù with Russia to ‚Äústand against hegemonism and power politics‚Äù to oppose unilateralism, protectionism and ‚Äúbullying,‚Äù as well as to safeguard sovereignty, security, international equity and justice, Xi said, Chinese state media reported.\n\nXi also said China is ready to resume normal cross-border travel with Russia and other countries ‚Äúin an orderly manner,‚Äù Xinhua reported.\n\nMoscow and Beijing have drawn closer in recent years, with Xi and Putin declaring the two countries had a ‚Äúno limits‚Äù partnership weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Analysts on Friday were watching for any sign that the Chinese leader‚Äôs support for his Russian counterpart had softened.\n\nChina has repeatedly refused to condemn the aggression, instead repeatedly laying blame for the conflict on NATO and the United States ‚Äì and remaining one of Russia‚Äôs key remaining supporters as outrage over the invasion builds, leaving Russia increasingly on its own.\n\nBut more than 10 months into the grinding war, the world looks much different ‚Äì and the dynamic between both partners has shifted accordingly, experts say.\n\nInstead of an anticipated swift victory, Putin‚Äôs invasion has faltered with numerous setbacks on the battlefield, including a lack of basic equipment. Many Russians face economic hardship in a bitter winter.\n\nOn Thursday, Russia launched what Ukrainian officials described as one of the biggest missile barrages since the war began in February, with explosions rattling villages and cities across Ukraine, damaging civilian infrastructure and killing at least three people.\n\nUkrainian officials had been cautioning for days that Russia was preparing to launch an all-out assault on the power grid to close out 2022, plummeting the country into darkness as Ukrainians attempt to ring in the New Year holidays.\n\n‚ÄúChina is eager for (the war) to end,‚Äù said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center.\n\n‚ÄúXi will try to emphasize the importance of peace to Putin,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúAs Russia is getting impatient with the lack of progress on the battlefield, the timing is ripening for peace talk in China‚Äôs eyes.‚Äù\n\nChina, too, is growing more isolated in its stance toward Russia, said Alfred Wu, associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.\n\nWu pointed to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as an example of hardening attitudes to Russia‚Äôs war.\n\nThough India has not condemned Moscow‚Äôs invasion outright, Modi told Putin in September that now was not the time for war and urged him to move toward peace. That shift is another reason Xi could be eager to see a swift resolution, Wu said.\n\nXi had already shown hints of impatience when he last met with Putin in September at a regional summit in Uzbekistan. At the time, Putin conceded Beijing had ‚Äúquestions and concerns‚Äù over the invasion, in what appeared to be a veiled admission of their diverging views.\n\nBut, experts say, China‚Äôs domestic situation has also changed significantly in the months since, which could necessitate a different approach to Putin this time around.\n\nThe country is currently fighting its worst-ever Covid outbreak after finally abandoning its stringent zero-Covid policy, with restrictions loosened and borders partially reopened. The U-turn came after an unprecedented wave of protests across the country in opposition to zero-Covid ‚Äì in some cases expanding to include broader grievances against Xi and the ruling Communist Party.\n\nAt the center of this crisis is Xi ‚Äì who entered a norm-breaking third term in October, with a tight grip on power and a close circle of loyalists.\n\n‚ÄúNow with domestic issues out of the way, Xi is in a better position to work on Russia,‚Äù said Stimson Center‚Äôs Sun, referring to his consolidation of power in October.\n\nShe added that despite the unpopularity of the war, China and Russia ‚Äúare aligned because of geopolitics.‚Äù Both countries face tensions with the West, and the two leaders have often touted a shared vision for a new world order.\n\n‚ÄúThe two leaders will emphasize their partnership, cooperation and strong ties. They will want to send the message that all those transcend the war in Ukraine,‚Äù said Sun. ‚Äú(The war) has been a nuisance for China this past year and has affected China‚Äôs interest in Europe. But the damage is not significant enough that China will abandon Russia.‚Äù\n\nWu, too, acknowledged that the relationship was ‚Äúfundamental for both countries,‚Äù pointing to China‚Äôs ability to profit from the Ukraine war due to its access to Russian oil.\n\nHowever, he added, China‚Äôs protests, Covid outbreak and consequent economic toll have placed Xi in a more vulnerable position that could mean less material and outspoken support for Russia. Now, more than ever, China is not in a position to risk sanctions.\n\n‚ÄúThe policy tools Xi Jinping can use to support Russia is quite limited now, it‚Äôs quite constrained,‚Äù said Wu. ‚ÄúPolitically, domestic support for Xi has declined dramatically. His third term does not actually start with a rosy picture.‚Äù", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung Darya Tarasova Alex Stambaugh", "Jessie Yeung", "Darya Tarasova", "Alex Stambaugh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/economy/china-xi-saudi-arabia-visit-oil-trade-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "When China and Saudi Arabia meet, nothing matters more than oil ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN ‚Äî\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping is visiting Saudi Arabia this week for the first time in nearly seven years, during which he signed a comprehensive strategic partnership with the world‚Äôs largest oil exporter and met leaders from across the Middle East.\n\nThe visit is a sign that China and the Gulf region are deepening their economic relations at a time when US-Saudi ties have crumbled over OPEC‚Äôs decision to slash crude oil supply. As Xi wrote in an article published in Saudi media, the trip was intended to strengthen China‚Äôs relations with the Arab world.\n\nThe partnership agreement signed by the two sides includes a number of deals and memoranda of understanding, such as on hydrogen energy and enhancing coordination between the kingdom‚Äôs Vision 2030 and China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative, according to the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA).

And the West has further scrambled the oil markets by slapping an embargo and price cap on the world‚Äôs second biggest exporter of crude.\n\nEnergy security has also increasingly become a key priority for China, which is facing significant challenges of its own.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping is welcomed by Emir of Riyadh Faisal bin Bende bin Abdulaziz and Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan at King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on December 7, 2022. Saudi Arabian Foreign Ministry/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nEnergy is core\n\nLast year, bilateral trade between Saudi Arabia and China hit $87.3 billion, up 30% from 2020, according to Chinese customs figures.\n\nMuch of the trade was focused on oil. China‚Äôs crude imports from Saudi Arabia stood at $43.9 billion in 2021, accounting for 77% of its total goods imports from the kingdom. That amount also makes up more than a quarter of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs total crude exports.\n\n‚ÄúStability of energy supplies, in terms of both prices and quantities, is a key priority for Xi Jinping as the Chinese economy remains heavily reliant on oil and natural gas imports,‚Äù said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University.\n\nThe world‚Äôs second largest economy is heavily reliant on foreign oil and gas. 72% of its oil consumption was imported last year, according to official figures. 44% of natural gas demand was also from overseas.\n\nAt the 20th Party Congress in October, Xi stressed that ensuring energy security was a key priority. The comments came after a spate of severe power shortages and soaring global energy prices following Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAs the West shunned Russian crude in the months that followed the invasion, China took advantage of Moscow‚Äôs desperate search for new buyers. Between May and July, Russia was China‚Äôs No. 1 oil supplier, until Saudi Arabia regained the top spot in August.\n\n‚ÄúDiversity is a key ingredient for China‚Äôs long-term energy security because it cannot afford to put all of its eggs in one basket and turn itself into a captive of another power‚Äôs energy and geostrategic interests,‚Äù said Ahmed Aboudouh, a nonresident fellow with the Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council, a research institute based in DC.\n\n‚ÄúAlthough Russia is a source of cheaper supply chains, nobody can guarantee, with utmost certainty, that the China and Russia relationship will continue to shore up 50 years from now,‚Äù Aboudouh said.\n\nThe Saudi Press Agency cited Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman as saying Wednesday that the kingdom would remain China‚Äôs ‚Äúcredible and reliable partner in this field.‚Äù\n\nSaudi Arabia also has strong motivations to deepen energy ties with China, according to Gal Luft, co-director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security.\n\n‚ÄúThe Saudis are concerned about losing market share in China in the face of a tsunami of heavily discounted Russian and Iranian crude,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTheir goal is to ensure China remains a loyal customer even when the competitors offer [a] cheaper product.‚Äù\n\nOil prices have fallen back to where they were before the Ukraine war on fears of a sharp global economic slowdown. The extent to which the Chinese economy can pick up pace next year will have a huge bearing on how bad that slump will be.\n\nShifting to yuan?\n\nBeyond security of supply, Saudi Arabia could offer Beijing another prize with bigger geopolitical ramifications.\n\nRiyadh has been in talks with Beijing to price some of its oil sales to China in the Chinese currency, the yuan, rather than the US dollar, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Such a deal could be a boost to Beijing‚Äôs ambitions to expand the Chinese currency‚Äôs global influence.\n\nIt would also hurt the long-standing agreement between Saudi Arabia and the United States that requires Saudi Arabia to sell its oil only for US dollars and to hold its reserves partly in US Treasuries, all in return for US security guarantees. The ‚Äúpetrodollar system‚Äù has helped preserve the dollar‚Äôs status as the top global reserve currency and payment medium for oil and other commodities.\n\nAlthough Beijing and Riyadh never confirmed the reported talks, analysts said it was logical that the two sides would be exploring the possibility.\n\n‚ÄúIn the near future, Saudi Arabia could sell some of its oil and receive revenues in Chinese yuan, which makes economic sense as China is the kingdom‚Äôs top trading partner,‚Äù said Naser Al Tamimi, senior associate research fellow at ISPI, an Italian think tank on international affairs.\n\nSome believe it‚Äôs already happening, but that neither China nor the Saudis want to highlight it publicly.\n\n‚ÄúThey know too well how sensitive this issue [is] for the United States,‚Äù said Luft. ‚ÄúBoth parties are overexposed to the US currency and there is no reason for them to continue to conduct their bilateral trade in a third party‚Äôs currency, especially when this third party is no longer a friend of either.‚Äù\n\nXi‚Äôs visit could mark another step ‚Äúin the erosion of the dollar‚Äôs status‚Äù as reserve currency, he added.\n\nLimits of the ties\n\nNonetheless, there are limits to the growing ties between Riyadh and Beijing.\n\n‚ÄúThe Biden administration‚Äôs approach to the Middle East has concerned the Saudis, and they see a growing relationship with China as a hedge against potential US abandonment and a tool for leverage in negotiations with the United States,‚Äù said Jon B. Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington DC-based think tank.\n\nThe Biden administration has reoriented its policy priorities with a focus on countering China. At the same time, it has indicated its intention to downsize its own presence in the Middle East, sparking worries among allies there that the United States may not be as committed to the region as it used to be.\n\n‚ÄúAll that being said, Chinese-Saudi ties pale in both depth and complexity to Saudi-US ties,‚Äù Alterman said. ‚ÄúThe Chinese remain a novelty to most Saudis, and they are additive. The United States is foundational to how Saudis see the world, and how they have seen it for 75 years.‚Äù\n\nDespite the possibility of shifting to yuan transactions, it‚Äôs too early to say Saudi Arabia would ditch the dollar in pricing its oil sales, analysts said.\n\nEurasia Group‚Äôs Kamal believes it‚Äôs ‚Äúhighly unlikely‚Äù that Saudi Arabia would take such a step, unless there is an implosion on the US-Saudi relationship.\n\n‚ÄúIn essence there could be discussion on pricing of barrels to China in yuan, but this would be limited in size and probably only correspond to bilateral trade volumes,‚Äù he said.\n\nPrasad from Cornell University said countries like China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia are all eager to reduce their dependence on the dollar for oil contracts and other cross-border transactions.\n\n‚ÄúHowever, in the absence of serious alternatives and with few international investors willing to place their trust in these countries‚Äô financial markets and their governments, the dollar‚Äôs dominant role in global finance is hardly under serious threat,‚Äù he said.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/20/europe/biden-putin-macron-ukraine/index.html", "title": "White House says Biden has agreed to meet with Putin 'in principle ...", "text": "Washington, Kyiv and Moscow CNN ‚Äî\n\nPresident Joe Biden has agreed ‚Äúin principle‚Äù to French-brokered summit talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin as long as Russia does not further invade Ukraine, the White House said late Sunday.\n\nThe meeting, according to press secretary Jen Psaki, would occur after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov meet on February 24.\n\nStill, in a statement, Psaki appeared to downplay the prospects of a meeting actually materializing given what US officials have said the high likelihood is Putin could launch an invasion soon.

It will be their decision.‚Äù\n\nDuring the same call, Peskov announced that Putin would hold a large, previously unscheduled sitting of the Russian Security Council on Monday. The spokesperson said the meeting was ‚Äúnot regular‚Äù and refused to elaborate further on its agenda.\n\nMacron has emerged as a diplomatic go-between of sorts as the crisis in Europe unfolds. He met Putin earlier this month in Moscow, and spoke to the Russian leader by phone twice on Sunday. French officials have said his efforts at diplomacy reflect a desire to explore every available pathway that avoids conflict.\n\nThe French presidency‚Äôs statement said the summit would be followed by a subsequent gathering of ‚Äúrelevant stakeholders to discuss security and strategic stability in Europe.‚Äù Macron ‚Äúwill work with all stakeholders to prepare the content of these discussions.‚Äù\n\nIt did not specify who those stakeholders were.\n\nUS officials have consistently said Biden is willing to engage with Putin, even as he prepares withering economic sanctions should another Russian invasion of Ukraine transpire.\n\n‚ÄúPresident Biden is prepared to engage President Putin at any time, in any format, if that can help prevent a war,‚Äù Blinken said Sunday on CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúState of the Union.‚Äù\n\nBiden has placed a premium on meeting leaders face-to-face and met Putin in June during a summit in Geneva. The two last spoke by phone last Saturday.\n\nAmerican officials have said deciphering Putin‚Äôs intentions is difficult as he masses troops along Ukraine‚Äôs borders. They say he has kept his plans veiled from even his most senior advisers.\n\nOn Sunday, a White House official said Blinken and Lavrov would discuss a possible summit between Biden and Putin when they meet later this week in Europe but added a note of caution about those talks.\n\n‚ÄúBlinken and Lavrov will discuss further if the invasion hasn‚Äôt started by then ‚Äì in which case it‚Äôs all off,‚Äù the official said.\n\nExercises in Belarus continue\n\nMacron‚Äôs effort to advance a potential diplomatic breakthrough comes as Belarusian officials announced Sunday that joint Russian military exercises in Belarus that were slated to end over the weekend would continue, implying that Russian forces may extend their stay.\n\nNew satellite images meanwhile showed intensified activity among Russian units close to Ukraine‚Äôs north-eastern border and the Ukrainian Defense ministry said it recorded dozens of ceasefire violations on Sunday.\n\nDefense minister Oleksii Reznikov said Monday that Ukraine was not seeing any withdrawal of Russian forces from positions close to the border.\n\n‚ÄúWe are observing the Russian units, which number today 127,000 people on the ground component, and with the naval and aviation component 147,000 people,‚Äù Reznikov said.\n\nThe Ukrainian Joint Forces Command on Sunday claimed Russian-backed separatists launched ‚Äúheavy armament fire‚Äù against their own territory in an effort to ‚Äúfalsely accuse the armed forces of Ukraine and further escalate the situation.‚Äù\n\nRussia and Ukraine continued exchanging accusations on Monday. Russia‚Äôs Federal Security Service (FSB) said in a statement that a shell fired from Ukrainian territory had destroyed a border guard post in Russia‚Äôs southern Rostov region.\n\nUkrainian border authorities responded by describing the FSB statement as ‚Äúdeliberate provocation,‚Äù while Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine‚Äôs National Security Council, said Ukraine had ‚Äúnothing to do with these attacks.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOur military can only fire back if there is a threat to the lives of our military. We are not shelling,‚Äù Danilov added Monday.\n\nOn Sunday, Biden held a National Security Council meeting with his top advisers. Also on Sunday, two US officials and another source familiar with US intelligence told CNN a US intelligence assessment indicated orders had been sent to Russian commanders to proceed with an attack on Ukraine. The intelligence was learned last week and informed comments by Biden and Blinken, according to another US official.\n\nHowever, pushing back on the reports, Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov on Sunday told CBS ‚ÄúFace the Nation‚Äù that, ‚Äúthere is no invasion and there is no such plan.‚Äù", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Sam Fossum Arlette Saenz Tim Lister Paul Murphy Ivana Kottasov√° Anna Chernova", "Kevin Liptak", "Sam Fossum", "Arlette Saenz", "Tim Lister", "Paul Murphy", "Ivana Kottasov√°", "Anna Chernova"], "publish_date": "2022/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/middleeast/iran-joins-shanghai-coop-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Iran inches one step closer to Russia and China as nuclear talks ...", "text": "Editor‚Äôs Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN‚Äôs Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region‚Äôs biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi CNN ‚Äî\n\nIran is set to formalize its relationship with the Global East, inching one step closer to joining the Sino-Russian axis as its nuclear talks with global powers falter.\n\nThe Islamic Republic on Wednesday signed a memorandum of obligations that will grant it full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a climactic moment after a fifteen-year wait since it first applied to join the Asian body, which includes Russia and China.\n\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi said on Friday that expanding the Asian organization could help defy Washington‚Äôs unilateralism, adding that thwarting ‚Äúdraconian‚Äù US sanctions required new solutions.\n\nHailed by Tehran as a successful entry into ‚Äúa new stage of economic cooperation,‚Äù the soon-to-be accession comes as hopes to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement are diminishing, and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine has left the world in a state of polarization not seen since the Cold War.\n\nFormed in 2001, the Asian bloc accounts for almost a third of the world‚Äôs economy. It includes ex-Soviet states Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and more recently India and Pakistan. Iran had been an observer state since 2005.\n\nWhile Iran‚Äôs bid for full membership was first approved last year, Wednesday‚Äôs decision comes at an awkward moment as both Iran and Western leaders had hoped that by now there would be an agreement on reviving the nuclear deal, says Trita Parsi, vice-president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC.\n\n‚ÄúIran has managed to begin to break out of its isolation,‚Äù Parsi told CNN, noting that as the world turns multipolar, the West is now losing a key card it has long used to pressure Iran ‚Äì namely the United States‚Äô role as ‚Äúa gatekeeper into the world economy.‚Äù\n\nWestern sanctions had been a major pressure point drawing Tehran to the negotiation table, some of which were meant to be lifted if the nuclear deal had been revived. Talks have, however, stalled once more and analysts say that both Iran and the West are preparing for a no-deal scenario.\n\nWhile little material relief is likely to come out of the SCO membership, Iran is likely to use the optics of Wednesday‚Äôs signing to show the world that it is not alone, said Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute.\n\n‚ÄúThe symbolic aspect is undeniable,‚Äù he said, noting that in practice, however, it will mean very little in the short term for Iran.\n\nOn the sidelines of the summit, which took place on Thursday and Friday in the Uzbek city of Samarkand, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi was pictured meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n‚ÄúIn the short term, [Ebrahim] Raisi will get another smile from Vladimir Putin and some handshakes,‚Äù said Vatanka. ‚ÄúBut it means nothing in economic terms.‚Äù\n\nThe alliance, therefore, seems mostly political, especially as Russia and China move away from the West and get closer to the Middle East.\n\n‚ÄúIran interprets its membership in the framework of its regional security agenda of curtailing US regional influence and encroachments,‚Äù said Fardin Eftekhari, an expert on Iranian national security and foreign policymaking, noting that the SCO shouldn‚Äôt be compared to Western security blocs like NATO, primarily ‚Äúdue to its membership diversity and the lack of sustaining agenda.‚Äù\n\nTehran is therefore ‚Äútesting a new pattern of multilateral security relationships within the SCO,‚Äù he added.\n\nSome attribute Iran‚Äôs increasing alignment with Russia and China to the US‚Äô failure to effectively leverage its influence while it still could.\n\nThe majority of UN Security Council states opposed using sanctions as a strategy to discipline Iran in 2020. Many states feared that it would only push Tehran into the arms of Russia and China, said Parsi.\n\nBut as former US President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and imposed a ‚Äúmaximum pressure‚Äù campaign on Iran, the Persian Gulf state started looking for new alliances.\n\nIn June, Iran also applied to join a group of emerging economies known as BRICS, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. It has been selling its crude to China in an effort to cling to its last economic lifeline as Western countries refuse to buy its oil.\n\nIran has also been selling what US officials believe are weapons-capable drones to Russia at a time when Moscow is waging the largest European war since 1945.\n\nIran‚Äôs relations with Russia and China are not, however, without complication. Iran shares a bitter history with Russia and has over the last 150 years looked westward for economic partners, according to Parsi.\n\nNot only are Russia and Iran competitors within the oil market, but they also have little in common apart from their shared anti-Americanism, said Vatanka.\n\nIran‚Äôs famous 1979 revolution slogan, ‚ÄúNeither East, Nor West,‚Äù points to the degree to which both the Iranian people and the ruling elite wanted to avoid a scenario where dependence on either Russia or the US was necessary.\n\nYet Western attempts to isolate Iran have pushed it in a direction that analysts say might prove detrimental for Tehran in the long run, even if there is slight short-term relief to its crippled economy.\n\n‚ÄúHad it not been for 30 or 40 years of sanctions on Iran, I think we would have seen a very different orientation of Iran,‚Äù said Parsi, adding that while it wouldn‚Äôt have necessarily been completely allied to the West, Iran‚Äôs foreign policy would have at least been a balanced one where there is less dependency on the East.\n\n‚ÄúRussia and China alone cannot compensate for what Iran could have had if it had a slightly more mainstream foreign policy,‚Äù said Vatanka.\n\nThe digest\n\nUAE foreign minister in Tel Aviv for two-year Abraham Accords anniversary\n\nThe United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan arrived in Israel‚Äôs Tel Aviv on Wednesday to mark two years since the signing of the Abraham Accords, the Emirati state news agency WAM said.\n\nBackground: Sheikh Abdullah was set to meet Israel‚Äôs Prime Minister Yair Lapid at his residence in Jerusalem on Thursday, Israel‚Äôs government said. The visit will span several days to commemorate the normalization agreement, signed two years ago after the UAE formally ended its near-half-century boycott of Israel . This is the Emirati top diplomat‚Äôs second official visit to Israel. His first was to attend a meeting held in the southern Israeli city of Sde Boker in the Negev desert in March.\n\nWhy it matters: The agreement opened doors to bilateral economic activity and security cooperation. Thousands of Israeli tourists now visit Dubai and other Emirati cities, while trade between both countries has steadily risen. The countries continue to cooperate on security and at a landmark meeting hosted by Israel in March, the UAE joined other Arab countries to demonstrate their newly formed close partnership.\n\nSaudi crown prince to travel to London for condolences but won‚Äôt attend funeral\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) will travel to London on Sunday to pay his respects to King Charles III and express his condolences on the death of Queen Elizabeth II, but the Saudi royal will not attend the funeral of the late monarch on Monday, a source close to the Saudi royal family told CNN.\n\nBackground: The crown prince will return to Saudi Arabia right after he offers his condolences, the source added. Another senior member of the Saudi royal family may attend the funeral, according to the source.\n\nWhy it matters: MBS had avoided traveling to Western states since the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 at the hands of Saudi agents. In July, he visited Greece and France, his first European Union trip since the murder. The crown prince last visited the UK in March 2018.\n\nFive more banks in Lebanon held up by customers demanding access to savings\n\nCustomers held up at least five banks around Lebanon on Friday in an attempt to retrieve frozen savings just two days after the last such hostage situation, a Lebanese army official told CNN. In one incident, an armed man entered a bank and poured gasoline on the floor, threatening to burn the branch down if he wasn‚Äôt given access to his funds, state news agency NNA reported. He was able to retrieve around $19,000 and handed it to someone waiting outside the bank before handing himself to authorities.\n\nBackground: Since October 2019, Lebanon has implemented severe restrictions on cash withdrawals as the country faces economic collapse . On Wednesday, two hostage situations at different banks took place in Beirut. In one incident, a woman managed to take a total of $20,000 from her account after taking hostages at a bank with a toy gun\n\nWhy it matters: Hostage takings are becoming more common in heavily armed Lebanon as citizens whose savings are frozen by banks say they are left with no option to retrieve their funds. In some cases, the hostage takers have said they have done so to help pay for their loved ones‚Äô medical treatment.\n\nWhat to watch\n\nUnder the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, Britian‚Äôs relationship with the Middle East significantly changed as colonial structures collapsed and strategic partnerships formed, some of which are sustained to this day.\n\nWatch the full report with CNN‚Äôs Becky Anderson here:\n\nWhen Queen Elizabeth II became head of state, Britain was the dominant power in the Middle East.

Manhattan District Attorney's Office\n\nA coin dating back to a Jewish rebellion against Roman rule almost 2,000 years ago has been returned by the US to Israel following a joint smuggling investigation.\n\nMinted in AD 69, the ‚Äúexceedingly rare‚Äù quarter shekel is estimated to be worth over $1 million, according to the Manhattan District Attorney‚Äôs office, which hosted a repatriation ceremony in New York on Monday.\n\nThe move comes 20 years after Israeli authorities first learned, via informants, that the silver coin had been discovered by antiquities looters in the Ella Valley, south of Jerusalem. It is believed to be one of a cache of coins found by thieves in the area, which is home to numerous important archeological sites.\n\nInvestigators say the item entered the black market before being smuggled to the UK through Jordan. It was then exported to the US using false paperwork. In 2017, Homeland Security officers seized the coin in Denver, Colorado, where it was due to be offered at auction.\n\nThe kingdom of Judaea fell under Roman control in AD 6, though resistance to imperial rule led to a series of revolts known as the Jewish-Roman Wars. The coin dates to the fourth year of the First Jewish Revolt, also known as the Great Jewish Revolt, which began in AD 66.\n\nBy Oscar Holland\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/23/asia/the-quad-tokyo-summit-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "What is the Quad? The partnership between the US, Japan ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN ‚Äî\n\nUS President Joe Biden is scheduled to meet the leaders of India, Australia and Japan in Tokyo on Tuesday for a summit of the ‚ÄúQuad‚Äù nations.\n\nThe meeting comes at the end of Biden‚Äôs first trip to Asia since becoming President, a five-day visit he began in South Korea.\n\nThe Quad, or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, is an informal group focused on security that dates back to the early 2000s. It has become more active in recent years as part of efforts to counter China‚Äôs reach and territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThe war in Ukraine, North Korea‚Äôs weapons program, Taiwan, and a controversial new security deal between China and the Solomon Islands in the Pacific are among the issues likely to be discussed at the summit.\n\nHere‚Äôs what you need to know about the Quad.\n\nHow did it form?\n\nThe partnership has its roots in the response to the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, when the four countries set up a ‚Äúregional core group‚Äù to help relief efforts. But the Quad in its current form was created in 2007 and held its first meeting in May that year.\n\nIn a speech several months after that first meeting, Japan‚Äôs then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe described his vision of a ‚Äúbroader Asia ‚Ä¶ an immense network spanning the entirety of the Pacific Ocean, incorporating the United States of America and Australia.‚Äù\n\nThe countries shared ‚Äúfundamental values‚Äù such as freedom and democracy, and common strategic interests, he said.\n\nThe initiative fell apart in 2008 under intense pressure from China and the threat of economic retaliation, said Cleo Paskal, a non-resident senior fellow for the Indo-Pacific at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nBut it was revived in 2017 amid renewed concerns about China‚Äôs rapid rise as a global superpower and Beijing‚Äôs increasingly aggressive foreign policy.\n\nSince then, the group has grown more active, with the four heads of state holding a symbolic virtual meeting in March 2021, before then meeting in person for the first time in September that year.\n\nAt the time, a senior US official emphasized the Quad was ‚Äúan unofficial gathering,‚Äù but called it ‚Äúa key and critical format,‚Äù adding ‚Äúwe are deepening coordination on a daily basis.‚Äù\n\nA meeting of the Quad leaders at a summit at the White House on September 24, 2021. Kyodo News/Getty Images\n\nWhat does the Quad do?\n\nThough sometimes dubbed by critics as an ‚ÄúAsian NATO,‚Äù the Quad is not a formal military alliance ‚Äì rather, it‚Äôs an informal strategic forum, featuring semi-regular summits, information exchanges and military drills.\n\nIt does not have the same kind of military agreements seen in NATO, like the concept of collective defense, where an attack on one member is viewed as an attack on all.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs deliberately more amorphous than that, so that it can withstand changes in political decision-making in each of the democracies, and respond in a more diffuse but effective way around things like vaccines or economics,‚Äù Paskal said.\n\nQuad members cooperate across fields including Covid-19 and natural disasters, climate change and sustainability.\n\nBut security and the goal of a ‚Äúfree and open Indo-Pacific‚Äù are key focuses, with the four nations frequently highlighting threats such as terrorism, disinformation and territorial disputes.\n\nAircraft carriers and warships participate in the Malabar naval exercises, attended by the US, Australia, India and Japan, in the Northern Arabian Sea on November 17, 2020. Indian Navy/AP\n\nMilitary cooperation has increased in recent years, with Australia joining the other three in the 2020 Malabar naval exercises ‚Äì the first time all four members had participated in the drills since 2007.\n\nLast September, the US, the United Kingdom and Australia signed a security deal known as AUKUS that will eventually bring nuclear-powered submarines to the region ‚Äì a move that set off a diplomatic firestorm with France and angered China.\n\nAnd this January, Japan and Australia signed a treaty to strengthen defense and security cooperation, with Australia saying the agreement included ‚Äúan expanding agenda for the Quad.‚Äù\n\nHow does China play into this?\n\nThe Quad has increasingly been seen as a counterweight to China‚Äôs growing reach in the region, with all four nations experiencing turbulent relations with Beijing over the past few years.\n\nThe India-China relationship has come under growing strain since May 2020 when troops from both sides were involved in a deadly clash along their disputed Himalayan border.\n\nAustralia and China have been involved in a series of trade spats since Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19, while Japan and China remain at odds over disputed islands in the East China Sea.\n\nThe US-China relationship has also steadily deteriorated, exacerbated by a trade war, pandemic finger-pointing and military saber-rattling.\n\nThe strategic location of each of the Quad nations ‚Äì at different corners of the Indo-Pacific and with China in between them ‚Äì has rattled Beijing, which fears the potential for military encirclement. It has condemned the bloc as an anti-China ‚Äúclique‚Äù that is emblematic of a ‚Äúpoisonous‚Äù Cold War mentality.\n\nA Chinese airstrip on a man-made island in the South China Sea, seen on March 20. Aaron Favila/AP\n\nExacerbating these tensions, China has reiterated its territorial claims and taken a harder line in response to perceived challenges. In recent years, China has built up its military positions in the South China Sea, despite a UN tribunal dismissing its territorial claims there. It has also ramped up threats against Taiwan ‚Äì a self-governing island the Chinese Communist Party sees as part of its territory despite never having ruled it ‚Äì and has sent fighter jets into its air defense identification zone.\n\n‚ÄúChina‚Äôs rise is now the global phenomenon that not (only) involves the neighboring nations, but also the safety of maritime security in the South China Sea, Malacca Straits, all the way to the Indian Ocean,‚Äù said Ken Jimbo, a professor in the faculty of policy management at Japan‚Äôs Keio University.\n\nIn April, China announced a security pact with the Solomon Islands, sparking protests from Australia, New Zealand and the US. Many were concerned it would allow China to build a military base in the tiny Pacific nation, though the islands‚Äô leader has said he has no intention of this happening.\n\nStill, some onlookers say the agreement makes Australia less safe and threatens to further destabilize the Solomon Islands, where the government‚Äôs close relationship with Beijing has already sparked protests.\n\n‚ÄúWhat countries are realizing more and more is that the economic investment from China is designed to lead to a weakening of political will within those countries ‚Ä¶ which brings it more strongly into the Chinese orbit,‚Äù said Paskal, from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nWhat are the other major issues?\n\nOther issues that may come up at the summit include the security of Taiwan.\n\nA recent surge of Chinese air incursions has raised fears for the future of the democratic island. Top US intelligence officials told Congress this month that China might be attempting to build a military capable of taking over Taiwan, and the island faces an ‚Äúacute‚Äù threat between now and 2030.\n\nQuad members have voiced support for Taiwan, which the US supplies with arms for self defense. On Monday, during a press conference in Japan, US President Joe Biden said the US would intervene militarily if China attempts to take Taiwan by force, a warning that appeared to deviate from the deliberate ambiguity traditionally held by Washington.\n\nThe White House quickly downplayed the comments, saying they don‚Äôt reflect a change in US policy.\n\nBut many analysts have drawn parallels between Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and Taiwan‚Äôs situation ‚Äì concerns echoed by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in May, when he said peace in the Taiwan Strait was ‚Äúcritical‚Äù and countries must ‚Äúnever tolerate‚Äù forceful attempts to change the status quo in East Asia.\n\n‚ÄúIf Taiwan falls to China, that breaks the first island chain and compromises Japanese security,‚Äù Paskal said. ‚ÄúThe fall of Taiwan is a deep security threat to all four Quad partners.‚Äù\n\nNorth Korea and its weapons program will also likely be on the table, said Jimbo, the Keio University professor. The country has recently stepped up its missile testing, in defiance of international law and to the alarm of Japan and the US. It has launched 15 missile tests this year so far, compared to four tests in 2020 and eight in 2021.\n\nThe war in Ukraine will be another focus, with the summit taking place exactly three months after Russia launched its invasion. Australia, Japan and the US have all taken hard stances in condemning the invasion and imposing sanctions on Moscow ‚Äì leaving India the odd one out.\n\nIndia has long enjoyed friendly relations and a defense relationship with Moscow; most estimates suggest more than 50% of India‚Äôs military equipment comes from Russia. These supplies are vital, given India‚Äôs border tensions with both China and Pakistan.\n\nThough India‚Äôs position has caused ‚Äúa significant amount of frustration‚Äù among the other three bloc members, Jimbo said ‚Äúit also reminds us that we do not really have the luxury to lose India from the Quad ‚Äì so obviously, we are going to pursue what we can agree (on) at this point together with India.‚Äù", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}]}

However, the protection is not as high as that provided by the original vaccine against earlier coronavirus variants, the researchers say.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, called the new data ‚Äúreally quite good.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPlease, for your own safety, for that of your family, get your updated Covid-19 shot as soon as you‚Äôre eligible to protect yourself, your family and your community,‚Äù Fauci said at a White House briefing Tuesday.\n\nUptake of the bivalent boosters, which protect against the BA.4/5 subvariants as well as the original virus strain, has been remarkably slow. Only 11% of eligible Americans have gotten them since they became available in early September.\n\nThe new study found that the updated boosters work about like the original boosters. They protect against symptomatic infection in the range of 40% to 60%, meaning that even when vaccine protection is its most potent, about a month after getting the shot, people may still be vulnerable to breakthrough infections.\n\nThat‚Äôs in about the same range as typical efficacy for flu vaccines. Over the past 10 years, CDC data shows, the effectiveness of the seasonal flu vaccines has ranged from a low of 19% to a high of around 52% against needing to see a doctor because of the flu. The effectiveness varies depending on how similar the strains in the vaccine are to the strains that end up making people sick.\n\nThe authors of the new study say people should realize that the Covid-19 vaccines are no longer more than 90% protective against symptomatic infections, as they were when they were first introduced in 2020.\n\n‚ÄúUnfortunately, the 90% to 100% protection was what we saw during like pre-Delta time. And so with Delta, we saw it drop into the 70% range, and then for Omicron, we saw it drop even lower, to the 50% range. And so I think what we‚Äôre seeing here is that the bivalent vaccine really brings you back to that sort of effectiveness that we would have seen immediately after past boosters, which is great. That‚Äôs where we want it to get,‚Äù said Dr. Ruth Link-Gelles, an epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nVaccines are only one tool to stay well\n\n‚ÄúThis protection is not 100%, but it is something,‚Äù Link-Gelles said. ‚ÄúEspecially going into the holidays where you‚Äôre likely to be traveling, spending time with elderly relatives, with vulnerable people. I think having some protection from infection and therefore some protection from infecting your loved one is better than having no protection at all.‚Äù\n\nLink-Gelles says it also means that people should continue to adopt a layered approach to protection, utilizing rapid tests, good-quality masks and ventilation as a comprehensive approach, rather than relying on vaccines alone.\n\n‚ÄúThis should be sort of one of the things in your toolbox for protecting yourself and your family,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPersonally, we‚Äôre my family is all vaccinated up to date, but I think if we go to the airport tomorrow, we‚Äôll be wearing our N95 [masks] because we‚Äôre seeing elderly relatives this weekend. And while we of course trust the vaccines, and I‚Äôm not super worried about a mild infection in myself or my healthy husband, we certainly would not want to infect his grandmother.‚Äù\n\nLink-Gelles added that she expects that vaccine protection against severe outcomes from Covid-19, like hospitalization and death, will be higher, but that data isn‚Äôt in yet.\n\nThe study, which was led by CDC scientists, relied on health records from more than 360,000 tests given at nearly 10,000 retail pharmacies between Sept. 14 and Nov. 11, a period when the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants were causing most Covid-19 infections in the US. The study included people ages 18 and up who had Covid-19 symptoms and were not immunocompromised.\n\nThe study looked at how effective the boosters were in two ways: Researchers calculated a value called absolute vaccine effectiveness, which compared the odds of symptomatic infection in people who received bivalent boosters with those who reported being unvaccinated. They also calculated relative vaccine effectiveness, which looked at the odds of symptomatic infection in people who received updated bivalent boosters compared with those who had two, three or four doses of the original single-strain vaccine.\n\nCompared with people who were unvaccinated, adults 18 to 49 who had gotten bivalent boosters were 43% less likely to get sick with a Covid-19 infection. Older adults, who tend to have weaker immune function, got less protection. Those ages 50 to 64 were 28% less likely, and those ages 65 and up were 22% less likely to get sick with Covid-19 than the unvaccinated group.\n\nThe relative vaccine effectiveness showed the added protection people might expect on top of whatever protection they had left after previous vaccine doses. If a person was two to three months past their last vaccine dose, the bivalent boosters added an average of 30% protection for those who were ages 18 to 49, 31% more protection if they were 50 to 64, and 28% more protection if they were 65 or older. At 3 months after their last booster, people ages 50 and older still had about 20% protection from Covid-19 illness, CDC data show. So overall, the updated boosters got them to around 50% effectiveness against symptomatic infection.\n\nIf a person was more than eight months away from their last vaccine dose, they got more protection from the boosters. But Link-Gelles said that by eight months, there was little protection left from previous shots against Omicron and its variants, meaning the vaccine effectiveness for this group was probably close to their overall protection against infection.\n\nThose ages 18 to 49 who were eight months or more past their last dose of a vaccine had 56% added protection against a Covid-19 infection with symptoms; adults 50 to 64 had 48% added protection, and adults over 65 had 43% added protection, on top of whatever was left from previous vaccinations.\n\nShort, modest protection from boosters\n\nJohn Moore, an immunologist and microbiologist at Weill Cornell Medicine, said it boils down to the fact that that boosters will probably cut your risk of getting sick by about 50%, and that protection probably won‚Äôt last.\n\n‚ÄúHaving a booster will give you some additional protection against infection for a short term, which is always what we see with a booster, but it won‚Äôt last long. It‚Äôll decline, and it will decline more as the more resistant variants spread,‚Äù said Moore, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nThe immunity landscape in the United States is more complex than ever. According to CDC data, roughly two-thirds of Americans have completed at least their primary series of Covid-19 vaccines.

Population protection against severe disease rose from an estimated 61% in December 2021 to around 89%, on average, this November.\n\nAll of this means the US is in a better spot, defensively at least, than it ever has been against the virus ‚Äì which is not to say that the country couldn‚Äôt see another Covid-19 wave, especially if a new variant emerges that is very different from what we‚Äôve seen, if immunity continues to wane or if behavior shifts dramatically.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/health/alcohol-by-age-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "No amount of alcohol is healthy if you're under 40, study says | CNN", "text": "Editor‚Äôs Note: Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

For all other causes, it‚Äôs harmful at all levels of consumption.‚Äù\n\nIndeed, the study found no protective effect for diseases such as tuberculosis, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, liver disease, epilepsy, pancreatitis and many cancers.\n\n‚ÄúAlcohol guidelines, both global ones and national ones, have typically emphasized the difference between consumption level for men compared to women,‚Äù Gakidou said. ‚ÄúWhat our work suggests is that global guidelines, national guidelines and local guidelines would be more effective if they emphasize age as opposed to sex.‚Äù\n\nThe findings underscore ‚Äúthe importance of alcohol recommendations that are tailored to specific regions and populations,‚Äù Amanda Berger, vice president of science and health for the trade group Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, told CNN in an email.\n\n‚ÄúImportantly, no one should drink alcohol to obtain potential health benefits, and some individuals should not drink at all.‚Äù\n\nYounger than 40 found at highest risk\n\nThe report, released Thursday in the journal Lancet, is the first to report alcohol risk by global geographical region, age, sex and year, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which prepared the study.\n\nThe analysis looked at 30 years of data on people ages 15 to 95 from 204 countries and territories gathered by the institute‚Äôs Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, which tracks premature death and disability from over 300 diseases.\n\nThe analysis estimated that 1.34 billion people around the world consumed harmful amounts of alcohol in 2020. More than 59% of the people who drank unsafe amounts of alcohol were between 15 and 39. Over two-thirds were men.\n\nIn every geographic region, the study found drinking alcohol does not provide any health benefits to people under age 40 but does raise the risk of injury, such as motor vehicle accidents, suicides and homicides.\n\nThe study defined a standard drink as 10 grams of pure alcohol, which might be a small 3.4-fluid ounce (100 milliliters) glass of red wine, a 12-fluid ounce (355 milliliters) standard can or bottle of beer (3.5% alcohol) or a 1-fluid ounce shot of spirits (30 milliliters) that is 40% alcohol by volume.\n\nConclusions criticized\n\nWhile praising the analysis as well-conducted, some experts not involved with the research expressed concern about the study‚Äôs conclusions.\n\nStatistics show there are ‚Äúover 14 times as many alcohol-attributable deaths in the UK among 70-74 year-olds than 20-24 year olds,‚Äù said Colin Angus, a senior research fellow at the Sheffield Alcohol Research Group at the UK‚Äôs University of Sheffield, in a statement. The data ‚Äúcontradicts the assertion in this new study that we should focus on the drinking of younger age groups,‚Äù Angus said.\n\n‚ÄúThe elephant in the room with this study is the interpretation of risk based on outcomes for cardiovascular disease ‚Äì particularly in older people,‚Äù said Dr. Tony Rao, visiting clinical research fellow at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King‚Äôs College London.\n\n‚ÄúWe know that any purported health benefits from alcohol on the heart and circulation are balanced out by the increased risk from other conditions such as cancer, liver disease and mental disorders such as depression and dementia,‚Äù Rao said in a statement.\n\nA study published in March found just one pint of beer or glass of wine a day can shrink the overall volume of the brain, with the damage increasing as the number of daily drinks rises. On average, people at age 50 who drank a pint of beer or 6-ounce glass of wine a day in the last month had brains that appeared two years older than those who only drank half of a beer.\n\nResearch in the US has shown drinking among adults rose during pandemic, particularly among women, with ‚Äúa 41% increase in heavy drinking days,‚Äù said Dr. Sarah Wakeman, medical director of the Substance Use Disorders Initiative at Massachusetts General Hospital, in an earlier CNN interview.\n\nA study published in June found many moderate drinkers over age 30 binge on the weekend ‚Äì defined as five or more drinks in a row or within a short period of time. Drinking an average of more than one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men ‚Äì or five or more drinks on the same occasion ‚Äì was linked to alcohol problems nine years later.\n\nWomen are especially sensitive to the effects of alcohol, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, or NIAA. Alcohol-related problems appear sooner and at lower drinking levels than in men, it said.\n\nWomen are more susceptible to alcohol-related brain damage and heart disease than men, and studies show women who have one drink a day increase their risk of breast cancer by 5% to 9% compared with those who abstain.\n\n‚ÄúThe recommendation that those under 40 should not drink at all is totally unrealistic,‚Äù Matt Lambert, CEO of the Portman Group, an industry-funded group that regulates alcohol marketing in the UK, said in an email.\n\nGakidou, the study‚Äôs senior author, admitted that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not realistic to think young adults will stop drinking. Still, we think it‚Äôs important to communicate the latest evidence so that everyone can make informed decisions about their health.‚Äù\n\nFor those over age 65, any increase in drinking is worrisome because many older adults ‚Äúuse medications that can interact with alcohol, have health conditions that can be exacerbated by alcohol, and may be more susceptible to alcohol-related falls and other accidental injuries,‚Äù the NIAA said.\n\n‚ÄúThere is a high threshold for being able to say that alcohol is an effective prevention therapy, and the studies so far do not reach that threshold.

That‚Äôs generally the same amount that global seas have already risen over the last century from Greenland, Antarctica and thermal expansion (when ocean water expands as it warms) combined.\n\nResearchers from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland observed changes in ice-sheet volume in and around Greenland and saw that meltwater runoff has been the primary driver. Using ‚Äúwell-established theory,‚Äù the scientists were able to determine that around 3.3% of the Greenland ice sheet ‚Äì equivalent to 110 trillion tons of ice ‚Äì will inevitably melt as the ice sheet reacts to the changes that have already occurred.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why these billionaires are funding a massive treasure hunt in Greenland 03:05 - Source: CNN\n\nThe sea level rise from this melted ice will occur ‚Äúregardless of any foreseeable future climate pathway this century,‚Äù according to lead author Jason Box, a scientist with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. ‚ÄúThis water is technically already under the bridge.‚Äù\n\nWhile the authors did not specify a timeline, they predict that the change in sea levels can occur between now and the end of the century.\n\nThe research was solely to estimate a minimum, or ‚Äúa very conservative lower bound,‚Äù of sea level rise from melting in Greenland, ‚Äúand in the virtually-certain event that climate continues warming, the sea level commitment only grows,‚Äù Box said.\n\nMassive ice sheets can melt rapidly when the air temperature is warm, but warmer ocean water is also eroding the sheet around the edges.\n\nThe findings come on the heels of a 2022 sea-level rise report released earlier this year by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which found that US coasts could expect 10 to 12 inches of sea level rise in the next 30 years. This will cause high tide floods to occur more than 10 times as frequently, and allow storm surges to spread further inland, according to the report.\n\nGreenland holds enough ice that if it all melted, it could lift sea levels by roughly 25 feet around the world. Researchers point out that a sea level rise of 20 feet doesn‚Äôt mean it will rise evenly around the globe, leaving some places devastated as the sea level falls in others.\n\nAs places such as Greenland lose ice, for example, they also lose the ice‚Äôs gravitational pull on water, meaning Greenland‚Äôs sea level is falling as the level rises elsewhere, said William Colgan, senior researcher at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. The rate of that change is the problem, Colgan told CNN‚Äôs Bill Weir during a research trip in the summer of 2021.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be really hard to adapt to change that fast,‚Äù Colgan said, standing at Greenland‚Äôs Jakobshavn Glacier, where the fjord is full of ice that has broken off from the glacier.\n\nBefore human-caused climate change kicked in, temperatures near 32 degrees Fahrenheit in Greenland were unheard of. But since the 1980s, the region has warmed by around 1.5 degrees per decade ‚Äì four times faster than the global pace ‚Äì making it all the more likely that temperatures will cross the melting threshold.\n\nSeveral days of unusually warm weather in northern Greenland recently triggered rapid melting, with temperatures around 60 degrees ‚Äì 10 degrees warmer than normal for this time of year, scientists told CNN.\n\nThe amount of ice that melted in Greenland between July 15 and 17 alone ‚Äì 6 billion tons of water per day ‚Äì would be enough to fill 7.2 million Olympic-sized swimming pools, according to data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center.\n\nGlobal scientists have said the trends at which climate change is accelerating are quite clear, and that unless emissions are curbed immediately, many more extreme melting events will continue to occur more intensely and frequently.", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/us/arctic-rapid-warming-climate/index.html", "title": "The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the planet ...", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nAs sea ice vanishes, Greenland melts and wildfires scorch the planet‚Äôs northernmost forests, new research confirms what scientists are sounding alarms about: the Arctic has warmed much faster than the rest of the world in the past several decades.\n\nThe phenomenon, called Arctic amplification, is caused by the heat-trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels. The pace of the temperature increase around the North Pole in recent decades was four times higher than the rest of the planet, researchers at the Finnish Meteorological Institute found in a study published Thursday.\n\nAnother problem: Climate models, which scientists used to predict long-term change, are not capturing this high rate of warming, lead author and researcher Mika Rantanen told CNN, which was part of this study‚Äôs motivation. That‚Äôs concerning because if the models can‚Äôt recreate what‚Äôs happening right now, scientists can‚Äôt be confident in their long-term predictions.\n\n‚ÄúBecause of this discrepancy, we decided that this needs to be corrected,‚Äù Rantenen said. ‚ÄúThis needs to be updated.‚Äù\n\nThe study, published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment, analyzed temperature trends in the Arctic Circle between 1979 and 2021 ‚Äî the modern era of satellite data.

The promise has been that if you endure the awkwardness and invasiveness of having a camera travel the length of your large intestine once every decade after age 45, you have the best chance of catching ‚Äì and perhaps preventing ‚Äì colorectal cancer. It‚Äôs the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Some 15 million colonoscopies are performed in the US each year.\n\nNow, a landmark study suggests the benefits of colonoscopies for cancer screening may be overestimated.\n\nThe study marks the first time colonoscopies have been compared head-to-head to no cancer screening in a randomized trial. The study found only meager benefits for the group of people invited to get the procedure: an 18% lower risk of getting colorectal cancer, and no significant reduction in the risk of cancer death. It was published Sunday in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nStudy researcher Dr. Michael Bretthauer, a gastroenterologist who leads the clinical effectiveness group at the University of Oslo in Norway, said he found the results disappointing.\n\nBut as a researcher, he has to follow the science, ‚Äúso I think we have to embrace it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd we may have oversold the message for the last 10 years or so, and we have to wind it back a little.‚Äù\n\nOther experts say that as good as this study was, it has important limitations, and these results shouldn‚Äôt deter people from getting colonoscopies.\n\n‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs just hard to know the value of a screening test when the majority of people in the screening didn‚Äôt get it done,‚Äù said Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the study.\n\nLess than half of people invited to get a colonoscopy in the study ‚Äì just 42% ‚Äì actually got one.\n\nWhen the study authors restricted the results to the people who actually received colonoscopies ‚Äì about 12,000 out of the more than 28,000 who were invited to do so ‚Äì the procedure was found to be more effective. It reduced the risk of colorectal cancer by 31% and cut the risk of dying of that cancer by 50%.\n\nBretthauer said the true benefits of colonoscopy probably lie somewhere in the middle. He said he thinks of the results of the full study ‚Äì including people who did and didn‚Äôt get colonoscopies after they were invited ‚Äì as the minimum amount of benefit colonoscopies provide to a screened population. He thinks of the results from the subset of people who actually got the test as the maximum benefit people could expect from the procedure.\n\nBased on his results, then, he expects that screening colonoscopy probably reduces a person‚Äôs chances of colorectal cancer by 18% to 31%, and their risk of death from 0% to as much as 50%.\n\nBut, he said, even 50% is ‚Äúon the low end of what I think everybody thought it would be.‚Äù\n\nOther studies have estimated larger benefits for colonoscopies, reporting that these procedures could reduce the risk of dying of colorectal cancer by as much as 68%.\n\nThe first randomized trial of colonoscopy\n\nThe NordICC study, which stands for Northern-European Initiative on Colon Cancer, included more 84,000 men and women ages 55 to 64 from Poland, Norway and Sweden. None had gotten a colonoscopy before. The participants were randomly invited to have a screening colonoscopy between June 2009 and June 2014, or they were followed for the study without getting screened.\n\nIn the 10 years after enrollment, the group invited to get colonoscopies had an 18% lower risk of colorectal cancers than the group that wasn‚Äôt screened. Overall, the group invited to screening also had a small reduction in their risk of death from colorectal cancer, but that difference was not statistically significant ‚Äì meaning it could simply be due to chance.\n\nBefore the NordiCC trial, the benefits of colonoscopies had been measured by observational studies that looked back in time to compare how often colorectal cancer is diagnosed in people who received colonoscopies versus those who did not.\n\nThese studies can be subject to bias, however, so scientists look to randomized trials that blindly sort people into two groups: those who are assigned to get an intervention and those who are not. These studies then follow both groups forward in time to see if there are differences. Those studies have been difficult to do for colon cancer, which can be slow-growing and may take years to be diagnosed.\n\nThe researchers say they‚Äôre going to continue to follow participants for another five years. It could be that because colon cancers can be slow-growing, more time will help refine their results and may show bigger benefits for colonoscopy screening.\n\nResults need careful interpretation\n\nNormally, those kinds of disappointing results from such a large, strong study would be considered definitive enough to change medical practice.\n\nBut this study has some limitations that experts say need to be sorted out before doctors and patients give up on colonoscopies for cancer screening.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone should be canceling their colonoscopy,‚Äù said Dr. Jason Dominitz, the national director of gastroenterology for the Veterans Health Administration.\n\n‚ÄúWe know that colon cancer screening works,‚Äù said Dominitiz, who also co-authored an editorial that ran alongside the study.\n\nThere are several options for colorectal cancer screening. Those include stool tests that check for blood or cancer cells and a test called sigmoidoscopy, which looks only at the lower part of the colon. Both have been shown to reduce both cancer incidence and colorectal cancer deaths.\n\n‚ÄúThose other tests work through colonoscopy,‚Äù Dominitz said. ‚ÄúThey identify people at high risk who would benefit from colonoscopy, then the colonoscopy is done and removes polyps, for example, that prevents the individual from getting colon cancer in the first place, or it identifies colon cancer at a treatable stage.‚Äù\n\nPolyps are benign growths that can turn into cancers. They are typically removed when identified during a screening colonoscopy, which can lower a person‚Äôs risk of colorectal cancer in the future.\n\nStudies are underway in Spain and the US testing colonoscopy head-to-head against stool tests to see which is most effective.\n\nThe best way to screen for colorectal cancer\n\nDominitz said this randomized controlled trial was a test of advice as much as it was a test of the value of colonoscopy.\n\n‚ÄúIf you ask the population to do something, how much of an impact will it have?‚Äù he said.\n\nOverall, the study found that just inviting people to get a colonoscopy didn‚Äôt have a large beneficial impact across these countries, partly because so many people didn‚Äôt do it.\n\nDominitz thinks the low participation can be partly explained by the study‚Äôs setting. Colonoscopies are not as common in the countries involved in the study as they are in the United States. In Norway, he said, official colorectal cancer screening recommendations didn‚Äôt come until this past year.\n\n‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt see the public service announcements. They don‚Äôt hear Katie Couric talking about getting screened for colon cancer. They don‚Äôt see the billboards in the airport and whatnot,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo an invitation to be screened in Europe is, I think, likely to be somewhat different than an invitation to be screened in the US.‚Äù\n\nIn the US, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 adults between the ages of 50 and 75 have never been screened for colorectal cancer.\n\nIf you feel squeamish about getting a colonoscopy, the US Preventive Services Task Force says a variety of methods and regimens work to detect colorectal cancer. It recommends screening with tests that check for blood and/or cancer cells in stool every one to three years, a CT scan of the colon every five years, a flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years, a flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years paired with stool tests to check for blood annually, or a colonoscopy every 10 years.\n\nIn 2021, the task force lowered the recommended age to start routine screening for colorectal cancer from 50 to 45 because the cancer is becoming more common in younger adults.\n\nWhen it comes to colorectal cancer, Dominitz said, tests can only be effective if people are willing to do them.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs proof, he points to early results from a large randomized trial from Sweden that‚Äôs testing colonoscopy, FIT testing and no screening at all.\n\nResults collected from more than 278,000 people enrolled between March 2014 and the end of 2020 found that 35% of the group assigned to get a colonoscopy actually got one, compared with 55% who were assigned to the stool test group.\n\nTo date, slightly more cancers have been detected in the group assigned to stool testing than in the group assigned to get a colonoscopy ‚Äì ‚Äúso participation with screening really is key!‚Äù Dominitz said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/health/updated-boosters-omicron-imprint/index.html", "title": "Updated Covid-19 boosters offer protection, but new studies suggest ...", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nThe updated Covid-19 booster shots appear to work about as well against the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants as the original boosters they replaced, according to two new studies from research teams at Harvard and Columbia universities.\n\nThe research suggests that our bodies have been well-trained to fight the original virus, which emerged from Wuhan, China, and that boosters mostly reinforce that response. Getting boosted this fall is still an important way to renew protection, even among people who were previously infected or vaccinated.\n\nBut the hope was that by tweaking the vaccine recipe to include currently circulating strains of the Omicron variant, it would help broaden immunity against those variants and perhaps offer better and longer-lasting protection.\n\nWhen the researchers compared the immune responses of people who got a booster dose of the original shot to people who got the updated bivalent boosters, they looked about the same.\n\n‚ÄúWe see essentially no difference‚Äù between the old boosters and the new about a month after the shot, said Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia, whose team authored one of the studies.\n\nImmunologists say a vaccine against two strains may not be better than a single strain shot because of a phenomenon called immune imprinting. Scientists say imprinting may complicate efforts to stay ahead of new variants as the coronavirus continues to evolve, and it adds urgency to the development of new vaccine technologies to fight the virus.\n\nWhen the US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorizations for new bivalent Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna at the end of August, it did so on the basis of studies in mice and previous human trials with a different two-strain booster formulation. Little was known about the how protective the shots might be in people; full data from clinical trials testing the BA.4 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines in humans hasn‚Äôt yet been made public.\n\nBut modeling data suggested that getting the boosters out in September could save tens of thousands of lives if the country had another winter surge, so the FDA authorized the shots, ahead of results from clinical trials, in order to get them to the public more quickly.\n\nThe updated shots contain instructions that show cells how to make spike proteins from the original virus that caused Covid-19, as well as spikes from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. These spikes get assembled by our cells and displayed to our immune system so it can make antibodies to fight the real thing during an active infection.\n\nThe original strain of the virus, sometimes called the ancestral or wild-type strain, is no longer circulating, however. When we boost, we are mostly boosting antibodies against a virus that‚Äôs long gone.\n\nAs the virus has evolved, the vaccines have not kept pace. Each new variant has become more and more resistant to the antibodies we make against it, increasing the risk of breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nRight now, protection against infection begins to wane just a few months after each booster dose. Protection against severe outcomes ‚Äì hospitalization or death from Covid-19 ‚Äì lasts longer, but can also fade, especially for vulnerable groups such as people who are over 65, who have weakened immune systems or who have underlying medical conditions.\n\nSimilar immune responses\n\nThe studies have important limitations, and they aren‚Äôt the final word on the updated boosters.\n\nBoth studies were small. Ho‚Äôs study looked at the immune responses of 19 people who were boosted with a fourth dose of the original recipe vaccine and 21 people who got a fourth dose of the updated boosters. The other study, from Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor at Harvard and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, looked at 15 people who got the original booster and 18 people who got bivalent shots.\n\nBoth reports were posted as preprints, before scrutiny by independent experts.\n\nThe studies also measured immune responses over a short period of time ‚Äì about three to five weeks after the fourth doses. Ho says these results could change with time, as immune cells mature.\n\n‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt say that a few months from now, there won‚Äôt be any difference,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt know that until these individuals are followed for a longer period of time.‚Äù\n\nDespite these caveats, experts who were not involved in the research say that two studies from well-regarded labs arriving at roughly the same conclusions about the vaccines gives them confidence that the results are correct.\n\n‚ÄúAt least at this time point, there‚Äôs no discernible benefit‚Äù over the older boosters, Ho said.\n\nClinical trials being conducted by vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna involve hundreds of people who have had the updated boosters and are being followed for longer periods of time. Data from those studies are still coming.\n\nBoth companies declined to comment on Ho and Barouch‚Äôs studies, citing company policies not to weigh in on research they have not been involved in.\n\nIn comparing the immune responses of people who got the old boosters with those who got the newer ones, the researchers found that neutralizing antibodies spiked after both shots to about the same high levels, which was good news.\n\nIn Barouch‚Äôs study, antibody concentrations were 15 times higher after the original boosters, rising from 184 to 2,829. They were 17 times higher after the updated shots, jumping from 211 to 3,693. The difference in antibody levels between shots didn‚Äôt pass a statistical test, however, so the results may have been due to chance.\n\nMore importantly, that slight difference in antibody levels probably wouldn‚Äôt protect people any better in the real world.\n\n‚ÄúWe would not expect this to be clinically significant,‚Äù said Barouch, who worked on the development of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nBut the bulk of the antibodies generated after either shot were ones that would bind the original virus, with fewer directed specifically against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\nBarouch‚Äôs team also looked specifically at T cells, which help the body hold the memory of germs it has been exposed to. These cells are thought to play a key role in how long immune protection lasts. Antibody levels naturally drop off over time, but T cells stick around.\n\nThe numbers of T cells didn‚Äôt budge much after either vaccine.\n\n‚ÄúUnfortunately, neither one increased T-cell responses very much, and we believe that T-cell responses in addition to antibody responses are important for protection against severe disease,‚Äù Barouch said.\n\n‚ÄòA booster is a booster‚Äô\n\nDr. Eric Topol, who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the study results ‚Äúcan be considered a disappointment,‚Äù especially because the US government raced to make them available and because there had been high hopes for an improved vaccine in time for a predicted winter Covid-19 surge.\n\nTopol also said it would be a mistake to skip these shots. They still work; they just may not be much of an improvement over the older ones.\n\n‚ÄúA booster is a booster until proven otherwise and we are in great need of getting more of them in the US,‚Äù Topol, who was not involved in the new studies, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nFewer than 20 million people ‚Äì less than 10% of the population ages 5 and up ‚Äì have gotten the updated booster, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAfter waiting the recommended three months since his last Covid-19 infection, President Joe Biden got an updated booster Tuesday and urged eligible Americans to do the same.\n\n‚ÄúYour old vaccine or your previous Covid infection will not give you maximum protection,‚Äù Biden said.\n\nPublic health officials had hoped that the rollout of the updated boosters would mark a turning point, where Americans might be able to get annual Covid-19 shots instead of boosters every few months.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA‚Äôs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, recently told Stat that he wasn‚Äôt sure whether the country had reached that point.\n\n‚ÄúI would be lying to you if [I said] it doesn‚Äôt keep me up at night worrying that there is a certain chance that we may have to deploy another booster ‚Äì at least for a portion of the population, perhaps older individuals ‚Äì before next September, October,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen, but it‚Äôs what keeps me up at night, because we see how fast this virus is evolving.‚Äù\n\nImprinting may complicate quest for better immunity\n\nThe studies probably didn‚Äôt find any difference between the new and old boosters because of immune imprinting, says Michael Worobey, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies the evolution of viruses and the origins and control of pandemics.\n\n‚ÄúYour body is on a hair trigger to create more antibodies of what it has a good memory of,‚Äù said Worobey, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, our immune systems were blank slates when it came to the coronavirus. By now, most of us have been exposed to one version of the virus or another through the vaccine, an infection or both. That exposure programs cells called B cells to make specific kinds of antibodies, and more B cells get this programming during their first exposure to the virus than they do in subsequent brushes with it.\n\nThat‚Äôs the reason some strains of the flu may hit certain age groups harder than others, too. When viruses look more similar to the first infection or vaccine you had, your body tends to do a better job fighting them off.\n\nWorobey said that both new studies have limitations, ‚Äúbut I think when you put them together, they paint a pretty clear picture that that antigenic imprinting is causing issues here, for sure.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs possible to break through immune imprinting, he said. Certain kinds of vaccine ingredients, or adjuvants ‚Äì ‚Äúthings that just happen to really wake up the immune system‚Äù ‚Äì can do it.\n\nBut it‚Äôs not easy to add the kind of adjuvants he‚Äôs thinking about to mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna‚Äôs. In this case, he says, judging by the study findings, it probably would have been better to update the vaccine by including only the components against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\n‚ÄúFor me, the take-home message is, if you want to boost and provide protection against Omicron, leave the original variant out of the vaccine.‚Äù\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA‚Äôs vaccine advisory committee, says the new studies bear out data that was presented to the FDA‚Äôs advisers in June.\n\nHe says it‚Äôs one of the reasons he voted against the FDA requiring companies to add an Omicron strain to the boosters used in the US.\n\n‚ÄúCertainly, the hope that this would be significantly better in terms of protection against the circulating strains, I think, is unlikely to be realized,‚Äù said Offit, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWorobey says that when the strains are combined as they are in the updated boosters, they actually end up competing. The body‚Äôs response to the original strain is so strong, it will end up blocking the updated portion of the vaccine from stimulating those blank slate B cells against the newer variants and reshaping the immune response.\n\nThus, imprinting will complicate efforts to keep up with the virus, he says. We may need different kinds of vaccine technologies if the virus ever changes so much that it outcompetes our immunity altogether.\n\nThat‚Äôs something the FDA‚Äôs Marks has considered, too.\n\n‚ÄúI would love to see us have a very ecumenical look over all of the available vaccines and all of the vaccines in development to try to see what‚Äôs best moving forward,‚Äù he told Stat. ‚ÄúNot to diss the current mRNA vaccines but because we owe it to the population to see what might provide the greatest breadth, depth and duration of immunity against Covid-19.‚Äù", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/25/health/marijuana-potency-addiction-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "Highly potent weed creating marijuana addicts worldwide, study says", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nHigher concentrations of tetrahydrocannabinol or THC ‚Äì the part of the marijuana plant that makes you high ‚Äì are causing more people to become addicted in many parts of the world, a new review of studies found.\n\nCompared with people who use lower-potency products (typically 5 to 10 milligrams per gram of THC), those who use higher-potency cannabis are more likely to experience addiction and mental health outcomes, according to the study published Monday in the journal Lancet Psychiatry.\n\nScientists have established a ‚Äústandard THC unit‚Äù of 5 milligrams of THC for research.

Adobe Stock\n\nIn cannabis resin, the sticky brown sap on the plant from which extracts and concentrations are made, THC levels increased by approximately 5.7 milligrams each year from 1975 to 2017, the study found. Concentrated products can reach extremely high levels of THC.\n\nThis yearly rise in potency may not be clear to consumers, experts fear. While looking at a product label might tell a person the ‚Äúprecise potency‚Äù of THC in a store where marijuana is legally sold, ‚Äúpeople buying cannabis illegally may not be able to access reliable information about the potency of the product they are using,‚Äù Freeman said.\n\n‚ÄúHowever, certain types of cannabis are typically more potent than others ‚Äì cannabis extracts are typically more potent than cannabis flower,‚Äù he added.\n\nWhile people do try to adjust their consumption when the potency of their cannabis varies, ‚Äúsuch as by adding less cannabis to their joint or inhaling less deeply,‚Äù these efforts fail to completely work, Freeman said. That means ‚Äúhigher potency products still deliver a larger dose of THC to consumers than lower potency products,‚Äù he said.\n\nMental health affected\n\nAs marijuana became more potent, cases of marijuana-associated psychosis rose, the review found.

They also had higher risks for lung and heart problems, fatigue, digestive and kidney disorders, diabetes and neurologic problems.\n\nThe findings come as a fresh wave of coronavirus variants, notably Omicron‚Äôs BA.5, have become dominant in the United States and Europe, causing cases and hospitalizations to rise once again. BA.5 caused about 54% of cases nationwide last week, doubling its share of Covid-19 transmission over the past two weeks, according to data posted Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBA.5 carries key mutations that help it escape antibodies generated by both vaccines and prior infection, leaving many people vulnerable to reinfection.\n\nDr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, led the research, which was posted as a preprint ahead of peer review. He said he decided to do it after watching reinfections become more and more common among his own patients.\n\n‚ÄúIf you asked me about reinfection maybe a year and a half ago, I would tell you that maybe I have a patient here or there, but it‚Äôs really, really rare,‚Äù Al-Aly said. That‚Äôs not true anymore, though.\n\n‚ÄúSo we asked a simple question that if you got Covid before and now you‚Äôre on your second infection, does this really add risk? And the simple answer is that it does.‚Äù\n\nTallying the risks of reinfections\n\nAl-Aly and his team compared the health records of more than 250,000 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 one time with records from 38,000 others who had two or more Covid-19 infections documented in their medical records. More than 5.3 million people with no record of a Covid-19 infection were used as the control group.\n\nAmong those with reinfections, 36,000 people had two Covid-19 infections, roughly 2,200 had caught Covid-19 three times, and 246 had been infected four times.\n\nCommon new diagnoses after reinfections included chest pain, abnormal heart rhythms, heart attacks, inflammation of the heart muscle or the sac around the heart, heart failure and blood clots. Common lung issues included shortness of breath, low blood oxygen, lung disease, and accumulation of fluid around the lungs, Al-Aly said.\n\nThe study found that the risk of a new health problem was highest around the time of a Covid-19 reinfection, but it also persisted for at least six months. The increased risk was present whether or not someone had been vaccinated, and it was graded ‚Äì meaning it increased with each subsequent infection.\n\nAl-Aly said that‚Äôs not what people really think will happen when they get Covid a second or third time.\n\n‚ÄúThere is this idea that if you had Covid before, your immune system is trained to recognize it and is more equipped to fight it, and if you‚Äôre getting it again, maybe it doesn‚Äôt affect you that much, but that‚Äôs not really true,‚Äù he said.\n\nAl-Aly said that doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt people who have had Covid and done just fine; there are lots of them. Rather, what his study shows is that each infection brings new risk, and that risk adds up over time, he said.\n\nEven if a person has half the risk of developing lasting health problems during a second infection than they did during their first infection, he said, they still wind up with 50% more risk of problems than someone who didn‚Äôt get Covid-19 a second time.\n\nThe study has some important caveats. Al-Aly says it was more common to see reinfections among people who had existing risks because of their age or underlying health. That shows that reinfection may not be random, and it could be that the health risks linked to reinfections aren‚Äôt, either.\n\n‚ÄúIt is possible that sicker individuals or people with immune dysfunction are at higher risk of reinfection and adverse health outcomes after reinfection,‚Äù Al-Aly said.\n\nHe wasn‚Äôt interested in trying to isolate the pure effects of reinfection but wanted to understand how repeated infections are affecting the people who get them.\n\n‚ÄúThe most relevant question to people‚Äôs lives is, if you get reinfected, does it add to your risk of acute complications and long Covid, and the answer is a clear yes and yes,‚Äù he said.\n\nThe study is observational, which means it can‚Äôt determine cause and effect.\n\nAl-Aly says the researchers saw these increased risks even after they weighted the data to account for the effects of age, sex, medication use and the person‚Äôs underlying health before they got Covid-19.\n\nCovid-19 continues to surprise\n\nExperts who were not involved in the research say it is compelling.\n\n‚ÄúThere is this idea that I think a lot of people have that ‚Äòif I survived my first infection, that I‚Äôm really going to be just fine the second time. There really shouldn‚Äôt be any problem,‚Äô ‚Äù said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an instructor in clinical medicine at Columbia University.\n\n‚ÄúThe popular wisdom, right, is that reinfections are mild, nothing to worry about, nothing to see here,‚Äù Griffin said of the study on the podcast ‚ÄúThis Week in Virology.‚Äù But that‚Äôs not really being borne out, he said.\n\nThis is not how it‚Äôs supposed to work. Even when viruses shape-shift ‚Äì as influenza does ‚Äì our immune system generally retains its memory of how to recognize and fight off some part of them. They may still make us ill, but the idea is that our prior immunity is there to mount some of kind of defense and keep us from serious harm.\n\nWith coronaviruses, and especially SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses, the hits just keep on coming.\n\n‚ÄúA year later, you can get reinfected with the same coronavirus the second time. It is not clear that that second infection can be more mild, because coronaviruses intrinsically have the ability to interfere with long-lasting lifetime immunity,‚Äù Griffin told CNN.\n\nGriffin says he‚Äôs seen Covid-19 reinfections go both ways. Sometimes, the second or third is milder for his patients, but sometimes it‚Äôs not.\n\nHow does that compare with other respiratory infections?\n\nEarly in the pandemic, people would get Covid, and three months would go by when they were pretty well protected, he said. But now, those reinfections are happening more frequently, no doubt because of the rapid changes to the virus. He says he‚Äôs seen some people infected four times in the past two years.\n\n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt really see much of that with the flu,‚Äù Griffin said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs for what people should be doing now with regard to this risk, Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says Americans are really done with the pandemic.

These include requirements for a background check and/or permits to purchase handguns; a permit to carry concealed guns in public; the secure storage of firearms; the rejection of ‚ÄòStand Your Ground‚Äô laws; and the enactment of ‚Äòextreme risk‚Äô laws that temporarily remove a person‚Äôs access to firearms when there is evidence that they pose a serious risk to themselves or others, according to Everytown.\n\nLast year, several conservative states ‚Äì including Texas, Iowa, Tennessee, Montana, Utah and Wyoming ‚Äì passed legislation allowing some form of permitless carry as President Joe Biden pushed forward executive actions to address gun violence following several high-profile mass shootings. But Congress has shown little to no movement on passing any meaningful federal gun reforms.\n\nA memorial outside of Oxford High School on December 3, 2021, in Michigan.

Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nIn Texas, the controversial ‚Äúconstitutional carry‚Äù legislation went into effect in September that allows most Texans who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public without obtaining a permit or training.\n\nSupporters of the bill have argued that by removing the licensing requirement they are removing an ‚Äúartificial barrier‚Äù to residents‚Äô right to bear arms under the Constitution and ensuring more Texans have access to ‚Äúthe protection of themselves or their families‚Äù in public. But law enforcement officials and experts have expressed concerns that the open carrying of firearms makes it more difficult for police to quell violence.\n\n‚ÄúAs we‚Äôve seen gun extremism continue to rise in this country, we‚Äôve also seen people who open carry start out at marches and rallies and then show up in elected officials‚Äô homes, in polling places, statehouses and then on January 6th at the US Capitol,‚Äù Watts said.\n\nAccording to Watts, the shooting in a Michigan high school in December that killed four students is a ‚Äútextbook example‚Äù of why laws that require the secure storage of firearms are essential to gun safety.\n\nThe alleged gunman in that shooting, 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley, is accused of fatally shooting four classmates and wounding several others on November 30. His parents were charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter in the same incident. All three have pleaded not guilty.\n\nProsecutors allege that James Crumbley, the father of the suspected shooter, bought the gun used in the shooting four days earlier. The incident prompted outrage over Ethan‚Äôs alleged accessibility to the gun, arguing that the shooting could have been prevented.\n\nOnly 23 states currently have some semblance of a secure storage requirement, Watts said.\n\nLast year, Everytown successfully worked to pass secure storage laws in Maine, Colorado, and Oregon, among others, according to Watts.\n\nDuring this year‚Äôs legislative session, Watts said the organization would work with lawmakers in hopes of passing such laws in at least 14 states. States such as California, Michigan and New Jersey are working on first-of-its kind legislation that requires parents to be notified about secure storage.\n\nEverytown‚Äôs research shows that 21 of the country‚Äôs states have rejected Stand Your Ground laws, which allow individuals to use deadly force in public as self-defense even if they can safely walk away from the situation.\n\nA Chicago police officer investigates a fatal shooting in the Hyde Park neighborhood in November 2021. John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune/Getty Images\n\nDespite strong gun laws, some states still feel the effects of being close to a state with more lax regulations. For example, Illinois has the sixth-strongest gun safety laws in the country, but its neighboring state of Indiana has much weaker gun laws, Suplina says.\n\nAccording to Suplina, this could explain why such a high number of guns purchased in Indiana have ended up in Chicago. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice charged six Indianapolis residents related to the straw purchasing of firearms. Prosecutors said more than 20 of the guns were recovered in Chicago after being used in violent crimes, including murder.\n\nGun violence overall has risen during the pandemic. More than two-thirds of the country‚Äôs 40 most populous cities saw more homicides last year than in 2020, and most of them were a result of gun violence, according to a CNN analysis of police department data. For many cities, the elevated rates of homicide continued into 2021.\n\nWhile experts say the reasons for the rise in homicides are varied, murders are increasingly carried out with guns. The increase in gun violence was underscored in the FBI‚Äôs 2020 Uniform Crime Report, which stated that about 77% of reported murders in 2020 were committed with a gun, up from 74% in 2019. The agency reported that the number of homicides increased by nearly 30% from 2019, the largest single-year jump the agency has recorded. There is no federal database of gun sales, but other independent surveys have found that gun sales have soared during the Covid-19 pandemic.", "authors": ["Emma Tucker Priya Krishnakumar", "Emma Tucker", "Priya Krishnakumar"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}]}

A speed eating contest was arranged by the Disgusting Food Museum in Malm√∂, including an eating competition for surstr√∂mming, a traditional Swedish delicacy consisting of fermented herring that has been salted just enough to prevent it from rotting. ‚ÄúThe biggest part of the challenge‚Äù was ‚Äúto not vomit‚Äù, said a spokesperson.\n\nCar bought for ¬£1 to go for ¬£1m\n\nA rare classic Jaguar bought for just ¬£1 is set to sell for over ¬£1m.

Kay Ivey is urging college football fans to get vaccinated before heading to stadiums this season. The first games kick off in a few weeks, raising concerns that crowded stadiums could help spread COVID-19. Asked about those concerns last week, the Republican governor said the remedy is for more people to get inoculated. ‚ÄúIf everybody would just get the vaccine, we wouldn‚Äôt have a problem. Simply get the shot, then go enjoy your football game,‚Äù Ivey said after participating in an event with college mascots on the steps of the state Capitol. Dr. Scott Harris, Alabama‚Äôs state health officer, said the state Department of Public Health has issued guidance on sporting events including recommending spacing and emphasizing the importance of vaccinations. ‚ÄúOutdoor events are safer in general than indoor events, but having hundreds of thousands of people getting together during a pandemic is going to result in some disease transmission,‚Äù Harris said. ‚ÄúWe hope people are vaccinated enough that that can be minimized.‚Äù Alabama coach Nick Saban has also been an outspoken advocate for getting vaccinated and participated in a public service announcement over the summer encouraging Alabamians to get the shots. The state has one of the nation‚Äôs lowest rates of fully vaccinated residents.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: The city could see nearly a half-million cruise ship visitors next year after a new docking agreement was announced with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. The deal between the cruise line and Sitka Sound Cruise Terminal came last week as one of the world‚Äôs largest cruise ships arrived, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reports. ‚ÄúIt ensures they have a place to bring their ships and additional ships to Sitka for the future,‚Äù said Chris McGraw, manager of Sitka Sound Cruise Terminal. Halibut Point Marine, owned by McGraw‚Äôs family, is majority owner of the cruise terminal. The Royal Caribbean ship Ovation of the Seas, which is 1,138 feet long ‚Äì or nearly the length of four football fields placed end-to-end ‚Äì arrived Tuesday. Officials said the visit got off to a great Alaska start, with a bear walking along the dock as the ship pulled in. The ship‚Äôs arrival marked the formal completion of a cruise terminal dock expansion that McGraw called ‚Äúphase one‚Äù of plans intended to position Sitka as a premier port in Alaska. The Ovation of the Seas, which can hold up to 4,900 guests, brought about 1,500 passengers to Sitka. There were fewer travelers aboard because of COVID-19 mitigation measures.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: After more than a year of silence due to the pandemic, mariachis are back playing Sunday services at Tucson‚Äôs St. Augustine Cathedral, where the colorful and sonorous tradition dates back a half-century and fuses Roman Catholicism with Mexican American pride. For the hundreds of worshippers gathered in this Spanish colonial church and other congregations across the Southwest, the unique sound of mariachi liturgy evokes a borderlands identity where spirituality and folk music have blended for centuries. ‚ÄúSyncretism is the reality of this land, the ‚Äòambos‚Äô reality,‚Äù said the Rev. Alan Valencia, the cathedral‚Äôs rector, who grew up attending mariachi Mass in ‚Äúambos Nogales,‚Äù or ‚Äúboth Nogales,‚Äù as locals refer to the two cities of the same name straddling the U.S.-Mexican border about 60 miles to the south. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs what we see in these mariachi Masses,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFaith and culture come together and grow.‚Äù The first canon of mariachi Mass was composed in Cuernavaca, Mexico, after the Vatican encouraged the incorporation of regional musical traditions into services in the 1960s. Called the Misa Panamericana, or Pan-American Mass, it features a specific order of instrumental arrangements, sung prayers and hymns, according to Dan Sheehy, director and curator of the Smithsonian Folkways Recordings.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 33 new COVID-19 deaths and more than 2,400 new coronavirus cases Friday as Arkansas reached a new high for virus patients on ventilators. The Department of Health said the state‚Äôs COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic began rose to 6,614, while coronavirus cases increased by 2,407 to 431,507 total. The number of COVID-19 patients in the state‚Äôs hospitals dropped by 13 to 1,397, but only 19 intensive care unit beds were available across the entire state, the department said. There were 343 COVID-19 patients on ventilators, a new high for the state, while 533 were in ICUs. Arkansas ranks fourth in the country for new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University research data. The state‚Äôs cases and hospitalizations have surged in recent weeks due to the ultra-contagious delta variant and the state‚Äôs low vaccination rate. Only about 39% of the state‚Äôs population is fully vaccinated against the disease. The state on Thursday reported 9,143 additional doses of COVID-19 vaccines were given. ‚ÄúWe must continue to work to increase vaccinations,‚Äù Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted. ‚ÄúOur children under 12 cannot get the vaccine and need our help to stay healthy.‚Äù\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The Golden City became the first major city in the nation to require proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 on Friday for people dining inside restaurants, working out in gyms or attending indoor concerts. Restaurants and bars posted signs and added extra staff to begin verifying people‚Äôs proof of vaccination before allowing them in. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs definitely some anxiety around how it‚Äôs all going to work,‚Äù said Pete Sittnick, a managing partner of Waterbar and EPIC Steak restaurants on the city‚Äôs waterfront. He anticipates a slowdown in checking in diners, possible pushback from guests who disagree with the requirement and awkward scenarios where someone shows up without proper documentation. ‚ÄúThe good thing is, if somebody doesn‚Äôt have their verification of vaccination, they can still eat outside,‚Äù he said. Mayor London Breed announced the requirement more than a week ago in an attempt to stem rising COVID-19 cases, saying she was worried the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus could disrupt the city‚Äôs economic rebound. The mandate goes further than New York City, which requires people to be at least partially inoculated for a variety of high-risk indoor activities, and New Orleans, which requires proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test for indoor dining or drinking.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper announced Thursday that he has a ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù case of COVID-19. The first-term Democrat issued a statement saying he tested positive for the coronavirus after experiencing mild symptoms and was self-isolating at the direction of Congress‚Äô attending physician, Dr. Brian P. Monahan. Hickenlooper said he was ‚Äúfeeling much better.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful for the vaccine (and the scientists behind it) for limiting my symptoms and allowing us to continue our work for Colorado,‚Äù Hickenlooper said. ‚ÄúIf you haven‚Äôt been vaccinated, don‚Äôt wait for the virus ‚Äì get the shot today, and a booster when it‚Äôs available too!‚Äù Infections and illnesses can happen even after being vaccinated. Experts say inoculation could help make any illnesses less severe. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that newer variants of the coronavirus could be a factor in ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù cases. Hickenlooper, 69, is a former brewpub entrepreneur, Denver mayor and two-term governor who defeated incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner in the 2020 election.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A year after receiving a huge influx of federal aid for the mailing of absentee ballot applications, town clerks across the state are facing the prospect of not having enough money to do the same for Nov. 2 local elections. They told the Connecticut Post local budgets were set months ago, and there may not be additional money for printing, postage and office workers. Absentee ballots are supposed to be ready for the public by Oct. 1. ‚ÄúWith cities and towns finalizing their annual budgets in the spring, town clerks do not have the necessary funds built into their current budget to cover the costs of postage and staff to process the possible increase in applications,‚Äù Kate Wall, president of the Connecticut Town Clerks Association, told the newspaper. The secretary of state‚Äôs office said a provision in the state budget allows people to continue to cite pandemic-related concerns to request using voting by mail or drop-off ballots this year. The $15 million in federal support for state elections last year, which also included cybersecurity measures, was a one-time event and is not available this year, the Post reports. A spokesperson for Secretary of the State Denise Merrill blamed the lack of funding this year on Republicans in the Legislature who oppose mail-in balloting.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Current and former students of the University of Delaware can pursue claims that the school breached contractual obligations and unjustly enriched itself by halting in-person classes and shutting down the campus last spring because of the coronavirus pandemic, a federal judge ruled Friday. Judge Stephanos Bibas said the students have plausibly alleged that the school promised them in-person classes, activities and services. ‚ÄúTrue, the school never promised them expressly. But promises need not be express to be enforceable,‚Äù Bibas wrote. ‚ÄúBy its statements and history of offering classes in person, the school may have implied a promise to stay in person.‚Äù Bibas also said that, even if the university was justified in breaking any such promise because of COVID-19, it should not be unjustly enriched in doing so and may have to return the money it saved, if any, when it went online. The judge rejected the university‚Äôs arguments that it expressly reserved the right to go online and that the case involves claims of ‚Äúeducational malpractice,‚Äù which many states prohibit. Bibas also rejected the university‚Äôs argument that parents who paid their children‚Äôs tuition and fees do not have standing in the lawsuit because they had no duty to shoulder those costs and were not personally deprived of campus services or in-person classes.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In a flash notice sent to all officers and members of the agency Thursday, the Metropolitan Police Department activated the entire force and postponed vacation days in anticipation of a Sept. 18 protest organized by supporters of Jan. 6 insurrection defendants, WUSA-TV reports. The rally, known as ‚ÄúJustice for J6,‚Äù is planned for the Union Square area of the Capitol grounds, the section of the west front encompassing the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial and Capitol reflecting pool. Matt Braynard, the head of data for the 2016 Trump campaign, announced the September gathering on Steve Bannon‚Äôs podcast, issuing a clarion call for his followers to seek justice for those charged in the riots two weeks before the inauguration of President Joe Biden. ‚ÄúAs we continue to raise the profile of these individuals, it makes it harder and harder for the left‚Äôs phony narrative about an insurrection to stick,‚Äù Braynard said on Bannon‚Äôs podcast released July 30. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going to define (the rally) is where it‚Äôs going to take place: We‚Äôre going back to the Capitol.‚Äù In a YouTube video, Braynard specifically asked rally attendees not to bring signs relitigating the 2020 election, including visible markers of support for specific political candidates.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The mayor asked residents Friday to stop watering their lawns and washing their cars immediately, saying water usage needed to be cut back because of the recent surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. The Orlando Utility Commission treats the city‚Äôs water with liquid oxygen, and supplies that ordinarily go toward water treatment have been diverted to hospitals for patients suffering from the coronavirus, Mayor Buddy Dyer said. ‚ÄúWe acknowledge that the No. 1 priority for the liquid oxygen should be for hospitals,‚Äù Dyer said at a news conference. Since the 1990s, the utility has used liquid oxygen to remove the slight discoloration and rotten-egg smell that is found naturally in Florida‚Äôs water supply. The city-owned utility typically goes through 10 trucks of liquid oxygen a week, but its supplier recently said it would be cut back to five to seven trucks a week to accommodate hospitals, said Linda Ferrone, OUC‚Äôs chief customer and marketing officer. About 40% of the utility commission‚Äôs potable water is used for irrigation, so any strains on the water supply will be greatly reduced if residents stop watering their lawns, washing their cars or using pressure washers, she said. On its website, the utility said residents should prepare to follow the conservation measures for at least two weeks.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The mayors of some of the state‚Äôs largest cities on Friday slammed Gov. Brian Kemp‚Äôs new order that aims to limit local efforts to curb the coronavirus pandemic. In an open letter, the mayors of Atlanta, Savannah, Athens-Clarke County and Augusta-Richmond County suggested the Republican governor was putting politics above public health, and they defended mask requirements. ‚ÄúWhile Governor Kemp may find it politically necessary to hew to the course of others who live in the shadow of the former president, we are more concerned with the health and livelihood of friends we see in the grocery store, at the schools where we bring our children each morning, and who we encounter as we head into work,‚Äù the four mayors ‚Äì all Democrats ‚Äì wrote in the letter. ‚ÄúThey overwhelmingly articulate support for the smart, tested public health measures that we have promoted for the past eighteen months.‚Äù An email to the governor‚Äôs office was not immediately returned. Amid a new surge of coronavirus cases that is straining hospitals, Kemp signed an executive order Thursday that says cities cannot require businesses and sports teams to enforce local pandemic restrictions. The governor presented the move as a way to protect businesses, saying some people in the state wanted to return to ‚Äúlockdown mode‚Äù and close businesses.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state‚Äôs surging COVID-19 cases have overwhelmed its contact tracing efforts. Hawaii News Now reports the Department of Health recently expanded its contact tracing team to 313 people from 269 but still struggles to keep up with the hundreds of people newly infected each day with the coronavirus. In the middle of July, department data showed contact tracers were able to reach about 90% of people who were infected. The latest data for the first week of August showed they were only able to reach 62%. ‚ÄúOne thing we‚Äôre seeing is there are a lot more people not picking up the phone,‚Äù said Dr. Sarah Kemble, the Hawaii state epidemiologist. ‚ÄúThat aside, we are seeing a record number of case counts in the state. Of course, that is a challenge to try to reach everyone.‚Äù A West Oahu hospital filled up Friday as the community faces a surge of COVID-19 cases. Jason Chang, CEO of The Queen‚Äôs Health Systems, said the Ewa Beach hospital has sent some patients to its sibling facility in downtown Honolulu. It has also asked staff from other parts of the Queen‚Äôs system to come help. The city has set up a triage tent outside the hospital with 25 cots. Chang said the hospital had 63 patients in its emergency room at one time, which is a crisis given the hospital only has 24 ER beds.\n\nIdaho\n\nNampa: Gov. Brad Little is directing $30 million to expand coronavirus testing in K-12 schools. The money is coming from emergency funds set aside by the Legislature to deal with unforeseen events, Little said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs critical now,‚Äù the Republican governor said this month. ‚ÄúThese school districts have got to have some resources.‚Äù House Republicans earlier this year killed a bill to use $40 million in federal coronavirus relief funds for voluntary testing in public and private schools. Little urged residents who haven‚Äôt been vaccinated to get their COVID-19 shots to help avoid disruptions at schools and the potential to overrun hospitals with coronavirus patients. He also said workers getting sick and schools shutting down because of coronavirus outbreaks and parents forced to stay home to care for kids and miss work could slow the state‚Äôs economic rebound. ‚ÄúOur workforce cannot afford to stay home because schools and day cares shut down due to outbreaks,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis threatens Idaho‚Äôs phenomenal economic success.‚Äù The Gem State has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the nation, with just over half of people ages 12 and up fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Masks will be required indoors throughout Cook County beginning Monday, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. The Cook County Department of Public Health issued the order Friday, saying it‚Äôs needed as new coronavirus cases continue to increase due to the more contagious delta variant. ‚ÄúWe are in a dangerous period, with the delta variant surging, during which we must return to previous remediation measures,‚Äù said Dr. Rachel Rubin, co-lead and senior medical officer of Cook County Department of Public Health. ‚ÄúWe have no choice but to mandate that people wear masks indoors to help contain this spread of the virus.‚Äù Illinois reported 4,904 new confirmed and probable coronavirus cases Friday. That pushed the state‚Äôs seven-day average of new cases above the peak of a COVID-19 surge this spring. The health department order applies to all multi-unit residential buildings and public places such as restaurants, stores, fitness clubs and public transportation in suburban Cook County. Chicago reinstated its indoor mask mandate effective Friday, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker has already said masks are required in all schools. The mandate applies to anyone over age 2. Businesses also are required to post signs saying masks are required.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Health officials have counted about 62,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines being tossed out in recent months across the state as the number of people seeking the shots has fallen drastically. That is about 1% of the some 6 million shots that have been given in Indiana since they first became available in December, but it‚Äôs a sign of the struggle that officials face in raising the vaccination rate. The state health department said doses can go unused by reaching their expiration date or a vial breaking, and officials knew eventually vaccine supply would outstrip demand. ‚ÄúWe are taking every action possible to minimize wastage, including urging providers to use doses with the nearest expiration dates first and encouraging Hoosiers to get vaccinated if they are eligible,‚Äù the agency said in a statement. ‚ÄúIn addition, we have been working with healthcare providers to allow them to order small batches of vaccine to have in their offices for patients and have increased the number of mobile vaccination clinics we are deploying across the state.‚Äù About 45% of Indiana residents are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, the 16th-lowest rate among the states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The city‚Äôs new mask mandate would impose the requirement on the University of Iowa‚Äôs campus, but the school will continue to strongly encourage but not require masks per guidance handed down from its own governing body, the state‚Äôs Board of Regents. Iowa City‚Äôs mandate announced Thursday evening goes against state law, said a spokesperson for Gov. Kim Reynolds, calling it ‚Äúnot enforceable.‚Äù May 2 guidance from the state‚Äôs Board of Regents says face masks are not required at the University of Iowa, Iowa State University or the University of Northern Iowa. Legally speaking, the regents could choose to make them required. The Board of Regents, as well as University of Iowa leadership, have not changed course on COVID-19 protocols ahead of the school year despite pressure from students and faculty to make them stronger, including mask and vaccine requirements or stronger incentivization. This month faculty and students sent a petition to the state‚Äôs board of Regents, and three faculty senate leaders sent a letter directly to President Barbara Wilson. Iowa City Mayor Bruce Teague declared a civil emergency and ordered a mask mandate late Thursday night. It applies to everyone within the limits of Iowa City when in public spaces where maintaining 6 feet of distance is not possible.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: Gov. Laura Kelly on Friday called for school districts to require masks and said she was contemplating an emergency declaration as hospitals buckle under the strain of increasingly young COVID-19 patients and as hundreds of students and staff become infected. ‚ÄúWe really want people to understand that this is no fooling around,‚Äù Kelly lamented while speaking at Saint Luke‚Äôs South Hospital in Overland Park, which is brimming with patients. ‚ÄúThis is an emergency.‚Äù The latest health department data shows 154 school clusters, with 1,889 cases. Kansas City, Kansas, Public Schools reported that 82 students and staff were infected in just the first nine days of the academic year, with 220 quarantined. The Turner school district began requiring masks after more than two dozen students were infected. The Wichita district, which is the state‚Äôs largest and isn‚Äôt requiring masks, has had ‚Äúa few‚Äù COVID-19 cases since classes started last week, said spokeswoman Susan Arensman. She said the district won‚Äôt provide weekly updates on cases until next month. The school board for Perry-Lecompton public schools, where 16 students are quarantining, imposed a mask mandate Thursday night. ‚ÄúThese are students that are not in school right now and cannot learn because of COVID,‚Äù Superintendent J.B. Elliott said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Top Republican lawmakers are promising to work with Gov. Andy Beshear to fight COVID-19 after a court ruling cleared the way for new limits on the Democratic governor‚Äôs emergency powers. Beshear‚Äôs allies said they‚Äôll be watching to see if his critics follow through. Kentucky Republicans cheered the state Supreme Court ruling Saturday that ordered a lower court to dissolve an injunction that for months had blocked the GOP-backed laws. It comes as the highly contagious delta variant drives up coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in the state. The court‚Äôs decision ‚Äúsignals it is time for the Republican leadership to publicly put forth their plan to protect the commonwealth from this pandemic and the deadly delta variant,‚Äù said Rep. Joni Jenkins and Sen. Morgan McGarvey, the top Democrats in the Kentucky House and Senate. ‚ÄúWe know what they don‚Äôt support; show us your plan.‚Äù The top legislative Republicans ‚Äì House Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers ‚Äì said lawmakers are ‚Äúready to work with the governor, as we have for nearly a year and a half, and address what is a very real public health crisis.‚Äù The GOP holds supermajorities in both chambers, and Republicans accused Beshear of taking a go-it-alone approach in dealing with the pandemic.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Stressed with too little staff and too many patients in an unrelenting COVID-19 resurgence, some hospitals are pressing insurance companies to ease up on requirements that can slow the transfer of recuperating patients to other facilities. At issue are ‚ÄúMedicare Advantage‚Äù plans that supplement government-funded Medicare coverage. These insurance policies require extensive reviews and sometimes consultations with other doctors before transfers to inpatient facilities providing skilled nursing care, rehabilitation or long-term care. Some of these patients are clearly ready to be moved to a non-hospital setting, but the bureaucracy has them stuck in badly needed beds, said Dr. Leslie Dean, of the Willis-Knighton system in northwest Louisiana. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost impossible for them to move these people along in a timely manner right now because of these delays with some of these insurance plans, unfortunately,‚Äù she said. The delays are critical as COVID-19 numbers grow, but the issue doesn‚Äôt just involve coronavirus patients. The paperwork also can slow transfers of Medicare Advantage-covered patients recuperating from a stroke, a heart attack, or some other illness or injury that will need post-hospital attention. Statewide hospitalizations have set records almost daily through most of August.\n\nMaine\n\nLewiston: The pandemic put the kibosh on most of the state‚Äôs bicentennial celebrations last year, but Maine proved Saturday that it‚Äôs never too late for an old-fashioned parade. Riding in a 3D-printed boat created at the University of Maine, Gov. Janet Mills served as grand marshal of the pandemic-delayed State of Maine Bicentennial Parade that snaked its way through the cities of Lewiston and Auburn. Mills said the state has persevered in the pandemic ‚Äúwith the grit and grace that have shaped our state for generations.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Bicentennial Parade is another opportunity to honor the resilience of Maine people, to remember our history and to recommit to creating a better and brighter future for us all,‚Äù the Democratic governor said in a statement. The parade was held against a backdrop of a surge in coronavirus infections caused by the delta variant and an ongoing debate over rules put in place by the Mills administration to protect residents. Protesters opposed to the governor‚Äôs vaccination mandate for health care workers gathered on a bridge between the cities before the parade started to make their point. Some exchanged words with the governor‚Äôs supporters. Later, dozens of protesters followed the boat in which the governor was riding and shouted at her. Mills ignored them and waved to the crowd.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan, a cancer survivor, said Sunday that he‚Äôs received a third shot of COVID-19 vaccine, and he‚Äôs urging the federal government to make booster shots available earlier than currently planned. Hogan appeared on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace the Nation‚Äù and said he received the additional dose this past week on the recommendation of his doctors. Asked if he wanted Marylanders to get the booster shot as soon as possible or wait the eight months that is currently recommended under federal guidelines, he said: ‚ÄúNo, we can‚Äôt wait that long.‚Äù He said he‚Äôs pushing the federal government to speed up the time frame for providing booster shots, and he‚Äôs pushing for full FDA approval of the vaccines. He said many of those who have refused to get the shots have cited the fact that the available vaccines do not have full approval but are being administered under an emergency use authorization. Federal officials announced last week a plan to start administering booster shots to the general public beginning the week of Sept. 20. The recommendations call for people to wait eight months from their second dose, which they said was a judgment call about when vaccine protection against severe illness might fall. Some public health experts have said a booster shot administered too early won‚Äôt be as effective.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Masks will be required for all indoor public places starting this Friday as the city moves to contain rising coronavirus infections blamed on the highly contagious delta variant, acting Mayor Kim Janey said late last week. Janey‚Äôs office issued a statement saying the mandate will apply to everyone age 2 and older who enters a business, retail shop, club, government office or any other public venue. Janey said the mask mandate was being imposed ahead of the arrival of more than 50,000 college students from across the nation and a return to classes for more than 50,000 Boston Public School students. ‚ÄúThere is nothing more important than Boston‚Äôs safe recovery, reopening, and renewal from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe know that masks work best when everyone wears one. Requiring masks indoors is a proactive public health measure to limit transmission of the delta variant, boost the public confidence in our businesses and venues, and protect the residents of our city who are too young for vaccination.‚Äù On Thursday, Gov. Charlie Baker said tens of thousands of state workers will need to prove they‚Äôre fully inoculated against COVID-19 by October or risk losing their jobs. Massachusetts remains one of the most vaccinated states in the nation, with more than 64% of residents fully inoculated against COVID-19.\n\nMichigan\n\nPontiac: The Michigan Court of Appeals has granted a new hearing to a man who claimed his rights were violated when he was sentenced for a crime by video, a common practice during the coronavirus pandemic. Michael Christian participated and spoke during a hearing last fall in Oakland County court and had a lawyer present. But the appeals court still found problems. ‚ÄúAt no point during the hearing did the trial court obtain a waiver of defendant‚Äôs right to be physically present in the courtroom for sentencing,‚Äù judges Jane Markey and Brock Swartzle said in a 2-1 opinion Thursday. Christian, 38, was convicted of uttering and publishing, a crime typically related to forging documents, and sentenced to a minimum of a year in prison. Judge Michael Riordan disagreed with the majority, saying Christian failed to show that the error ‚Äúaffected substantial rights.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe has not shown or even argued, for example, that he would have received a lighter sentence if he was physically present,‚Äù Riordan said. Christian remains in prison for other unrelated crimes in Macomb County.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: St. Cloud State University and St. Cloud Technical & Community College, alongside all Minnesota state colleges and universities, will mandate COVID-19 vaccination or frequent coronavirus testing for certain student groups, according to a memo from Chancellor Devinder Malhotra. The memo, sent Wednesday to Minnesota State‚Äôs Leadership Council, said the system‚Äôs schools would require vaccination attestation for ‚Äúspecific student groups or populations that are in settings where there is close and frequent contact with others.‚Äù That includes students living in residence facilities run by the school system, those participating in intercollegiate athletics, and those required to by clinical or internship sites. Additionally, the memo said, colleges and universities could include other extracurriculars that pose difficulties for social distancing. As of Friday, the technical and community college hadn‚Äôt had conversations about student groups, though the school is limiting large group gatherings. Vice President of Administration Lori Kloos said extracurricular activities are being kept to a minimum but may continue in different ways, such as meeting outside or virtually.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: Two concert venues are now requiring guests to provide proof they‚Äôve been vaccinated against COVID-19 or show negative coronavirus test results. The Lyric and Proud Larry‚Äôs in Oxford announced last week that they would implement the requirements, The Oxford Eagle reports. Lyric general manager Lindsay Dillon-Maginnis said the regulations have been a trend nationwide for music festivals. ‚ÄúPromoters who have been in our line of work, we could see the storm coming,‚Äù Dillon-Maginnis told the paper. Not every venue in Mississippi is following suit. Entertainer Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit announced Friday that they would pull out of a show at the Brandon Amphitheater scheduled for October. Isbell said the venue would not require that attendees show proof of vaccination or a negative test. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the powers that be were not willing to comply with the band‚Äôs updated Health and Safety standards,‚Äù a statement from Southeastern Records said. Dillon-Maginnis said there has been ‚Äúoverwhelmingly large majority of support‚Äù for the policy, with less than 1% of ticket holders requesting a refund. ‚ÄúI think what people see online or what you see in comments is vitriolic or negative,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut with those people, if you dig deeper, have no connection to the Lyric or Oxford or even Mississippi.‚Äù\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: New COVID-19 hospital admissions are reaching winter surge levels in the city, and southeast Missouri hospitals are under strain due to a surge in coronavirus cases and a rise in deaths. On Thursday, hospitals in St. Louis reported admitting 100 new patients with COVID-19 ‚Äì the most since Jan. 16, according to the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force. A total of 585 people were hospitalized, including 25 children, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Twelve of those children are younger than 12 and not yet eligible for vaccines. Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Southeast Hospital and Saint Francis Medical Center in Cape Girardeau has increased by more than 50% in the past week and a half, according to data released Thursday by both facilities. Saint Francis, which reopened its COVID-19 care unit last week, reported 39 coronavirus inpatients as of early Thursday afternoon, up from 25 just 10 days ago. At Southeast Hospital, the number of COVID-19 inpatients increased from 22 about 10 days ago to 32 as of Thursday morning, the Southeast Missourian reports. Statewide, the death toll from the rapidly spreading delta variant continues to rise in Missouri, with July shaping up to be an even deadlier month than earlier reported.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: While many large companies across the U.S. have announced that COVID-19 vaccines will be required for their employees to return to work in person, Montana stands alone in banning such mandates. Under a new law passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature earlier this year, requiring vaccines as a condition for employment is deemed ‚Äúdiscrimination‚Äù and a violation of the state‚Äôs human rights laws. Montana is the only state in the U.S. with a law like this for private employers, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy. The law has raised concern among employers across the state as Montana struggles with a rise in COVID-19 cases that is once again straining the state‚Äôs health care system. Pushback swelled last week when physicians called on the Legislature to reverse the law. ‚ÄúThis is against everything we‚Äôve ever known or believed about public health,‚Äù said Dr. Pamela Cutler, president of the Montana Medical Association. ‚ÄúI believe it‚Äôs a travesty now, and it needs to be fixed so that we can make our offices safe for patients and our co-workers.‚Äù GOP lawmakers who supported the bill in the Legislature said it was needed in response to employers ‚Äúcoercing‚Äù employees to get vaccinations under threat of termination.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Nebraska Medical Center on Friday announced it‚Äôs reducing inpatient surgeries at the Omaha hospital because of the rise in COVID-19 cases. The change will take effect Aug. 30, Nebraska Medicine spokesman Taylor Wilson said in a news release. Wilson said inpatient surgeries likely will be limited through October. Nebraska Medicine is not limiting surgeries at Bellevue Medical Center or any other outpatient surgery clinics. Wilson said the rise in coronavirus patients, who need extra care and resources, strained Nebraska Medical Center. On top of that, he said, Nebraska is facing a nursing shortage. Nebraskans can help to ease the strain on hospitals by getting vaccinated against COVID-19, Wilson said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Half of all eligible residents are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, pushing the state closer to the national inoculation rate of about 60% for all people 12 and older, state health officials said. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak said Friday that the 50% mark for residents 12 and up who are now fully vaccinated is an ‚Äúincredible milestone to reach.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe know there is more work to be done and we will remain focused on promoting vaccine opportunities throughout the state,‚Äù he said in a statement. Among those 12 and older, 60.5% have initiated vaccination, receiving at least one dose of vaccine, officials said. Nationally, 59.8% of that age group was fully vaccinated, and 70.4% had received the first of two shots as of Thursday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nevada‚Äôs 14-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases and positivity rate both declined through the week after a steady rise began in early June. At an emergency meeting Friday, the state Board of Health approved a vaccine mandate plan for Nevada‚Äôs public colleges and universities scheduled to take effect Nov. 1. The requirement will not affect enrollment until the spring semester.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state House of Representatives will begin holding committee meetings on retained bills this week, without the option to participate remotely that existed during much of the coronavirus pandemic. In the calendar published Friday, House Speaker Sherman Packard reminded lawmakers that the emergency order allowing public bodies to meet remotely without a physical quorum present in the same location expired when the governor lifted the state of emergency June 11. That means House committees meeting to discuss bills that were set aside for more work must meet in person at the Legislative Office Building, which has reopened to the public. Packard said dozens of additional air purification units have been set up throughout the office building and Statehouse, and each meeting room will have air treatment that meets or exceeds federal health guidelines for office buildings. Masks will be encouraged but not required.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A group of parents wants Gov. Phil Murphy to remove the ban on virtual learning for the 2021-22 school year and provide a permanent remote learning option for K-12 schools. A change.org petition started by New Jersey Parents for Virtual Choice has garnered more than 17,000 signatures. The parents are driven by a variety of reasons, some related to health and safety concerns due to the coronavirus and the highly transmissible delta variant, said group spokesperson Karen Strauss. Some parents want to retain the virtual learning option from last year because their children excelled, she said. The petition asks Murphy to let K-12 schools continue to offer virtual learning for parents who want it and to create a permanent virtual learning option by approving free virtual-only public or charter schools. It also asks Murphy to meet with the group. ‚ÄúNew Jersey needs to catch up,‚Äù Strauss said, referring to school systems in other states that offer virtual learning options. Strauss said she wants a virtual option for her 5-year-old son, who has asthma and high-functioning autism. She said he thrived during remote learning last year even though it took some getting used to, but her primary consideration is his health. ‚ÄúWe already lost someone to COVID. I‚Äôm not risking him getting sick,‚Äù she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: About 150 people protested in front of the state Capitol on Friday, demanding an end to vaccine mandates for health care workers. Many protesters identified themselves as hospital workers ‚Äì nurses, nursing assistants and clerical workers. Other attendees included correctional officers, retirees and children of health care workers. A state mandate requires nurses and other workers in high-risk environments to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and some hospitals have their own mandates. ‚ÄúI believe the vaccine is harmful,‚Äù said practical nurse Katrina Philpot, who was picketing along the road outside the Capitol complex with a sign that read: ‚ÄúHealthcare workers deserve rights.‚Äù Philpot said the hospital where she works in Rio Rancho is requiring her to be vaccinated by Aug. 27 or be fired. She fears she won‚Äôt qualify for medical or religious exemptions to the mandate. State employees, including prison guards, are required to get COVID-19 shots or submit to weekly testing. At least one prison guard has sued the state over the mandate. New Mexico has outpaced neighboring states when it comes to getting people vaccinated. About two-thirds of residents 18 and up have been fully inoculated, but state health officials have warned that evidence shows vaccinated people can still get infected and spread the virus.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city‚Äôs public schools will require COVID-19 shots for student-athletes and coaches participating in ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù sports including football, volleyball, basketball, wrestling, lacrosse, rugby and bowling, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday. The students and coaches will have to get at least one dose of vaccine before the start of competitive play, de Blasio said on radio station WNYC. Bowling, while not a contact sport like football or wrestling, is on the list because it is indoors, de Blasio said. Masks will be required for all students and staff when school starts Sept. 13, but while the mayor has urged all New Yorkers who are eligible for COVID-19 shots to get them, vaccination is not required either for school staff or for students over age 12. Asked about the possibility of requiring public school teachers to be vaccinated, de Blasio said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre actively looking right now at different actions we could take.‚Äù\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Children now must get approval from a parent before receiving the current COVID-19 vaccine available to them under legislation that Gov. Roy Cooper signed into law Friday. The written consent requirement is contained in a broader measure that largely expands the medications or immunizations, including vaccines, that pharmacists trained to deliver shots can administer to consumers. It comes even as the U.S. and North Carolina see a marked rise in coronavirus cases due to a highly contagious variant. The measure, which received nearly unanimous support in the Republican-controlled General Assembly, also states that trained pharmacy technicians and interns can administer a COVID-19 or flu vaccine under a pharmacist‚Äôs supervision. ‚ÄúThis important legislation will help our state administer COVID-19 vaccines more quickly and efficiently,‚Äù Cooper, a Democrat, said in a news release announcing the bill signing. Permission from a parent or guardian applies immediately to vaccines authorized by federal regulators for emergency use ‚Äì such as the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer ‚Äì and administered by any health care provider. State law had given minors the ability on their own to be treated for certain health issues, including communicable diseases.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Amid a COVID-19 resurgence, advocates are calling on nursing homes to require that all staff members get vaccinated, and a nonprofit tracking the latest data says there haven‚Äôt been enough workers getting on board. The latest COVID-19 dashboard from AARP shows that only 24% of senior care facilities in North Dakota have met the industry target of having at least 75% of their staffs inoculated against the disease. Josh Askvig, state director of AARP North Dakota, said experts don‚Äôt want to go back to last fall, when the state saw some of the highest coronavirus death rates among patients. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs concerning right now is as new variants are emerging, facilities cannot let preventable problems be repeated,‚Äù Askvig said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to increase vaccinations, and we‚Äôve got to do it now.‚Äù The latest AARP dashboard also shows nearly 12% of North Dakota nursing homes lack personal protective equipment to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. Askvig said the state should help to ensure they have enough supplies. As for the vaccinations, he said facilities need to step up in the area. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got the resources through the different relief funding to get it done,‚Äù Askvig said. ‚ÄúAnd so we‚Äôre encouraging everyone eligible for the vaccine to get vaccinated.‚Äù\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: While COVID-19 cases have reportedly risen nationally among children, that trend has yet to show up locally. Instead, another common virus has squeezed Nationwide Children‚Äôs Hospital in recent weeks: The pediatric hospital is dealing with a rise in cases of respiratory syncytial virus, which usually begins circulating more in the fall rather than late summer. It‚Äôs hard to pinpoint exactly why RSV is showing up again now, but the coronavirus pandemic is likely the cause, said Dr. Mike Patrick, an emergency department physician at Nationwide Children‚Äôs. With everyone masking up, staying home and keeping their distance, RSV didn‚Äôt spread as easily in 2020. Now that more families are getting out and doing things, and kids are returning to school and day care, RSV is able to spread, Patrick said. ‚ÄúNo one knows for certain what is driving this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut being isolated and behind masks and then suddenly reintroducing people together really fuels the spread of these viral illnesses.‚Äù The spike in RSV cases is similar to what Nationwide Children‚Äôs usually sees at its peak in winter, Patrick said. But Patrick said he worries whether COVID-19 cases could also start showing up more in kids seeking treatment at Nationwide Children‚Äôs.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt is criticizing both a northeast Oklahoma school district that adopted a mask mandate and President Joe Biden over comments that the state‚Äôs ban on school mask requirements ban may violate a coronavirus aid package for schools. The Republican governor and state Attorney General John O‚ÄôConnor released a joint statement Thursday criticizing the Hulbert school district for its mask requirement. ‚ÄúIt is disappointing that one school district has chosen to openly violate a state law that was supported by 80 percent of the Legislature,‚Äù Stitt said in the statement. The district‚Äôs policy includes an opt-out option for medical reasons. Earlier this month Stitt praised two Oklahoma City school districts for mask mandates that included opt-out options for medical, religious or personal reasons. O‚ÄôConnor said that the law is constitutional and that the state is fighting a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality. Stitt‚Äôs criticism of Biden comes after U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in letters to him and state school Superintendent Joy Hofmeister on Wednesday that the school mask ban may violate the American Rescue Plan that provided $123 billion to the nation‚Äôs schools to help them return to the classroom.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Managers from a senior living facility say a video posted to social media by a recruiter for the company saying she would hire unvaccinated health care workers does not reflect the company‚Äôs views. Shayna Hall, a recruiter for Salem-based Bonaventure Senior Living, a senior assisted living community with locations in Oregon, Washington and Colorado, posted the video on TikTok last month, as first reported by the Salem Reporter. In the video, which has been deleted from Hall‚Äôs account but can still be found on other posters‚Äô accounts, Hall says she came across medical workers posting on TikTok about being fired or forced out of their jobs because they refuse to get a ‚Äúbrand new vaccine.‚Äù ‚ÄúI just wanted to tell you if you are a nurse, a caregiver, a med tech, and you now need a new job because of this, hit me up, I‚Äôll hire you,‚Äù she says in the video. ‚ÄúI need nurses, caregivers, med techs in Washington, Colorado and Oregon. Take your pick.‚Äù While the COVID-19 vaccines are new, the research behind them is not. Scientists around the world have been working on vaccines for the SARS coronavirus for more 20 years. Hall‚Äôs video swiftly ignited controversy online. Many have decried the company‚Äôs willingness to hire unvaccinated employees to serve elderly and high-risk residents.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state‚Äôs unemployment rate dropped to a new post-pandemic low in July, and the labor force shrank, as payrolls jumped by nearly 29,000, according to figures released Friday. Pennsylvania‚Äôs unemployment rate dropped three-tenths of a percentage point to 6.6% from June‚Äôs adjusted rate, the state Department of Labor and Industry said. The national rate was 5.4% in July, more than a point below Pennsylvania‚Äôs. The figures come out as the federal government prepares to end supplemental payments of $300 a week to people who lost jobs or self-employment income during the pandemic. The $300 payments last through the week ending Sept. 3. In a survey of households, the labor force shrank by 16,000 in July, closer to 6.3 million. However, the number of employed grew slightly, while the number of unemployed slid by 19,000. The state hit a record-high labor force of almost 6.6 million just before the pandemic hit. In a separate survey of employers, payrolls grew in July by 28,800, to above 5.7 million. The state has regained about 65% of the 1.1 million jobs lost in the pandemic. It hit a record high for payrolls of 6.1 million just before the pandemic hit, according to state figures. The leisure and hospitality sector led all gainers, adding 16,000 jobs.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city‚Äôs downtown arts festival has been canceled for the second year in a row amid rising cases of COVID-19, city officials announced Friday. PVDFest, a weekend festival that typically draws more 100,000 people to downtown Providence, was scheduled to make its comeback Sept. 25-26. But officials said it would be unsafe to continue amid high levels of coronavirus transmission. Mayor Jorge Elorza said the decision was made ‚Äúafter carefully considering the increased spread of the delta variant.‚Äù ‚ÄúTogether we can beat this virus and return to dancing and celebrating together downtown next year,‚Äù Elorza said in a statement. Although the downtown event is canceled, smaller outdoor art programs affiliated with the festival will continue in the coming weeks. Officials said face masks will be strongly recommended. Rhode Island is averaging about 310 new COVID-19 cases a day, up from about 196 a day two weeks ago. The festival was started in 2015 and has featured more than 5,000 artists and performers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state‚Äôs health agency became the latest group Friday to ask lawmakers to make it clear that school districts can require students to wear masks without losing state budget money or facing any other penalties. The General Assembly put the mask ban item into the budget in early June when South Carolina was seeing an average of 150 COVID-19 cases a day. Ten weeks later, the state is seeing about 3,520 new cases each day. And that dire new case average comes before about 700,000 public school students completed their first week back in classrooms. Of the more than 5,200 new coronavirus cases reported Friday, more than 500 were in children 10 or younger. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control Board voted unanimously Friday to ask the state House and Senate to come back in special session to ‚Äúprovide local authority for mask mandates.‚Äù They joined the Republican state education superintendent, House Democrats, teacher groups, an association of school board members, a group of two Democratic and two Republican state senators, several school boards, and other groups that have asked lawmakers to reconsider the mask ban.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Friday that she is planning to focus on water, sewer and broadband infrastructure projects as the state plans to spend nearly $1 billion in federal funds meant to help towns and cities recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The state government is readying to receive $974.5 million from the federal government over the next year and a half. Over the course of the pandemic, South Dakota has been alloted more than $4.8 billion in federal relief funds ‚Äì a windfall that nearly matches the state‚Äôs annual budget. Under the American Rescue Plan Act passed by Congress, state and local governments must use the funds to respond to COVID-19. They can use the money for public health programs, addressing the financial fallout of the pandemic, replacing lost revenues, paying for essential workers, or infrastructure. The Republiacn governor said the state has ‚Äúbroad flexibility‚Äù in using the money. Meanwhile, daily coronavirus cases across the state on Friday topped 300 for the first time in more than six months as a fresh pandemic wave appeared to build. In the past two weeks, the state has seen case counts spike by 270%, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. However, the number of cases per capita in that time has remained one of the lowest in the country.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Bluff City teens have been leading the state‚Äôs surge of recent COVID-19 vaccinations. The 15-19 age group in the Memphis region showed the greatest growth of any age group across the state‚Äôs eight regions from late July through last week, according to a new study by researchers at the Department of Health Policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Vanderbilt School of Medicine. Vaccinations among residents ages 12-14 also grew, according to the study. The increase in vaccinations comes as infections and hospitalizations surged through July and August, driven by the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The burden of new COVID-19 cases across the state is among the Tennessee‚Äôs younger populations, who are also less likely to be inoculated, researchers concluded. Findings show infections have grown the most among people in their early 20s. The two western Tennessee regions saw the greatest vaccination growth, according to the study, though each of the eight regions in the state saw growth in vaccinations beginning in late July. The state‚Äôs metropolitan areas of Nashville, Knoxville and Memphis have the highest vaccination rates in nearly all age groups, the researchers wrote. The lowest rates are among the Upper Cumberland region of Cookeville and surrounding counties.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The lieutenant governor blamed rising hospitalization and death rates from COVID-19 on unvaccinated Black people in comments that were quickly denounced as racist. Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick made the remarks Thursday night on a Fox News segment in response to question about the latest coronavirus surge in Texas, which is seeing its highest hospitalization rates since January. ‚ÄúThe biggest group in most states are African Americans who have not been vaccinated,‚Äù Patrick said. He did not change course Friday, saying that ‚ÄúDemocrat social media trolls‚Äù misstated facts and that he had used state data in his assertions. But statistics from the Texas Department of State Health Services don‚Äôt back that. Black people ‚Äì who make up about 12% of Texas‚Äô population ‚Äì accounted for about 15% of total COVID-19 cases and just more than 10% of deaths. Patrick also told Fox News that Democrats were to blame for low vaccination rates among Black people, who frequently support that party, even though he believes Republicans should persuade more people to get their shots, too. But he also tiptoed around that issue, which has been sensitive for the GOP. About 8% of Texans who have been fully vaccinated are Black, according to state data. The resulting percentage of Black people who‚Äôve been inoculated is unclear.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The mayor announced Friday that she had issued a mask order in the city‚Äôs K-12 schools as the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus spreads. Mayor Erin Mendenhall said she used her emergency powers to issue the order and plans to work with health officials to determine when it can be lifted. ‚ÄúAs Mayor it is my responsibility to do everything I can to keep our City, and our school district, from going down the tragic and dangerous path many others are already on,‚Äù Mendenhall, a Democrat, said in a statement. The order came a week after the Salt Lake County Council overturned a school mask order for kids under 12 that the county‚Äôs top health official issued. Mendenhall said the majority of board members had privately told her they feared retaliation and urged her to issue the order. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, and despite all the evidence that masks protect children and the adults who care for them, this issue has become politicized to the point that elected bodies across the country, and in the State of Utah, worry about retaliation if they take stand as an organization,‚Äù she wrote. Masks were required in classrooms last year, but under a new state law, school mask mandates are banned. Local health departments can issue a rule with the support of elected county leaders, but anti-mask advocates have been vocal in their opposition.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state and Vermont Legal Aid have reached a settlement over the end of a hotel voucher program for some of the homeless population during the pandemic, the Vermont Agency of Human Services and the legal services group announced Friday. Under the settlement, eligibility for the general assistance emergency housing program will be expanded for people with disabilities, and a formal process will be created for applicants whose health or welfare would be at risk due to their disability if they were unsheltered, the groups said. Last year Vermont expanded eligibility for the program during the pandemic to allow more people to stay temporarily in hotels and motels. It ended the program for some in July and gave $2,500 checks to those who were no longer eligible. Vermont Legal Aid sued, and a judge signed an agreement extending the emergency housing for some people to show they had a disability and could remain eligible. ‚ÄúPeople with disabilities who are experiencing homelessness will now be able to access GA benefits even if they are able to work,‚Äù Vermont Legal Aid staff attorney Jessica Radbord said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe believe this will protect some truly vulnerable members of our community from suffering negative health consequences as a result of being unsheltered.‚Äù\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: More than 200 University of Virginia students who didn‚Äôt comply with the school‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine requirement have been disenrolled ahead of the fall semester. The move affected 238 students, including 49 students who were enrolled in fall courses, The Virginian-Pilot reports. That may mean that ‚Äúa good number‚Äù of the remaining students ‚Äúmay not have been planning to return to the university this fall at all,‚Äù university spokesperson Brian Coy said. The students were disenrolled after ‚Äúreceiving multiple reminders via email, text, phone calls, calls to parents that they were out of compliance,‚Äù Coy said. They can reenroll if they comply with the vaccine requirement or file an exemption by Wednesday. About 96.6% of students have been vaccinated against COVID-19, according to a news release. The university granted 335 permanent vaccine waivers for students with religious or medical exemptions. The university also granted 184 temporary vaccine waivers for students who couldn‚Äôt get inoculated but intend to get a COVID-19 shot once on campus. Exempt students must be tested weekly for the coronavirus and wear a mask in indoor and outdoor common spaces.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Gov. Jay Inslee‚Äôs announcement of mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for state workers comes at a time when the state ferry system is experiencing a severe staffing shortage. KUOW reports that in an Aug. 13 notice, Washington State Ferries Chief of Staff Nicole McIntosh said there were ‚Äúan unprecedented 91 relief requests yesterday.‚Äù She thanked the crew members who helped cover for their absent colleagues. In response to the shortage, the agency canceled sailings and went from two ferries on the Edmonds-Kingston and Clinton-Mukilteo routes to one. Washington State Ferries spokesperson Ian Sterling said staffing issues have been a chronic problem throughout the pandemic, but that week was ‚Äúas bad as it‚Äôs been, due to the labor shortage, due to people out with active COVID or having to quarantine.‚Äù Capt. Dan Twohig, the regional representative of the International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, one of several unions representing ferry service workers, said last week‚Äôs staff shortages were an anomaly. A coalition of unions representing Washington State Ferries employees started bargaining with state officials last week over the implementation of the vaccine mandate. Twohig said the unions agree that the mandate is legal and will go forward.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Friday launched a second round of vaccination sweepstakes, this time with prizes aimed at enticing younger residents to sign up for COVID-19 shots as the pandemic continues to worsen. The first of six weekly drawings will be held Aug. 31. Registration opens Monday. All residents must register again for the new drawings, even if they were registered for the first series of prizes earlier this summer, Justice said at a news conference. The prizes include season ticket packages to West Virginia University and Marshall sporting events, ski lift tickets, and a 10-year supply of free gas. Also being given away each week will be a $150,000 dream wedding, a luxury sports car, a custom fishing boat, ATVs or high-end lawnmowers, and college scholarships for residents ages 12 to 25. The governor‚Äôs announcement came as the number of people hospitalized statewide from COVID-19 reached 447, the most since late January. More than 1,350 coronavirus cases had been reported statewide in the prior two days alone. Cases of the more contagious delta variant of the virus are now present in at least 46 of the state‚Äôs 55 counties, according to health department data.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOneida: At least three American Indian tribes in the state will put cash in the pockets of their members and employees to get COVID-19 shots. The Oneida, Menominee and Ho-Chunk tribes are offering a $500 incentive for vaccinations. The offer includes those who have already been inoculated. For the Menominee Nation, members ages 12 and older as well as tribal employees who are fully vaccinated on or before Oct. 31 are eligible. Oneida tribal members and employees have until Sept. 30 to show proof of their vaccination to receive the $500. Ho-Chunk Nation members have until Nov. 1 to provide proof. ‚ÄúWe know that once we can get at least 75% of our community vaccinated, we‚Äôre going to be able to have that level of safety that we can,‚Äù said Debbie Danforth, director of the Oneida Nation Division of Health. So far, Danforth said about 5,000 tribal members, or about 30%, have been vaccinated, WLUK-TV reports. The rate for employees is about 50%. Marlon Skenandore, who had COVID-19 last year and is still dealing with its effects, said the incentive is not swaying his decision on whether to get vaccinated. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just hesitant about the FDA not approving it and not going through its normal procedure, so I‚Äôm on the fence, but I‚Äôm leaning towards getting it,‚Äù he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: Grand Teton National Park had its busiest month on record in July. July is almost always the busiest month for tourism in the park in northwestern Wyoming. In July 2021, almost 830,000 people visited, park officials said in a statement. That was up from 796,000 in July 2018, the second-busiest month in records dating to 1979. July was the first time Grand Teton topped 800,000 visitors in a month. Visitation was up almost 10% compared to July 2020, when the park had just reopened after being mostly closed by the coronavirus pandemic. Accompanying the tourism surge, camping was up 2.7%, backcountry camping was up 15%, and trail use was up 21% in July 2021 compared to July 2019. Researchers this summer have been studying the relationship between the number of vehicles entering Grand Teton and visitor traffic at key areas of the park, park officials said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/23"}]}

Alex Douglas, AKA The Naked Narrator, said women would often tell him that they ‚Äúlove‚Äù getting voice notes from him on dating apps. He ‚Äúran with the idea‚Äù and set up his Naked Narrator WhatsApp service, which sees him sending personalised saucy voice notes to customers based on up to three words they send to him, said the outlet.

The doctor's office called afterward with shocking news: If Stelly wanted to live to age 30, he was told, he'd need a pacemaker.\n\nStelly knew it would be the end of his baseball dream, but he made a quick decision. \"I did what the doctor said,\" he recalls. \"I trusted him.\"\n\nMonths after the surgery, local news outlets reported that the Louisiana cardiologist, Mehmood Patel, was being investigated for performing unnecessary surgeries. Stelly had another doctor review his case. Then another. And another. They all agreed: He needed blood pressure medication, but he never needed the pacemaker.\n\nToday, Patel is in prison, convicted of billing Medicare for dozens of unnecessary heart procedures. Stelly, now 34, still has the pacemaker ‚Äì but the doctors shut it off years ago.\n\n\"Baseball was my life, and he took that away,\" Stelly says. \"For nothing.\"\n\nTens of thousands of times each year, patients are wheeled into the nation's operating rooms for surgery that isn't necessary, a USA TODAY review of government records and medical databases finds. Some, such as Stelly, fall victim to predators who enrich themselves by bilking insurers for operations that are not medically justified. Even more turn to doctors who simply lack the competence or training to recognize when a surgical procedure can be avoided, either because the medical facts don't warrant it or because there are non-surgical treatments that would better serve the patient.\n\nThe scope and toll of the problem are enormous, yet it remains largely hidden. Public attention has been limited to a few sensational cases, typically involving doctors who put cardiac stents in patients who didn't need them.\n\nIn fact, unnecessary surgeries might account for 10% to 20% of all operations in some specialties, including a wide range of cardiac procedures ‚Äî not only stents, but also angioplasty and pacemaker implants ‚Äî as well as many spinal surgeries. Knee replacements, hysterectomies, and cesarean sections are among the other surgical procedures performed more often than needed, according to a review of in-depth studies and data generated by both government and academic sources.\n\nSince 2005, more than 1,000 doctors have made payments to settle or close malpractice claims in surgical cases that involved allegations of unnecessary or inappropriate procedures, according to a USA TODAY analysis of the U.S. government's National Practitioner Data Bank public use file, which tracks the suits. About half the doctors' payments involved allegations of serious permanent injury or death, and many of the cases involved multiple plaintiffs, suggesting many hundreds, if not thousands, of victims.\n\nThose malpractice cases, which can be settled with no admission of wrongdoing, account for no more than a fraction of cases in which people got surgery that wasn't needed, and there's no way to know the total number. In an era when many hospitals are required to report every infection and surgical error, neither the federal government nor the states track unnecessary surgeries or their consequences, which can include surgery-related infections or other complications ‚Äî a nicked nerve or artery, for example ‚Äî that can cause severe disability, even death.\n\n\"It's a very serious issue, (and) there really hasn't been a movement to address it,\" says Lucian Leape, a former surgeon and professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. Leape, a renowned patient safety expert who began studying unnecessary surgery after a 1974 congressional report estimated that there were 2.4 million cases a year, killing nearly 12,000 patients.\n\nLeape's take today? \"Things haven't changed very much.\"\n\nEXPENSIVE AND UNSEEN\n\nThe costs of unnecessary surgeries touch consumers and taxpayers in ways most never imagine. Medicare, Medicaid and their private insurance counterparts spend billions of dollars on operations that shouldn't be done, draining health care dollars that could go to far better use.\n\nAbout 10% of all spinal fusions paid for by Medicare in 2011 were not necessary, either because there was no medical basis for them or because doctors did not follow standards of care by exploring non-surgical treatments, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from Medicare program audits. That translates to $157 million in improper payments, just for spinal surgeries in a single year.\n\nOnly the most egregious claims of unnecessary surgery make headlines: The Maryland cardiologist sentenced in 2011 on charges that he put cardiac stents in more than 100 patients who didn't require them; or the lawsuit filed this year by nearly 100 patients alleging that a Cincinnati doctor did needless spinal surgeries to implant bone-grafting devices.\n\nFar more often, cases go unnoticed.\n\nThe procedures are notoriously tough to identify, even for the victims. If, for example, someone has an unnecessary knee replacement, that person might never know that the pain could have been relieved just as effectively with physical therapy or a less invasive procedure. The symptoms are gone, so the patient suspects nothing.\n\n\"If we ever learn about it at all, it's only after the fact, if something goes wrong and the patient sees another doctor, or if Medicare or someone else comes in retroactively and does an audit,\" says Rosemary Gibson, an authority on patient safety and author of The Treatment Trap, a book on unnecessary care. \"The system, in my opinion, doesn't want to know about this problem.\"\n\nAcademic studies have discovered high rates of unnecessary surgery, particularly in spinal and cardiac operations.\n\nA 2011 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association reviewed records for 112,000 patients who had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), a pacemaker-like device that corrects heartbeat irregularities. In 22.5% of the cases, researchers found no medical evidence to support installing the devices.\n\nAnother 2011 study, in the journal Surgical Neurology International, evaluated 274 patients with neck and back complaints over a one-year period: More than 17% had been told they needed surgery but had no neurological or radiographic findings that indicated an operation was necessary.\n\n\"I am seeing more and more patients who are told to have operations they don't need,\" says the spinal study's author, Nancy Epstein, a neurosurgeon and chief of Neurosurgical Spine and Education at Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y.\n\n\"If patients have operations they don't need, they risk having major problems ‚Äî infections, paralysis, heart attacks, strokes,\" Epstein says. Yet she notes that virtually no data are collected on complications or patient injuries from unnecessary surgery. \"Nobody reports the complications, so finding the real morbidity and mortality of these procedures is extremely difficult.\"\n\nWALKING WOUNDED\n\nWillie Boudry, a construction worker, was referred to Eric Scheffey by his company's insurer after he slipped and wrenched his back carrying pipe on a muddy job in 2002.\n\nBoudry, now 53, never knew the neurosurgeon had recently come off probation by the state medical board for doing unnecessary surgeries. Nor did he know Scheffey faced scores of malpractice claims and was sanctioned previously in connection with cocaine use. He knew only what Scheffey told him: He needed surgery.\n\nScheffey fused Boudry's spine in multiple places, installing screws and other hardware, but the pain worsened. By the time Boudry limped in to consult another neurosurgeon, Scheffey had been suspended again, charged with more unnecessary surgeries in a case that later got his license revoked for good.\n\nBoudry's new surgeon removed the screws and hardware ‚Äî he said they weren't needed. But Boudry is permanently disabled, finished as a construction worker. He's in a subsidized assisted living complex and offsets his rent by driving a resident shuttle a few hours a day.\n\nBoudry's surgery was \"unnecessary and quite extensive,\" and Scheffey \"did it poorly,\" according to an affidavit from another neurosurgeon Boudry hired as an expert for a malpractice suit he filed. Much of his settlement went to paying back the worker's compensation he received.\n\n\"I can't make real money; I'm in chronic pain, so I can't even drive for long,\" Boudry says. \"I refuse to be a cripple. ‚Ä¶ I taught myself to walk without a cane and don't take painkillers. But I struggle with depression, anxiety. It's been hard.\"\n\nA MATTER OF MONEY, MOSTLY\n\nThere are three broad categories of unnecessary surgery: the immoral, the incompetent and the indifferent.\n\nDoctors who perform needless operations to enrich themselves are the public face of the problem. Lured by the millions of dollars that can be made by billing Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers for expensive procedures that aren't necessary, they've become a top target of investigators who consider this type of health care fraud to be particularly insidious.\n\n\"There's a health and safety aspect ‚Ä¶ and we take that very seriously,\" says Joseph Campbell, the FBI's deputy assistant director for criminal investigations.\n\nCases are tough to identify, he says. Surgeons might draw attention if they perform certain procedures at especially high rates. But \"we have to determine whether the surgery was necessary, and if it was unnecessary, was it incompetence, just mistakes, or was there something nefarious.\"\n\nThe challenge gets even more daunting in court, where questions of medical necessity often boil down to a matter of opinion, with dueling assessments from each side's experts.\n\n\"We look for cases where, based on an examination of records and claims data, the (surgery) numbers are so out of whack with a physician's peer group that it counters that presumption that we typically give a doctor\" to make judgment calls, says Randy Harwell, civil division chief for the U.S. attorney in central Florida. \"It's quite difficult in a medical necessity case to get to a place where all those things come together ‚Ä¶ to paint a picture where (the doctor) is actually sinister.\"\n\nIn most cases of unnecessary surgery, there is no sinister character ‚Äî or criminal intent. The driving factors are more complex and more subtle.\n\n\"I think there are a very small percent of doctors who are crooked, maybe 1 or 2%,\" says John Santa, a physician and former health system administrator who became director of the Consumer Reports Health Ratings Center in 2008.\n\n\"I think there's a higher percentage who are not well trained or not competent\" to determine when surgery is necessary, Santa says. \"Then you have a big group who are more businessmen than medical professionals ‚Äî doctors who look at those gray cases and say, 'Well, I have enough here to justify surgery, so I'm going to do it.'\"\n\nThe pressures are real. Doctors' income can hinge largely on the number of surgeries they do ‚Äî and the revenue those procedures generate. Those numbers also can determine whether doctors get privileges at certain hospitals or membership in top practices.\n\nThere's no way to know what portion of unnecessary surgeries are related to these more subtle pressures, as opposed to poor training or fraud. Researchers simply know they're happening.\n\nSome of the most widely cited evidence comes from Dartmouth College's Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, which uses data from Medicare and other sources to document large variances in the rates at which surgeries are done in different parts of the country.\n\nData from 2008-2010, examining common surgeries that carry a risk of being done unnecessarily, show:\n\n‚Ä¢ Radical Prostatectomy: Medicare patients in Lansing, Mich., were 10 times more likely to have surgical prostate removals than those 500 miles away, in York, Penn. Lansing's rate for the surgeries was the nation's highest, 2.7 times the average; York's was lowest, less than a third of the average.\n\n‚Ä¢ Gall bladder removal: Medicare patients in McAllen, Texas, were three times more likely to have a surgical gall bladder removal than those in Mason City, Iowa. McAllen's rate for the surgeries was the nation's highest, 1.6 times the average; Mason City's was lowest, closer to half the average.\n\n‚Ä¢ Knee replacement: Medicare patients in Lincoln, Neb., were nearly four times more likely to have knee replacement surgery than those in Honolulu. Lincoln's rate for the surgeries was the nation's highest, nearly 55% above the national average; Honolulu's was lowest, less than half the average.\n\nAbsent any hard data on what drives the different surgery rates, researchers have adopted a generic explanation: physician preference.\n\nCUT FOR NOTHING\n\nMichael Rosin had a busy dermatology practice treating hundreds of mostly elderly skin cancer patients in Southwest Florida. But the cancers were a fiction.\n\nRosin, now 62, was sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2006 and ordered to pay more than $7 million for intentionally misdiagnosing patients with cancer, then doing skin surgeries ‚Äî often multiple times on a single patient ‚Äî to remove lesions he knew were benign.\n\n\"He would look us over, take a sample for a biopsy, then come back and say you have some kind of cancer,\" recalls Robert Avrutik, 89. \"He'd keep finding more, and you never know yourself whether it's cancerous, so you figure, 'Oh, I've got all these cancerous things. Eventually, he'll get rid of them all.'\"\n\nAvrutik and his wife, Marie, visited Rosin again and again. Each time he would tell them both that he needed to remove more lesions.\n\n\"He'd always have to put in six, seven stitches; it would be sore, you had to attend to it, so it was really a pain,\" Avrutik says. \"My wife still has a couple of scars on her face, and she yells about him from time to time.\"\n\nWhen federal agents caught up with Rosin, he'd worked the scam for nearly a decade, prosecutors said. In all, they counted more than 800 victims.\n\nMORE KNOWLEDGE, FEWER SURGERIES\n\nThe fee-for-service nature of U.S. health care, where the hospitals and doctors get more money for every operation they perform, essentially rewards those that put more patients under the knife.\n\n\"There's no financial reason not to do it, so there's no pressure,\" says Leape, the Harvard physician. \"There are no regulators breathing down their backs; Medicare and the insurance companies continue to pay for it.\"\n\nThe 2010 health care law, still being implemented, promises changes in the payment system that may pressure health care providers to cut unnecessary surgeries, Leape says. But the key, he says, is to redefine the doctor-patient relationship.\n\nInformed or shared decision-making, in which doctors help patients play active roles in choosing their treatment, is the mantra of many patient advocates and a number of surgeons themselves. The idea is that doctors lay out all the information about a surgery ‚Äî potential benefits, evidence for doing it, options for non-surgical treatment ‚Äî so patients can decide whether it's right for them.\n\n\"We see dramatic variations in rates of (surgery) for ‚Ä¶ conditions where multiple treatment options are possible,\" the Dartmouth researchers concluded. \"Such extreme variation arises because patients commonly delegate decision-making to physicians. ‚Ä¶ When patients are fully informed about their options, they often choose very differently.\"\n\nHaving surgeons talk with patients might not be enough. Safety advocates say patients themselves must take an active role.\n\n\"Don't just take a doctor's word,\" says Patty Skolnik, who founded Citizens for Patient Safety after her son, Michael, died at 22 from complications in what she says was unnecessary brain surgery. \"Research your doctor, research the procedure, ask questions, including the most important one: 'What will happen if I don't get this done?'\"\n\nPeople often feel pressed to make immediate decisions on surgery when there's no rush, Skolnik says. \"I say, 'Slow it down. Stabilize and get another opinion.'\"\n\nA 1982 study in the journal Medical Care found that a mandatory second opinion program for Massachusetts Medicaid patients led to a 20% drop in certain surgeries, such as hysterectomies, that were considered more likely to be done unnecessarily. A 1997 study in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons looked at 5,601 patients recommended for surgery and found that second opinions found no need for the operation in 9% of the cases. Among those who got the countervailing second opinion, 62% opted not to have the operation.\n\nBut many patients simply aren't inclined to question their doctors.\n\n\"We expect the physician to know what's best for a patient,\" says William Root, chief compliance officer at Louisiana's Department of Health and Hospitals. \"We put so much faith and confidence in our physicians, (and) most of them deserve it. But when one of them is wrong or goes astray, it can do a lot of damage.\"\n\nRoot worked previously for the Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, where he helped build the case against Mehmood Patel, the Louisiana cardiologist who put in the pacemaker that ended Jonathan Stelly's baseball dreams. That case was \"one of the worst,\" Root says, because Patel was so trusted in the community that no one questioned him.\n\nStelly wishes he had.\n\n\"I'd known him since I was a kid,\" says Stelly, who moved to Denver and started a business that markets water ionizing and antioxidant equipment. \"(But) when someone's doing something that can change your life forever, you have to get a second opinion. You have to ask questions.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/06/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/08/04/nancy-pelosi-china-taiwan-visit/10244249002/", "title": "China halts climate, military talks with US as tensions rise over ...", "text": "WASHINGTON ‚Äì China said Friday it would suspend talks with the United States on a range of issues and would impose sanctions on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her family as tensions between the two nations escalated over Pelosi‚Äôs visit to Taiwan earlier this week.\n\nChina‚Äôs Foreign Ministry said it would suspend or cancel dialogue with the U.S. on issues ranging from climate change to military relations and anti-drug efforts. China did not say specifically what sanctions it would levy against Pelosi and her immediate family over what it called her ‚Äúegregious provocations‚Äù in visiting Taiwan, an island that China claims as its own territory.\n\nChina acted because Pelosi visited Taiwan ‚Äúin disregard of China‚Äôs strong opposition and serious representations,‚Äù the ministry said in a statement.\n\nIn another sign of deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing, the White House summoned China's ambassador to the White House on Thursday to launch a formal protest over Beijing's recent aggressive actions against Taiwan.\n\nChina on Thursday launched threatening military exercises in six zones just off Taiwan‚Äôs coasts that it says will run through Sunday. Missiles also have been fired over Taiwan, defense officials told state media.\n\n\"We condemned (China's) military actions, which are irresponsible, at odds with our long-standing goal of maintaining peace and stability and across the Taiwan Strait,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. \"We made clear to the ambassador that Beijing‚Äôs actions are of concern to Taiwan, to us and to our partners around the world.\"\n\nChina has claimed that Pelosi‚Äôs visit to Taiwan amounts to an attack by the Biden administration on Chinese sovereignty. The White House has stressed that Pelosi is the head of the legislative branch of government and that it could not stop her visit.\n\nThe White House also has said Pelosi‚Äôs visit does not signal a shift in its one-China policy, which acknowledges that Taiwan is part of China.\n\n‚ÄúChina has chosen to overreact and use the speaker‚Äôs visit as a pretext to increase provocative military activity in and around the Taiwan Strait,‚Äù Kirby told reporters at the White House on Thursday.\n\nIn an effort to ease the tensions, Kirby said the U.S. would postpone intercontinental ballistic missile test scheduled for this week. Kirby said the decision to reschedule the test was intended to demonstrate ‚Äúthe behavior of a responsible nuclear power by reducing the risks of miscalculation and misperception.‚Äù\n\nPelosi, the first U.S. speaker to visit Taiwan in 25 years, said in Japan on Friday that China will not be able to isolate Taiwan by preventing U.S. officials from traveling there. The Chinese have tried to isolate Taiwan, Pelosi said, including most recently by preventing it from joining the World Health Organization.\n\n‚ÄúThey may try to keep Taiwan from visiting or participating in other places, but they will not isolate Taiwan by preventing us to travel there,‚Äù Pelosi said as she wrapped up a swing across Asia. Pelosi and five other members of Congress arrived in Tokyo late Thursday after visiting Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea.\n\nChina‚Äôs announcement on Friday threatened to accelerate the friction with Washington.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry said dialogue between U.S. and Chinese regional commanders and defense department heads would be canceled, along with talks on military maritime safety.\n\nCooperation on returning illegal immigrants, criminal investigations, transnational crime, illegal drugs and climate change will be suspended, the ministry said.\n\nThe Chinese military exercises launched Thursday involve its navy, air force and other departments and are to last until Sunday. They include missile strikes on targets in the seas north and south of the island in an echo of the last major Chinese military drills in 1995 and 1996 aimed at intimidating Taiwan‚Äôs leaders and voters.\n\nTaiwan has put its military on alert and staged civil defense drills, while the U.S. has numerous naval assets in the area. China also flew war planes toward Taiwan and blocked imports of its citrus and fish.\n\n'WE CAME TO TAIWAN TO LISTEN':Pelosi gives strong backing to Taiwan's democracy; US braces for Chinese military drills\n\nEarlier Friday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said that China‚Äôs military exercises aimed at Taiwan represent a ‚Äúgrave problem‚Äù that threatens regional peace and security after five ballistic missiles launched as part of the drills landed in Japan‚Äôs exclusive economic zone.\n\nKishida, speaking after breakfast with Pelosi and her congressional delegation, said the missile launches need to be ‚Äústopped immediately.‚Äù\n\nJapanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said five missiles landed on Thursday in Japan‚Äôs exclusive economic zone off Hateruma, an island far south of Japan‚Äôs main islands. He said Japan protested to China, saying the missiles ‚Äúthreatened Japan‚Äôs national security and the lives of the Japanese people, which we strongly condemn.‚Äù\n\nJapanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, attending a regional meeting in Cambodia, said China‚Äôs actions are ‚Äúseverely impacting peace and stability in the region and the international community, and we demand the immediate suspension of the military exercises.‚Äù\n\nJapan has in recent years bolstered its defense capability and troop presence in southwestern Japan and remote islands, including Okinawa, which is about 700 kilometers (420 miles) northeast of Taiwan. Many residents say they worry their island will be quickly embroiled in any Taiwan conflict. Okinawa is home to the majority of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact.\n\nSEE THE HISTORIC TRIP:Speaker Nancy Pelosi visits Taiwan amid escalating tensions with China\n\nAt the breakfast earlier Friday, Pelosi and her congressional delegation also discussed their shared security concern over China, North Korea and Russia, and pledged their commitment to working toward peace and stability in Taiwan, Kishida said. Pelosi was also to hold talks with her Japanese counterpart, lower house Speaker Hiroyuki Hosoda.\n\nJapan and its key ally, the U.S., have been pushing for new security and economic frameworks with other democracies in the Indo-Pacific region and Europe as a counter to China‚Äôs growing influence amid rising tensions between Beijing and Taipei.\n\nDays before Pelosi‚Äôs Taiwan visit, a group of senior Japanese lawmakers, including former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba, visited the island and discussed regional security with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. Ishiba said Japan, while working with the United States to prevent conflict in the Indo-Pacific, wants a defense agreement with Taiwan.\n\nOn Thursday, the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized nations issued a statement saying ‚Äúthere is no justification to use a visit as pretext for aggressive military activity in the Taiwan Strait.‚Äù It said China‚Äôs ‚Äúescalatory response risks increasing tensions and destabilizing the region.‚Äù\n\nChina cited its displeasure over the statement for the last-minute cancellation of talks between the Chinese and Japanese foreign ministers on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in Cambodia on Thursday.\n\nPelosi held talks on Thursday in South Korea, also a key U.S. ally, which stayed away from the Taiwan issue, apparently to avoid upsetting China, focusing instead on North Korea‚Äôs increasing nuclear threat.\n\nIn recent years, South Korea has been struggling to strike a balance between the United States and China as their rivalry has deepened.\n\nThe Biden administration and Pelosi have said the United States remains committed to the so-called one-China policy, which recognizes Beijing as the government of China but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei. The administration discouraged but did not prevent Pelosi from visiting.\n\nPelosi has been a long-time advocate of human rights in China. She, along with other lawmakers, visited Beijing‚Äôs Tiananmen Square in 1991 to support democracy two years after a bloody military crackdown on protesters at the square.\n\nAs leader of the House of Representatives, Pelosi‚Äôs trip has heightened U.S.-China tensions more than visits by other members of Congress. The last House speaker to visit Taiwan was Newt Gingrich in 1997.\n\nChina and Taiwan, which split in 1949 after a civil war, have no official relations but multibillion-dollar business ties.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/09/hospital-wedding-howard-celebrates-home-order-news-around-states/114749772/", "title": "Hospital wedding, Howard celebrates: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: An organization for teachers is expressing concern that children are being allowed to return to school before completing required COVID-19 quarantine periods, potentially putting the health of students and school employees at risk. The Alabama Education Association sent a letter Thursday to the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners saying it had learned some doctors are writing excuses for students to return to school before mandated quarantine periods expired. Theron Stokes, associate executive director of AEA, said doctors should be aware of the guidelines and follow them. ‚ÄúWhen students return to school having not completed the entire 14-day quarantine period, they are placing their fellow students and their schools‚Äô employees at risk. For students and school employees who have underlying health conditions, these decisions can be deadly,‚Äù Stokes wrote.

The changes take effect Monday, with masks to be worn, with a few exceptions, in indoor public settings or communal areas and outdoors when distancing from non-household members is not possible. In some cases, such as for individuals with disabilities who cannot tolerate a mask, face shields will be allowed unless wearing one would be impossible, the order says. Masks are to be worn by school-age children older than 5, those who exercise or work at gyms, and athletes, players, coaches and officials who participate in organized sports, according to the municipality directives. Athletes must keep a mask on for indoor sports, but one is not required while ‚Äúexercising vigorously outdoors,‚Äù the directives state.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A top hospital official urged Arizonans to help curb the spread of the coronavirus by considering alternatives to traditional Thanksgiving get-togethers. ‚ÄúCongregating in large groups and close contact with others outside of your immediate household put you and those around you at risk,‚Äù said Dr. Marjorie Bessell, chief clinical officer of Banner Health. ‚ÄúI know we are asking a lot of you.‚Äù Banner operates 23 hospitals in Arizona and several in other states. Arizona health officials on Sunday reported 1,880 new COVID-19 cases and 17 additional deaths. State Department of Health Services officials said the latest figures increase Arizona‚Äôs totals to 259,264 cases and 6,164 known deaths since the coronavirus pandemic began. Cases and hospitalizations have been steadily increasing in Arizona since late September and throughout October after bottoming out in August after the state was a national hot spot in June and July.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state hit a record one-day increase in coronavirus cases Friday for the second day in a row, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he was growing concerned about hospital capacity. The Department of Health said the state‚Äôs probable and confirmed virus cases rose by 1,870. The state‚Äôs previous one-day high came Thursday, when it reported 1,548 new cases. On Saturday the department reported 1,598 new cases and 12 additional deaths for totals of 120,828 cases and 2,068 deaths since the pandemic began. The department reported 722 hospitalizations, 16 more than Friday‚Äôs then-record high. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs numbers show we are not in a good position as we head into the colder months,‚Äù Gov.

Darrell Issa was victorious Saturday in his race to return to Congress, where he once headed the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and became a GOP favorite for launching a string of investigations of the Obama administration. The former nine-term congressman and ardent supporter of President Donald Trump trailed early in the San Diego-area 50th District. But as more votes were counted after Election Day, he overtook Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar. The latest vote count update gave him about 54% of the votes and a 23,000-vote lead. Issa already had declared victory in a statement posted to social media Friday night. Campa-Najjar, a 31-year-old former Obama administration official, was making his second bid for the seat. He received more votes than he did in 2018 and thanked his supporters for ‚Äúgiving a Latino-Arab American a chance to do something special.‚Äù\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: City officials are urging residents to stay home between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. in an effort to stem the tide of coronavirus cases, which could overwhelm area hospitals by the end of the year. Mayor Michael Hancock said during a virtual news conference Friday that the ‚ÄúHome by 10 Order,‚Äù which will last for at least 30 days, is necessary to avoid another citywide stay-at-home order. He also urged residents not to gather or mix with other households. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to mince any words here when it comes to the spread of the coronavirus,‚Äù Hancock said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on a very dangerous path. We‚Äôre seeing rapid, significant increases in the numbers of people getting sick, and many of those people ended up in the hospital.‚Äù The mayor shied away from calling the order a curfew because he said enforcement would only target the most egregious violations ‚Äì not, for instance, someone walking their dog or going for a run after 10 p.m.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: Several colleges and universities have added new restrictions for students as coronavirus cases continue to rise in the state. Quinnipiac University announced it is instituting a two-week quarantine after recording 155 positive tests on campus since Wednesday. The quarantine means residential students must stay in their rooms, except to pick up takeout meals from the dining hall, and students living off campus can only return for testing. Students in isolation who have tested positive for the coronavirus will have meals delivered to their rooms each night. At Yale University, students residing in Davenport, Hopper, and Saybrook Colleges were ordered to quarantine because of positive coronavirus tests. In Fairfield, Sacred Heart and Fairfield universities have instituted curfews. The state reported Friday that 22 more people were hospitalized with COVID-19, bringing the total to 402, the highest total in five months.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: For the Rehoboth Beach Film Society, the show (or shows) must go on. The 23rd annual Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival is taking place as scheduled this month with a few modifications for health concerns. Only five films will be shown inside the society‚Äôs Cinema Art Theater, with 10 more available to stream at home. ‚ÄúWe had the opportunity to carry out this event with the safety of our viewers as a priority,‚Äù said Rehoboth Beach Film Society Executive Director Sue Early. ‚ÄúThey can watch films at home this year. It‚Äôs not the same experience, but there‚Äôs some great films to see. And in our theater, we could be showing at 60%, and we‚Äôre only going to use 30 out of 104 seats, which is just under 29%. They are well-spaced and cleaned after every screening. So it‚Äôs really safe.‚Äù Tickets are on sale now for the festival, which runs Nov. 5-15.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Hundreds of people gathered on the campus of Howard University on Saturday to celebrate their sister Kamala Harris after her announcement as vice president-elect, WUSA-TV reports. ‚ÄúWhen you come to Howard University, that is a very distinct choice,‚Äù said Niambi Carter, associate professor of political science at Howard University. ‚ÄúYou are choosing a legacy and a lineage that is great in so many aspects.‚Äù A large group of Alpha chapter members of Alpha Kappa Alpha gathered in front of the sorority‚Äôs plot on the yard to cheer for Harris‚Äô election. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so proud of Kamala, and I‚Äôm so proud to stand on the grounds where she walked,‚Äù alumna Kenya Sumner said. Harris graduated from Howard with a degree in political science and economics in 1986, the same year she became a member of the Alpha chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first historically black sorority, founded on Howard‚Äôs campus.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrange Park: Eight weeks after being admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, Henry Bell and his longtime fiancee decided the time was right for a wedding. So the day before his anticipated release from the inpatient rehab center at Orange Park Medical Center, Bell, 63, and Antionette Brown, 48, said their vows in the parking lot Thursday. Brown‚Äôs uncle performed the ceremony. ‚ÄúHis condition was deadly,‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúWe decided to do it now because we feel they (the hospital staff) are like family and wanted to share the life they gave us back.‚Äù Bell was admitted to the hospital Sept. 13 and immediately put on a ventilator. Brown and the couple‚Äôs seven grown children could only wait and hope for his condition to improve. He spent weeks in intensive care. He entered the hospital‚Äôs rehab center Sunday, and his recovery has included learning how to walk again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Athens-Clarke County plans to rent space for jury trials and grand jury proceedings. Grand juries and trials have been on hold in the state since March 14, when state Supreme Court Chief Justice Harold Melton declared a statewide judicial emergency because of the coronavirus threat. In subsequent renewal orders, Melton amended them to allow for court proceedings if they could be conducted safely. The best option for holding court proceedings in Athens-Clarke County is by using the Classic Center, said a committee tasked with deciding the issue. The county will pay the Classic Center up to $350,815 to rent space for the proceedings. The price Athens-Clarke will pay includes daily cleaning of the rooms used for trial proceedings, including space to conduct actual trials and a jury deliberation room. The $350,815 amount is based on the cost of 30 jury trials that last an average of five days each.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Land and Natural Resources reopened a popular scenic spot on Oahu that has been closed to visitors since the outbreak of the coronavirus. The Nuuanu Pali State Wayside, popularly known as Pali Lookout, was closed to the public at the outset of the pandemic because of budgetary constraints and crowding concerns. There were challenges in maintaining physical distancing at the lookout, State Parks Administrator Curt Cottrell said. Officials announced the park, which is among the most visited spots on Oahu, reopened Wednesday with daily hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The gates to the park‚Äôs access roads will be unlocked and secured daily by the Honolulu Police Department. The state set new parking fees of $7 per vehicle for nonresidents. Hawaii residents are not subject to parking and entry fees at any state parks. Tour buses are largely absent from the lookout, making the volume of visitors much lower.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A state panel of medical experts is asking the governor for a statewide mask mandate, and hospitals are running out of space for COVID-19 patients, after a week marked with record numbers of new cases and deaths. At least 671 Idaho residents have died from the coronavirus, and a record high of 1,290 new COVID-19 cases were reported on Wednesday alone, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, followed by 1,265 new cases Thursday. More than 69,500 residents have been confirmed to have the illness since the pandemic began. Idaho hospitals have reported more than 200 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 every day since Oct. 12. On Nov. 2, the most recent data available, there were nearly 300 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Jeanie Gentry, CEO of Steele Memorial Medical Center in Salmon, told the Idaho Statesman the facility is short about 40% of its staffers because they‚Äôve been exposed or sickened.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has tested negative for the coronavirus after learning he may have been exposed during a meeting to someone who tested positive. Members of Pritzker‚Äôs staff who attended the meeting last Monday also tested negative for the virus, his office said Saturday in a news release. Pritzker had self-isolated Friday while awaiting test results. They were the second negative test results for Pritzker and staff members who also underwent weekly tests Wednesday, according to his office. Meanwhile, 12,438 newly confirmed and probable cases of the virus and another 76 deaths were reported Saturday by the Illinois Department of Public Health. More than 10,370 new cases and 49 deaths were reported Friday. Illinois has had nearly 478,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 10,150 deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: The University of Notre Dame‚Äôs Faculty Senate formally expressed disappointment in the school president‚Äôs failure to wear a face mask at a White House event days before he tested positive for the coronavirus. The Faculty Senate voted 29-13 on Thursday for a resolution expressing disappointment in the Rev. John Jenkins‚Äô failure to wear a mask and practice social distancing at a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor confirmed last month as a U.S. Supreme Court justice. The Faculty Senate was originally expected to vote on a no confidence resolution, but that was amended. Jenkins tested positive for the coronavirus days after the Rose Garden ceremony, where President Donald Trump introduced Barrett as his nominee to the high court. Jenkins was seen without a mask, and he shook hands and sat shoulder-to-shoulder with others.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State prison officials reported Friday that a coronavirus outbreak has infected nearly half of the inmates at a prison in Anamosa. Testing last week revealed 476 inmates among 985 at the prison tested positive for the virus, said Cord Overton, a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Corrections. A report provided by the department indicates 37 staff members also tested positive. Across the nine institutions the department manages, 601 inmates were infected as of Friday afternoon. The report shows coronavirus has been active in the prison system since testing began in March with more than 21,000 tests administered to inmates. It said 1,252 inmates have recovered, an indication they have at one time tested positive but are no longer symptomatic are believed to be contagious. Four Iowa inmates have died during the pandemic, the report said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state saw most of a projected budget shortfall melt away Friday with a fiscal forecast that is less pessimistic about the economy and tax collections than a dire estimate issued this spring during a statewide lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic. The forecasting group boosted the state‚Äôs forecast for tax collections by $463 million, or 6.3%, for the 2021 budget year that began July 1. The group also issued its first calculations for the 2022 budget year that starts in July 2021, and while the forecast predicts a drop in tax collections of 2.1%, or $166 million, that‚Äôs due largely to the end of a temporary, pandemic-induced move to help income taxpayers. The Legislature‚Äôs nonpartisan research staff now projects a $153 million budget shortfall for the state‚Äôs 2022 budget year, an amount that almost can be covered by an internal shuffling of government funds that Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly already has proposed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state‚Äôs bar and restaurant operators are getting a break from alcoholic beverage renewal fees in a cost-saving step as they struggle with revenue losses from the pandemic. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is granting a 12-month fee renewal waiver to license holders, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday. Bar and restaurant operators who haven‚Äôt submitted the renewal fee this year won‚Äôt have to pay until 2021, he said. Those who have paid this year will have their fees waived in 2021, he said. ‚ÄúThis has certainly been a difficult year for our bars, restaurants and venues, and they deserve this innovative support as we face what could be a very painful winter,‚Äù Beshear said. Bars and restaurants have endured capacity limitations to help contain the coronavirus. The fee waiver doesn‚Äôt apply to producers, distributors, wholesalers and others able to continue operations throughout the virus-related state of emergency.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: In response to complaints that family and clergy were barred from hospitals and nursing homes amid the coronavirus pandemic, legislators have rewritten state laws to lessen visitation restrictions during public health emergencies. The bills passed unanimously in the special session that ended last month and were signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. They still will give discretion to the Louisiana Department of Health to decide just how wide-open the visitation can be and what safety protections will have to be followed. One measure by Sen. Robert Mills, a Minden Republican, calls on the health department to create rules requiring inpatient health care facilities to allow pastors, priests and other members of the clergy to visit patients during a public health emergency, if the patient asks for the visit.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials on Friday recommended caution at more schools in the state because of the rise in coronavirus cases. The state uses a color-coded system to categorize the level of precaution schools should use. The administration of Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said it‚Äôs adding schools in Knox County and Franklin County to the ‚Äúyellow‚Äù category, which is an intermediate level. Those counties join Somerset and Washington counties in the yellow category. All other counties in the state are in the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù category, the lowest level, though officials said they‚Äôre closely monitoring schools in Waldo and Kennebec counties. The state recommends that schools located in counties in the yellow category consider hybrid instruction models to reduce the number of people in schools and classrooms. The change in category for some schools came as cases surged around the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city is tightening restrictions on restaurants and indoor and outdoor gatherings in response to rising cases of the coronavirus, Mayor Bernard ‚ÄúJack‚Äù Young announced Friday. The changes will take effect Thursday at 5 p.m. Young said numbers of people in restaurants, religious facilities, theaters and malls will be limited to 25% capacity. Young said food service establishments must close indoor dining at 10 p.m. Bars that don‚Äôt have a license to sell food will be closed. ‚ÄúI am instituting these restrictions for the public health and to save lives in Baltimore city,‚Äù Young said. Also, the city‚Äôs health commissioner revised an order to require masks to be worn in public at all times, whether people are inside or outside. Dr. Letitia Dzirasa‚Äôs order is effective immediately. ‚ÄúOver the past month Baltimore city has seen our data trends move in the wrong direction,‚Äù she said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State officials on Friday urged more schools to return to full, in-person instruction, saying that only communities with the highest COVID-19 rates should be using any form of remote learning. Under previous guidance, schools were told to shift among remote learning, in-person learning or a mix of the two depending on their area‚Äôs infection rate. Areas with moderate spread were advised to use remote or hybrid learning, while only those with the lowest rates were encouraged to bring students back full time. But speaking at a news conference, Gov. Charlie Baker said there‚Äôs growing evidence that schools are not a significant source of spread and that keeping students at home hurts their learning and mental health. ‚ÄúWe continue to see too many communities with children learning in remote-only models,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe all know that losing a week, a month, a quarter or more in the life of a kid‚Äôs education has real consequences.‚Äù\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Joe Biden reclaimed the Wolverine State for Democrats with a surge of support in urban regions like Detroit and Grand Rapids, offsetting high turnout in rural and exurban areas for President Donald Trump. Biden‚Äôs 146,000-vote margin, 2.7 percentage points, was powered by gains in big, vote-rich counties such as Oakland near Detroit and Kent, which includes Grand Rapids ‚Äì amid a record 5.5 million people casting ballots statewide. Biden won Oakland by 14 points, besting Hillary Clinton‚Äôs 8-point edge in 2016. He carried Kent by almost 6 points after Trump netted it by 3 points four years ago. Trump again won traditional bellwether Macomb County outside Detroit, by roughly 8 points ‚Äì less than his 11-point margin in 2016, however. Biden became just the second Democratic presidential candidate to carry Kent in more than 50 years, after Barack Obama did it in his first run.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: COVID-19 is sweeping across the state at an unprecedented pace, breaking records for new cases and daily deaths and raising concerns about the ability of hospitals to keep up. The Star Tribune reports Saturday‚Äôs tally of 4,647 new cases ‚Äì a figure that would have easily set a record during the first eight months of the pandemic ‚Äì wasn‚Äôt even close to the biggest single-day count of the past week. For the seven-day period ending Saturday, Minnesota reported more than 25,000 new COVID-19 cases, or more than 10% of the state‚Äôs cases since March. The Minnesota Department of Health reported another 34 deaths Saturday, bringing the week‚Äôs total to 168, the second-highest one-week count since the start of the pandemic. Hospitals, meanwhile, are scrambling to treat more COVID-19 patients even as the virus threatens to sideline more health care workers.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Health has been working around the clock to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Now, the agency will be responsible for starting a statewide medical marijuana program within the next nine months. Uncertified election results showed 74% of Mississippi voters approved the ballot measure that allows doctors to prescribe up to 5 ounces of marijuana per month for people who have at least one of more than 20 serious medical conditions. ‚ÄúThis vote shows minds are changing,‚Äù said Jaqueline Temple Rudder, a homemaker from Madison County who lost her father-in-law to cancer and voted for Initiative 65. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want our sick suffering.‚Äù Both Gov. Tate Reeves and state‚Äôs top health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, opposed the initiative. Officials with the Department of Health will have until August to begin licensing treatment centers and certifying eligible patients.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Local health departments in the state don‚Äôt have enough staffers to conduct contact tracing for all the COVID-19 cases popping up, so they have been prioritizing the ones they try to trace back to their sources, officials said. The state‚Äôs rate of positive tests over the past two weeks is more than double the national average, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Larry Jones, who heads the Missouri Center for Public Health Excellence, said local health departments are struggling to keep up with contact tracing, which helps determine how a disease is spreading. Missouri on Sunday reported 4,131 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three more deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Missouri has risen over the past two weeks, from about 1,789 new cases per day Oct. 24 to about 3,126 as of Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A nursing facility in Butte has reported 10 COVID-19-related deaths in less than two weeks, and Gallatin County on Friday enacted stricter measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. Montana has hit a record for hospitalizations, and the confirmed number of infection cases was closing in on 38,000, state officials said. The state health department confirmed 986 more cases of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the total for the past week to 6,040, or an average of 863 cases per day. Over the previous week, the daily average was 779. Montana has reported 418 deaths, which may not include all 10 deaths tied to the outbreak at the Continental Care & Rehabilitation nursing facility in Butte. The Gallatin County health board on Friday said bars, restaurants and casinos must close by 10 p.m. instead of 12:30 a.m. They must also limit group sizes at tables to six adults plus children who are with a parent or guardian.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to report record numbers of new coronavirus cases and people hospitalized with the virus. Health officials said the surge in cases over the past month continued Friday with 2,681 new cases and 748 people hospitalized with the virus. Both those were new records, and the state‚Äôs rate of new cases was the seventh-highest in the nation. The state said 27 new deaths were reported Friday to give Nebraska 701 deaths. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has increased over the past two weeks from 836.71 new cases per day Oct. 23 to 1,408.86 new cases per day Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Also Friday, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said nine more staff members had tested positive for the virus to give it a total of 225 staff members who have been diagnosed with the virus. The department said the ill staffers are all isolating themselves at home.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Democrats successfully won reelection in the swing state‚Äôs two battleground congressional districts. First-term Rep. Susie Lee won reelection to a second term by defeating former professional wrestler Dan Rodimer in the 3rd District. Republicans believed the Las Vegas-area district offered them their best chance at unseating an incumbent. Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford was reelected in the state‚Äôs other battleground district, defeating Republican former Assemblyman Jim Marchant. Lee and Horsford‚Äôs victories cement a six-year hold on Nevada‚Äôs swing districts, which Democrats have won in the three most recent elections, and helps Democrats hoping maintain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, where many races remain too early to call with votes left to be counted. The result sends Nevada‚Äôs existing delegation back to Washington, D.C.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth-Hitchcock is again putting strict limits on visitors to its hospitals and outpatient clinics in response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Effective Friday, visitors are banned under most circumstances. Limited exceptions will be made for pediatric patients, women giving birth, patients at the end of life and those in a few other circumstances. The return to more restrictive policies applies to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon as well as the health system‚Äôs outpatient clinics and facilities. Officials said their decision was based on the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in both New Hampshire and Vermont. Meanwhile, the state‚Äôs court system said it is suspending in-person hearings for a few days after Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year‚Äôs Day to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday named his associate counsel to lead the commission that will oversee the state‚Äôs new recreational marijuana marketplace. Dianna Houenou, who serves as legal counsel to Murphy‚Äôs administration, will chair the Cannabis Regulatory Commission. Before working in Murphy‚Äôs administration, Houenou was policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union in New Jersey. Murphy, a Democrat, made the announcement just days after New Jersey voters approved a constitutional amendment legalizing recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. The amendment goes into effect at the start of next year and calls for state regulators to set up a marketplace for the legal sale of the drug. It‚Äôs unclear when marijuana will be ready to hit retail shelves in the state. Advocates for legalization said the soonest they expect it could happen toward the end of 2021.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State officials have the power to impose civil penalties when enforcing public health orders that call for businesses to restrict their operations amid a public health emergency, the state Supreme Court said Friday. The unanimous written opinion details the legal reasoning for an oral decision made by the court in August in a case brought by businesses that challenged health orders issued as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had petitioned the court to resolve the dispute. Lujan Grisham has warned that more restrictions could be imposed as early as this week as infections, hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase. She also said she has been disappointed in enforcement, pointing to businesses and country clubs in Albuquerque and elsewhere that hosted Halloween parties despite the ban on gatherings.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Restrictions in some New York City pandemic hot spots will be rolled back, even as the state prepares to combat coronavirus flare-ups upstate, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday. The governor said he‚Äôs considering imposing additional social distancing restrictions in ‚Äúmicrocluster‚Äù zones in the Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse areas because of rising infection rates. The addition of more of those zones upstate reflect the shifting state strategy as COVID-19 becomes a worsening problem beyond New York City, once an epicenter of the pandemic. The governor also said the National Guard will increase its presence at airports to help make sure travelers from non-neighboring states can provide proof of a negative coronavirus test. ‚ÄúIn general, downstate New York is doing better than upstate New York, which is a total reversal from the first phase of COVID,‚Äù Cuomo said during a telephone briefing.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans pressed state election officials Friday to make public more information about the number of outstanding ballots from last week‚Äôs election that could be counted. Nearly a dozen Election Day races in North Carolina, including those for president and U.S. Senate, remained too early to call because as many as 172,000 ballots had either yet to be counted or rejected, or could trickle in before this week‚Äôs deadline to receive mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day. The actual number of ballots that will arrive is likely to be less, however, because many people who requested absentee ballots ended up voting on Election Day or perhaps didn‚Äôt vote at all. And past elections show a significant portion of the 41,000 provisional ballots cast Tuesday will be rejected.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A child with COVID-19 has been confirmed to have a rare condition that causes inflammation in different parts of the body, state health officials said Friday. The child, who was discharged from the hospital and is resting at home, is the first confirmed case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in the state. ‚ÄúThis development is an unfortunate reminder that COVID-19 can impact people of any age, even children,‚Äù Dr. Joan Connell, Department of Health field medical officer and pediatrician, said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe best way to help prevent your child from getting MIS-C is to take action to avoid exposure to the COVID-19 virus and teach your child how to do the same.‚Äù MIS-C ‚Äì short for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children ‚Äì can inflame the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs. Children with it have experienced persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes and fatigue. Long-term effects are unknown.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The number of coronavirus cases in the state has continued to spike despite pleas from the governor for people to help slow the spread. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Ohio has risen over the past two weeks from 2,084 new cases per day Oct. 22 to 3,748 new cases per day Thursday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in the state has also risen over the past two weeks from 4.96% on Oct. 22 to 7.93% on Thursday, according to the tracking hub. The Health Department on Friday reported 5,008 probable and confirmed cases, another daily record high. Ohio has reported more than 240,000 probable and confirmed cases to date, including 5,494 deaths. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday that he planned to announce additional measures soon to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of newly reported coronavirus cases in the state Saturday more than doubled the previous one-day record, and the Department of Health said a backlog of cases and possibly duplicate reporting were the reason. There were 4,741 new cases, bringing the total to 136,492 since the pandemic began, the department said. The previous one-day record of 2,101 new cases was recorded Thursday as cases in the state have surged in recent weeks. ‚ÄúWe have reason to believe that our normal case count would have continued on an upward trajectory without the backlog and duplication,‚Äù which is due to a transition from a manual to electronic reporting system, according to a health department statement. In a statement, Gov. Kevin Stitt called on residents to wash hands often, socially distance and voluntarily wear masks at indoor public places.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Following a record-breaking day of COVID-19 cases in the state, officials announced new restrictions Friday that will be implemented in at least five of the state‚Äôs counties as part of a two-week pause on social activities. The updated safety measures, which begin Wednesday, include halting visitations to long-term care facilities, reducing the capacity of indoor dining at restaurants to 50 people, encouraging all businesses to mandate working from home, and urging Oregonians not to gather with people who do not live in their household ‚Äì but if they do to limit it to six people. If people have multiple get-togethers, which is discouraged, it should be the same social circle of six people. ‚ÄúLet me be clear, we cannot allow this disease to continue to spread so rapidly in our communities. Lives are at stake,‚Äù Gov. Kate Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Bail has been set at $750,000 each for two men authorities said were armed with loaded handguns when they were arrested near the city‚Äôs convention center where votes were being counted. Joshua Macias, 42, and Antonio LaMotta, 61, traveled from the Virginia Beach, Virginia, area in a Hummer and did not have permits to carry the weapons in Pennsylvania, police said. They were charged with carrying a concealed firearm without a license and carrying a firearm on a public street. The men were stopped Thursday about a block from the vehicle, Macias with a .40-caliber Beretta handgun inside his jacket and LaMotta with a 9 mm Beretta in a holster, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. An AR-style rifle and ammunition were found inside the vehicle, Outlaw said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: Protesters gathered near a prison that houses federal detainees Friday, denouncing the facility‚Äôs contract with U.S. immigration authorities and pointing to a surge in coronavirus infections among detainees. Demonstrators blocked roads leading to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, where authorities say more than 150 detainees have tested positive for COVID-19. Activists have repeatedly called for Wyatt‚Äôs closure, saying conditions are subpar. The publicly owned but privately operated lockup has about 540 inmates in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In April, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal class-action lawsuit seeking the release of dozens of detainees, saying the virus was spreading ‚Äúuncontrollably.‚Äù More than two dozen detainees subsequently were freed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two days after his opponent proclaimed victory in South Carolina‚Äôs 1st District, freshman U.S. House Rep. Joe Cunningham conceded defeat Friday, saying he was proud of the work he had done in his single term in Congress and pledging to continue to work toward bipartisan progress as a private citizen. Standing in front of the U.S. Customs House in Charleston, Cunningham told supporters that he had called Republican Nancy Mace to offer support and congratulations. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs now my representative,‚Äù Cunningham said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm rooting for her.‚Äù The Associated Press called the race for Mace early Wednesday morning, but Cunningham did not concede, citing scanning issues with absentee ballots in one of the district‚Äôs counties. In her victory, Mace, 42, becomes the first Republican woman elected to Congress in South Carolina and only the second-ever woman from the state elected to a full House term.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: More than 100 state residents have died of complications due to the coronavirus in the first eight days of November, health officials said Sunday. The Department of Health confirmed 13 deaths in the past day, for a total of 111 this month and 536 since the start of the pandemic. The overall death count is the 24th-highest per capita in the country in the past two weeks, Johns Hopkins University researchers said. The state reported 1,426 positive tests for COVID-19 since Saturday. South Dakota ranks second in the country behind North Dakota in the number of new cases per capita in the past two weeks. The top five counties with the most cases per capita in that time are Bon Homme, Dewey, Buffalo, Potter and Sanborn, according to the COVID Tracking Project. There are 546 people being treated in hospitals in the state, up 31 in the past day. Of those, 96 are in intensive care units, and 69 are using ventilators.\n\nTennessee\n\nJohnson City: Health officials in northeastern Tennessee say they do not have enough nurses to combat COVID-19 inside the region‚Äôs hospital system. ‚ÄúThere are no longer enough nurses to fill the need that we have,‚Äù Ballad Health Senior Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer Lisa Smithgall told WJHL-TV. According to Ballad Health, the hospital system is looking to hire 350 registered nurses to fill its nurse shortage. ‚ÄúIn the last eight weeks, we‚Äôve had more than 900 patients admitted to COVID-19,‚Äù said Ballad Health Chief Administrative Officer Eric Deaton. After hitting 200 inpatients last week, the health care system has adjusted its COVID-19 surge plan to receive 300 inpatients. ‚ÄúThese numbers represent lives; they‚Äôre non-encouraging,‚Äù Deaton said. ‚ÄúIn fact, it‚Äôs really becoming a tragedy in the increased rates that we‚Äôre seeing.‚Äù\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: A district judge on Friday upheld an order from El Paso County‚Äôs top elected official shutting down businesses while the region fights an alarming surge in COVID-19 cases. The decision from Judge Bill Moody of El Paso‚Äôs 34th District Court came as federal military medical teams deployed to the border region at the request of the state. The county‚Äôs top elected official, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, ordered a two-week shutdown of nonessential activities late last month. In making his decision, Moody pointed out that during the Spanish flu pandemic in the early part of the 20th century, city and county elected officials had authority to respond as they ‚Äúthought was necessary to protect the health and financial interests of their individual communities.‚Äù Chris Hilton, an attorney with the Texas attorney general‚Äôs office, said the state would appeal.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state‚Äôs largest teachers union called for the governor to move all public secondary schools in high coronavirus transmission areas to remote learning Friday as the state reported a single-day record of 17 COVID-19 deaths. The Utah Education Association also called for Republican Gov. Gary Herbert to suspend all extracurricular activities that can‚Äôt comply with social distancing guidelines in high transmission areas from the Thanksgiving holiday throughout winter break. ‚ÄúWe are now seeing multiple schools repeatedly shift back and forth from in-person to at-home learning due to outbreaks,‚Äù the union wrote in a statement. ‚ÄúThis cycle is obviously not helping to control the virus spread and, as educators, we can unequivocally state the continual interruptions are not in the best interest of student learning.‚Äù\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott said Friday that comments by President Donald Trump casting doubts on the integrity of the election process are hurting society. Scott said all legal votes cast in the 2020 election need to be counted, including mail-in votes. Scott‚Äôs comments came a day after President Donald Trump made baseless claims of fraud in the ballot-counting process for the presidential election. Scott said that the president‚Äôs comments are ‚Äúinciting a lot of rhetoric‚Äù and that many of his followers take him at his word. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe any of the statements he made last night are true, and I do believe it is hurting our society and our ability to work together,‚Äù Scott said. After voting Tuesday, he said he had cast his presidential ballot for former Vice President Joe Biden. He said he had never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate before but had to put ‚Äúcountry over party.‚Äù\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Freshman Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger has kept her seat in a competitive congressional race in the Richmond suburbs. The former CIA operations officer defeated Republican challenger and state House delegate Nick Freitas in a close race that was called Sunday. Spanberger is considered one of Congress‚Äô more moderate Democrats and was part of a wave of women who helped Democrats retake the U.S. House in 2018. But Freitas had tried to tie Spanberger to her party‚Äôs leadership and said it was out of sync with constituents. Spanberger spent nearly a decade with the CIA, working on counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation cases. She is one of two moderate Virginia Democrats who held on to U.S. House seats they flipped from red to blue two years ago, as Democrats‚Äô strength in the Old Dominion continues to grow.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state set a daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 1,777 new confirmed cases announced Saturday, and the state Department of Health warned that COVID-19 cases are spreading in the Puget Sound region. In a statement, the health agency said the high numbers the state has seen over the past week reflect an overall surge that started in mid-September. King, Snohomish and Pierce counties are currently the hot spots in the region, officials said. ‚ÄúCOVID-19 is currently spreading very quickly in Washington state,‚Äù said Secretary of Health John Wiesman. ‚ÄúWe are very concerned that disease transmission will only grow over the next few weeks with the holidays coming up. The threat to overwhelming not just our hospital systems, but our ability to do contact tracing, is real. We need everyone in Washington state to take action now to stop the spread.‚Äù\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported surging COVID-19 case numbers Saturday along with 15 newly reported deaths from the virus. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources reported 655 newly reported cases as of 10 a.m. Saturday for a total of 27,742 total cases and 502 deaths since the pandemic reached the state. The daily case count set a record for the state, a day after West Virginia saw a new peak of 540 cases over 24 hours. On Friday, several government staff and officials including Gov. Jim Justice were tested for the virus after a staffer in the Capitol building tested positive Friday morning. The attorney general‚Äôs office later said the employee believed to have the virus tested negative Friday night. Justice said he was tested for the virus minutes before a noon news conference Friday, where he announced the record high of new cases. He also urged West Virginians to get tested at sites around the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: State health officials reported a new daily high of more than 7,000 new COVID-19 cases ‚Äì another new daily record. Saturday‚Äôs total of 7,065 confirmed infections is more than 900 cases higher than the previous record, set Friday with 6,141 cases, according to the state Department of Health Services. The state first passed 6,000 daily cases Friday, and Tuesday and Wednesday of this past week also saw record-setting numbers of new cases. The 7,065 positive cases made up 37% of the 18,928 test results reported Saturday by the state health department. The seven-day average of new cases also rose again, hitting 5,394, which is the highest weekly average to date, according to DHS. The state health department also reported 45 more people have died, bringing the state‚Äôs death toll to 2,301.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State health officials reported 646 new coronavirus cases Sunday, the second-highest single-day total of the pandemic in the state. The Department of Health listed 966 new cases Friday, the highest single-day total. The Casper Star-Tribune reports at least 114 people have died of the coronavirus, and more than 14,690 people have tested positive. The new totals come amid a rapid surge in the numbers of cases in Wyoming and throughout much of the U.S. Gov. Mark Gordon has said he is not considering implementing a statewide face mask order but has urged residents to wear masks. Albany County, which includes Laramie; the Wind River Reservation; and Teton and Laramie counties have implemented mask mandates under which residents must wear facial coverings when outside their homes, with some exceptions.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/12/surprise-vacation-yard-sale-reprieve-teacher-sick-day-news-around-states/114862294/", "title": "Surprise vacation, yard sale reprieve, teacher sick day: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State health officials are urging people to serve up a heaping side of precaution at Thanksgiving, as the holiday comes amid a national surge in COVID-19 cases. Officials say people should skip large family gatherings in favor of scaled-back events. ‚ÄúWe all want to see our family at holiday time, and yet this is a special year. This is a year unlike any we‚Äôve ever had,‚Äù Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said. ‚ÄúMany things maybe could be done virtually, which is not nearly as much fun but certainly safer.‚Äù The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines. Suzanne Judd, an epidemiologist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham‚Äôs School of Public Health, said Thanksgiving is particularly problematic because it‚Äôs a holiday celebrated by family gatherings indoors. ‚ÄúGatherings greater than 10 people pose a substantial risk of one of the people being COVID-positive and not knowing,‚Äù Judd said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The spread of the coronavirus at the state‚Äôs largest prison has accelerated beyond an initial outbreak, with 110 inmates testing positive for the virus as of Monday. Goose Creek Correctional Center first announced a virus outbreak at the facility Nov. 2, when the Alaska Department of Corrections said 22 inmates and five staff members tested positive, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The prison west of Wasilla near Point McKenzie housed 1,317 pretrial and sentenced prisoners as of Monday, department spokeswoman Sarah Gallagher said. Staff are required and inmates are strongly encouraged to wear masks, she said. The outbreak began in one of the prison‚Äôs housing units, known as mods. Each mod has 64 prisoners, indicating the outbreak has expanded beyond a single unit, Gallagher said. Each mod continues to operate as a ‚Äúfamily unit‚Äù in order to minimize the risk of further transmission, Gallagher said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With the state reporting a daily average of 1,900 new COVID-19 cases over the past week, Gov. Doug Ducey has urged residents to be careful. In a video posted Tuesday, Ducey urged Arizona residents to wear face coverings, wash hands, practice social distancing and stay home when sick. ‚ÄúGatherings of families and friends from outside your household are no safer than going to the grocery store,‚Äù he said. Ducey, a Republican, has not implemented a statewide masking requirement, while many local governments in the state have done so. He announced no new virus prevention initiatives in the video posted on social media and his office‚Äôs website. He cited past moves that included increasing testing and providing money to hospitals for protective gear, staffing and ventilators. Ducey said he wants to protect public health ‚Äúkeep our economy safely open and moving, We know that both are important to the health and well-being of Arizonans.‚Äù\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state‚Äôs COVID-19 hospitalizations again hit a new high Tuesday, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson resisted calls for new restrictions on businesses or gatherings to combat a surge in coronavirus cases. An outbreak of the virus among state legislators also grew to 11 on Tuesday, with a lawmaker testing positive. The Department of Health reported 24 more people were hospitalized because of COVID-19, bringing the state‚Äôs virus hospitalizations to a new high of 810. The state‚Äôs confirmed and probable virus cases rose by 1,424 to 124,235. ‚ÄúThe numbers aren‚Äôt good, the trend is not good, and we have a lot of work to do here in Arkansas and across the nation,‚Äù Hutchinson said at his weekly news briefing on the virus. The state‚Äôs COVID-19 deaths rose by four to 2,112. The Republican governor said many of the state‚Äôs cases are coming from smaller gatherings at homes that he said can‚Äôt be regulated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city will study the feasibility of using its enormous convention center as a temporary shelter for the increasing number of homeless people living on the streets. City Councilman Curren Price introduced a motion Tuesday seeking a report on what it would take to transform the 720,000-square-foot LA Convention Center in his downtown district. The property has not been used for conventions since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, the pandemic has forced more people into homelessness, Price said. With more than 60,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, encampments have gone up throughout the region on sidewalks, in empty lots and under freeway overpasses. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a panic situation along with a pandemic situation. Folks on the streets are just suffering,‚Äù Price told the Los Angeles Times. ‚ÄúWe have to do a better job of housing individuals who are homeless.‚Äù\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Department of Public Health and Environment has routinely deleted emails related to the coronavirus pandemic even though the state archives has asked that they be saved, a newspaper has found. The Denver Post reports it discovered that emails sent and received by state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy were deleted after the newspaper requested documents. The department said it would provide some records, including emails. But it said emails ‚Äúfrom May would have already been auto-deleted unless otherwise preserved, or they were previously deleted by Dr. Herlihy as part of a normal business process,‚Äù said Monica Wilkerson, the department‚Äôs records and legal services liaison. As of last year, the department deleted most employee emails after 90 days. The policy mirrors similar practices by the state government. The Colorado State Archives posted a notice in June asking agencies to ‚Äúkeep all records related to COVID-19.‚Äù Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition Executive Director Jeff Roberts said it is important to keep records so that journalists can report on a crisis affecting the health and safety of residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Canaan: More than 350 students and 20 teachers in a wealthy suburb are in quarantine after a new round of coronavirus testing turned up 15 infections, according to the local school district. New Canaan schools on Tuesday reported 13 students and two teachers tested positive, days after all 540 tests of students came back negative, the Stamford Advocate reports. There were also 26 new positive tests last weekend, First Selectman Kevin Moynihan said. ‚ÄúWe continue to see cases spread from gatherings, dinner parties, out-of-town caregivers, house cleaners and, not unexpectedly, within families,‚Äù Moynihan said. ‚ÄúThis rapid case increase over the weekend illustrates how fast community transmission spreads and accelerates.‚Äù The most recent testing resulted in quarantines for 213 students at New Canaan High School, 70 at Saxe Middle School and 70 at three elementary schools. People in quarantine are told they must stay home for 14 days.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Attorneys for a cleric say they‚Äôve reached a settlement with Gov. John Carney over the coronavirus restrictions he imposed on worship services. The Rev. Christopher Allan Bullock filed a lawsuit in May claiming Carney‚Äôs restrictions were unconstitutional and discriminatory. Carney then rescinded many of the restrictions, and his lawyers argued Bullock‚Äôs claims were moot. But Bullock‚Äôs attorneys asked for an injunction prohibiting the governor from imposing similar limitations in the future. Lawyers representing the New Castle County pastor and community activist said Wednesday that the settlement requires the governor to treat houses of worship in a neutral manner in any future emergency. Among other things, if certain businesses or activities are considered essential, that definition will include churches. Attorney Thomas Neuberger said the state also agreed to pay the plaintiffs $150,000 in lawyer fees and $7,200 in court costs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. reported 206 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday ‚Äì its highest single-day total since late May, WUSA-TV reports. Daily test data lags behind and is only available up to Nov. 7, so it‚Äôs unclear what, if any, connection to the weekend‚Äôs celebrations these numbers may have. The city is now averaging more than 100 new cases a day for the first time since May 30.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than a dozen Miami nurses and front-line health care workers are finally getting a well-deserved break. The group was scheduled for an upcoming, mandatory ‚Äì aka boring ‚Äì 48-hour training but was instead surprised with an island vacation to the Florida Keys. Jackson Health System supervisors were asked to choose staff who went above and beyond during the pandemic. Many of the staff, including respiratory therapists and lab techs, have not been able to take any time off during the pandemic to relax or spend time with their loved ones and have been working tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients, the hospital said. The 50 workers were told they had to attend a two-day training, but when they gathered at the hospital Tuesday, they were handed gift boxes with gift certificates. Hawks Cay Resort in the Florida Keys donated two-night stays to its island on Duck Key, surrounded by sparkling waters and swaying palm trees, as part of its Heroes Salute program.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is again hitting a new peak in public high school graduation rates. The state Department of Education said Tuesday that 83.8% of seniors graduated on time in the spring. That‚Äôs the highest level recorded since Georgia began calculating according to current methods, which require a student to graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma, and rose from 82% in 2019. The state says part of the increase came from a waiver allowing the state to count students with significant cognitive disabilities, about 1% of students overall, as graduating on time even if they take more than four years to complete high school. Because of the pandemic, many high school students did not have to take end-of-course exams last year, which would have counted for 20% of their overall grade. Most students take the courses that require the exams before their senior year, so it‚Äôs unclear whether the lack of tests influenced Georgia‚Äôs graduation rates.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Bankruptcies declined in October for the eighth time in 10 months as state unemployment reached a national high of 15.1% and as tourism was in the beginning stage of reopening after a major economic downturn. There were 125 bankruptcy filings in October, a 22.6% decrease from the 162 during the same period in the previous year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Data provided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, showed bankruptcy filings were down 9.8% to 1,274 for the year through October compared to 1,412 during the same period in 2019. Chapter 7 liquidation filings, the most common type of bankruptcy, fell 19.8% in October to 93 from 116 in the year-earlier period. Chapter 13 filings, which allow people with regular income sources to establish installment payment plans to creditors over three to five years, dropped 27.3% to 32 from 44 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge dismissed a case against a woman who was cited for holding a yard sale authorities said violated the state‚Äôs coronavirus stay-at-home order. Judge Van Valin on Friday dismissed the case brought by officials who said the yard sale was not an ‚Äúessential business,‚Äù The Idaho Statesman reports. Valin ruled the yard sale conducted in April by Christa Thompson of Rathdrum was not a business. Defense attorney Edward Dindinger said in a statement that the judge ruled the language of the stay-at-home order issued in response to the coronavirus pandemic did not apply to Thompson. The Rathdrum Police Department said in April that the event was a ‚Äúlarge nonessential yard sale‚Äù that filled the front yard and spilled into the back yard of her home. Thompson held the sale ‚Äúto liquidate her late father-in-law‚Äôs estate,‚Äù Dindinger said. Thompson faced a possible sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state set another single-day record for coronavirus infections Tuesday, pushing the total number of people who have tested positive in the state since the pandemic began past 500,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker presented statistics to show that hospitalizations are nearing their spring peak, when the initial wave of infections had officials scrambling for hospital beds and professionals to tend them. State public health officials reported 12,623 newly confirmed cases of the virus, nearly 15% higher than the previous record set Saturday, when cases also topped 12,000. In Chicago, officials reported a daily average of 1,686 new cases, roughly four times higher than a month ago. ‚ÄúThere are no signs of slowing,‚Äù Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said. Hospitalizations jumped 7.5% in one day to 4,742. The seven-day average of 4,207 in hospital beds is creeping toward the 4,822 average hit May 5.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is continuing its record-setting increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new infections, health officials said Tuesday as the state once again surpassed 4,000 new cases and reported 63 more deaths. The newly reported deaths raised Indiana‚Äôs pandemic death toll to 4,731, including confirmed and presumed coronavirus infections, the Indiana State Department of Health said in its daily statistics update. The 4,879 infections reported Tuesday were Indiana‚Äôs second-highest daily count of newly reported coronavirus cases and marked the sixth straight day the state reported more than 4,000 new cases. Indiana‚Äôs seven-day rolling average for newly confirmed cases rose to 4,490, according to Tuesday‚Äôs daily update of the state‚Äôs coronavirus dashboard. That is the highest level Indiana has seen during the pandemic and more than five times the seven-day rolling average of 858 newly confirmed cases the agency reported Sept. 22.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two more state prisons are reporting outbreaks of coronavirus infections, according to the Iowa Department of Corrections. Recent testing has revealed outbreaks at prisons in Clarinda, where 377 inmates and 16 staff members are positive, and Rockwell City, where 254 inmates and four staff members are positive, a DOC report updated Sunday shows. The Clarinda prison has about 900 inmates, and Rockwell City has 426. The department released data Friday showing an outbreak at the Anamosa prison, and the updated numbers show 485 infected inmates of the 982 inmates at the prison. An additional 50 staff members tested positive. Additional smaller prison outbreaks are reported at Mount Pleasant, where 18 inmates and five staff members are positive, and the women‚Äôs prison in Mitchellville, where four inmates and 10 staff members are positive.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state‚Äôs largest public school district, in Wichita, has scrapped plans to allow its middle and high school students to attend some in-person classes, and three counties have imposed new restrictions inspired by the coronavirus pandemic. The moves by local officials come as the state works to expand its overall testing capacity so under a ‚Äúunified‚Äù statewide strategy announced by Gov. Laura Kelly in late September. The strategy calls for regular testing of at-risk populations, including first responders, prison inmates, nursing home residents, and K-12 students and staff, as well as more aggressive testing in virus hot spots. The state plans to spend at least $53 million in federal coronavirus relief funds on contracts with private laboratories. But Kelly said Tuesday during a Statehouse news conference: ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt work if people are not abiding by the other safety protocols, particularly wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings.‚Äù\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentuckians should avoid large Thanksgiving gatherings as a safeguard to protect extended family and friends from a surging COVID-19 outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Instead, in-person get-togethers should be limited to people from the same household, he said. While the health guidelines might be tough to swallow, the guidance can save lives as Kentucky struggles with its worst outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic governor said. ‚ÄúThat person that you may think that you will really miss sitting across the table from you this year, I want to make sure is across the table from you next year,‚Äù Beshear said at a news conference. ‚ÄúAnd this right now is the most dangerous time we‚Äôve had in this virus.‚Äù The Thanksgiving guidance came as the state reported 2,120 new virus cases ‚Äì its highest total for a Tuesday and fifth-highest day overall, Beshear said. He also reported 14 more virus-related deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Shoppers will see state sales taxes suspended for two days this month, under a bill passed by lawmakers in their latest special session and signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, a Gonzales Republican, sponsored the measure to help residents and businesses recovering from hurricanes Laura and Delta and coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The state sales tax holiday will be held Nov. 20-21. Louisiana‚Äôs 4.45% state sales tax will not be charged on the first $2,500 of a purchase. The holiday doesn‚Äôt cover car, truck and other vehicle purchases. And it doesn‚Äôt apply to local sales taxes. The state is estimated to lose $4.5 million in sales tax collections because of the tax holiday, according to a nonpartisan financial analysis of the bill.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers plan to hold their first legislative sessions at the Augusta Civic Center instead of the Statehouse as coronavirus cases grow. The city-owned, 49,000-square-foot civic center, about 3 miles from the Statehouse, is typically used for events such as concerts, agriculture conventions and conferences. It would provide more space than the Statehouse, and that would make it easier to observe social distancing, a spokeswoman for outgoing Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon told the Portland Press Herald. The full Legislature last met in March. The top priority for lawmakers will be crafting a new, two-year state budget at a time when Maine‚Äôs finances have been stressed by the pandemic. New Hampshire lawmakers took a similar approach in June when they met in the University of New Hampshire Whittemore Center Arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will reduce indoor operations for bars and restaurants from 75% to 50% in response to rising coronavirus cases and increased hospitalizations, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday. The new limits took effect Wednesday. ‚ÄúLast week, I said that the warning lights were starting to blink on the dashboard and that it appeared we were approaching a critical turning point in the fight. Today, I‚Äôm reporting that we have now crossed over into the danger zone,‚Äù Hogan said at a news conference. ‚ÄúToo many residents and businesses have COVID fatigue and have begun letting their guard down.‚Äù State health officials also have issued a public health advisory effective immediately to strongly discourage indoor gatherings of 25 people or more at family gatherings or house parties. Contact tracing data has shown an increase in cases resulting from such gatherings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases could force the state to once again open field hospitals to care for a possible overflow of patients as intensive care units fill up, Gov. Charlie Baker warned Tuesday. Hospitals are also prepared to make an additional 400 beds available for COVID-19 patients by converting acute care beds to ICU beds to deal with an expected rise in cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus during the fall and winter, Baker said at a press conference. ‚ÄúThe trends obviously are going in the wrong direction and show no signs of changing,‚Äù he said. When and where field hospitals might be set up depends on space and need, Baker said. Massachusetts residents had done a good job controlling the virus after an initial spike in the spring but are getting careless and allowing the virus to get a toehold again, leading to a second surge, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state on Tuesday posted a record number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases, near 6,500, and reported 59 deaths within the previous 24 hours ‚Äì its deadliest day in six months. COVID-19, which subsided over the summer after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer imposed sweeping stay-at-home and other restrictions, has rebounded this fall. Asked if she might again order people to stay home, the Democrat said she was talking with the state health department about potential next steps. Mask requirements and gathering limits remain in effect despite a ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù state Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a law she used to issue orders, she said. Whitmer said she will not see extended family in person for Thanksgiving and said it is ‚Äúinherently dangerous‚Äù to have more than one household in an enclosed space without ventilation and open windows. The state‚Äôs latest average positivity rate is 9.4%, up from 4.9% two weeks ago.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials reported a record 56 new deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said. Walz told Minnesota Public Radio the daily report shows positivity rates above 20%, an important measure of how fast the disease is spreading. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Minnesota has nearly doubled over the past two weeks from just under 7% on Oct. 27 to nearly 13% on Tuesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. The governor made the comments a day after warning Minnesotans that the state is approaching the worst phase of the pandemic and that conditions will get dramatically worse unless people start changing their behavior. He said it won‚Äôt be unusual for people to open their newspapers and see 50 to 60 new deaths. ‚ÄúThis is just inevitable if we do not change our behaviors and take some mitigation efforts.‚Äù Walz told MPR. Minnesota‚Äôs previous record was 36 deaths, reported Friday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he, his wife and their three daughters are in isolation after the youngest tested positive for the coronavirus. Maddie Reeves, 8, attends a private elementary school in Jackson. The Republican governor said in a social media post: ‚ÄúShe feels OK, but could still use prayers! Please pray for her momma too!‚Äù Reeves also said everyone in his family is being tested for the virus. The governor announced his daughter‚Äôs infection shortly after he canceled his coronavirus news conference that was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. An executive order issued by Reeves requires children and teachers to wear masks in public and private schools. Sixteen of Mississippi‚Äôs 82 counties have been under a mask mandate that was set to expire Wednesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nO‚ÄôFallon: Twenty-eight employees of an election board have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, and a director believes they most likely got infected from voters, though local health officials aren‚Äôt convinced. The Jackson County Election Board‚Äôs Republican director, Tammy Brown, said Tuesday that eight full-time and 20 part-time employees tested positive for the virus in the past 21/ 2 weeks. Most are doing well and recovering at home, but two are hospitalized, including one in intensive care, Brown said. Jackson County is Missouri‚Äôs second-largest county, behind St. Louis County. While Kansas City is part of Jackson County, the city has its own election board. The Jackson County board handled votes cast by nearly 200,000 people. Jackson County Health Department spokeswoman Kayla Parker said community transmission is so widespread that determining the source would be next to impossible.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the state‚Äôs chief epidemiologist said the spread of the coronavirus has stressed medical services to the brink, and he predicted the situation will get worse as winter sets in. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre kind of preparing for the worst here,‚Äù Jim Murphy said. ‚ÄúWe have pretty spooky numbers for COVID, going into a fall respiratory season. It‚Äôs not a position that anybody would like to be in.‚Äù Murphy said the increase in cases across the state has led to a shortage in health care workers, in addition to a shortage in hospital beds. ‚ÄúYou can have a lot of beds. But if you don‚Äôt have the staff to support those beds, that‚Äôs a problem,‚Äù he said. U.S. officials have dispatched a team of nearly 30 physicians, nurses, paramedics and other health care workers to Montana‚Äôs largest city. The National Disaster Medical System team arrived Friday and will work in Billings for two weeks, The Billings Gazette reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to set records with the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and health care providers expect that to continue because of the recent surge of cases. Cliff Robertson, CEO of CHI Health, said his group of 14 hospitals in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa is preparing for COVID-19 cases to keep increasing over the next three to four weeks. He said COVID-19 patients already account for about 25% of all the patients in his hospitals. ‚ÄúWe highly encourage folks to take this seriously because ‚Ä¶ this virus is rampant in our community right now,‚Äù Robertson said. The steady increase in cases raises the concern that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist at Nebraska Medicine in Omaha. ‚ÄúIn three weeks‚Äô time, our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and we will no longer be able to deliver optimal and effective care for COVID, and we will also no longer be able to deliver appropriate care for everyone who comes in with a heart attack or a stroke.‚Äù\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Although the coronavirus is spreading at record rates, the state will not need to tighten restrictions if individuals commit to preventive measures like mask-wearing and working from home, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday. For the third time in three weeks, the governor referred to ‚Äúalarming trends‚Äù and said Nevada was almost at the point where stricter measures would be necessary. But unlike in the past, when he has hesitated to commit to benchmarks or timelines, he provided a deadline: If Nevada doesn‚Äôt show signs that it‚Äôs containing the virus in two weeks, he will be forced to tighten the state‚Äôs prevention measures. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have to go out, don‚Äôt go out. Reduce your time in public to what is necessary, and limit any and all exposures to those outside your household,‚Äù Sisolak said. ‚ÄúThink about changes like ordering groceries for delivery instead of going into the store, or picking up dinner curbside.‚Äù\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAmherst: Officials say an Election Day voter at a polling place tested positive for the coronavirus, but the town had safety precautions in place. WMUR-TV reports town officials in Amherst said they were notified by the state that a voter tested positive for the virus. They said the infected person was at Souhegan High School between 10:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. on Election Day. Amherst town moderator Steve Coughlan said it wasn‚Äôt crowded. The town is now contacting election volunteers who may have had direct contact with the voter. Coughlan said plexiglass shields separated voters from election workers. Volunteers had to wear masks, but voters did not. ‚ÄúI think we provided a very safe environment,‚Äù Coughlan said. ‚ÄúIt would be crazy for us to have thought that there would be zero infected voters out of everyone coming in. So we took precautions that were appropriate.‚Äù\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The family of the state‚Äôs first law enforcement officer to die from COVID-19 has filed a claim to sue Hudson County, saying he did not receive any masks or other personal protective equipment while working at the county jail. Bernard Waddell Sr., a corrections officer with 32 years of experience, was forced to work within close proximity to inmates who he believed were infected, said family lawyer Paul da Costa. ‚ÄúUp to his last day on the job, he was not provided with any PPE,‚Äù da Costa said. The virus devastated the jail in Kearny. Along with Waddell, it claimed the lives of two nurses, a commissary director and another corrections officer. Waddell, 56, died April 1. The Jersey City resident is survived by his wife and two sons. Around the time of his death, New Jersey was experiencing a severe shortage of face masks and gowns, prompting hospitals to ask the public for donations.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Santa Fe Public Schools is ending a short-lived soft opening of in-person learning as the coronavirus pandemic hobbles the state. ‚ÄúI am announcing today a hiatus of our volunteer hybrid program due to the rampant rise in COVID-19 cases in Santa Fe County and New Mexico and SFPS‚Äô philosophy to always prioritize the safety and well being of our students and staff,‚Äù Superintendent Veronica Garcia said. The volunteers included 58 teachers who went to work despite the pandemic, enabling about 200 elementary students to attend school in person at least part of the week. The program started Oct. 26 and will hold the last day of classes Nov. 20. ‚ÄúIf parents are able to keep their children home next week, I urge them to do so,‚Äù Garcia said. The announcement comes as the state sets records for COVID-19 cases amid dwindling space in hospitals and as students are failing classes at much higher rates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. across the state in the latest effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. He said people will also be barred from hosting private gatherings with more than 10 people. Cuomo said the new restrictions, which go into effect Friday, are necessary because new coronavirus infections have been traced to those types of activities. Businesses can reopen each morning. ‚ÄúBars, restaurants, gyms, house parties ‚Äì that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs coming from, primarily,‚Äù Cuomo said. The governor spoke as rates of coronavirus infection continued to rise. He said 1,628 people were hospitalized across the state for COVID-19 on Tuesday, and 21 people died. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing is what they predicted for months,‚Äù Cuomo said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state will remain paused in its current reopening plan for an additional three weeks, with indoor gathering limits reduced from 25 people to 10 people starting Friday. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced the tightening of gathering restrictions during a Tuesday news conference. The decision not to further reopen ahead of Thanksgiving comes at a time when the state is concerned about increases it has seen in COVID-19 cases and the percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive. ‚ÄúThe science shows that the transmission of this virus is much greater indoors, and the more people are gathered, the easier this virus can spread,‚Äù Cooper said. Cooper, who won reelection last week, noted that churches and restaurants would be unaffected by the updated guidance. The executive order will remain in place until Dec. 4.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state continues to lead the nation in daily new coronavirus cases per capita, with 1 in 83 residents testing positive in just the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. In the past two weeks, there were 2,265 new cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. State health officials reported a dozen new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus Wednesday, down from a record 30 deaths Tuesday. The deaths reported Wednesday increased total fatalities to 696 since the pandemic began. The report said 123 deaths have occurred in November, matching all of September. October has been the deadliest month so far in North Dakota, with 292 deaths. State health officials reported 1,039 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and a daily positivity rate of more than 18% for the second straight day.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine beseeched Ohioans on Wednesday to take the surging coronavirus spread seriously, issuing new orders on mask enforcement in businesses, limiting gatherings across the state, and threatening to close bars, restaurants and fitness centers if cases continue to rise. ‚ÄúThroughout our country‚Äôs history, each generation has faced unique sacrifices,‚Äù DeWine said in the statewide address. ‚ÄúToday, we all must do something far less dramatic but very important: Wear a mask so your friends and family members can live.‚Äù DeWine shifted the authority of mask enforcement from the local counties to the state. The Ohio Bureau of Workers‚Äô Compensation will be responsible for inspections across the 88 counties. If a business receives more than one violation, it will have to close for 24 hours. ‚ÄúWe must do this to protect our front-line workers,‚Äù DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of people hospitalized with confirmed and probable coronavirus in the state shattered the previous one-day record by nearly 200 on Wednesday, and more than 2,100 new cases were reported, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The department reported 1,248 hospitalizations to surpass the previous record of 1,055 set last Thursday. The department reported 2,177 new cases and 19 additional deaths since Tuesday for totals of 142,334 cases and 1,470 deaths since the pandemic began in March. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven‚Äôt been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day average of the percentage of people who tested positive has risen from 9% to nearly 16% in Oklahoma, and the average number of new cases each day increased from 1265.8 per day to 1,947.3.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown and state health officials warned Tuesday of the capacity challenges facing hospitals as COVID-19 case counts continue to spike. The Oregon Health Authority recorded a record 285 confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospitals Tuesday ‚Äì a 57% increase in just the past week and an 83% increase in the past four weeks. ‚ÄúThere are limitations to what Oregon‚Äôs health care system can handle,‚Äù said Dana Hargunani, the health authority‚Äôs chief medical officer. ‚ÄúEven with regional planning and the hard work of all of our hospital partners, we cannot handle ever-growing high daily case counts and widespread hospitalizations.‚Äù Currently out of Oregon‚Äôs 703 listed intensive care unit beds, 27% are available, and about 18% of non-ICU adult hospital beds in the state are available, based on data on from the health authority‚Äôs website. ‚ÄúOur fear that this virus would spread out of control as the colder months set in is now becoming a frightening reality,‚Äù Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city‚Äôs public school students will continue to attend classes virtually for the foreseeable future, district officials announced Tuesday. The announcement came on the same day Philadelphia public health officials saw a peak in confirmed virus cases and increased hospitalizations. The school district had planned to begin bringing back younger students for a hybrid in-person instruction model starting Nov. 30, with plans to phase in instruction for students with complex instructional needs and then older students next. ‚ÄúWe hope to see these students back in school before the spring,‚Äù Philadelphia district Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said, adding that it would ultimately depend on health experts and infection trends. About one-third of parents with students who would have been eligible to return had opted for in-person, part-time instruction that would have put students in classrooms two days a week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Employees of the state Senate are being told to work from home after three workers tested positive for the coronavirus, state officials said. The Senate‚Äôs roughly 50 workers were instructed to start working remotely Monday after three staffers tested positive over the weekend, The Providence Journal reports. They were told to work remotely for two weeks. The directive came from Gov. Gina Raimondo. Senate spokesman Greg Pare said the Senate president is ‚Äúfollowing that guidance and wants to do all he can to keep Senate staff members safe.‚Äù The House said it has no plans to shift to remote work. The new cases in the Senate were reported as the General Assembly looks for ways to gather for its first full sessions since July. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio previously said he is exploring whether meetings can be held at the Rhode Island Convention Center.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials in the state‚Äôs largest school district say the number of students who received an F in at least one class tripled this year, as the district adjusted learning because of the coronavirus pandemic. First-quarter report cards show a little more than 16,000 students in Greenville County Schools had an F. That compares to roughly 5,300 students with at least one failing grade in the first quarter last year. The pandemic has limited in-person teaching for the district‚Äôs 75,000 students, and Associate Superintendent of Academics Jeff McCoy said that likely was a factor in the jump in Fs. He also cited the stress of the crisis on families and the emergency shutdown of schools in the spring. Still, the district wasn‚Äôt expecting such a big increase in the number of struggling students. McCoy said the report cards show a much larger proportion of virtual students are receiving failing grades compared to in-person students.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The mayor cast the tie-breaking vote that defeated a proposed mask mandate in the state‚Äôs largest city Tuesday night. After more than two hours of public comment, Mayor Paul TenHaken rejected the mandate after the City Council tied 4-4 on the ordinance. The mandate would have required face coverings to be worn by people in most indoor public places where 6-foot social distancing was not achievable. Violations carried a $50 fine. ‚ÄúI believe the small uptick we‚Äôll see in compliance is not worth the community division that this will create,‚Äù TenHaken said as he ended debate. Councilor Greg Neitzert said he did not want to live in a city where people are calling the police because someone isn‚Äôt wearing a mask. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just about health,‚Äù Neitzert said. ‚ÄúWe also have to look at principles.‚Äù The Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce opposed it. Several faith leaders in the city supported the mandate.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that he‚Äôs looking to include ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù teacher pay raises in next year‚Äôs budget despite facing financial crunches brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee had originally proposed funneling an additional $117 million to K-12 teacher salaries earlier this year before the virus outbreak began rippling across the state. If approved, the starting minimum annual salary for teachers would have increased from $36,000 to $40,000 over the next two years. Yet months later, Lee was forced to strip the teacher funding boost, as well as many other budget initiatives, as officials braced for funding shortfalls. However, Tennessee‚Äôs revenues have come in slightly higher than originally projected over the past three months, allowing Lee‚Äôs administration to remain slightly optimistic that it will be able to fund some new measures rather than have to dip into rainy day funds.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state has become the first with more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases as the nation continues to face a surge of infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University early Wednesday. The nation‚Äôs second-most populous state has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases with 19,337 deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to the count on the Johns Hopkins website. Texas recorded 10,865 new cases Tuesday, setting a new daily record that surpassed by 74 cases an old mark set July 15, state officials said. According to state figures Tuesday, an estimated 132,146 cases are active, the most since Aug. 17, and 6,170 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, the most since Aug. 18. There were 94 new deaths Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Meanwhile, cases of the coronavirus are surging in the Laredo area, health officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A group of teachers has organized an event to encourage educators across the state to call in sick and use the day off to get tested for the coronavirus amid a surge in confirmed infection cases. ‚ÄúThere are no testing requirements for teachers or students currently,‚Äù Granite School District teacher Lindsay Plummer said. Some teachers believe the ‚Äútest out‚Äù planned for Thursday will prompt state leaders to do more to limit the spread of COVID-19 and increase safety protocols in classrooms, FOX13 reports. Plummer said the group was inspired to act following remarks made by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert on Sunday, when he put in place a statewide mask mandate. ‚ÄúThe goal of doing something like this is we want to push them to do more,‚Äù she said. The Utah Education Association said it is aware of event but is urging teachers to be patient. Herbert‚Äôs office has said all teachers have universal access to testing.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state on Tuesday suspended a program that allowed people from across the Northeast to visit Vermont without quarantining if they come from a county with a low rate of coronavirus infection. Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that the number of counties eligible ‚Äì listed on a map that uses red, orange and green to indicate eligibility ‚Äì has continued to shrink. As of Tuesday only two counties between Maine and Ohio were listed as green. ‚ÄúThe fact is, along with social gatherings, travel to and from other states without the proper quarantine continues to be one of the common denominators in our rising case counts,‚Äù Scott said. Essential travel ‚Äì such as work, school, medical care, personal safety, shared child custody or buying groceries ‚Äì is not affected, but people should only do what they need to do and then return home, he said. Vermont determined eligible counties as those with virus rates of less than 400 cases per million residents.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday announced plans to significantly increase statewide testing capacity and to launch a media campaign in southwest Virginia, which has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past month. The moves came three days after Virginia reported 2,103 new cases ‚Äì its biggest single-day increase in new cases since the start of the pandemic. On Tuesday, the state reported 1,435 new cases. The state‚Äôs seven-day moving average of new cases is 1,462. The seven-day testing positivity rate has also climbed from just under 5% a few weeks ago to 6.2% on Tuesday. Since the start of the pandemic, the state has recorded a total of 194,192 cases, with 3,726 deaths. Northam said he is focusing on mitigation efforts and continuing to encourage people to wear masks and practice social distancing. He said he is not currently considering ordering new restrictions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two hospitals near the city are struggling with COVID-19 outbreaks within the facilities. The Auburn Medical Center reported at least five employees and eight patients tested positive for the coronavirus, after an outbreak on a fourth-floor unit. The hospital said in a statement Tuesday that one patient died after the outbreak was detected late last week, The Seattle Times reports. The MultiCare hospital system, which owns the hospital, tested all 40 patients in the unit and 212 staffers who had worked there in the two-week period before the first positive test was reported, officials said. At St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton, at least six people have been infected since early November. CHI Franciscan, the hospital system that owns St. Michael, announced Tuesday that four patients and two employees have been infected to date. State health officials have reported 350 outbreaks in health care settings, including hospitals, since Oct. 24, a statewide outbreak report said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new high of 642 coronavirus cases Wednesday and seven deaths as the pandemic continued its march into rural enclaves. There are 277 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, slightly down from the peak of 290 last week. A total of 553 deaths have been linked to COVID-19. Virus-related deaths have increased 45% in the past month. The daily positivity rate is up to 5.9%, the highest it has been in about two months. ‚ÄúThe enemy is at our borders, and the enemy is coming at us right now,‚Äù Gov. Jim Justice said at a press briefing. Twenty-five counties had the most severe designation of virus spread, with 25 or more cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said all options are on the table for bringing new travel and business restrictions, but nothing is planned yet. ‚ÄúLegally, I can‚Äôt go out and start arresting people‚Äù for not wearing masks, Justice said in urging people to follow guidelines and get tested for the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers renewed his pleas Tuesday for people to stay home to avoid the coronavirus in an unusual prime-time speech hours after the state set new records for infections and deaths. The governor announced he was advising people to stay in their houses and businesses to allow people to work remotely, requiring masks, and limiting the number of people in stores and offices. He said projections show that if nothing changes, deaths could double to 5,000 by January. Evers has been imploring people to stay home and wear masks for months during twice-weekly afternoon news conferences to little avail. This time his office streamed his remarks live on his Facebook page and YouTube channel. ‚ÄúSo I want to be clear tonight: Each day this virus goes unchecked is a setback for our economic recovery,‚Äù Evers said. Republicans and their conservative allies have worked to block every Evers initiative to stop the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The son of a state representative who opposed COVID-19 public restrictions said his father was positive for the coronavirus when he died. Roy Edwards, 66, died Nov. 2 at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper after being hospitalized for more than a week with illness that was not immediately disclosed, The Gillette News Record reports. Edwards continued to oppose public restrictions resulting from the pandemic during his recent campaign to retain his House seat. He was reelected the day after he died. Mitch Edwards said his father initially experienced minor virus symptoms. He was told by a medical professional that he had sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinuses, and did not need to be tested for COVID-19. Roy Edwards was not advised to quarantine, but he did so as a a precaution, Mitch Edwards said. His symptoms worsened, and he had trouble breathing Oct. 23, when he again sought medical attention.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/14/president-biden-king-charles-speak-first-time-since-queens-death/10376984002/", "title": "President Biden, King Charles speak for first time since queen's death", "text": "WASHINGTON ‚Äì President Joe Biden on Wednesday personally offered condolences to King Charles III in his first conversation with the new king since the death of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\"I recalled her kindness, dignity, and constancy ‚Äì and how she deepened the friendship between our nations,\" Biden tweeted.\n\nBiden also told the king he hopes \"to continue a close relationship with him.\"\n\nThe White House has not said what meetings Biden might have with Britain‚Äôs new prime minister or others while in England for the queen‚Äôs funeral.\n\n'Used beans' and 'The Talking Hat':Queen Elizabeth's visits with presidents didn't always go as planned\n\nBiden on a bus?:Brits say president, other world leaders to be escorted to queen's funeral in coaches\n\nBiden had known the queen for three decades and had met her three times, most recently in June 2021, when she hosted him and the first lady at Windsor Castle during their visit to the U.K. to attend the Group of Seven leaders' summit.\n\nAfter that visit, Biden told reporters the queen was \"very gracious\" and said he invited her to the White House.

Tell us how we can make chips without spending all this money. Tell us how we can be safer, you don‚Äôt have to worry about your kids as much as you do today,‚Äù South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said in remarks at the AFPI conference in advance of Trump‚Äôs speech. ‚ÄúYou did it once, you can do it again.‚Äù\n\nWhich, well, let me just stop you there.\n\nThe notion being put forward by Graham, that Trump has a) given a serious policy address and b) painted a ‚Äúhopeful‚Äù vision for America is simply false.\n\nGo back to Trump‚Äôs two most famous/infamous speeches: The one to kickoff his 2016 presidential campaign and the one he delivered at his 2017 inauguration.\n\nThe first is defined in the public‚Äôs mind by Trump‚Äôs insistence that ‚Äúwhen Mexico sends its people, they‚Äôre not sending their best. ‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre bringing drugs. They‚Äôre bringing crime. They‚Äôre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.‚Äù\n\n(In that same speech, Trump blasted his opponents for their lack of understanding about air conditioning, bragged about his crowd size and called the US as a ‚Äúdumping ground for everybody else‚Äôs problems.‚Äù)\n\nHopeful!\n\nThen there was Trump‚Äôs inauguration speech, which is remembered for Trump‚Äôs evocation of ‚ÄúAmerican carnage‚Äù in describing the current state of the country.\n\nUplifting!\n\nThe simple fact is that Trump‚Äôs appeal has NEVER been about policies or a hopeful vision. It‚Äôs always been totally and completely about Trump himself ‚Äì and the roiling sense of grievance, nostalgia and score-settling that sits at the center of his personality.\n\nSure, there have been issues that embodied that sentiment. Trump voters rallied behind his call to build a border wall ‚Äì and make Mexico pay for it ‚Äì because it sounded tough and freaked out liberal elites. His foreign policy stances appealed to voters who wanted America to go back to the take-no-prisoners approach they remembered from decades ago. (That such an American foreign policy stance never existed was besides the point for these folks.)\n\nTrump‚Äôs ever-shifting views on, well, most things, was the clearest evidence that his winning campaign ‚Äì and the four years he spent in the White House ‚Äî weren‚Äôt about advancing some broader theory of the case. They were about Trump doing whatever felt good at the moment ‚Äì and the cult of personality that grew up around his many maneuvers. (In 2017, the New Yorker wrote a great piece about conservative intellectuals who tried to put an ideological framework around Trumpism. Which, well, ha!)\n\nNow to Trump‚Äôs speech on Tuesday.\n\nHe said the country was ‚Äúon the brink‚Äù and the weakest that it has been since the Civil War.

He said, ‚ÄúOur streets are riddled with needles and soaked with the blood of innocent victims.‚Äù He decried ‚Äúdrugged-out lunatics‚Äù and ‚Äúsadists‚Äù who he insisted are taking over the country. ‚ÄúOur country is now a cesspool of crime,‚Äù said Trump.\n\nHis policy solution? ‚ÄúIt has to stop and it has to stop now.‚Äù\n\nWhich, well, color me unsurprised.\n\nThe Point: The appeal of Trump to voters has never, ever been about a policy or a set of policies.

ANDREWS, Scotland - Rory McIlroy had said all the right things in his post-round news conference and with those duties complete, he slumped into a four-passenger golf cart and buried his head into wife Erica's left shoulder and all the emotions came flooding out.\n\nThe 150th Open Championship, the one McIlroy labeled his Holy Grail earlier in the week, was his to win or lose. After sharing the 54-hole lead with Viktor Hovland, McIlroy had built a two-stroke lead with nine holes to go. The World No. 2 had his strut back this week and was playing chess against the fabled seaside links in a way that would have made past champions here like Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods proud.\n\nMcIlroy could almost taste the alcohol he surely would have consumed from the Claret Jug once he regained possession of the winner's trophy for the first time since 2014 and ended his nearly eight-year winless drought.\n\nOnly problem is Cameron Smith of Australia had other plans and vaulted into the lead by reeling off five back-nine birdies in a row en route to shooting 8-under 64 at the Old Course. McIlroy, who closed in 2-under 70, two shots back, and finished in third, was left to wonder what more he had to do claim his elusive fifth major title.\n\nBRITISH OPEN:Cameron Smith seals victory with spectacular final-round 64\n\nCAMERON SMITH:British Open winner is 'going to find out how many beers' fit in Claret Jug\n\nSPORTS NEWSLETTER:Sign up now to get daily updates in your inbox\n\n\"I'll be OK,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, it's not life or death. I'll have other chances to win the Open Championship and other chances to win majors. It's one that I feel like I let slip away, but there will be other opportunities.\"\n\nExcept he didn't look OK as he drove off. He rued failing to convert on birdie chances at Nos. 3, 6 and 9, which could have nipped Smith's charge in the bud. McIlroy hit every green in regulation in the final round and had a wonderful sense of speed with his putter, but he picked a bad time for it to go cold. He didn't make a single putt of consequence.\n\n\"I felt like I didn't do much wrong today, but I didn't do much right either,\" he said. \"It's just one of those days where I played a really controlled round of golf. I did what I felt like I needed to just apart from capitalizing on the easier holes - around the turn, 9, 12, 14. If I had made the birdies there from good positions, it probably would have been a different story.\"\n\nThis one will hurt because McIlroy knows he had every chance to stop Smith, but with every birdie by Smith, his confidence grew and the pressure on McIlroy tightened.\n\n\"I can't be too despondent because of how this year's went and this year's going,\" he said. \"I'm playing some of the best golf I've played in a long time. So it's just a matter of keep knocking on the door, and eventually one will open.\"\n\nBut despondent is what he looked like as he hid his face in his wife's embrace. He finished second at the Masters, eighth at the PGA Championship, T-5 at the U.S. Open, and third at the Open - a banner-type year for Rickie Fowler in 2014 but for McIlroy it is close but no cigar. The end result is a failure and like Vesuvius he has to wait until April to begin the quest of pushing the ball up the mountain again.\n\nIt hurt because he admitted that he had dreamed of winning the 150th and allowed himself moments to look ahead and think about what it might be like to hold the trophy and be celebrated on the 18th green as the Champion Golfer of the Year.\n\n\"I'm only human. I'm not a robot. Of course, you think about it, and you envision it, and you want to envision it,\" he said. \"My hotel room is directly opposite the big yellow board on 18 there right of the first. And every time I go out, I'm trying to envision McIlroy at the top name on that leaderboard and how did that feel? At the start of the day, it was at the top, but at the start of tomorrow, it won't be.\"\n\nIt's enough to make even one of the greatest golfers in the world bury his face in his wife's warm embrace.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2021/12/04/nft-apple-metaverse-2022-predictions/8803081002/", "title": "From NFTs to Apple and the metaverse: What 2022 holds for the tech", "text": "Peter Csathy\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nJust when we thought it was safe to get back into the real world, new COVID variants emerge to brush us back ‚Äì continuing to transform all aspects of our lives. While nothing is more powerful than real physical human connection, the digital virtual tech-driven world was the big story for media and entertainment in 2021.\n\nIn particular, 2021 marked the coming out party for the blockchain ‚Äì a kind of transformational decentralized Web 3.0 world. In the world of media, the headline blockchain story took its form in so-called non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Blockchain blows up in 2022\n\nAfter early experimentation in 2021, 2022 will mark the year creators truly begin to embrace and leverage the power of the blockchain at scale. Just like iPhones ushered in a whole new mobile-first world of content 15 years ago, so-called Web 3.0 ushers in a whole new transformational world for originators of intellectual property, or IP, to directly reach and monetize their audiences. In the process, creators take back at least some of the power of mega tech platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Apple that built their trillion-dollar-plus valuations on their backs.\n\n2. NFTs a new venue for fans\n\nAnd 2022 will mark the year superfans will use their collective decentralized power to fuel creativity from their favorite artists via blockchain-related opportunities. Most in the entertainment world still focus on Beeple‚Äôs $69-million digital art NFT as being the blockchain‚Äôs poster child.\n\nBut instead they should be thinking of NFTs as new direct and directly monetizing channels of super-fandom ‚Äì opening up membership into exclusive new clubs. If few in the world of media now know of CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club and DAOs in general (decentralized autonomous organizations), that changes in 2022. The blockchain, NFTs and DAOs are no momentary fads. They are long-term game-changers. Like it or not, the Los Angeles-based Staples Center‚Äôs new ‚ÄúCrypto.com Arena‚Äù moniker is here to stay.

Big action to come against Big Tech\n\nThe new mega-media platforms of Facebook (or Meta, actually), Google, Apple, and Amazon face a more immediate threat than the blockchain and related new decentralized social platforms in 2022, as big government finally takes big action against big tech in advance of 2022‚Äôs mid-term elections. Facebook and Zuckerberg are first to feel the pinch, as the Feds force Facebook to shed Instagram (and perhaps set some real rules to limit unbridled ad and AI-driven algorithmic devastation, both on young people and society itself).

Apple leads the way to the metaverse\n\nFaced with these threats, Facebook tries to run and hide with its new Meta moniker (the quintessential ‚Äúlipstick on a pig‚Äù), but real metaverse innovation comes from others, including Apple. Yes, Apple‚Äôs AR glasses ultimately will drive some of that innovation. But Apple already sports the ultimate wearable ‚Äì AirPods (now a $20-billion business by itself). AirPods will become the first major gateway into the metaverse ‚Äì outside of the games industry ‚Äì much like Apple drove mass consumer adoption in the mobile world with the iPhone. Expect micro-cameras to be incorporated into higher-end, extremely expensive versions of AirPods that will enable visual experiences. I can see you lining up at your local Apple store already.\n\n‚ñ∫What is the metaverse anyway? Everyone wants to own the metaverse including Facebook and Microsoft\n\n5. Games + crossovers = metaverse magic\n\nSpeaking of games, that industry will continue to lead all other categories of entertainment content by an order of magnitude and increasingly show the way for artists and creators to emerge and build audiences. Before the tragedy of Astroworld, Travis Scott broke out into the metaverse in 2020 via \"Fortnite\" to the tune of 50 million viewers who drove a No. 1 hit. Ariana Grande shattered those numbers this past year, and the marriage of games and music grows stronger in 2022 as music licensing for games becomes a massive new revenue stream.\n\n‚ñ∫From Facebook to Fortnite:The metaverse is calling. Are we ready?\n\n6. Get paid to play\n\nMedia and tech business models will continue to fundamentally evolve, particularly in light of the havoc wreaked by ad-driven business models from the two major culprits of Facebook and Google. We‚Äôve already seen the shift from single transactions to subscription-based recurring revenue bundles (Amazon Prime, Apple One, Disney+). That will accelerate in 2022. And move over ‚Äúfree to play‚Äù business models in the world of games. Now, thanks to the blockchain, welcome to an entirely new ‚Äúplay to earn‚Äù model that literally pays players to play (and gives them fractional ownership in the games they play). Why work when you can play? Other parts of the entertainment industry will continue to look to the world of games for inspiration and innovation, because that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs happening.\n\n7. In battle for screen dominance, Disney beats Netflix\n\nDisney+ will grow more rapidly than Netflix ‚Äì and begin to close the gap in terms of global paid members ‚Äì as the Mouse House begins to unlock significantly more dollars to produce originals. And don‚Äôt forget Disney‚Äôs ‚Äúspecial sauce‚Äù that Netflix can‚Äôt touch ‚Äì Disney‚Äôs priceless crown jewels of content ‚Äì i.e., the Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Avengers, and Disney Princess franchises. Just imagine the NFTs Disney can (and will) create with those timeless characters (which, in turn, will drive more Disney+ subscriptions/memberships). Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple will also quietly raise their own originals ante as they too accelerate their media ambitions ‚Äì but for decidedly different ends. Amazon and Apple use content as marketing and to drive customer loyalty ‚Äì to draw us in and create an ongoing customer relationship so we spend more time (and cash) in their walled gardens. And in the thirst for new content, expect more media production company acquisitions in 2022. The big buy in 2021 was Reese Witherspoon‚Äôs Hello Sunshine. Indie idol A24 will be the big prize for 2022.\n\n8. Musicians to harness the power of NFTs\n\nMusic will continue its double-digit growth ‚Äì fueled by accelerating streaming via broader global broadband connectivity, entirely new royalty-paying platforms (Facebook, TikTok, Peloton), the growing ubiquity of smart speakers and, yes, transformational blockchain-fueled opportunities like NFTs. Perhaps most notably ‚Äì and most notably absent in the minds of most executives still today ‚Äì superfans will directly drive significantly more dollars into the pockets of their favorite artists. Billions have been left on the table in the past. Not any longer.\n\n‚ñ∫Making music and history:In her return, singer Shontelle deploys NFTs in song of empowerment\n\n9.You could help finance the next big Hollywood entertainment project\n\nExpect the retail market ‚Äì that's you and me, the superfans ‚Äì to directly finance and even buy fractional pieces of content from our favorite artists. In a world of content increasingly being ‚Äúking,‚Äù private equity has pumped billions of dollars into the world of music acquisitions for the likes of Stevie Nicks and Bob Dylan. But that kind of content ownership will not be just for the ‚Äúbig boys‚Äù in 2022. NFTs will help fuel the way. And superfan-fueled crowd-funding and IP ownership aren‚Äôt just for the world of music. The retail market will open up an entirely new world of financing for producers of film and television. Hey, Hollywood, check out ‚ÄúThe Chosen.‚Äù If you don‚Äôt know about it, you should.\n\n10. Live entertainment is back, but forever changed\n\nMusic festivals and other mega-live entertainment experiences will continue to open up in 2022 due to pent up demand for real, physical interaction and lasting shared experiences in our increasingly heads-down digital, virtual world. But these large-scale live events are forever changed as a result of the twin tragedies of COVID and Astroworld. Crowd control, mitigation and broader safety and security efforts and focus will transform overall planning and execution ‚Äì not to mention the overall ‚Äúfestival experience‚Äù for those who attend.\n\nThere you have it ‚Äì 10 predictions for our increasingly tech-driven world of media and entertainment in 2022.\n\nPeter Csathy is the chairman of CREATV Media & Deep Cuts Media, a media, entertainment & tech-focused business development, M&A and advisory firm.

Republicans Reps. Matt Simpson of Daphne and Chris Pringle of Mobile told Al.com they plan bills next year to increase penalties for distributing the deadly drug that accounted for 66% of all U.S. overdose deaths in 2021. Under Simpson‚Äôs proposal, prison sentences would increase based on the weight of fentanyl distributed in Alabama. Similar laws exist in other states, but Simpson‚Äôs proposal would be among the harshest. Traffickers caught with more than 8 grams of fentanyl could face a life sentence under his plan. ‚ÄúThis is not the run-of-the-mill old-time drugs that there used to be,‚Äù Simpson said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the pot of the ‚Äô70s or the cocaine of the ‚Äô80s. I hate to say it, but it‚Äôs not the meth of the early 2000s. It‚Äôs highly potent and deadly.‚Äù Around Birmingham in Jefferson County, health officials report a 118% jump in fentanyl-related deaths from 2019 to 2022, though this year still has more than three months remaining. Pringle‚Äôs legislation allows a felony manslaughter charge against someone who is not a licensed pharmacist who sells an illicit pill that causes death.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A landslide triggered by record rainfall significantly damaged three homes, prompted the evacuation of about a dozen residents and caused power outages in the capital city‚Äôs downtown. Geological assessment teams determined Tuesday that favorable weather has returned the threat level to pre-slide levels. The city‚Äôs public works department was preparing to begin removing debris, city spokesperson Meredith Thatcher said. Of the three homes, one was completely destroyed as it came down the mountain and slammed into a second home, which was significantly damaged but remains standing, she said. The extent of damage to the third home was not yet known. Residents will be allowed to return to their homes at their own discretion. ‚ÄúIf you feel comfortable going home, you can go home,‚Äù Thatcher said. The local power company was expected to restore service after the debris has been removed to the point where crews need to work. Damage from the Monday evening landslide was confined to the one residential street above the downtown business district in the southeast Alaska mountain community of about 32,000 residents. There were no reported injuries, city officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A state scholarship program to train teachers doesn‚Äôt have enough money to serve all who are interested, and some universities are implementing waitlists and other cutbacks. The Arizona Teachers Academy is facing a $13 million budget shortfall, limiting its ability to produce new teachers at a time Arizona desperately needs them. The lack of funding comes even as the state sees record budget surpluses. The program has about $21 million on hand ‚Äì not enough even to match last school year‚Äôs spending of nearly $25 million, the vast majority of which went to student scholarships for the more than 3,300 people enrolled. ‚ÄúThe impact of a budget shortfall will surely reduce the number of future students who enroll in teacher-prep programs,‚Äù Carole Basile, dean of Arizona State University‚Äôs Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, wrote in an email. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not an outcome Arizonans want and it‚Äôs not an outcome the state of Arizona can afford.‚Äù A survey by the Arizona School Personnel Administrators Association found the state‚Äôs teacher shortage has deepened, with initial findings showing 66% of the surveyed districts had more teacher vacancies this year than last. The state funds tuition and fees in teacher preparation programs, and in exchange, students commit to teaching in Arizona public schools for the number of years they were funded.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A state senator won‚Äôt have access to Senate offices and can‚Äôt participate in legislative meetings after the chamber on Tuesday ruled he made a frivolous ethics complaint against a fellow lawmaker in retaliation for sanctions he received earlier this year. By a 26-4 vote, the majority-Republican Arizona Senate approved its ethics committee‚Äôs recommendation to suspend GOP Sen. Alan Clark for the rest of the 93rd General Assembly, which ends Jan. 8. The Senate earlier this month rejected a complaint Clark had filed against Democratic Sen. Stephanie Flowers accusing her of improperly receiving per diem payments for legislative meetings she attended via Zoom. The ethics panel ruled that Clark had filed the complaint as retaliation after the Senate stripped him and another lawmaker of their leadership posts because Clark sought reimbursement for a meeting he didn‚Äôt attend. ‚ÄúThe committee felt that the comments and actions of Sen. Clark, including bringing these ethics petitions for the purpose of retaliation, were bringing dishonor and disruption to the institution of the Senate,‚Äù Republican Sen. Kim Hammer, who chairs the ethics committee, told senators before the vote. Clark didn‚Äôt attend Tuesday‚Äôs proceedings, citing a long-planned trip with his family and said his attorneys would not have been able to attend.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Homeless people and their advocates sued the city Tuesday, demanding that it stop harassing and destroying the belongings of people living on the streets with nowhere to go ‚Äì and with the goal of forcing the city to spend billions of dollars on affordable homes that will keep residents housed. The Lawyers‚Äô Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area and others filed the lawsuit in federal court on behalf of the Coalition on Homelessness and seven individuals who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. Defendants include the city, several city departments and Mayor London Breed. The complaint says San Francisco ‚Äúpresents the image of a caring municipality‚Äù with a plan to address homelessness, but decades of inaction on affordable housing have left thousands forced to use tents and vehicles as shelter. An annual homelessness survey found 7,754 homeless people in San Francisco in 2022, with nearly 60% living unsheltered. Not only has the city failed to construct affordable housing, according to the complaint, but the city also uses heavy-handed tactics to get homeless people to move, threatening to arrest or actually arresting people, as well as taking people‚Äôs belongings in early morning encampment sweeps in which shelter is not offered, as required by law.\n\nColorado\n\nGreeley: A 20-year-old woman who was seriously injured when the parked police patrol vehicle in which she was detained was struck by a freight train in northern Colorado has been released from the hospital. Yareni Rios-Gonzalez, of Greeley, is recovering at home with nine broken ribs, a broken arm, a fractured sternum, and numerous other injuries to her head and back, her attorney, Paul Wilkinson, told KUSA-TV. ‚ÄúShe is bedridden. She can move around a little bit. She also has a fractured leg that she wasn‚Äôt initially aware of,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs still really, really hurt.‚Äù Multiple law enforcement agencies responded to a report of a road rage incident involving a firearm in Fort Lupton on Sept. 16. A Platteville police officer stopped Rios-Gonzalez‚Äôs car just past a set of railroad tracks and parked the patrol vehicle on the crossing. She was placed in the back of the police vehicle, which was hit as officers were searching her car. Police bodycam and dashcam video shows officers scrambling as the train approaches and slams into the patrol vehicle, parked squarely on the tracks. One officer repeatedly says, ‚ÄúOh my God.‚Äù And another yells, ‚ÄúStay back,‚Äù as the train‚Äôs horn blares before the crash. Video shows officers running toward the mangled, crushed vehicle through what appears to be a debris field left by the impact. No one has been charged in the alleged road rage incident or the crash.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Lawyers for Randy Cox, a Black man who was paralyzed from the chest down in June when a police van without seat belts braked suddenly, filed a $100 million lawsuit Tuesday against the city. Cox, 36, was being driven to a police station in the city June 19 for processing on a weapons charge when the driver braked hard, apparently to avoid a collision, causing Cox to fly headfirst into the wall of the van, police said. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump said Cox‚Äôs legal team is still in talks with the city but filed a federal negligence lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court to make sure Cox is compensated for his suffering. ‚ÄúIf we say we respect life and respect Randy Cox‚Äôs life experiences and people like Randy Cox, similarly situated, then we have to show that by action, not just by rhetoric,‚Äù Crump said. In the lawsuit, the city and the officers involved in Cox‚Äôs transport are accused of negligence, recklessness, use of excessive force, denial of medical treatment and the intentional infliction of emotional distress. Cox‚Äôs supporters say the police mocked his cries for help after he was injured and accused him of being drunk and faking his injuries. Police video shows the officers dragged him by his feet from the van and placed him in a holding cell at the police department before paramedics finally took him to a hospital.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Most people incarcerated in the state hail from Wilmington, Dover and Seaford, a new report from the Prison Policy Initiative found. Prison gerrymandering ‚Äì the practice of counting incarcerated people as residents of the prison rather than their last home in the census ‚Äì was outlawed in Delaware in 2010. That move allowed think tanks to determine where most of the people in the state‚Äôs prisons are actually from. The calculations are based on data from the 2020 census and information provided by prisons about the majority of their population. The findings paint a grim but not unexpected picture: People incarcerated in Delaware often come from cities with higher poverty rates and more Black residents. Wilmington has the highest incarceration rate of any city in Delaware, according to the nonprofit Prison Policy Initiative. Over 1% of residents are incarcerated, and with the largest population in the state, the think tank has given Wilmington the ‚Äúdubious distinction‚Äù of having the most people actually incarcerated in addition to the highest rate. Excluding towns, Seaford has the second-highest incarceration rate in the state ‚Äì 748 people behind bars per 100,000 residents. It‚Äôs followed by Dover, which had 680 people incarcerated per 100,000 residents as of 2020.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Singer and flutist Lizzo paid a special visit to the Library of Congress on Monday while on tour in D.C., WUSA-TV reports. The performer gave Tuesday‚Äôs audience at her Capitol One Arena show quite the treat,when she surprised everyone by performing on a historical 200-year-old crystal flute. According to the Library of Congress, a French fluter made the ornate instrument in 1813 specifically for President James Madison in honor of his second inauguration. The iconic moment started with a simple social media exchange. Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden tweeted an invitation for Lizzo to visit the world‚Äôs largest flute collection, housed at the D.C. institution. After making a stop at the library to tour the collection and practice on a few instruments, Lizzo‚Äôs dream became reality when she got the chance to play the historic flute on stage Tuesday night. Handlers brought the flute onstage to Lizzo, who carefully accepted the historical instrument and carried it to a microphone. She played relatively few notes ‚Äì adding a few of her signature moves ‚Äì then returned the flute and ran back to her mic. ‚ÄúI just twerked and played James Madison‚Äôs crystal flute from the 1800s.‚Äù she shouted. ‚ÄúWe just made history tonight!‚Äù Lizzo thanked the Library of Congress for ‚Äúpreserving our history and making history freaking cool.‚Äù\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: The polluted leftovers of the state‚Äôs phosphate fertilizer mining industry, more than 1 billion tons in ‚Äústacks‚Äù that resemble enormous ponds, are at risk for leaks or other contamination as Hurricane Ian comes ashore in the state, environmental groups say. Florida has 24 such phosphogypsum stacks, most of them concentrated in mining areas in the central part of the state. About 30 million tons of this slightly radioactive waste are generated every year, according to the Florida Industrial and Phosphate Research Institute. ‚ÄúA major storm event like the one we are bracing for can inundate the facilities with more water than the open-air ponds can handle,‚Äù Ragan Whitlock, staff attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity environmental group, said in an email Tuesday. ‚ÄúWe are extremely concerned about the potential impacts Hurricane Ian may have on phosphate facilities around the state.‚Äù A leak in March 2021 at a stack called Piney Point resulted in the release of an estimated 215 million gallons of polluted water into Tampa Bay and caused massive fish kills. State officials, overseen by a court-appointed receiver, are working with a $100 million appropriation to shut down that long-troubled location.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state ran a surplus of more than $6 billion in the budget year that ended June 30, meaning the next governor and lawmakers could spend or give back billions. The State Accounting Office, in a Friday report, said Georgia ran a $6.37 billion surplus even after spending $28.6 billion in state taxes and fees in the 2022 budget year. Total state general fund receipts rose a whopping 22%. Even after filling its rainy day fund to the legal maximum, Georgia has $6.58 billion in ‚Äúunreserved, undesignated‚Äù surplus ‚Äì cash that leaders can spend however they want. Some money is already spoken for, with the state likely to transfer more than $1 billion to pay for roads, bridges and other transportation projects. That would make up for the state‚Äôs decision in March to waive its gasoline tax of 29.1 cents per gallon and its diesel tax of 32.6 cents per gallon. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has repeatedly extended the tax breaks since then, a move lawmakers must ratify when they return in January. Kemp, running for reelection against Democrat Stacey Abrams, has designs on an additional $2 billion of the surplus, pledging to give another $1 billion in state income tax rebates, plus spending $1 billion to renew a long-dormant property tax break for homeowners.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Department of Health said Tuesday it has fined the U.S. Navy $8.8 million for repeatedly discharging untreated or partially treated sewage into state waters from Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. The department said in a news release that it recorded 766 counts of the Navy discharging pollutants in excess of limits established by a permit. The pollutants were released between January 2020 and July 2022 from the Hawaii Wastewater Treatment Pant operated by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, the department said. The agency also found 212 counts of operation and maintenance failures. ‚ÄúThe Navy‚Äôs failure to properly operate and maintain this wastewater treatment plant led to the pollution of state waters,‚Äù said Kathleen Ho, the department‚Äôs deputy director of environmental health, in a statement. ‚ÄúWe are taking action to protect our state‚Äôs water resources and to hold the Navy accountable to make critical repairs and prevent a potential catastrophic failure of the facility.‚Äù Navy Region Hawaii said the Navy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency agreed in June 2021 to address deficiencies with the treatment plant. The Navy is on track to meet these obligations, which may also address some of the issues pointed out by Hawaii‚Äôs Department of Health, it said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Embattled Boise Police Chief Ryan Lee has resigned at the request of the Mayor Lauren McLean. The city‚Äôs announcement came Friday afternoon after KTVB reported last week that nine officers had filed complaints against Lee and after an investigation into an allegation that he injured a high-ranking officer during a training demonstration last year. Sgt. Kirk Rush has said Lee broke parts of his neck during the demonstration, which required surgery to repair. Clearwater Prosecutor Clayne Tyler late last month told officials that while he felt there was probable cause to support charging Lee with felony battery, he wasn‚Äôt sure he could prove the crime in court. Lee‚Äôs attorney Chuck Peterson said earlier this year that Rush‚Äôs claims were ‚Äúcompletely untrue.‚Äù McLean told the Idaho Statesman on Friday that she was having ‚Äúconversations about management‚Äù and examining Lee‚Äôs role within the department. Boise City spokesperson Maria Weeg told KTVB: ‚ÄúIt became clear to the mayor the department needed different leadership.‚Äù Lee‚Äôs resignation will take effect Oct. 14, but he will be placed on leave until then, city officials said in a statement. McLean has appointed retired officer Ron Winegar as acting chief.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Police filed eight felony counts Tuesday against a man who climbed five stories of a fire escape to infiltrate a police facility while officers were undergoing a SWAT training exercise. Donald Patrick, 47, of Waukegan, was charged with five counts of aggravated assault on a peace officer and three counts of burglary in the attack Monday at the facility in Homan Square on Chicago‚Äôs West Side. He‚Äôs due in bond court Wednesday. It wasn‚Äôt clear whether Patrick had an attorney who might comment on the charges. Patrick grabbed at least two guns before he was shot and wounded by an officer, police said. Patrick was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police Superintendent David Brown said the suspect was seen on video climbing the fire escape to the fifth floor, where a door had been propped open for ventilation because there are no windows. Brown said investigators believe the man grabbed at least two guns from a table and pointed them at officers. He said the guns did not contain live ammunition ‚Äì they were either empty or contained munitions, such as pellets that are used for training exercises. Pellets sting but do not cause serious injury or death.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A federal judge has barred the state from enforcing a 2016 law‚Äôs provisions that require abortion clinics to either bury or cremate fetal remains, finding that they violate the U.S. Constitution. U.S. District Judge Richard L. Young ruled that the law‚Äôs requirements infringe on the religious and free speech rights of people who do not believe aborted fetuses deserve the same treatment as deceased people. ‚ÄúThe Constitution prohibits ‚Äòmechanisms, overt or disguised, designed to persecute or oppress a religion or its practices.‚Äô The fetal disposition requirements are contrary to that principle,‚Äù Young wrote in Monday‚Äôs decision, which granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs who had sued the state. Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, a defendant in the lawsuit, said Tuesday that his office will appeal the ruling. The lawsuit was filed in 2020 on behalf of the Women‚Äôs Med Group abortion clinic in Indianapolis, its owner, two nurse practitioners who work at the clinic and three women who are each listed only as Jane Doe. Shortly after the law was signed in 2016 by then-Gov. Mike Pence, Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky and the ACLU of Indiana sued the state over the law.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A federal judge has struck down the third attempt by the Iowa Legislature to stop animal welfare groups from secretly filming livestock abuse, finding once again that the law passed last year violates free speech rights in the U.S. Constitution. The decision Monday rejected the law approved by state lawmakers in April 2021 that makes it a crime to trespass on a property to place a camera to record or transmit images. The law, which had support from Republicans and some Democrats, made the first offense punishable by up to two years in prison and subsequent offenses a felony. The case is one of many so-called ag-gag laws that have surfaced in the U.S. in recent years that pit the right of farmers to protect their property from trespassers against animal welfare advocates. Farmers argue intruders could track in disease and want to unfairly portray their livestock practices, while animal welfare groups say producers don‚Äôt want the public to see how farm animals are treated. The lawsuit was filed in federal court Aug. 10, 2021, by animal rights groups the Animal Legal Defense Fund, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and Bailing Out Benji. They were joined by environmental and grassroots advocacy groups Food & Water Watch and Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Sunflower State is defending its honor after a big-city mayor claimed that ‚ÄúKansas doesn‚Äôt have a brand.‚Äù New York Mayor Eric Adams said his city has a brand that‚Äôs recognizable around the world, unlike Kansas. ‚ÄúWe have a brand,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNew York has a brand. And when people see it, it means something. When we go there, it‚Äôs not ... Kansas doesn‚Äôt have a brand.‚Äù But Kansans took to social media Tuesday to challenge his assertion. For one, many noted, Superman ‚Äì whose motto was ‚Äútruth, justice and the American way‚Äù ‚Äì didn‚Äôt grow up in New York City or even his adopted hometown, Metropolis, but in the also-fictional Smallville, Kansas. And the Plains state gets far more recognition these days in sports than its coastal counterpart. The New York Jets and Giants both posted 22-59 records (points for consistency) from 2017 to 2021. Basketball hasn‚Äôt been particularly relevant in New York since the 1970s. Right now, the Kansas and Kansas State football programs are making more national headlines than the Jets and Giants. The Jayhawks are off to their first 4-0 start in more than a decade, and the Wildcats just upset the No. 6 team in the country on the road. In April, Kansas basketball won its fourth NCAA championship in school history. Famous Kansans include Jason Sudeikis, Paul Rudd, Annette Benning, Janelle Mon√°e, Melissa Etheridge and Elvira, to name a few. Another common retort was that Kansas has created a brand identity through its association with ‚ÄúThe Wizard of Oz,‚Äù in which a tornado leaves farm girl Dorothy Gale in the magical land of Oz, only to find that she most wants simply to go home.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Despite multiple lawsuits, expensive reviews and community outrage, the city‚Äôs police continue to pull over and search Black drivers at disproportionate rates. Since 2020, Black people have made up 33% of Louisville Metro Police Department traffic stops with a citation and 53% of searches while accounting for about 20% of the population 18 and older, an analysis of city data found. The disparities are consistent with previous analyses and independent reviews conducted since at least 2000. And as officials await results from a U.S. Justice Department investigation of the department, some community members say they‚Äôre proof LMPD‚Äôs self-imposed changes aren‚Äôt working. The mayor and police chief ‚Äúdid a city tour touting their reforms and their new policies, but that‚Äôs all theory,‚Äù said Khalilah Collins, a project manager for the DOVE Delegates pilot, which dispatches ‚Äúcommunity responders‚Äù trained in crisis intervention to some 911 calls. ‚ÄúThe numbers aren‚Äôt changing and/or are getting worse.‚Äù Some law experts were reluctant to say the data indicates racial bias without knowing more information about why the stops happened and what their outcomes were. Still, LMPD officials acknowledge enforcement disparities exist and said the department is ‚Äúmaking a serious investment into personnel and technology‚Äù that will allow it to better scrutinize traffic stops.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: As the state continues to be plagued by a spiraling insurance crisis, with insurers leaving the state and canceling homeowner policies as thousands of claims remain unpaid following a series of hurricanes, Gov. John Bel Edwards will travel to London this week to meet with a leading insurance underwriter. During the economic development trip, the Democratic governor‚Äôs sixth international trip, Edwards will also meet with high-ranking executives of major energy companies, including Shell, to discuss the company‚Äôs expanding portfolio of clean energy investments. On Sunday he will attend the New Orleans Saints game, which is being played in London as part of the NFL‚Äôs annual International Series. ‚ÄúI am excited to be able to capitalize on this opportunity to represent Louisiana‚Äôs economic and cultural interests on the world stage,‚Äù Edwards said in a press release Tuesday. ‚ÄúFew states are more directly impacted by the insurance underwriting and energy markets than Louisiana, which is why it‚Äôs so important to maintain an open dialogue with global leaders in those sectors.‚Äù Following a series of damaging hurricanes in 2020 and 2021 ‚Äì Delta, Laura, Zeta and Ida ‚Äì more than 610,000 residential property claims were filed in Louisiana, according to Louisiana Department of Insurance data.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A bargain hunter who went to an estate sale in Maine to find a KitchenAid mixer, a bookshelf or vintage clothing walked away with a 700-year-old treasure. Instead of a kitchen appliance, Will Sideri stumbled upon a framed document hanging on a wall. It had elaborate script in Latin, with musical notes and gold flourishes. A sticker said 1285 AD. Based on what he‚Äôd seen in a manuscripts class at Colby College, the document looked downright medieval ‚Äì and a bargain at $75. Academics confirmed the parchment was from The Beauvais Missal, used in the Beauvais Cathedral in France, and dated to the late 13th century. It was used about 700 years ago in Roman Catholic worship, they said. An expert on manuscripts said the document, first reported by the Maine Monitor, could be worth as much as $10,000. After spying the unusual manuscript, Sideri contacted his former Colby College professor, who was familiar with it because there‚Äôs another page in the college collection. The professor reached out to another academic who‚Äôd researched the document. They quickly confirmed the authenticity. The parchment was part of a prayer book and priests‚Äô liturgy, said Lisa Fagin Davis, executive director of the Medieval Academy of America and a professor of manuscript studies at Simmons University in Boston. The full missal was once owned by William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper publisher, before being sold in the 1940s and, much to the consternation of today‚Äôs academics, divvied up into individual pages, she said.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: A woman who said she was left to give birth to her baby alone on the dirty, concrete floor of her jail cell last year filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday alleging jail nurses ignored her screams and pleas for help for six hours. Jazmin Valentine alleges some nurses working for the jail‚Äôs contracted medical provider, PrimeCare Medical Inc., said she was withdrawing from drugs, not in labor, and some jail staffers and medical staff laughed at her, saying she was just trying to get out of her cell late at night in July 2021 at the Washington County jail in Hagerstown. Valentine claims she punched the walls of her solitary confinement cell, which did not have blankets or sheets, during her most painful contractions and removed what she believed was her baby‚Äôs amniotic sac, sliding it under her cell door to prove she was about to have a baby. A fellow inmate, hearing her pleas, called Valentine‚Äôs boyfriend, who called the jail pleading with staffers to help her, the lawsuit said. The nurses also ignored a concern raised by a jail deputy about Valentine, but he did not contact any superiors, the lawsuit said. He discovered Valentine holding the baby girl in her cell about 15 minutes after she was born, and an ambulance was called to take them to the hospital, according to the lawsuit. Because of the unsanitary conditions in the cell, the baby developed a type of staph bacteria infection that is resistant to many antibiotics, the lawsuit said. Valentine, who had never given birth before, said she feared her baby would die, and she might bleed out.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Federal workplace safety regulators have proposed fining a subcontractor nearly $1.2 million in connection with the death of a worker during the demolition of a downtown Boston parking garage. The worker was operating an 11,000-pound excavator in the Government Center Garage on March 26 when an upper floor gave way, and he fell 80 feet to his death, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration said in a statement Tuesday. It was his first day on the job. The worker has previously been identified as Peter Monsini, 51, of Easton. An investigation found that JDC Demolition Co. Inc. violated the demolition plan by placing heavy equipment on partially demolished floor bays, OSHA said. JDC also failed to adequately train its workers on the demolition plan and safety management systems, OSHA said. In total, JDC was cited for 11 alleged violations. ‚ÄúJDC Demolition Company Inc. knew the heavy equipment on the partially demolished floors were over the weight limits and still allowed a worker, unaware of the hazards, to do demolition work,‚Äù OSHA Regional Administrator Galen Blanton said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Belle Isle Nature Center reopened Wednesday ‚Äì with a $2.5million makeover ‚Äì after being closed since March 2020. Located on 5 acres at the northeastern tip of Belle Isle State Park, the Belle Isle Nature Center boasts educational, environmental and natural experiences that help connect visitors with urban nature. Highlights of the upgraded facility include an expanded mudpuppy habitat, a replica Detroit sewer tunnel and a pollinator area that allows guests to see how bumblebees experience their world. ‚ÄúWe are so proud of this new facility, and after more than two years of being closed, we are ready to show everyone what we have been working on,‚Äù Amy Greene, nature centers director for the Detroit Zoological Society, said in a news release. ‚ÄúWe have so many new and exciting features for guests to explore.‚Äù The new experiences are designed to give visitors the opportunity to connect with nature while also learning how to celebrate and save wildlife and wild places found in their own backyards and communities. ‚ÄúThe Belle Isle Nature Center is truly unique,‚Äù Greene said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve completely reimagined a new nature center that puts the focus on urban wildlife. Our intention is to reinforce the connections people have and the spaces they share with the nature that surrounds us.‚Äù\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Democratic Gov. Tim Walz has $3.2 million in cash on hand heading into the final weeks of the campaign, while Republican challenger Scott Jensen has $916,000 left in the bank. The Jensen campaign said it raised $1.8 million in the two-month reporting before Tuesday‚Äôs filing deadline to bring its total for the campaign cycle to $4.2 million. The campaign said in a statement Wednesday that it was a new record for a Minnesota GOP gubernatorial candidate, beating the $3.3 million that then-Gov. Tim Pawlenty raised for his 2006 campaign. The Walz campaign said it raised $1.73 million in the same period, which ended Sept. 20, for a grand total for the election cycle of $4.4 million. In other statewide races, Democratic Attorney General Keith Ellison‚Äôs campaign reported it had $923,000 in cash on hand after raising $996,000 since Jan. 1. GOP candidate Jim Schultz reported raising $775,000 this year and had $321,000 left. Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon had $967,000 in cash on hand after raising $799,000 this year, while Republican challenger Kim Crockett had $119,000 left after collecting $286,000.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Years before residents were left without running water for weeks, Gov. Tate Reeves claimed to have helped block money to fund water system repairs in the capital city. Reeves, a Republican, blames Jackson‚Äôs water crisis on mismanagement at the city level. The city‚Äôs latest water troubles are far from its first, stemming from decaying infrastructure beyond one water treatment plant. The EPA said 300 boil-water notices have been issued over the past two years in the city. As Reeves climbed Mississippi‚Äôs political ladder, he cited his opposition to financially helping the capital as evidence of his fiscal conservatism. Jackson-area lawmakers say the troubled water system is one example of Jackson‚Äôs status as a political punching bag for Republican officials, who control the Legislature and the state Bond Commission. ‚ÄúWe operate under the golden rule here,‚Äù said Democratic Sen. John Horhn of Jackson. ‚ÄúAnd the golden rule is: He who has the gold makes the rules.‚Äù In Jackson, 80% of residents are Black, and 25% live in poverty. Repeated breakdowns made it unsafe for people to drink from their tap, brush their teeth and wash their dishes without boiling the water first. At a September news conference, Reeves said water service was restored to most of the city only after the state ‚Äústepped in‚Äù to provide emergency repairs.\n\nMissouri\n\nStockton: A judge on Tuesday allowed a Christian boarding school to remain open for now, scheduling two days of hearings in October to determine its fate after multiple current and former students alleged widespread abuse. Cedar County Associate Circuit Judge Thomas Pyle‚Äôs ruling came a day after he took over the case involving Agape Boarding School in Stockton. The Missouri attorney general‚Äôs office had asked Pyle to close the school after requesting the new judge for the case previously presided over by Cedar County Circuit Judge David Munton. The state didn‚Äôt say why it sought a new judge. Pyle also approved the state‚Äôs request to again place Missouri Department of Social Services workers at Agape. On Monday, Munton lifted the order allowing state workers at the school. They had been there to monitor for abuse since Sept. 8. Two days of hearings to determine Agape‚Äôs fate are scheduled for Oct. 13-14. Agape‚Äôs attorney, John Schultz, said he was pleased with the judge‚Äôs decision allowing Agape to continue operating. ‚ÄúThe students at Agape are not facing immediate harm as the State argued,‚Äù Schultz said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe monitor the students 24/7 and will continue to do so with the DSS workers returning.‚Äù\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The public has been warned to stay out of the Missouri River during a rare Rainbow Reservoir drawdown. This week, the bed of the river in Great Falls will lie more exposed than it has in years. The sight above and below Rainbow Dam will be compelling, revealing riverbed features that are only rarely seen ‚Äì as well as significant dangers. NorthWestern Energy and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks said in a statement last week that the utility would start drawing down the reservoir Sunday to replace leaky boards on the dam. According to NorthWestern Energy spokesperson Jo Dee Black, the 11-feet river drawdown will last approximately five days, and the reservoir upstream from Rainbow Dam is expected to back to full pool by Oct. 6. The public safety concern is not that some unwitting hiker might get swept away by a sudden release of water but rather that the exposed riverbed is unstable, slick and potentially dangerous. ‚ÄúWhen the river is drawn down there‚Äôs islands, things you can see in the river that you don‚Äôt see when the reservoir is at full pool,‚Äù Black said. ‚ÄúHowever, we want to caution people not to go onto the exposed riverbed. There will be deep mud and slippery rocks. Just because the river‚Äôs lower doesn‚Äôt mean that its safe to go out onto it.‚Äù\n\nNebraska\n\nChampion: A semitrailer collided with a school bus in southwestern Nebraska, injuring eleven children and the two drivers, officials said. The crash happened about 4 p.m. Tuesday on a rural highway near Champion when a bus dropping off children from school turned left in front of a semi loaded with grain, a news release from the Chase County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said. The grain truck hit the rear passenger side of the bus, causing the bus to spin and tip on its side, officials said. The truck was forced off the road and into a ditch. Eleven children ages 6 to 15 were on the bus, and all were taken to the Chase County hospital ‚Äúwith a wide range of injuries,‚Äù investigators said. Three of the children were later taken to regional trauma centers, the sheriff‚Äôs office said. The bus driver was a 39-year-old man from Champion, officials said, and the truck driver was a 20-year-old man from Venango. Both were taken to the Chase County hospital.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Authorities were searching Tuesday for a 42-year-old convicted bombmaker who escaped from a prison where he was serving a life sentence for a deadly 2007 explosion outside a Las Vegas Strip resort. Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered an investigation into the incident after he said late Tuesday that his office learned the escapee had been missing from the medium-security prison since early in the weekend. ‚ÄúThis is unacceptable,‚Äù Sisolak said in a statement. Officials didn‚Äôt realize until Tuesday morning that Porfirio Duarte-Herrera was missing during a head count at Southern Desert Correctional Center near Las Vegas. A state Department of Corrections statement said search teams were looking for him. Duarte-Herrera, from Nicaragua, was convicted in 2010 of killing a hot dog stand vendor using a motion-activated bomb in a coffee cup atop a car parked at the Luxor hotel-casino. Records show his co-defendant, Omar Rueda-Denvers, remained in custody Tuesday. The 47-year-old from Guatemala is serving a life sentence at a different Nevada prison for murder, attempted murder, explosives and other charges. A Clark County District Court jury spared both men from the death penalty in the slaying of Willebaldo Dorantes Antonio, whom prosecutors identified as the boyfriend of Rueda-Denvers‚Äô ex-girlfriend.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: A 100-year-old woman who left high school to care for her brother during the Great Depression has been awarded an honorary diploma. Josephine Sad left Central High School in Manchester to take care of her younger brother while both of their parents worked. She later joined the Women‚Äôs Army Corps and served during World War II. Sad‚Äôs friend, Terry Seavey, shared her story with Mayor Joyce Craig, and a surprise award ceremony was held Tuesday. ‚ÄúWhen the mayor reached out, we were immediately on board,‚Äù said Jennifer Gillis, Manchester School District superintendent. ‚ÄúMrs. Sad‚Äôs service to her family, community and country in times of need is inspiring.‚Äù According to Gillis, Sad shared her secret to a long life: ‚ÄúNever slow down.‚Äù\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A grand jury has indicted 14 corrections officers on charges stemming from what authorities said was a brutal attack in 2021 on inmates at the state‚Äôs only prison for women. The grand jury handed up the indictments after a more than yearlong investigation into the events at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women, in the community of Clinton, Acting Attorney General Matt Platkin‚Äôs office said late Tuesday. Attorneys for the guards charged have said previously that they planned to fight the allegations in court. The charges include charges conspiracy, official misconduct, tampering with public records and aggravated assault, Platkin said. The indictments are the latest development in a state criminal probe that resulted in significant fallout, including the departure of the state‚Äôs corrections commissioner and Gov. Phil Murphy‚Äôs declaration that he will close the prison. A picture of what happened in January 2021 at the prison has emerged, based on accounts from law enforcement, videos released by authorities showing extractions of prisoners from their cells, and a report commissioned by the governor. One video clip, for example, showed five prison guards wearing helmets and chest, back and shoulder armor filing into a woman‚Äôs cell and punching her in the head. ‚ÄúStop punching me in my face!‚Äù the woman calls out.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: New state data shows New Mexico‚Äôs repeat rate for child abuse is among the worst in the country, a newspaper reports. The Albuquerque Journal said more than 40% of children in New Mexico who had a substantiated serious injury from physical abuse or neglect in fiscal year 2022 came from families who had a prior involvement with the state‚Äôs Children, Youth and Families Department in the preceding 12 months. A report by the New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee said the Families Department ‚Äúcontinues to underperform on targets for repeat maltreatment, maltreatment of foster care children, and serious injuries after protective services involvement,‚Äù and the state‚Äôs rates for repeat maltreatment ‚Äúare among the worst in the nation.‚Äù Barbara Vigil, a retired New Mexico Supreme Court judge who became the Families Department‚Äôs secretary nearly a year ago, told the Journal that the agency is ‚Äúincredibly proud of the ongoing improvements that are being made in our child welfare system ‚Ä¶ but we acknowledge that improvements must continue to be made.‚Äù Vigil said a key to reducing child maltreatment rates is strengthening the Families Department‚Äôs workforce including hiring and retaining employees.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Some historical battle reenactors are holding their musket fire because of worries about the state‚Äôs new gun rules ‚Äì an unplanned side effect of a law designed to protect the public‚Äôs safety. The law that went into effect this month declares parks, government property and a long list of other ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù places off limits to guns. The rules were geared more toward semi-automatic pistols than flintlock weapons, but reenactors who fear being arrested if they publicly restage battles from the Colonial era to the Civil War are staying off the field. Gov. Kathy Hochul‚Äôs administration insists that historical battle reenactments are still OK, and some have still taken place this month. But persistent skepticism among event organizers and participants has resulted in some cancellations, like an 18th-century encampment and battle reenactment planned for last weekend north of Saratoga Springs. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been getting reports from units that were supposed to attend that they don‚Äôt feel comfortable transporting muskets or bringing muskets to the site,‚Äù said Harold Nicholson, a reenactor involved in the event at Rogers Island. ‚ÄúAnd so at that point, we decided that it was probably best not to (go ahead).‚Äù\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The head of a national political action committee working to elect women who support abortion rights visited the state Tuesday, joining candidates she says must win this fall to block Republican attempts to enact more restrictions. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper also stood beside EMILY‚Äôs List President Laphonza Butler while warning the ability of women to control reproductive health choices at current standards will depend on General Assembly races. ‚ÄúI have seen in states across this country abortion under attack,‚Äù Butler said at a news conference outside state Democratic Party headquarters. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why here in North Carolina, we know that these legislative races ‚Ä¶ are all difference makers in protecting abortion rights and protecting essential health care options for all women in this great state.‚Äù Republicans could earn veto-proof majorities if they win two more state Senate seats and three more state House seats, making it difficult for Cooper to derail abortion legislation with his veto stamp. The GOP-controlled Legislature hasn‚Äôt overridden any of Cooper‚Äôs nearly 50 vetoes since Democratic seat gains during the 2018 election took effect. ‚ÄúIn North Carolina, women still have reproductive freedom,‚Äù Cooper said. ‚ÄúAnd as governor, I aim to keep it that way. But I cannot do it alone.‚Äù\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A one-of-a-kind construction and research project is using hemp in an effort to make healthier homes. Two small houses going up on the back half of a lot just off a busy street not far from downtown Fargo ‚Äúare identical in blueprint ‚Äì they‚Äôre 13 by 23, with 12-foot ceilings; there‚Äôs a loft in each of them,‚Äù said Grassroots Development president Justin Berg, the man behind the project. One of the houses is built with a traditional wood frame, with fiberglass insulation covered with a commonly seen shiny white house-wrap material. A second house a few feet away also has a wood frame, but the walls are filled with 12 inches of hempcrete, giving it a brown, textured look inside and out. The raw material, called hurd, is the inner, woody core of the hemp plant, chipped into small pieces. The hurd is mixed with a lime binder and water. ‚ÄúAnd we hand-packed, physically hand-packed, this entire house,‚Äù said Grassroots Development sustainability consultant Sydney Glup. They‚Äôre being guided through the process by Bismarck-based Homeland Hempcrete. These homes might become short-term rentals, but the primary purpose is research. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just trying to get that concrete nonbiased research to contribute to the industry so we can troubleshoot and figure out how to do better,‚Äù Glup said. ‚ÄúWe want it to be so that anybody who wants a healthier dwelling can afford it.‚Äù\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A judge extended a temporary block Tuesday on a state law banning virtually all abortions for an additional 14 days, further pausing a law that had taken effect after federal abortion protections were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in June. The decision by Hamilton County Judge Christian Jenkins means pregnancy terminations through 20 weeks‚Äô gestation may continue in Ohio through Oct. 12. Jenkins issued his first 14-day pause Sept. 14 in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU of Ohio on behalf of the state‚Äôs remaining abortion providers, finding their lawsuit was ‚Äúsubstantially likely to prevail on the merits.‚Äù The action argues that the abortion ban violates protections in the state constitution guaranteeing individual liberty and equal protection. It also says the law is unconstitutionally vague. The law signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in April 2019 prohibits most abortions after the first detectable ‚Äúfetal heartbeat.‚Äù Cardiac activity can be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many people know they‚Äôre pregnant. The law had been blocked through a legal challenge, then went into effect after the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision was overturned. Jenkins has scheduled the next hearing in the case for Oct. 7.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The University of Oklahoma Medical Center confirmed Wednesday that it is planning to stop offering some gender-affirming medical treatments after state lawmakers threatened to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding earmarked for the University Hospitals Authority. The Republican-controlled Legislature, which returned for a special session Wednesday to appropriate $1.87 billion in federal American Rescue Plan Act funds, has already targeted transgender young people with new laws that restrict their ability to play sports or use school bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. Transgender medical treatment for children and teens is increasingly under attack in many Republican-led states, labeled child abuse and subject to criminalizing bans. But it has been available in the United States for more than a decade and is endorsed by major medical associations. ‚ÄúThe OU Health Senior Leadership team is proactively planning the ceasing of certain gender medicine services across our facilities and that plan is already under development,‚Äù OU Health said in a statement. A spokeswoman for OU Health declined to say which services the center was planning to stop offering.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A renewable energy plant being commissioned Wednesday that combines solar power, wind power and massive batteries to store the energy generated there is the first utility-scale plant of its kind in North America. The project, which will generate enough electricity to power a small city at maximum output, addresses a key challenge facing the utility industry as the U.S. transitions away from fossil fuels and increasingly turns to solar and wind farms for power. Wind and solar are clean sources of power, but utilities have been forced to fill in gaps when the wind isn‚Äôt blowing or the sun shining with fossil fuels like coal or natural gas. At the Oregon plant, massive lithium batteries will store up to 120 megawatt-hours of power generated by the 300-megawatt wind farms and 50-megawatt solar farm so it can be released to the electric grid on demand. At maximum output, the facility will produce more than half of the power that was generated by Oregon‚Äôs last coal plant, which was demolished earlier this month. On-site battery storage isn‚Äôt new, and interest in solar-plus-battery projects in particular has soared in the U.S. in recent years due to robust tax credits and incentives and the falling price of batteries. The Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facility in Oregon, however, is the first in the U.S. to combine integrated wind, solar and battery storage at such a large scale in one location, giving it even more flexibility to generate continuous output without relying on fossil fuels to fill in the gaps.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWest Mifflin: A western Pennsylvania amusement park announced new security measures Wednesday following a shooting that wounded three people, including two teenagers. Kennywood Park officials said the measures would include more police, more security along perimeter fences, limits on bag sizes and masks covering faces, and required adult chaperones for all juveniles at all times during the park‚Äôs Phantom Fall Fest, scheduled to run until mid-October. Park officials declined to discuss the investigation into the shooting shortly before 11 p.m. Saturday that followed an altercation between two groups of teenagers near the Musik Express ride at the park in West Mifflin, southeast of Pittsburgh. A male wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and a dark-colored mask was being sought. Park officials said Wednesday that they have doubled the number of police hired for each night of Phantom Fall Fest and will require adult chaperones at least 21 years old for everyone under 17 who enters the park at any time during the event. Chaperones had previously been required only after 4 p.m. Officials said they have cut down trees along the perimeter fence to improve visibility and are installing new floodlights and security cameras that will completely cover the fence line, also vowing to ‚Äúsignificantly‚Äù increase security patrols.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state is ramping up investments in clean transportation as consumers take advantage of rebates for electric cars and the state expands the network of charging stations. In the first two months of the reinstated DRIVE EV program, which offers incentives of up to $4,500 to buy electric vehicles, the state Office of Energy Resources has approved 54 applications. Interest has risen since the July 7 launch date of the program that provides funding for both new and used cars, particularly since passage last month of climate legislation in Congress that will expand a federal tax rebate for EVs. ‚ÄúIt picked up in August, and we‚Äôve been very busy this month as well with applications,‚Äù said Sara Canabarro, administrator of clean transportation for the energy office. The work to green the transportation sector is key to meeting the state‚Äôs climate goals. Transportation accounts for 35% of Rhode Island‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions. If the state is to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, as required with the passage last year of the Act on Climate, it will require a big investment in electric cars.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A church that was painted pink with the word ‚ÄúTrap‚Äù written above it by a real estate developer is listed for sale for $2.5 million, leaving some locals feeling betrayed and angry. The former Bibleway Full Gospel Missionary Baptist Church property, sold for $425,000 in April, is now listed on LoopNet as available for ‚Äúredevelopment in booming West Greenville.‚Äù The listing came after developer Ron Rallis heard concerns from residents about gentrification. Now neighbors of the property fear that‚Äôs exactly what would be spurred by the sale Rallis seeks. On July 30, he held an impromptu ‚Äúcommunity forum‚Äù where he addressed his painting of the closed church, as well as personal concerns he‚Äôs made public on social media, podcasts and media outlets about claims that he was falsely accused and arrested for two felonies. In a video posted on Instagram on Aug. 4, he expressed willingness to work with neighbors in his efforts to redevelop the property but included a statement that struck a nerve with some: ‚ÄúDaddy is here to make money.‚Äù Restaurant owner Dayna Lee said that statement ‚Äúmade it very clear to me that not only did I waste a lot of time ever giving him the benefit of the doubt, he turned a historically Black church into an eyesore because he doesn‚Äôt care.‚Äù She believes Rallis used the forums ‚Äúas tools to deceive everyone that attended. He wasted their time and never was committed to being anything more than a publicity stunt in the first place.‚Äù\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem made a campaign promise Wednesday to repeal the state‚Äôs tax on groceries, changing course to lend outspoken support to a bipartisan proposal she did not publicly endorse in March. The Republican governor made the announcement two days ahead of a Friday debate with Democratic challenger Jamie Smith, a state lawmaker who pushed the repeal of the 4.5% tax on groceries for years and helped broker a bipartisan vote to pass it in the House this year. Noem billed the campaign promise Wednesday as ‚Äúthe largest tax cut in South Dakota‚Äôs history,‚Äù saying it would push $100 million ‚Äúdirectly to families to help them with their budget.‚Äù But Smith said the campaign promise was ‚Äújust another example of Gov. Noem trying to manipulate the voters of South Dakota by proposing a policy she clearly didn‚Äôt believe in and is doing it for her political gains at this moment.‚Äù A spokesman for Noem‚Äôs campaign, Ian Fury, said Noem had privately voiced support for the grocery tax cut bill to Senate leadership during budget negotiations. At the time, Republican state Sen. Lee Schoenbeck, one of the most powerful lawmakers in the chamber, had said the House proposal was dead on arrival in the Senate. He said in a text message that he remains opposed to the tax cut. Schoenbeck also told The Dakota Scout that Noem, even in a private conversation in March, was ‚Äúadamantly opposed‚Äù to the House proposal.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A man already charged with a fatal shooting that police said set off a daylong crime rampage now faces murder charges in two more killings, officials said Wednesday. Ezekiel Kelly, 19, was indicted Tuesday on two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Richard Clark and Allison Parker, the Shelby County district attorney‚Äôs office said. Kelly already has been charged with fatally shooting Dewayne Tunstall in the head outside a home in east Memphis. At least three witnesses saw Kelly shoot Tunstall about 1 a.m. Sept. 7, according to a police affidavit. Clark and Parker were shot later that day, as Kelly was driving around Memphis, livestreaming some of his activities and leading officers on a citywide manhunt, police said. Police said three other people were wounded in the shootings. The indictment also charges Kelly with attempted first-degree murder and more than 20 other charges, including reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon, commission of an act of terrorism, theft of property and evading arrest. The shootings had police warning Memphians to shelter in place, locking down a baseball stadium and university campuses and suspending public bus services. Kelly was arrested after crashing a stolen car while fleeing police.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A Jewish death row inmate who was part of a gang of prisoners who fatally shot a police officer in 2000 after they had escaped is one step closer to getting a new trial after prosecutors agreed with defense claims that the judge who presided over his case held antisemitic views. Lawyers for Randy Halprin have contended that former Judge Vickers Cunningham in Dallas used racial slurs and antisemitic language to refer to the inmate and some of his co-defendants. Halprin, 45, was among the inmates, known as the ‚ÄúTexas 7,‚Äù who escaped from a South Texas prison in December 2000 and then committed numerous robberies, including the one in which they shot 29-year-old Irving police Officer Aubrey Hawkins 11 times, killing him. During a three-day hearing in August in Dallas, several witnesses, including Cunningham‚Äôs brother and two lifelong family friends, testified that the former judge had frequently used antisemitic and racial slurs before and after Halprin‚Äôs 2003 trial in reference to him and several of the other escaped inmates. One witness testified when Cunningham ran for district attorney in 2005, she heard him say he was running for office to save Dallas County from Latinos, Black and Jewish people, but using racial slurs to refer to these groups of individuals, according to court documents.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utahns often rate among the friendliest and most polite in state-by-state rankings, but there is a glaring exception on Beehive State roadways, according to a new survey. Utah motorists rank as the worst in the U.S. when it comes to road rage, according to nationwide survey work published last week by Forbes Advisor, a consumer services advice company based in New Jersey. More than half of Utah residents surveyed said they had been on the receiving end of a rude or offensive gesture while driving, including a highest-in-the-nation 76% who said they had been the target of a honk. Utah drivers were also the second most likely to say they had been tailgated (73%). About 27% said they knew someone who had been injured due to a road rage incident. The survey was conducted with more than 5,000 U.S. car owners last month, including at least 100 in every state, according to Forbes Advisor, which commissioned the survey work from the research company OnePoll. The companies said the margin of error was plus or minus 2.2 percentage points, with a confidence interval of 95%. ‚ÄúOverall, 85% of drivers surveyed said they‚Äôve experienced at least one form of road rage,‚Äù according to the authors. ‚ÄúSome instances, like frustrated honking, may be fairly innocuous, but other forms can have far more severe consequences.‚Äù\n\nVermont\n\nBrattleboro: Three police officers will not face charges in the fatal shooting of a person of interest in a suspected homicide who charged at two of the officers with a knife, the offices of the state attorney general‚Äôs office and a county prosecutor announced Tuesday. A Brattleboro police officer and two Vermont State Police detective sergeants on July 19 were pursuing Matthew Davis, who was a person of interest in the death of his ex-girlfriend, a Massachusetts woman who was found dead in her truck in Brattleboro with a suspected gunshot wound earlier that day. Family members had reported her missing, and foul play was suspected on the part of Davis, who had a criminal history including assault to kill, according to the attorney general and county prosecutor‚Äôs office. One of the officers had spotted Davis walking on a Brattleboro road, but he fled. The three officers then found him in culvert under a bridge, which he fled, refusing orders to stop. Officers confronted him in nearby woods. One officer yelled that Davis had a knife. They ordered him 10 times to drop the knife, but he refused, according to the release. After one officer asked Davis, ‚ÄúWhy did you kill her?‚Äù he then ran out from behind a tree with the knife and charged downhill toward two officers, they said. All three officers fired their weapons.\n\nVirginia\n\nPetersburg: A new documentary explores the history of a hospital founded in Richmond in 1870 as the world‚Äôs first mental institution for Black people, in a state that had also established the first state mental hospital in the nation in 1773. When the American Psychiatric Association celebrated its 175th anniversary three years ago in San Francisco, it featured photographs of two Virginia mental institutions that contributed to its birth ‚Äì what are now Eastern State and Western State hospitals. Former Virginia Mental Health Commissioner King Davis, a featured speaker, was struck by the absence of another state mental institution, now known as Central State Hospital, near Petersburg. ‚ÄúThey had no idea,‚Äù Davis said, even though the association awarded him its coveted Benjamin Rush Award for his work to preserve and digitize more than 800,000 records and 36,000 photographs documenting a century of the hospital‚Äôs past. During a recent reception, the American Psychiatric Association Foundation saluted the archives project by showing the documentary, ‚ÄúCentral Lunatic Asylum for the Colored Insane,‚Äù and giving tours of an exhibition of documents from the archives. The film was written, directed and produced by Virginia Commonwealth University professor Shawn Utsey.\n\nWashington\n\nSkykomish: A section of U.S. Highway 2 is again closed because of the Bolt Creek Fire burning near the roadway. Three miles of the highway were closed Monday night, and officials extended the closure to 4 miles Tuesday morning, KING 5 News reports. On Tuesday, U.S. 2 was closed between Northeast Old Cascade Highway and 747th Avenue Northeast in Skykomish, according to the Washington State Department of Transportation. The department tweeted a video showing crews working in smoky conditions cutting down burnt trees near the roadway. The fire burning since Sept. 10 has grown to an estimated 17.7 square miles. Some evacuation orders remained in effect. A 13-mile stretch of U.S. 2 had reopened Saturday after a fire-related, weeks¬≠long closure. Officials said hot and dry conditions Monday slightly increased fire behavior, which resulted in more wildfire smoke in the area. Air quality in western Washington was moderate with some areas experiencing short spikes of air quality that was unhealthy for sensitive groups, the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A new children‚Äôs hospital at West Virginia University is finally opening. Officials held a ribbon-cutting Saturday in Morgantown for the new WVU Medicine Children‚Äôs Hospital. The 150-bed, $215 million facility will open Thursday. Plans to build the hospital were announced in 2017 due to rising demand for primary and specialty services for children and women. Officials say the existing children‚Äôs facility‚Äôs four care units were operating at an average daily capacity above 70%, with just one or two beds available at some times. Officials say the new hospital includes a significantly larger care team, a pediatric emergency department, the state‚Äôs only Level IV neonatal intensive care unit and a spa-like birthing center.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Complaints against nursing homes continue to pile up and could surpass a record number filed last year as the state struggles to find enough nurses and nursing home inspectors. State officials have contracted with two private companies ‚Äì Healthcare Management Solutions and Long Term Care Institute, Inc. ‚Äì to help inspect nursing homes that have complaints against them. The rise in complaints comes as the nursing home industry continues to deal with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, which in some cases has left facilities without enough staff to properly care for residents. Approximately two out of every five nursing homes in Wisconsin reported a shortage of nurses earlier this month, worse than during the height of the pandemic, according to data submitted by the facilities to the federal government. Wisconsin has received more than 1,500 complaints against nursing homes so far this year, or about 190 new complaints each month, according to numbers from the state Department of Health Services. The state last year received an average of 165 per month, for a total of 1,984 complaints.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Biden administration has finally responded to the state‚Äôs plan for a federally funded network of electric vehicle chargers, but few of the exemptions Wyoming officials requested were granted, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. States have access to money from a bipartisan infrastructure bill signed by President Joe Biden, but the federal government required that the charging stations be no farther than 50 miles apart and no more than a mile away from highway exits. The program envisions expanding the range of electric vehicles by building up the infrastructure to support them, removing disincentivizes to adoption for people who live in or travel to more rural areas. Wyoming had sought exceptions to the distance requirements in some less-populated areas, but the administration only approved a few, according to the newspaper. It told state officials they had given ‚Äúinsufficient justification‚Äù for leaving longer spans of highway unserved by chargers and denied the request for a new station being built farther from Interstate 80 to count toward the network.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}]}

Great royal events in the United Kingdom are often a mix of old and new, and the commemoration and funeral of Queen Elizabeth II will be no exception. While there will be several strikingly new features, the seemingly traditional elements are not as old as they may appear. While some newer elements are revivals from the past. The modern history of royal occasions is one of innovation and tradition to preserve the monarchy‚Äôs popularity and relevance. Public service and the monarch‚Äôs ability to represent the whole nation have become the main themes. The organisation of public mourning for Elizabeth II, which began with her death on September 8 and will end after her funeral on September 19, is a huge national undertaking. However, the funerals of sovereigns have not always been public spectacles. Early commemorations Since the 18th century, all British monarchs were buried at Windsor and for a long period, funeral ceremonies took place within Windsor Castle. Changes began with the death of Queen Victoria in 1901. In part, this was in recognition of her long reign of 63 years. But it was also a culmination of efforts, noticeable at her jubilees in 1887 and 1897, to make the monarchy more public. This was to encourage greater popular attachment towards the royal family in a society which was becoming more democratic ‚Äì and potentially more critical of an ancient and privileged institution. The day of Queen Victoria‚Äôs funeral was proclaimed a day of national mourning, during which all work ceased. This was done in the expectation that many people would attend memorial church services ‚Äì which then was the chief means to express public grief and respect. Skip advert For the first time after a monarch‚Äôs death, the Church of England issued special commemorative services for use in all its local places of worship, and the leaders of most other religious communities in the United Kingdom also encouraged the organisation of local memorial services.\n\nEverywhere, church and chapel services were crowded. That Queen Victoria died at her home on the Isle of Wight created the opportunity for further mass demonstrations of grief, as her coffin, on its route to Windsor, was carried in a long and slow procession across London, through streets lined with huge crowds. Public processions have remained central to later funerals of monarchs, though now focused around Westminster. A public affair Following the deaths of Victoria‚Äôs successors, further measures were taken to involve the public. When Edward VII died in London in 1910, a public lying in state at Westminster Hall was introduced. His son, George V, insisted that access should be ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù and nearly 300,000 members of the public paid their respects by filing past the coffin. He also asked that all local memorial services on the day of the funeral begin at the same time as the service at Windsor, to create simultaneous national participation in the prayers of commemoration. For George V‚Äôs own funeral in 1936, the day of mourning was replaced by a national two-minute silence to avoid loss of work during a time of economic depression. The silence also linked the king‚Äôs death with the annual mass ritual of remembrance of the dead of the first world war. His lying in state was attended by over 750,000 people. Radio broadcasts created a vast audience for the public ceremonies, in a new form of mass participation. For the commemoration in 1952 of King George VI, who had achieved great public prominence during the second world war, two further additions were made. After the funeral at Windsor, a special remembrance service was held at St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, attended by members of the government, parliament and other national leaders. The memorial services and funeral procession in London became the first royal events to be broadcast by television as well as radio. The commemoration of Queen Elizabeth II Many facets of royal commemorations since 1901 remain integral to the arrangements in 2022 but there are new elements. Skip advert Some of these features result from advances in television and electronic media, others are a tribute to an even longer reign than Queen Victoria‚Äôs. The state of the union of the United Kingdom has also influenced the plans that the civil service and Buckingham Palace have maintained and regularly revised since the 1930s for ‚Äúthe demise of the Crown‚Äù ‚Äì known more recently under the code name ‚ÄúOperation London Bridge‚Äù.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/957927/state-funerals-what-are-they-and-who-gets-them-in-the-uk", "title": "State funerals: what are they and who gets them in the UK? | The ...", "text": "Leaders from across the world are joining mourners at the Queen‚Äôs state funeral today, the first in the UK since 1965.\n\nAround 500 heads of state and foreign dignitaries were expected to attend the late monarch‚Äôs funeral in London, marking ‚Äúone of the biggest gatherings of royalty and politicians hosted in the UK for decades‚Äù, said the BBC.\n\nWhat did the papers say?\n\nThe i news site defined a state funeral as ‚Äúa public funeral ceremony, observing the strict rules of protocol, held to honour people of national significance‚Äù. The rare events are usually but not always reserved for the sovereign, and ‚Äúinclude much pomp and ceremony as well as religious overtones and distinctive elements of military tradition‚Äù, the site added.\n\nState funerals usually begin with the coffin being carried on a gun carriage drawn by Royal Navy sailors, rather than horses, as part of a military procession from a private resting chapel to Westminster Hall in the House of Parliament.\n\nA second procession then usually takes place to the church where the service will be held, either Westminster Abbey or St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral. The Queen‚Äôs funeral is taking place at the former, where she married Prince Philip, in 1947, and was crowned, in 1953. The late monarch will then be laid to rest alongside Philip at St George‚Äôs Chapel at Windsor.\n\nA state funeral also includes a 21-gun salute, flags at half-mast and a national day of mourning.\n\nWho gets a state funeral?\n\nThe head of state is always entitled to a state funeral, but with the approval of the monarch and a vote in Parliament, other ‚Äúexceptionally distinguished‚Äù people may also be granted the honour.\n\nThe most recent state funeral, in 1965, was for Winston Churchill, and the last one for a sovereign was for the Queen‚Äôs father, George VI, in 1952.\n\nKing George‚Äôs state funeral was preceded by those of George V (1936), Edward VII (1910) and Queen Victoria (1901).\n\nThe only British monarch ‚Äúnot to be given a state funeral in the last 295 years was Edward VIII, who abdicated‚Äù, said Wales Online.\n\nNon-sovereigns who have been granted the honour include Isaac Newton (1727), Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson (1806) and the Duke of Wellington (1852).\n\nHow do they differ from ceremonial funerals?\n\n‚ÄúTo the outsider, there is little difference between a state funeral and a ceremonial one,‚Äù said Wales Online. But while ‚Äúboth can include lying in state and a military procession‚Äù, there are key differences.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/society/957245/the-pros-and-cons-of-legalising-assisted-dying", "title": "The pros and cons of legalising assisted dying | The Week UK", "text": "The House of Commons is due to debate assisted dying for the first time in two years today.\n\nA public petition, which reached more than 150,000 signatures in six months, implored the government to bring forward legislation to allow assisted dying for adults who are terminally ill and have mental capacity, subject to strict safeguards including assessment by two independent doctors.\n\nSupporters of legalising assisted dying ‚Äúwill be hoping to show that the balance of opinion in Parliament has tilted their way since the defeat of Rob Marris‚Äôs private member‚Äôs bill in 2015‚Äù, said the BBC‚Äôs parliamentary correspondent Mark D‚ÄôArcy.\n\nAssisted dying is a controversial issue for legislatures worldwide, with widely cited arguments both for and against a practice that is legal in some countries while totally taboo in others.\n\nPro: an end to suffering Allowing patients to end their suffering is not only morally justified but also essential to upholding the right to personal and bodily autonomy, advocates argue. The latest research from the campaign group Dignity in Dying found that between 300 and 650 dying UK citizens take their own lives every year. A further 3,000 to 6,500 attempt to do so, according to October 2021 estimates. A further 50 Brits travel to Switzerland for assisted death each year on average. The authors of the report ‚Äì titled ‚ÄúLast resort: the hidden truth about how dying people take their own lives in the UK‚Äù ‚Äì argue that the law must change to allow terminally ill, mentally competent adults the option of an assisted death, subject to robust, upfront safeguards. Paul Lamb, a paralysed former builder from Leeds who died in June 2021, had lost his legal case to challenge UK laws on assisted dying. Calling for an urgent government inquiry on the issue in 2020, he told the BBC: ‚ÄúI now have no choice if my pain ever becomes unbearable, other than the horrifying prospect I was most afraid of from the start ‚Äì slowly starving myself to death. ‚ÄúI cannot understand, in a civilised society like ours, why I should be forced to suffer when millions of people around the world already have the choice I asked for.‚Äù\n\nCon: losing legal protection It is currently a criminal offence under the 1961 Suicide Act to help someone take their own life, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Some people believe that legalising euthanasia would put too much power in the hands of doctors, who could abuse their position. Rita Marker, executive director of the International Task Force on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide in the US, has argued: ‚ÄúEuthanasia and assisted suicide are not about the right to die. They are about the right to kill.‚Äù The UK‚Äôs Care Not Killing alliance against legalised euthanasia said that the law is also in place to protect the vulnerable ‚Äúfrom being pressured into ending their lives‚Äù. A YouGov poll published in August 2021 found that 73% of Britons support allowing doctor-assisted suicide for the terminally ill, including 74% of Conservative voters and 76% of Labour voters. But the polling company pointed out that the public‚Äôs view is not represented in Westminster, where just 35% of MPs think the law should be changed.\n\nPro: death with dignity People in the late stage of terminal illness often end up bedridden and reliant on nurses and relatives for everyday tasks such as eating, washing and going to the toilet, which can be degrading. A 50-year-old Scottish woman suffering from terminal multiple sclerosis that had left her unable to take care of herself told The Telegraph in 2008 that such an existence was ‚Äútorture‚Äù. ‚ÄúIf I was Spooky, my cat, I‚Äôd have been put down long ago,‚Äù said Val McKay, from Perth. McKay and other campaigners for euthanasia have argued that giving dying people the opportunity to choose when and how they die allows them to take control of their life and how they are remembered.\n\nCon: ‚Äòslippery slope‚Äô Opponents argue that normalising euthanasia would be a philosophical slippery slope to legalised murder. This ‚Äúslippery slope is real‚Äù, said James Mildred of Care (Christian Action Research and Education), which campaigns against assisted suicide. In a 2018 article in The Economist, Mildred cited ‚Äúa steady increase year on year in the number of people being killed or helped to commit suicide by their doctors‚Äù in countries that have legalised assisted suicide. It was ‚Äúonly a matter of time‚Äù before the criteria for euthanasia was widened, he added. But writing for iai news, Emily Jackson, a professor of law at LSE and a member of the British Medical Association (BMA)‚Äôs medical ethics committee, said that ‚Äúslippery slope arguments are in fact often a smokescreen, invoked by people who are fundamentally opposed to legalisation, in order to appeal to people who are not, but who do have concerns about the possibility of abuse‚Äù.\n\nPro: shifting opinion There has been a significant shift in recent years in professional medical opinion regarding assisted dying for people with a terminal illness. In June, the UK‚Äôs largest doctors‚Äô union, the BMA, voted to reaffirm its neutral stance on assisted dying. The union had dropped its long-standing opposition to a change in the law on assisted dying following a debate at its Annual Representative Meeting last year. The Royal College of Nursing has adopted a neutral stance on the issue since 2009. A number of other countries ‚Äì including Canada, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Spain and Colombia, plus some states in Australia and the US ‚Äì have changed or are due to change their laws in favour of assisted dying. In Scotland, Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur has launched a separate consultation on legalising assisted dying. Campaigners claim UK police are also increasingly turning a blind eye to people travelling to other countries to end their life.\n\nCon: religious concerns Many religious people, especially Catholics, believe that life is the ultimate gift and that taking that away is usurping power that belongs to God only. In 2020, the Vatican reiterated the Roman Catholic Church‚Äôs opposition to assisted suicide and euthanasia, describing them as ‚Äúintrinsically evil‚Äù acts ‚Äúin every situation or circumstance‚Äù, The New York Times reported. However, a 2019 survey of 5,000 people across England, Wales and Scotland revealed ‚Äúbroad support for assisted dying across most faith groups, including more than 82% support amongst Christians‚Äù, according to pollsters Yonder (then Populus). More recently, former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey and rabbi Jonathan Romain wrote an article titled ‚ÄúThere is nothing holy about agony‚Äù, in which they argued that nothing in the scripture directly prohibits assisting a death to end suffering. ‚ÄúA massive change is going on in religious attitudes to assisted dying,‚Äù the pair said in the article, published in the British Medical Journal in September 2021.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/956673/did-sweden-covid-experiment-pay-off", "title": "Did Sweden's Covid-19 experiment pay off in the end? | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

The women will soon try to become pregnant with their new wombs, the doctor in charge of the pioneering project has revealed.\n\nThe women were born without a uterus or had it removed because of cervical cancer. Most are in their 30s and are part of the first major experiment to test whether it's possible to transplant wombs into women so they can give birth to their own children.\n\nIn many European countries, including Sweden, using a surrogate to carry a pregnancy isn't allowed.\n\nLife-saving transplants of organs such as hearts, livers and kidneys have been done for decades and doctors are increasingly transplanting hands, faces and other body parts to improve patients' quality of life. Womb transplants ‚Äî the first ones intended to be temporary, just to allow childbearing ‚Äî push that frontier even farther and raise some new concerns.\n\nThere have been two previous attempts to transplant a womb ‚Äî in Turkey and Saudi Arabia ‚Äî but both failed to produce babies. Scientists in Britain, Hungary and elsewhere are also planning similar operations but the efforts in Sweden are the most advanced.\n\n\"This is a new kind of surgery,\" Dr. Mats Brannstrom told The Associated Press in an interview from Goteborg. \"We have no textbook to look at.\"\n\nBrannstrom, chair of the obstetrics and gynecology department at the University of Gothenburg, is leading the initiative. Next month, he and colleagues will run the first-ever workshop on how to perform womb transplants and they plan to publish a scientific report on their efforts soon.\n\nSome experts have raised concerns about whether it's ethical to use live donors for an experimental procedure that doesn't save lives. But John Harris, a bioethics expert at the University of Manchester, didn't see a problem with that as long as donors are fully informed. He said donating kidneys isn't necessarily life-saving, yet is widely promoted.\n\n\"Dialysis is available, but we have come to accept and to even encourage people to take risks to donate a kidney,\" he said.\n\nBrannstrom said the nine womb recipients are doing well. Many already had their periods six weeks after the transplants, an early sign that the wombs are healthy and functioning. One woman had an infection in her newly received uterus and others had some minor rejection episodes, but none of the recipients or donors needed intensive care after the surgery, Brannstrom said. All left the hospital within days.\n\nNone of the women who donated or received wombs has been identified. The transplants began in September 2012 and the donors include mothers and other relatives of the recipients. The team had initially planned to do 10 transplants, but one woman couldn't proceed due to medical reasons, university spokesman Krister Svahn said.\n\nThe transplant operations did not connect the women's uteruses to their fallopian tubes, so they are unable to get pregnant naturally. But all who received a womb have their own ovaries and can make eggs. Before the operation, they had some removed to create embryos through in-vitro fertilization. The embryos were then frozen and doctors plan to transfer them into the new wombs, allowing the women to carry their own biological children.\n\nThe transplants have ignited hope among women unable to have children because they lost a uterus to cancer or were born without one. About one in girl in 4,500 is born with a syndrome, known as MRKH, where she doesn't have a womb.\n\nLise Gimre, 35, who was born without a womb, said she thought many women with MRKH would be interested if the operation proves to be safe and effective. Gimre runs an organization for women with the syndrome in Norway.\n\n\"If this had been possible when I was younger, no doubt I would have been interested,\" she said. Gimre, who has two foster children, said the only option for women like her to have biological children is via surrogacy, which is illegal in many European countries, including Norway and Sweden.\n\nFertility experts have hailed the project as significant but stress it's unknown whether the transplants will result in healthy babies.\n\nThe technique used in Sweden, using live donors, is somewhat controversial. In Britain, doctors are also planning to perform uterus transplants, but will only use wombs from dying or dead people. That was also the case in Turkey. Last year, Turkish doctors announced their patient got pregnant but the pregnancy failed after two months.\n\n\"Mats has done something amazing and we understand completely why he has taken this route, but we are wary of that approach,\" said Dr. Richard Smith, head of the U.K. charity Womb Transplant UK, which is trying to raise 500,000 pounds ($823,000) to carry out five operations in Britain.\n\nHe said removing a womb for donation is like a radical hysterectomy but it requires taking a bigger chunk of the surrounding blood vessels to ensure adequate blood flow, raising the risk of complications for the donor. Smith said British officials don't consider it ethical to let donors take such chances for an operation that isn't considered life-saving.\n\nSmith said the biggest question is how any pregnancies will proceed.\n\n\"The principal concern for me is if the baby will get enough nourishment from the placenta and if the blood flow is good enough,\" he said.\n\nAll of the women who received womb transplants will need to take anti-rejection medicines, but Smith said data from women who have received kidney transplants doesn't suggest their babies are at any increased risk from the drugs.\n\nBrannstrom said using live donors allowed them to ensure the donated wombs were functional and didn't have any problems like an HPV infection.\n\nDoctors in Saudi Arabia performed the first womb transplant in 2000, using a live donor, but it had to be removed after three months because of a blood clot.\n\nBrannstrom said he and his colleagues hope to start transferring embryos into some of their patients soon, possibly within months. The Swedish researchers and others have previously reported successful uterus transplants in animals including mice, sheep and baboons, but no offspring from the primates were produced.\n\nAfter a maximum of two pregnancies, the wombs will be removed so the women can stop taking the anti-rejection drugs, which can cause high blood pressure, swelling and diabetes and may also raise the risk of some types of cancer.\n\nOther experts said if the operations are successful, womb transplants could be an alternative for women who have few choices.\n\n\"What remains to be seen is whether this is a viable option or if this is going to be confined to research and limited experimentation,\" said Dr. Yacoub Khalaf, director of the Assisted Conception unit at Guy's and St. Thomas' hospital in London, who was unconnected to any of the womb transplant projects.\n\nBrannstrom warned the transplants might not result in children but remained optimistic.\n\n\"This is a research study,\" he said. \"It could lead to (the women) having children, but there are no guarantees ‚Ä¶ what is certain is that they are making a contribution to science.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/01/13"}]}

Its name comes from that of a Chinese goddess who, according to legend, has lived on the moon for millennia.\n\nThe landing highlights China‚Äôs growing ambitions to rival the U.S., Russia and Europe in space, and more broadly, to cement the nation‚Äôs position as a regional and global power.\n\nThe Chang'e 4's launch on Dec. 8 has been hailed as one of the country‚Äôs major achievements in 2018, and state broadcaster China Central Television announced Thursday‚Äôs landing to the public at the top of the noon news.\n\n\"On the whole, China‚Äôs space technology still lags behind the West, but with the landing on the far side of the moon, we have raced to the front,\" said Hou Xiyun, a professor at Nanjing University‚Äôs school of astronomy and space science.\n\nHe added that China has Mars, Jupiter and asteroids in its sights: \"There‚Äôs no doubt that our nation will go farther and farther.\"\n\nIn 2013, Chang'e 3, the predecessor craft to the current mission, made the first moon landing since the former Soviet Union‚Äôs Luna 24 in 1976. The United States is the only country that has successfully sent a person to the moon, though China is considering a crewed mission too.\n\nFor now, it plans to send its Chang‚Äôe 5 probe to the moon next year and have it return to Earth with samples ‚Äì also not done since the Soviet mission in 1976.\n\nThe relatively unexplored far side of the moon has a different composition than the near side, where previous missions have landed.\n\nChang‚Äôe 4, a combined lander and rover, will make astronomical observations and probe the structure and mineral composition of the terrain above and below the surface.\n\n‚ÄúThe far side of the moon is a rare quiet place that is free from interference from radio signals from Earth,‚Äù mission spokesman Yu Guobin said, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. ‚ÄúThis probe can fill the gap of low-frequency observation in radio astronomy and will provide important information for studying the origin of stars and nebula evolution.‚Äù\n\nOne challenge of operating on the far side of the moon is communicating with Earth. China launched a relay satellite in May so that Chang‚Äôe 4 can send back information.\n\nChina conducted its first crewed space mission in 2003, only the third country to do so after Russia and the U.S. It has put a pair of space stations into orbit and plans to launch a Mars rover in the mid-2020s.

Most of the candidates raised their hands, while Christie raised an objection.\n\nWould you support Trump if he is convicted? Most of the candidates raised their hands, while Christie raised an objection. Mike Pence got backup for the issue that has been the biggest weight on his candidacy: his refusal to interfere in the congressional counting of electoral college votes on Jan. 6, 2021 as Trump wanted.\n\nRepublican hopefuls make their pitch to voters\n\nDuring a 14-minute discussion, most of the GOP candidates said they would still support Trump, even if he is convicted of crimes and still wins the Republican nomination. They also said GOP voters are tiring of all the drama surrounding the former president.\n\n\"We have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America,\" said former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. \"We can‚Äôt win a general election that way.\"\n\nTwo GOP candidates, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, again said that Trump's indictments disqualify him from leadership of the party or nation.\n\n\"Someone's got to stop normalizing this conduct,\" Christie said, drawing boos from the crowd at a sports arena in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nOn the stage in Milwaukee, most of the attacks went against businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, an upstart who has seen his poll numbers rise. Rivals like former Vice President Mike Pence hit Ramaswamy on his lack of government experience. Ramaswamy called than an asset.\n\nDeSantis, who is second to Trump in many polls, emerged from the debate relatively unscathed, but had no memorable quotes. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum used the debate to promote their own platforms.\n\nSome highlights from debate day:\n\nMike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy spar about age on the debate stage\n\nWhen asked whether an elected president should pass a mental or physical test if above a certain age, Pence, 64, said Americans can make their own judgment. But he added that the country doesn‚Äôt need a president who‚Äôs too old, or a president who‚Äôs too young.\n\nRather, he said that the country needs a president who‚Äôs been there and knows how the government works.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, 38 and the youngest candidate on the debate stage, said that there needs to be a person of a different generation leading the country forward, and that he is the only candidate to do that.\n\n‚àíSudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican candidates push to eliminate Education Department\n\nSeveral of the Republican candidates showed their support for eliminating the federal Department of Education.\n\n‚ÄúWe need education in this country, not indoctrination in this country,‚Äù Ron DeSantis said.\n\nRamaswamy agreed that the Department of Education should be shut down and said he supports parents choosing where they send their kids to schools. He said he believes high school students should have to pass a civics test, like individuals in the process of becoming American citizens.\n\nDoug Burgum, also in favor of removing the Department of Education, said the country forgets that education differs by state. He emphasized the need for schools to innovate.\n\nNikki Haley pushed for transparency in the classroom.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of crazy, woke things happening in schools,‚Äù she said, later adding, ‚ÄúParents need to be deciding which schools their kids go to because they know best.‚Äù\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\n'C'mon, man': Chris Christie doesn't like UFO question\n\nThe former governor of New Jersey took umbrage at a \"lighting round\" question on whether presidents should \"level\" with the American people about UFOs.\n\n\"I get the UFO question? C'mon, man,\" Christie told Fox News' Martha MacCallum.\n\nHe did answer the question by saying: ‚ÄúThe job of the president of United States is to level with the American people about everything.\"\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nSparks fly over Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence tore into entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for saying he‚Äôd freeze the current lines of control in Ukraine in return for a promise from Russia that it would not form a military alliance with China.\n\nPence told Ramaswamy ‚Äúif we do the giveaway that you want to‚Äù and give Putin eastern Ukraine, ‚Äúit's not going to be too long‚Äù before he rolls across the border into a NATO nation.\n\n‚ÄúUkraine is not a priority for the United States of America,‚Äù Ramaswamy argued, raising China as a bigger threat.\n\nHaley argued that a win for Russia is a win for China and said Ukraine is the first line of defense.\n\n‚ÄúYou have no foreign policy experience, and it shows,‚Äù Haley told Ramaswamy.\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers\n\nOther GOP candidates said Pence did the right thing on Jan. 6\n\nMike Pence got some back up for the issue that has been the biggest anchor on his candidacy: his refusal to interfere in the congressional counting of electoral college votes as Donald Trump wanted.\n\nAsked if Pence did the right thing on Jan. 6, 2021, other candidates said he did ‚Äì though it took longer for some to get there than others.\n\nAfter Ron DeSantis tried to dodge the question, Pence said the American people deserve to know if everyone on stage would‚Äôve done what he did.\n\n‚ÄúAnswer the question,‚Äù Pence said.\n\n‚ÄúMike did his duty,‚Äù DeSantis responded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got no beef with him.‚Äù\n\nPence got his biggest backing from Chris Christie who said the former vice president stood up for the Constitution and deserves thanks, ‚Äúnot grudging credit.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Maureen Groppe\n\nVivek Ramaswamy says he would pardon Donald Trump\n\nDonald Trump‚Äôs indictments over his handling of classified documents and the 2020 election have raised the question among his GOP rivals of whether they would pardon the former president if they're elected.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy said on the debate stage that he would pardon Trump, a position he has long held. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she was \"inclined in favor\" of a pardon in an interview, though Haley noted that the discussions were still premature.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence said pardons would only be appropriate to weigh if Trump was found guilty. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Trump‚Äôs two most vocal critics, have leaned against a pardon.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley targets Donald Trump's electability\n\nDuring the 14-minute discussion of Donald Trump's legal problems, Nikki Haley was the only candidate who mentioned a political issue: His ability to win a general election.\n\n\"We have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America,\" Haley said. \"We can‚Äôt win a general election that way.\"\n\nTrump will no doubt disagree with this assessment, but don't be surprised if other GOP candidates echo Haley's argument in the coming weeks.\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump finally comes up: Most candidates will support him even if he is convicted, but not Chris Christie\n\nThe first Trump question came at 9:56 p.m., eastern, nearly an hour in: Would you support him if he is convicted?\n\nMost of the candidates raised their hands, while Christie raised an objection.\n\n\"Someone's got to stop normalizing this conduct,\" Christie said, drawing boos from the crowd and criticism from Ramaswamy, who said the Justice Department is being weaponized against Trump.\n\nScott also criticized the Justice Department. So did DeSantis, though he said the party also needs to stop talking about this and look forward - presumably with him as president.\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nVivek Ramaswamy says we are in a \"dark moment;\" Mike Pence disagrees\n\nMike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy went at it again, this time over the moral climate of the nation.\n\nPence bashed Ramaswamy over his negativity, saying \"we just need government as good as our people.\"\n\nRamaswamy's reply: \"It is not morning in America. We are living in a dark moment and we have to confront that,\" an apparent reference to former President Ronald Reagan.\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nGOP lacks uniform abortion message\n\nNikki Haley and Mike Pence‚Äôs exchange on abortion shows the hopscotch Republicans have to deal with since the Supreme Court knocked down Roe v. Wade.\n\nSix states have had reproductive rights questions on their ballot since then, and liberals have won all of those.\n\nOn the stage, most of the GOP contenders talked about a 15-week national ban being the standard, but Ron DeSantis talked up signing a 6-week ban in Florida. At one point Tim Scott, who often talks about his anti-abortion views, said that Congress should aim for a 15-week ban at least.\n\nBut others such as former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, don‚Äôt support a federal prohibition at all, saying it should be left up to the states.\n\nEach touted how they are a ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù candidate, but there isn‚Äôt a uniform standard.\n\n‚Äî Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNikki Haley, Mike Pence tangle on abortion\n\nNikki Haley tried to argue to Republicans that they need to be honest with Americans when discussing a national abortion ban. Because any federal legislation will require 60 votes in the Senate, she said, party leaders should be trying to find a consensus on abortion issues, such as banning later abortions and agreeing not to jail women who get them.\n\nMike Pence, the strongest anti-abortion advocate on the stage, wasn‚Äôt having it.\n\n‚ÄúNikki, you‚Äôre my friend,‚Äù Pence said, ‚Äúbut consensus is the opposite of leadership.‚Äù\n\nPence said abortion is not an issue for the states to decide.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a moral issue,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚Äì Maureen Groppe\n\nMore than 45 minutes in ‚àí and no discussion of Donald Trump\n\nAfter more than 45 minutes, the debate moderators, and the candidates, have yet to discuss a big campaign issue: Donald Trump.\n\nMike Pence made passing references to the president who put him on the ticket in 2016, but neither he nor his rivals mentioned Trump's indictments or big poll leads.\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nVivek Ramaswamy falsely claims climate change agenda is a hoax\n\nVivek Ramaswamy during the debate claimed that climate change is a hoax, but that is inaccurate.\n\nThere is a wide range of proof that climate change is real, including research on increasing global temperatures, rising sea levels and and decreasing Antarctic ice sheets.\n\nScientific data show warming has accelerated since the mid-20th century and that human activities have contributed to that trend.\n\n‚àí Sudiksha Kochi\n\nChris Christie on Vivek Ramaswamy: ‚ÄòA guy who sounds like ChatGPT‚Äô\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie didn‚Äôt hesitate to attack entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy after the candidates were asked whether they believe in climate change.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve had enough already tonight of a guy who sounds like Chat GPT stand up here‚Ä¶‚Äù Christie said, interrupting Ramaswamy.\n\n‚ÄúThe last person at one of these debates who stood in the middle of the stage and said, 'what‚Äôs a skinny guy with an odd last name doing here' was Barack Obama, and I‚Äôm afraid we‚Äôre dealing with the same type of amateur,‚Äù Christie added.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nTim Scott tells opponents to stop being childish\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott sought to bring order to all the noise, telling colleagues that \"going back and forth\" and \"being childish\" will not help the American people.\n\nHis opponents are likely to continue being feisty.\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nHaley draws attention to being sole woman on stage\n\nAs several of the candidates traded insults, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley saw a chance to draw attention to her status as the only woman on stage.\n\n‚ÄúThis is exactly why Margaret Thatcher said, `If you want something said, ask a man. If you want something done, ask a woman,‚Äô‚Äù Haley said.\n\n‚Äì Maureen Groppe\n\nNo one has 'the sway': South Carolina young Republicans on the GOP debate\n\nPedro Mateo, 29, said he thinks the debate will be more about setting the stage for determining a vice president or even 2028 candidate.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone on the stage really has the sway to upend Trump,‚Äù Mateo said.\n\nMateo is the chairman of the political engagement committee for Young Greenville, a Republican club in South Carolina. He said regardless of who ultimately wins the nomination, he‚Äôll support any candidate over the Democratic opponent.\n\n‚àí Savannah Kuchar\n\nVivek Ramaswamy takes heat from Mike Pence\n\nSo far, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy is getting the most heat, with former Vice President Mike Pence attacking him for a lack of government experience.\n\nAfter Pence called the rising Republican a \"rookie,\" Ramaswamy said his business background is a better asset to lead a \"revolution.\"\n\n\"We're just going to have some fun tonight,\" he said.\n\nLater, several candidates hooted at Ramaswamy for claiming he is the only candidate not \"bought and paid for.\" Chris Christie compared him to another guy with a \"funny name:\" Barack Obama.\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley comes out swinging\n\nWhereas the other candidates played nice when they first spoke, Nikki Haley wasn‚Äôt having it.\n\nThe former South Carolina governor, who is the lone women running for the GOP nomination, drew first blood by attacking her rivals for supporting COVID-19 stimulus spending.\n\n‚ÄúThe truth is that Biden didn't do this to us, our Republicans did this to us too,‚Äù she said.\n\nHaley mentioned multiple candidates on the stage by name and Trump when slamming Republicans for raising the U.S. debt and supporting earmarks.\n\n‚ÄúYou tell me who are the big spenders,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time for an accountant in the White House.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Phillip M. Bailey\n\nRon DeSantis starts with an attack on Joe Biden\n\nThe moderators opened with a question about a song that bemoans the state of the nation. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis used it as an excuse to bash President Joe Biden, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie followed suit.\n\nThe eight candidates on stage were quick to criticize Biden over a slate of economic issues, from inflation to job opportunities.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nThe lineup: The candidates' positions on the stage - and the polls\n\nThe candidates were introduced in the order of their place in political polls: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former Vice President Mike Pence, former South Carolina Gov Nikki Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.\n\nDeSantis and Ramaswamy are first and second, so they are in the center. They are flanked by Pence, Haley, Christie, Scott, Hutchinson and Burgum.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nBrian Kemp chides Donald Trump for skipping debate\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp remains one of the few popular Republicans who won‚Äôt spare Donald Trump a criticism.\n\nKemp, who is mentioned as a possible 2024 contender, trekked to Wisconsin for the first GOP debate. He said the former president, who remains the clear front-runner, is making a big mistake by not joining the discussion.\n\n‚ÄúFight it out,‚Äù Kemp said on a podcast appearance.\n\n‚Äî Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNew Hampshire voters turn to Republican debate: ‚ÄòI‚Äôd like to see how everybody conducts themselves‚Äô\n\nEven though Kenneth Biel has narrowed down his vote for a few specific candidates in New Hampshire‚Äôs crucial first-in-the-nation primary, the debate he said, could sway him.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm open to hearing somebody change my mind,‚Äù said the 47-year-old software engineer from Chester. Biel said he is eyeing former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. But if a different candidate has a standout performance, the debate could change his mind.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see how everybody conducts themselves,‚Äù Biel said, adding he‚Äôs open to ‚Äúpeople who I disagree with.‚Äù\n\n‚àí Ken Tran\n\nWill Donald Trump attend the Republican debate?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will be skipping the first Republican primary debate, citing his lead in GOP polls.\n\nThe former president had previously hinted he would not attend the event in Milwaukee, saying he did not want to give trailing rivals free shots at him on a debate stage.\n\n‚ÄúThe public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,\" Trump said Sunday on his Truth Social platform, before adding: \"I WILL THEREFORE NOT BE DOING THE DEBATES!‚Äù\n\nMeanwhile, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson posted his taped interview of Trump on the X social media site at 8:55 p.m., eastern.\n\n‚Äì Rachel Looker and David Jackson\n\nJoe Biden's campaign mocks Donald Trump for ‚Äòsoftball‚Äô interview with Tucker Carlson\n\nAhead of Wednesday‚Äôs debate, the Biden campaign mocked former President Donald Trump for taking part in a ‚Äúsoftball‚Äù interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that will air online simultaneously.\n\n‚ÄúIn his softball 'interview' posting tonight, Donald Trump will again make clear that he‚Äôs running on the same extreme and deeply unpopular MAGA agenda the American people have rejected time and time again,‚Äù Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said in a statement.\n\nMunoz said that instead of explaining his ‚Äúbroken promises‚Äù to bring manufacturing jobs to Wisconsin, Trump will likely ‚Äúdouble down on his most out-of-touch positions, including his support for wild, debunked conspiracy theories and a national abortion ban.‚Äù\n\nThe Biden campaign has circled the first Republican primary debate as an opportunity to ramp up their attacks against the GOP field after staying mostly quiet since Biden announced his reelection bid in April.\n\n‚Äì Joey Garrison\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on student loan forgiveness?\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court struck down President Joe Biden‚Äôs plan to forgive $400 billion in student loan debt, a move 2024 GOP candidates applauded.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on X that a president ‚Äúcannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors.‚Äù South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has supported legislation prohibiting Biden from cancelling student loan debt.\n\nLikewise, biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy also supported the court‚Äôs decision, sharing at the time: \"We have a bad habit in America of paying people to do the exact opposite of what we want them to do.\"\n\n‚àí Sudiksha Kochi\n\nFollow along as we fact-check the first Republican debate\n\nWas that fair criticism or cherry-picked data? An accurate description or a baseless conspiracy theory?\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact Check Team will dig into key claims from the candidates as they make them during tonight‚Äôs Republican primary debate. Follow our live fact-check file as we dig through the data, documents and transcripts to sort fact from fiction.\n\nFact-checking the GOP debate: What the Republican candidate hopefuls get right and wrong\n\n‚àí Eric Litke\n\nBashing Biden: Democrat likely to be a GOP punching bag\n\nGOP candidates will be eager to demonstrate they have the best chance of beating President Joe Biden in the general election.\n\nA strategy memo put together by Ron DeSantis‚Äô political action committee, which the candidate and his campaign have denounced, suggested the Florida governor focus his attacks on the Democratic president.\n\nDebaters will need little prompting to criticize Biden, although entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and several others have said they intend to use the primetime event to introduce themselves to voters and make the case for their own candidacies. Vice President Kamala Harris is also likely to be a target. DeSantis has been sparring with Harris over slavery, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has been critical of the vice president‚Äôs record. Haley has made a point of arguing that if anything happens to Biden, who is 80, Harris would succeed him as president.\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers\n\nA crowd gathers in Milwaukee for Republican debate night\n\nIt's party time in Milwaukee: the Republican Party. As the debate approaches, ticket holders, Republican supporters and curious bystanders are enjoying the restaurant-and-bar areas near the city's sports arena.\n\nOthers have more organized activities.\n\nMore than 100 union members marched behind the arena, promoting labor rights and chanting \"we are the union/the mighty, mighty union.\" Another chant included the line \"Republicans hear our call!\"\n\nDown the avenue, an old-fashioned fife-and-drum corps led a group of Vivek Ramaswamy supporters dressed in Revolutionary War-era garb, topped by bonnets and tri-cornered hats, all in 99 degree weather.\n\nSpecial guests gathered in the plaza right beside Fiserv Forum, the home of professional basketball's Milwaukee Bucks. Food trucks, television tents, and a bandstand dotted the \"Block Party\" hosted by Young America's Foundation, one of the debate sponsors.\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump declared Republican debate victory hours ago\n\nHours before the first Republican presidential debate even began, Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign was claiming victory, mocking his rivals and the network hosting the event.\n\n‚ÄúPresident Trump has already won this evening‚Äôs debate because everything is going to be about him,‚Äù Chris LaCivita, who serves as a campaign senior adviser, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nLaCivita added how Fox News hosts will \"show an unnatural obsession\" with Trump by asking the other GOP contenders their reaction to the front-runner's policy positions. He said the campaign will even be looking for how many times the former president's name is brought up.\n\n‚ÄúIn fact, tonight‚Äôs Republican undercard event really shouldn‚Äôt even be called a debate, but rather an audition to be a part of President Trump‚Äôs team in his second term,\" he said.\n\n‚Äî Phillip M. Bailey\n\nVivek Ramaswamy Googled most, Mike Pence least before Republican debate\n\nWhich candidate were Googlers most curious about leading up to the debate? That would be political newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nHe was the subject of 40% of searches for candidates by name this past week, according to Google. Former President Donald Trump was next at 33%.\n\nThen there was a drop-off in interest with everyone else appearing in no more than 10% of searches.\n\nMike Pence, Trump‚Äôs former running mate, was last at 1%.\n\n‚Äì Maureen Groppe\n\nWhich Republican candidates go beyond bashing Biden over inflation?\n\nWhen the candidates go after Joe Biden on the debate stage tonight, there‚Äôs a good chance they‚Äôll bring up inflation. Although price increases have cooled over the past year, pocketbooks are still pinched and Republicans love to blame Biden.\n\nSome of the candidates have been more specific than others about what they would do differently.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence has an entire ‚ÄúEnding Inflation‚Äù plan that includes specific spending cuts, such as eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency. Both Pence and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy want to change how the Federal Reserve manages the economy.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has backed a proposal to bar Congress from passing any legislation that would increase inflation when the inflation rate is 4.5% or higher.\n\n‚Äì Maureen Groppe\n\nHow have the GOP candidates prepared for the Republican debate?\n\nFrom the tennis courts ‚Äì entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy called his tennis practice this week ‚Äúthree hours of solid debate prep‚Äù ‚Äì to the basketball courts ‚Äì North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball. GOP candidates employed a range of tactics to prepare for the debate.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis brought in debate coach Brett O‚ÄôDonnell, who has experience prepping former President George W. Bush, former Arizona Sen. John McCain and Utah Sen. Mitt Romney for debates.\n\nOthers like former Vice President Mike Pence and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley relied on their prior political experience, with Pence falling back on the way he approached one-on-one vice presidential debates in 2016 and 2020 and Haley relying on her experience from 80 town halls she held in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nSen. Tim Scott will likely lean into his faith and role as the \"nice guy‚Äù in the race. Scott campaign spokesperson Nichole Morales told USA TODAY earlier this week he ‚Äúwill share his positive, conservative message on the debate stage in Milwaukee.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì USA TODAY staff\n\nFact-checking the GOP debate:What the Republican candidate hopefuls got right and wrong\n\nConservative advocacy groups descend on Milwaukee before presidential debate\n\nThe Republican presidential campaigns aren't the only political organizations in town for the debate ‚àí advocacy groups are also hanging around the city's pro basketball arena promoting their issues.\n\nEconomic conservatives, like the Club For Growth, and social conservatives, like the Faith & Freedom Coalition are represented in Milwaukee to lobby lawmakers and candidates, many of whom they back with money and voter turnout.\n\n\"We want to make sure they hear what our message is,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\n\nIt's not just conservative groups taking advantage of the big political event.\n\nDeath Penalty Action, which describes itself as the only national organization strictly focused on stopping the death penalty, is also in town solicitating support for a national ban on capital punishment.\n\n‚àí David Jackson\n\nWhat to know ahead of the debate: Here's where candidates stand on China, potential invasion of Taiwan\n\nRepublicans agree on what they argue is an urgent need to combat the military and economic threat from China. But that‚Äôs where their agreement on the issue ends.\n\nThe United States has traditionally had a policy of strategic ambiguity on whether it would send troops to Taiwan to defend the island in the face of a Chinese invasion. Former Vice President Mike Pence supports this policy and says the U.S. should keep providing Taiwan with military assistance.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has described China as the ‚Äúmost dangerous foreign threat we face since the second world war‚Äù and said it‚Äôs clear that Beijing is preparing for war. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he would do everything he could to avoid using the U.S. military against China, ‚Äúbut if it was unavoidable, I would do what needs to be done.‚Äù\n\nEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy says he would aggressively defend Taiwan ‚Äì but only until the U.S. has semiconductor independence, which he has pledged to do by 2028. At that point, he said, would not risk war for ‚Äúsome nationalistic dispute between China and Taiwan.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers\n\nGOP candidates who won't be at presidential debate blast polling requirement\n\nGOP candidates Larry Elder and Perry Johnson announced on Tuesday that they planned to sue the Republican National Committee after not making the debate stage.\n\nElder alleged on X that the RNC notified him after he turned in his debate qualification package that one of the polls he cited would not count. Johnson‚Äôs campaign also sent an email claiming that the committee had rejected him because they weren‚Äôt accepting certain polls.\n\nGOP candidate Francis Suarez said on X that his campaign also faced a similar issue on Monday night, though he added that he respects the rules set forth by the RNC.\n\n‚ÄúI am sorry that this debate will not include my perspectives from the largest growing voting block in our country - young, conservative Hispanics,‚Äù Suarez wrote.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nFlying the flag: Donald Trump aides, supporters and surrogates swarm presidential debate site\n\nDonald Trump himself may not be in Milwaukee, but Trump World has a definite presence at the debate site.\n\nSurrogates like U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., are out and about, giving television interviews promoting their favorite absent candidate. Trump campaign aides are also milling about the area around the Fiserv Forum and speaking to reporters.\n\nEveryday supporters have also flocked to downtown Milwaukee, despite temperatures in excess of 90 degrees, adorned in red or white Trump t-shirts and carrying signs. Part of their job, apparently: Wave the signs while standing behind television correspondents during live shots.\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nPlanned Parenthood highlights Mike Pence, Tim Scott and other GOP candidates‚Äô position on abortion\n\nPlanned Parenthood launched this week its first ad in the 2024 presidential campaign, highlighting what five of the GOP candidates have said about abortion.\n\nThe first clip is of former Vice President Mike Pence, who has for decades tried to end government funding for Planned Parenthood and has taken the strongest anti-abortion stand in the 2024 field.\n\n‚ÄúEvery Republican candidate for president should support a ban on abortion,‚Äù Pence says in the clip.\n\nThe ad is running on social media and in Wisconsin.\n\n‚Äì Maureen Groppe\n\nUkraine war a pressure point for the GOP field\n\nThe Ukraine war could prove to be fertile ground for the large group of presidential hopefuls to differentiate themselves.\n\nSupport for U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is flagging inside the GOP electorate with Kyiv‚Äôs counteroffensive against Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs army making slow progress. Still, any suggestion that Ukraine is at fault for Russia‚Äôs violation of its sovereignty is likely to drive away establishment Republican voters.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis‚Äô description of the conflict as a ‚Äúterritorial dispute‚Äù helped fuel his decline, even though he later backtracked the comment and called Putin a ‚Äúwar criminal.‚Äù Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also come under scrutiny for his views, including a proposal to allow Putin to keep parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence are among the candidates who say that stopping Putin is vital to U.S. national security and helps to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan.\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers\n\nAsa Hutchinson, Chris Christie and other GOP candidates weigh in on Trump's indictments\n\nFormer President Donald Trump‚Äôs indictments in both federal and state criminal cases have led some of his rivals to defend him, while others have sharply criticized him over the charges.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott have condemned the indictments on the campaign trail. Meanwhile, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have largely dodged questions about his criminal cases.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson have been some of Trump's most vocal critics, particularly after he was indicted for allegedly trying to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden. After Trump's federal indictment over the 2020 election, former Vice President Mike Pence said anyone who puts themselves above the Constitution should not be president.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: The newcomer on the presidential debate stage\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has faced scrutiny in recent days over conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attack, something his rivals could use to their advantage during the debate.\n\nIn an interview on CNN earlier this week, Ramaswamy claimed he was misquoted in an article about his 9/11 comments, though that wasn‚Äôt the case according to a recording released later.\n\nRamaswamy, a Trump-loving candidate who embraces meritocracy and anti-wokeness, has previously drawn scrutiny over comments on the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, Juneteenth and more.\n\n‚Äì Rachel Looker and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nConservative Supreme Court could factor into GOP debate\n\nSeven years ago, during the first GOP debate of the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was criticized by several candidates.\n\n‚ÄúIt's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being,‚Äù then candidate Mike Huckabee quipped.\n\nWhat a difference a few years makes.\n\nThe nation‚Äôs highest court, which today is more conservative than it has been in decades, has already factored into the GOP primary. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump have swiped at each other over whether the bench is conservative enough. Last month, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of candidates he said he would nominate to the court, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah.\n\n‚Äì John Fritze\n\nPresident Biden hopes to watch ‚Äòas much as I can‚Äô of Republican debate\n\nPresident Joe Biden is among the millions of Americans expected to tune in to tonight‚Äôs Republican primary debate.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to try to see ‚Äî get as much as I can, yes,‚Äù Biden, who is vacationing in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, told reporters when asked if he plans to watch the debate.\n\nAsked about his expectations, Biden smiled and laughed. ‚ÄúI have none,‚Äù he said.\n\nWhile Republican frontrunner Donald Trump skips out on the debate in Milwaukee, Biden‚Äôs reelection campaign is going on the offensive during the event.\n\nThe Biden campaign launched a $25 million television ad blitz to coincide with the first Republican debate and dispatched surrogates to Milwaukee as Democrats seek to paint the eight Republicans on the debate stage as part of an extreme ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù Republican Party.\n\n‚Äì Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump opts for interview with Tucker Carlson\n\nTrump may not be on the stage in Milwaukee, but he is expected to weigh in on the proceedings.\n\nA pre-taped interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson is scheduled to be posted at 9 p.m., eastern, the same time as the debate.\n\nTrump - who has also threatened to skip a second GOP debate scheduled for Sept. 27 in California - will likely comment on whatever happens in Milwaukee on Truth Social.\n\n‚ÄúThe public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,\" Trump said Sunday on his social media platform, before adding: \"I WILL THEREFORE NOT BE DOING THE DEBATES!‚Äù\n\n- Rachel Looker and David Jackson\n\nTrump, absent from the debate, remains frontrunner in GOP primary polls\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is still leading the polls for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, according to an average calculated by RealClearPolitics.\n\nHe has garnered 55.4% in an average of polls, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis trails behind him with 14.3%. Biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy is in third with 7.2%, and former Vice President Mike Pence leads behind with 4% of support.\n\nIn line after those candidates are former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nTrump aides are all over media set-ups outside the debate venue in Milwaukee, promoting those polls and proclaiming the race all but over. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt stop the Trump Train,‚Äù senior adviser Jason Miller said.\n\n‚Äì Sudiksha Kochi and David Jackson\n\nDoug Burgum rushed to emergency room a day before the GOP debate\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, 67, was rushed to a Milwaukee emergency room on Tuesday after he tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball. He is currently using crutches.\n\nHowever, he will still be on the debate stage, according to a post he shared on X, the platform previously known as Twitter.\n\nBurgum, who did an early afternoon ‚Äúwalk through‚Äù said he wants to debate. A candidate with little name recognition, Burgum previously told USA TODAY his focus in the debate will be to introduce himself to Americans.\n\n‚Äì Francesca Chambers,David Jackson and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDemocrats look to get in a word at the Republican debate\n\nDemocratic Party officials are also zeroing in on the Milwaukee debate, trying to promote their messages in favor of President Joe Biden.\n\nSpeakers are doing national and local media hits, arguing that the Republicans are too extreme and too beholden to the missing debater, Donald Trump.\n\nDemocrats also have paid advertising on local and national media, as well as billboards on highways surrounding Milwaukee. The signs feature Biden answering various Republican proposals.\n\nOne section of the billboard says \"tax cuts for yacht owners?\" Biden's response: \"Good luck with that, champ.\"\n\n‚Äì David Jackson\n\nGOP debate location: Why it's in Milwaukee\n\nThe debate will take place at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nWisconsin is one of several swing states that could decide the presidency in 2024. Out of the last six presidential elections, four have been decided by less than one percentage point in Wisconsin.\n\nThe debate will be held ahead of the Republican National Convention, which is also set to take place in the city next year.\n\n‚Äì Rachel Looker\n\nHow can you watch the Republican debate?\n\nThe first Republican primary debate is scheduled for Wednesday at 9 p.m. Eastern.\n\nThe debate, hosted by Fox News, will air on Fox News Channel as well as Fox Business Network.

Some candidates have refused to participate altogether.\n\nHere are the candidates who are on track to qualify for the first debate:\n\nDonald Trump\n\nRon DeSantis\n\nNikki Haley\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nTim Scott\n\nChris Christie\n\nHere are the candidates still working on qualifying:\n\nMike Pence\n\nWill Hurd\n\nDoug Burgum\n\nAsa Hutchinson\n\nRyan Binkley\n\nFrancis Suarez\n\nLarry Elder\n\nHere‚Äôs a deeper rundown of which Republican hopefuls might make an appearance ‚àí and which ones might not ‚àí on debate night.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump ‚àí the GOP frontrunner ‚àí will qualify for the debate.\n\nA survey from Morning Consult shows Trump has 56% of support from potential GOP voters, and he‚Äôs placed first in other national and state polls. His campaign said that he has also raised more than $35 million during the second quarter of the year - about twice the amount raised during the first quarter, Politico first reported.\n\nBut whether Trump will participate is still up in the air.\n\nTrump threatened to skip the debate in late June claiming on Truth Social that Fox News, one of the event‚Äôs sponsors, ignored his campaign events. He suggested to Fox News host Bret Baier on his show \"Special Report\" last month that he didn't want to spar with low-polling candidates.\n\n\"They're all very low,\" Trump said. \"So why would I allow people at one or two percent, at zero percent, to be hitting me with questions all night? You know, I don't think it's fair.\"\n\nHe's also considered scheduling a competing event for that night, according to NBC News.\n\nRon DeSantis\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who‚Äôs trailing behind Trump in the Republican primary polls, will hit the debate stage.\n\nHis campaign announced he raised more than $20 million during the first six weeks of his candidacy and has about 50,000 donors as of late June, according to the New York Times. The survey from Morning Consult shows that DeSantis has garnered 17% of support among potential GOP voters.\n\nDeSantis said in an interview two weeks ago with Fox News host Will Cain he will be on the debate stage regardless of whether Trump joins.\n\n‚ÄúI hope everybody who's eligible comes,‚Äù DeSantis said. ‚ÄúI think it's an important part of the process and I look forward to being able to be on the stage and introducing our candidacy and our vision and our leadership to a wide audience.‚Äù\n\nLast month, DeSantis dodged the question of whether he would support Trump if he becomes the nominee in 2024. However, DeSantis later said that he didn‚Äôt avoid the question and would \"respect the outcome of the process,\" according to The Hill.\n\nNikki Haley\n\nFormer Republican South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is on track to meet the requirements for the debate.\n\nHaley‚Äôs spokesperson told USA TODAY that she has ‚Äúwell over 40,000 unique donors‚Äù and is ‚Äúlooking forward to being on the debate stage.‚Äù The New York Times reported she‚Äôs raised over $7.3 million through her campaign and affiliated committees between April and June.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows she has registered 3% of support among GOP voters, which is on par with two of her rivals. She‚Äôs also maintained scoring above 1% in other polls.\n\nHaley indicated on Twitter she plans on supporting the eventual nominee for the Republican party.\n\n‚ÄúAbsolutely irresponsible that Trump, DeSantis, and others won't commit 100% to supporting the Republican nominee,‚Äù Haley tweeted. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no room for personal vendettas in this battle to save our country.‚Äù\n\nVivek Ramaswamy\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has fulfilled the debate criteria, according to his spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.\n\nMcLaughlin told USA TODAY that Ramaswamy has 65,000 donors. As part of his fundraising strategy, Ramaswamy has laid out incentives for supporters such as offering to give them a 10% cut of the total money he raises for his presidential bid, according to Axios.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows Ramaswamy has received 8% support from GOP voters, surpassing former Vice President Mike Pence and trailing behind DeSantis. He‚Äôs also starting to receive double-digit figures in some polls.\n\nRamaswamy will take the loyalty pledge if the other candidates do, McLaughlin said.\n\nMike Pence\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, who filed to run for president last month, is facing difficulty meeting the debate criteria.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows he has gained 7% support among voters, trailing behind Ramaswamy, and he's maintained over 1% support in other polls. However, the New York Times reported last week he has not yet received donations from 40,000 unique donors.\n\nHe‚Äôs also raised less than $1.2 million for his campaign in the second quarter of the year ‚àí far below what his rivals have raised, according to the Washington Post.\n\nDespite announcing his candidacy late compared to his rivals, Pence ‚àí a familiar face among voters ‚àí has already garnered attention from voters as he campaigns across key states and maintains a critical position against Trump‚Äôs stances on abortion, immigration, criminal justice and the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.\n\nPence said in a CNN town hall last month in Iowa he would support whoever ends up being the Republican nominee in 2024.\n\nTim Scott\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott said during an interview last month on Fox News‚Äô ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Newsroom‚Äù that he's met the requirements for the debate.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows he‚Äôs scored 3% support among GOP voters, and he‚Äôs also maintained an average 3.2% of support in the Republican primary polls, according to data from RealClearPolitics.\n\nScott‚Äôs campaign told the New York Post they‚Äôve been backed by 40,000 donors in early July and announced Wednesday that they‚Äôve raised $6.1 million in the second quarter of fundraising, according to The Hill.\n\nScott indicated in a Fox News interview in May he will support the eventual nominee, saying ‚Äúall Republican candidates would be better than any Democrat candidate.‚Äù\n\nChris Christie\n\nFormer Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has qualified for the debate.\n\nHe told CNN host Anderson Cooper on Wednesday he‚Äôs received more than 40,000 unique donors in just 35 days. He‚Äôs taken in fundraising from big donors such as Motorola Solutions CEO Greg Brown and Lewis Eisenberg, who was a former ambassador to Italy during the Trump administration, according to CNBC News.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows he garnered 3% of support among voters ‚àí on par with two of his rivals ‚àí and has scored above 1% in other polls. Although his poll numbers are not as high as Trump's or DeSantis', he appears to be gaining momentum as a fierce rival against his running mates.\n\nLast month, Christie called the loyalty pledge a ‚Äúuseless idea‚Äù on CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúState of the Union‚Äù but said he will do what is needed to be on the debate stage. In an ABC News interview, Christie said he will take the pledge ‚Äúas seriously as Donald Trump did eight years ago,‚Äù when Trump signed the pledge but refused to agree to back the eventual nominee.\n\nWill Hurd\n\nFormer Republican Texas Rep. Will Hurd is working to fulfill the debate requirements, according to his campaign spokesperson.\n\n‚ÄúWill entered the race only a few weeks ago, but he fully intends on fulfilling the polling and donor thresholds,‚Äù a Hurd for America spokesperson told USA TODAY.\n\nHowever, the survey from Morning Consult shows Hurd received 0% of support among GOP voters, and he‚Äôs not included in some polls. He encouraged his followers on Twitter to donate $1 to support his campaign in late June so he could fulfill the 40,000 donor requirement.\n\nThe spokesperson said Hurd won‚Äôt sign the loyalty pledge from the Republican National Committee.\n\n‚ÄúThis is not about whether or not he‚Äôll support the Republican nominee, it‚Äôs about refusing to support Donald Trump,‚Äù the spokesperson said.\n\nDoug Burgum\n\nWealthy Republican North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum is taking several steps to meet the debate criteria.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows Burgum has received 0% support among GOP voters, but he has reached 1% in certain national or state polls, according to The Hill.\n\nBurgum reported raising $11.7 million for his campaign in the second quarter of the year last week, but about $10.2 million of that amount was self-funded, according to NBC News.\n\nHis campaign is offering a $20 gift card to anyone who donates at least one dollar, and the offer lasts for the first 50,000 donors. Experts, however, have raised questions over the legality of this method, according to NPR.\n\nAsa Hutchinson\n\nFormer Republican Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is struggling to fulfill the debate criteria.\n\nHe's attracted crowds of no larger than 50 people to his Iowa events, according to the Des Moines Register. He also told radio host Hugh Hewitt in early July that he has more than 5,000 donors and has more work to do to reach the 40,000 donor requirement.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult shows he has 1% support from GOP voters and a polling average of 0.8%, according to data from RealClearPolitics.\n\nDespite his low numbers, Hutchinson told ABC News in May he is in the race for the long haul and that his support among voters will expand.\n\nRyan Binkley\n\nTexas business executive Ryan Binkley is working towards fulfilling the debate requirements, according to a campaign spokesperson.\n\n\"Ryan is engaged in a major ad blitz and canvassing effort to be able to qualify for the debate,\" his spokesperson told USA TODAY. \"He is winning over supporters and donors everywhere he and his digital footprint go.\"\n\nBut his name doesn't appear in most national polls or the survey from Morning Consult. He has also raised $2 million for his campaign overall - $1.8 million of which he self-funded, according to Forbes.\n\nBinkley's spokesperson said he is close to 5,000 donors and expects \"to exceed that by the end of the Turning Point Action conference.\"\n\nFrancis Suarez\n\nRepublican Miami Mayor Francis Suarez might not qualify for the GOP debate.\n\nBut his spokesperson, Soledad Cedro, told USA TODAY Suarez' campaign is three weeks old and he will be on the debate stage.\n\nSuarez tweeted on Friday that his campaign committee had raised $1 million and will meet the criteria for the first debate, though he didn't specify how many donors he has. Suarez's major setback, however, are his low polling numbers.\n\nThe survey from Morning Consult show he's received 0% support from GOP voters, and he has a polling average of 0.1% according to data from FiveThirtyEight.\n\nSean Freeder, a political science professor at the University of North Florida, previously told USA TODAY Suarez will have a difficult time leveraging himself as the top candidate given his late entrance and competition with two high-profile candidates from Florida.\n\nLarry Elder\n\nConservative commentator Larry Elder is unlikely to qualify for the GOP debate.\n\nHis campaign referred USA TODAY to an opinion piece he wrote for The Hill, in which he criticized the debate requirements and said he is running for president to give back to the country rather than serving ‚Äúas a piggy bank for a political party.‚Äù\n\nHowever, he said in an interview with News Nation last month that he will work hard to meet the criteria.\n\nHe‚Äôs not included in the survey from Morning Consult, but data from RealClearPolitics shows he has a polling average of 0.5%.\n\nHis campaign spokesperson declined to say how many donors he has, but said Elder is \"optimistic\" he will reach 40,000.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/21/how-to-watch-republican-debate-time-channel/70639827007/", "title": "How to watch first 2023 Republican primary debate: Start time ...", "text": "The stage is set for the first Republican presidential primary debate.\n\nThe debate is scheduled to take place on Wednesday in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and will feature some key figures in the Republican party.\n\nThere will be, however, one notable absence.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump made it official Sunday that he will skip the first debate, citing his big lead in the GOP polls.\n\n\"The public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,\" Trump said on his Truth Social platform. \"I WILL THEREFORE NOT BE DOING THE DEBATES!\"\n\nHere's how to watch Wednesday night's debate.\n\nFINAL LINEUP:The final lineup for the first Republican debate is here.

You've got me jazzed.‚Äù\n\nAfter the event, West said he doesn‚Äôt believe Trump is electable and he‚Äôs ready to support someone different in the caucuses. He worries Ramaswamy could be a little weak on foreign policy, but he said there‚Äôs ‚Äúsomething special about this guy.‚Äù\n\nVivek Ramaswamy leans into support for Donald Trump\n\nRamaswamy has established himself on the debate stage and on the Iowa campaign trail as a Trump supporter, embracing the former president‚Äôs MAGA instincts and refusing, more than any other candidate, to criticize him.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just speak the truth,‚Äù he said during the debate. ‚ÄúPresident Trump, I believe, was the best president of the 21st century. It‚Äôs a fact.‚Äù\n\nHe reiterated his promise to pardon Trump if voters give him the chance, and he called on his competitors to do the same.\n\nWhen debate moderators asked candidates to raise their hands if they would still support Trump if he‚Äôs convicted in any of the legal cases that are advancing, Ramaswamy was the first to do so.\n\n‚ÄúThat shows me that there‚Äôs some leadership skills there,‚Äù said state Sen. Brad Zaun, who spoke at the Polk County Summer Sizzle event where Ramaswamy also appeared in Clive Friday night. Zaun has endorsed Trump.\n\nAt that event, Ramaswamy sat at a table with former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, who served in the Trump administration as the U.S. ambassador to China.\n\nCurrently, Trump dominates the Iowa caucus field, leading Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis 42% to 19% among likely Republican caucus attendees, the Iowa Poll showed.\n\nU.S. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina is in third place with 9%, Haley and Pence tie at 6%, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is at 5% and Ramaswamy follows with 4%. Seven other candidates are polling at 2% or lower.\n\nIn total, the poll showed 34% of respondents are considering supporting Ramaswamy in the caucuses. That includes the 4% who name him as their first choice for president, the 12% who say he is their second choice and another 18% who say they are actively considering him.\n\nBy that measure, Ramaswamy places fifth behind Trump, who has a total footprint of 63%, DeSantis (62%), Scott (53%) and Haley (40%).\n\nBut Ramaswamy is less well-known than those other top-tier candidates. According to the poll, 38% view him favorably, 20% view him unfavorably and 41% are not sure ‚Äî an indication that they don't know enough about him to form an opinion.\n\nThat may change after the debate, where Ramaswamy had the second-most speaking time of anyone on stage.\n\nIn Newton, Ramaswamy argued that the debate showed a clear divide between the candidates on stage and cast himself as the true change candidate.\n\n‚ÄúWe had some banter on the basketball court a couple nights ago,‚Äù he joked, drawing chuckles. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs OK. That‚Äôs a good thing. It makes our party stronger to have real, open debate. But I do think we face a choice ‚Äî a choice between good people who I respect. Do you want incremental reform, or do you want revolution? I stand on the side of revolution.‚Äù\n\nRamaswamy delivers, withstands attacks on first debate stage\n\nAt the debate, Ramaswamy both delivered the most attacks and was the recipient of the most attacks, according to NBC News.\n\nPence repeatedly attacked Ramaswamy's lack of experience calling him a \"rookie\" and Christie derided him as an \"amateur.‚Äù Ramaswamy has never held elected office.\n\nOn the campaign trail in Iowa Friday, Ramaswamy addressed those critiques directly.\n\n‚ÄúYou know how old (Thomas Jefferson) was when he wrote the Declaration of Independence?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúThirty-three. Thirty-three years old. I'm an old man compared to what he was.‚Äù\n\nMuch like Trump, Ramaswamy has cast his political inexperience as an asset, saying he‚Äôs the only candidate who isn‚Äôt ‚Äúbought and paid for.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf you have a broken car, you don't turn over the keys to the people who broke it again,\" he said during the debate.\n\nBut those quips did little to stop the barrage of debate-night attacks.\n\nPence and Haley attacked Ramaswamy for saying he would freeze the current lines of control in Ukraine in return for a promise from Russia that it would not form a military alliance with China.\n\n‚ÄúUkraine is not a priority for the United States of America,‚Äù Ramaswamy argued, raising China as a bigger threat.\n\nHaley argued that a win for Russia is a win for China and said Ukraine is the first line of defense. And she accused Ramaswamy of wanting to ‚Äúgo and defund Israel‚Äù after he said in an interview that the U.S. should aim to reduce its aid to Israel.\n\n‚ÄúYou have no foreign policy experience, and it shows,‚Äù Haley told Ramaswamy.\n\nOne event attendee in Newton asked Ramaswamy to clarify his position on Israel after that debate exchange, calling it a ‚Äústumbling block‚Äù for her.\n\n‚ÄúI'm new to politics,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is a dirty game. People will, maybe they'll distort what you say. I did not expect people to literally make up things that you've never said. So I'll be very clear about where I am on Israel.‚Äù\n\nHe said that in his original comments, he said it should be the goal to ‚Äúget to a place where Israel is so strongly integrated back into the security and economic infrastructure of the Middle East, that they no longer even require the $30 billion in aid that we give them.‚Äù\n\nHe said he stands with Israel because ‚Äúit is deeply in American interests to do so.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI come to it with my own conviction, which means we're actually going to see it through rather than approaching it as a check-the-box transactional client relationship,‚Äù he said.\n\nInformation from USA Today and the Associated Press was used in this report.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Register.

Though Election Day is over a year away, the race is well underway.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced he will seek another term, and with former President Donald Trump's hat also in the ring, there's a real possibility of a rematch of their 2020 race. Though the Democratic establishment is expected to fall firmly behind Biden, RFK Jr. has begun to raise some eyebrows as an opponent.\n\nThe Republican side is more of a toss-up. Trump-endorsed candidates suffered in the midterm elections, and with his legal troubles mounting, the GOP may consider other options. Polls still show Trump with a strong lead however, as the first GOP debate nears and many of those trying to unseat him have floundered including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nDeSantis who generated early buzz has suffered in the polls, struggling to translate popularity in Florida to popularity at the national level, and recently firing much of his campaign staff in a major shake-up.\n\nHere are the latest developments on the path to the 2024 election:\n\nAnd here are the candidates who have announced their intention to run for president in the 2024 election:\n\nLearn more about each candidate:\n\nJoe Biden ‚à£ Robert F.

He lost his first wife Neilia Hunter and their one-year-old daughter Naomi in a 1972 car accident shortly after winning his first Senate race. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were injured in the crash but survived. In 2015, Biden lost Beau to brain cancer and has made it a major political goal to champion cancer research.\n\nHe remarried in 1977, tying the knot with now-First Lady Jill Biden. The two share a daughter, Ashley, and a large clan of grandchildren.\n\nBiden's son Hunter has been the subject of scandal in recent years and has written about his struggles with drug addiction. The GOP-led House has seized on Hunter's business dealings, hosting hearings to investigate his finances and the potential influence he has on his father.\n\nPrevious political experience: Joe Biden is a veteran of the Senate. First elected in 1972, he served as a senator from Delaware for 36 years before being elected as vice president on the Obama ticket in 2008.\n\nAfter serving two terms as vice president, Biden took a brief hiatus from government work before returning to run, and win, in 2020.\n\nHis views: Biden's campaign is focused on the \"battle for the soul of America,\" doubling down on the central message of his campaign four years ago. He said the question facing the nation is \"whether, in the years ahead, we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer.\"\n\nMore on Biden's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nLatest Joe Biden news: Explore\n\nExplore Will attacks against Hunter hurt Biden in 2024?

She has one daughter, India Emmanuelle, whose father has not been publicly identified.\n\nPrevious political experience: Williamson is a self-help author and spiritual leader who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020. Then she was largely drowned out by a crowded Democratic field, breaking through for a rare viral moment, but eventually written off as a non-traditional candidate whose views involved centering the \"politics of love\" and rejecting a ‚Äúdark psychic force of collectivized hatred.‚Äù\n\nHer views: Williamson supports abortion rights, a single-payer health care system and reparations for descendants of formerly enslaved Americans.

He says he wants to stand out in a crowded field by prioritizing unity, and leaning on his faith and business experience.\n\nHis views: Binkley has said he hopes to prioritize balancing the budget, lowering health care costs, creating bipartisan immigration reform, and putting more community emphasis on education. Binkley is against abortion. Though he signed a highly restrictive bill in his own state, he had indicated he would not do the same nationally and it should be a local issue. Binkley advocates for American energy independence using an \"all of the above\" approach that encompasses both fossil fuels and new technologies.\n\nMore on Binkley's 2024 presidential candidacy:\n\nLatest Ryan Binkley news : Explore\n\n: Explore Who is Ryan Binkley?

He was elected governor of North Dakota in 2016 and reelected in 2020.\n\nBurgum‚Äôs candidacy is expected to focus more on economics than culture wars ‚Äì a favored topic of frontrunners Trump and DeSantis.\n\nHis views: Burgum has emphasized economic issues, rather than hot-button cultural issues that have been a focal point for some other GOP candidates. He is a vocal supporter of the oil industry, and the U.S. role in exporting it to other nations, and has said he favors smaller government and lower taxes.\n\nMore on Burgum's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 60\n\nFamily: Christie met wife Mary Pat at the University of Delaware and the two wed in 1986.

He ran again unsuccessfully in 2016 and, despite prior criticism, ultimately endorsed Trump and later joined his campaign.\n\nHis views: Christie is anti-abortion, but does support some exceptions in the case of incest, rape, and danger to the mother. He is not for a federal ban, instead believing the issue should be left to the states. He has advocated for a more secure border to stem the flow of fentanyl into the country and is in support of U.S. aid for Ukraine.\n\nMore on Christie's 2024 presidential candidacy:\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 44\n\nFamily: The governor wed former television host Casey DeSantis in 2009 and the couple share two daughters Madison and Mamie and one son Mason.\n\nPrevious political experience: DeSantis serves as the 46th governor of Florida.

Prior to his run for governor, he served in the House of Representatives as a congressman for Florida's 6th district for three terms from 2013 to 2018.\n\nHe is widely viewed as Trump‚Äôs biggest threat in the Republican primary. Similar in politics but different in demeanor, DeSantis represents a younger, some say more predictable, alternative to the former president.\n\nHis views: DeSantis is campaigning on a hard-right agenda to make America look more like Florida. He is in favor of \"defending parental rights and eliminating CRT,\" and is anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment.\n\nMore on DeSantis' 2024 Presidential Candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: Elder has no children and has been married once.

We can enter a new American Golden Age, but we must choose a leader who can bring us there. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm running for President.\"\n\nHis views: Elder backs school choice, including vouchers and charter schools. His platform also includes a vow to be tough on crime, to secure the border, and to \"contain China\" by asserting military dominance in the South China Sea and minimizing reliance on the country's manufacturing.\n\nMore on Elder's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 51\n\nFamily: Haley is one of four children born to Indian-American parents in Bamberg, South Carolina - a town she has described as divided by race.\n\nShe and her husband of 26 years, Michael, live still in South Carolina where they are raising two children Rena and Nalin.\n\nPrevious political experience: Haley started her political career in the South Carolina state legislature where she served for 6 years before mounting a successful campaign for the governor's office in 2010.

Haley has played up her role as a female candidate in what is expected to be a largely male primary field. \"May the best woman win,‚Äù she quipped in an interview with Fox News.\n\nHer views: Haley is anti-abortion and pro-Israel. She supports cracking down on illegal immigration and \"getting tough\" on China and Russia.

He joins the likes of Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson in publicly disavowing the former president and in his campaign launch video listed illegal immigration, inflation, crime, and homelessness as legislative priorities.\n\nMore on Hurd's 2024 presidential candidacy:\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 72\n\nFamily: Hutchinson has been married to wife Susan since 1973.

He went on to serve six terms in the House of Representatives before being sworn in as governor of Indiana in 2013.\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump chose Pence as his running mate, and he served one term as Vice President. The role thrust him into a precarious situation in 2021 when Trump sought to pressure him to throw out some of Biden's electoral votes to overturn the election.\n\nPence ultimately defied Trump and certified the results, infuriating MAGA voters and Trump himself. His candidacy will likely involve a difficult tightrope walk as he attempts to distance himself from the former president without alienating the base.\n\nHis views: Pence is a vocal opponent of abortion, and of what he sees as the nation's long-term debt problem. He favors cuts in government spending and lower taxes, and while he often touts his time as vice president and speaks well of the policies that came out of the Trump White House, he has begun to distance himself from his former running mate in terms of tone. He has also criticized Trump's actions during the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore on Pence's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 37\n\nFamily: Ramaswamy married Apoorva Tewari, a throat surgeon and assistant professor at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, in 2015.

Ramaswamy left the company in 2020 amid clashes with colleagues over how to respond to the murder of George Floyd and the public outcry that followed. He now heads up Strive Asset Management.\n\nHe is the author of three books, including \"Woke Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam,\" which explores how American politics and capitalism have become increasingly intertwined.\n\nHis views: He has peddled ideas such as ending affirmative action and eliminating the Department of Education. His elevator pitch: He'll go farther than Trump ever did or could today.\n\nMore on Ramaswamy's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 57\n\nFamily: Scott is unmarried, with no children. He was raised by a single mother in North Charleston and has one brother.\n\nPrevious political experience: Scott first entered politics in 1995 during a special election for City Council in Charleston. His profile grew nationally when he suggested posting the 10 Commandments outside the council building, a proposal that was denied.\n\nScott served for two years in the state legislature before being elected in 2010 to the House of Representatives for South Carolina's 1st district. He served one term before being appointed to the Senate by then-governor Nikki Haley and becoming the first Black U.S. senator from the state.\n\nScott is pitching himself as a more hopeful alternative to Trump, drawing on Reagan-era ideals and centering a tone of optimism.\n\nHis views: Scott joined the Senate in 2013. He‚Äôs anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment. He says on his website that his ‚Äúsignature legislation,‚Äù Opportunity Zones, put $75 billion into ‚Äúdistressed communities‚Äù across the country.\n\nMore on Scott's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 45\n\nFamily: Suarez is the son of another prominent Florida politician: Xavier L.

Prior to that he was Miami City commissioner and served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors from 2022 to 2023.\n\nViews: Suarez has said he did not support Trump in either 2016 or 2020, instead using his ballot to write in the names of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and Former Vice President Mike Pence respectively. As mayor, Suarez has championed growing Miami's tech economy, and he has also backed low taxes and increased police spending.\n\nMore on Suarez's 2024 presidential candidacy:\n\nLatest Francis Suarez news : Explore\n\n: Explore Miami mayor files for 2024 run: Meet Francis Suarez\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 76\n\nFamily: Trump is the son of real estate magnate Fred Trump.

The two were married for 13 years and share three children: Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric. In 1993 Trump married actress and model Marla Maples. The two had one daughter: Tiffany. Following his divorce from Maples, Trump tied the knot for a final time with model Melania, who is mother to his youngest child, Barron.\n\nTrump's family was uncharacteristically involved in his presidency. Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner played prominent roles in the administration, and both Don Jr. and Eric were often cited as close advisors.\n\nPrevious political experience: When Trump entered the race in 2016, he branded himself as a political outsider, a businessman separate from the establishment, ready to \"drain the swamp.\"\n\nPrior to 2016, he dabbled in politics, often sounding off on controversial issues like the birther movement meant to cast doubt on Barack Obama's citizenship and the guiltiness of the now-exonerated Central Park Five. However, he was still primarily known for real estate and his forays into reality television, famously starring in \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nIn 2016, Trump shocked pollsters by securing victory over Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. He served a full four-year term and was defeated by Biden in his reelection bid.\n\nHis views: The former president has centered much of his campaign on his purported ‚Äúpolitical persecution‚Äù by Democrats. He supports securing America‚Äôs borders, ‚Äúreclaiming free speech,‚Äù and ‚Äúdismantling the Deep State,‚Äù according to his campaign website. He has said he would consider pardoning participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which was inspired by his false claims of election fraud.\n\nMore on Trump's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nThird-party 2024 presidential candidates\n\nPolitical Party: Green Party\n\nThough West originally announced his candidacy under the People's Party, he later officially filed as a Green Party candidate.\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: West has been married five times and has two children.

The next debate will reportedly require at least 3% in two national polls, or 3% in one national poll and two polls conducted in early states.\n\nAdditionally, candidates are expected to have 50,000 unique donors, including at least 200 donors from 20 different states or territories.

And it‚Äôs being propelled even more by the 79-year-old President‚Äôs age, which has prompted questions about what kind of campaign schedule he‚Äôd be able to keep up.\n\nFear runs deep of yet another unfavorable Biden comparison to Jimmy Carter, who survived a 1980 primary challenge from Ted Kennedy but not the lasting wound going into the general election. Democrats privately hoping Biden might reverse course and not run are petrified that they‚Äôre backbiting their way into allowing Trump and Trumpism back into power.\n\nThat hasn‚Äôt stopped muted worries from going around the West Wing, according to four aides familiar with the conversations, that someone may yet emerge ahead of the President‚Äôs planned spring 2023 formal reelection campaign launch. Biden advisers expect to stick to that no matter what happens, including if Trump decides to jump in early.\n\n‚ÄúNothing about our timeline changes, but we‚Äôre prepared if he decides to run,‚Äù one person familiar with the Biden team‚Äôs political planning said about Trump.\n\nBut even Rep. Ro Khanna, the California congressman and former Bernie Sanders campaign co-chair, who first won his seat by beating an incumbent in a primary, said he won‚Äôt entertain the thought of jumping in against Biden, although he‚Äôs aware he‚Äôs being whispered about ‚Äì so much that a close friend had a dream over July Fourth weekend that he did it.\n\n‚ÄúAbsolutely not,‚Äù Khanna told CNN. ‚ÄúI plan to support (Biden) because of the danger that Donald Trump poses. I would certainly not do anything to weaken him, and I hope no one else will do anything to weaken him. He‚Äôs still the safe brand in the midwestern states to make sure Trump is kept far away from the Oval Office.‚Äù\n\nThat also goes for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has been causing the most antsy whispers from the Biden orbit with his comments calling out a lack of Democratic action and energy and his buying a July Fourth ad in Florida hitting Gov. Ron DeSantis, a prospective 2024 GOP candidate. Newsom, who‚Äôs facing reelection in November, compared the Democratic dynamics to those he initially faced in his recall election last year, when he and advisers worked to scare off several Democrats who‚Äôd looked at jumping in against him.\n\n‚ÄúThe success of our recall was about unifying around our party and defining the opposition. We need to unify the Democratic Party and not destroy ourselves from within,‚Äù Newsom said. ‚ÄúWe need to have our President‚Äôs back. But we also have to get on the field. He needs troops. He has to govern. Our job is to organize, and it‚Äôs to have his back.‚Äù\n\nThe same goes for J.B. Pritzker, the billionaire first-term Illinois governor who also drew some behind-the-scenes brushback from Biden world by delivering a speech about his exhaustion with the Democratic status quo in famous first-presidential primary state New Hampshire. The Democrat, who‚Äôs running for a second term in November, lit up even more speculation with his response to the Highland Park shooting in his state earlier this month, which was more forceful than Biden‚Äôs.\n\nBiden ‚Äúhas said he‚Äôs running for reelection and I support that,‚Äù Pritzker told CNN, adding that though he thinks some other opponent may yet emerge, Biden ‚Äúwill win the nomination, and yet, it‚Äôll be Ted Kennedy running against Jimmy Carter ‚Ä¶ They will lose and they will take away from the President. That‚Äôs not what we need right now.‚Äù\n\nThe speculation is at a high enough fever that when Pete Buttigieg‚Äôs PAC reactivated on Twitter at the end of June to endorse a few candidates for US House and state legislature, several plugged-in operatives began to wonder if this was the first step in the transportation secretary relaunching as a candidate. His attendance at Democratic National Committee events and meetings with a few potential future donors only sparked more talk.\n\nBut there‚Äôs nothing to that, according to a Transportation Department spokesperson, who said, ‚ÄúButtigieg has had no involvement in Win the Era PAC since his nomination as Secretary. He is 100 percent focused on his job at DOT, including implementing President Biden‚Äôs bipartisan infrastructure law.‚Äù\n\nSome have talked about Jared Polis, the Colorado governor known for straying from what became Democratic orthodoxy on Covid-19 lockdowns and is facing voters this fall. He has a personal fortune, several operatives noted, and while not enough to self-fund, enough to possibly seed a campaign and feel confident that he wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about endangering future job prospects. Polis campaign spokesperson Amber Miller said he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot considering anything like that and is focused on running the state of Colorado. If he is re-elected, he plans to serve his entire term as governor of Colorado.‚Äù\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has repeatedly said Biden intends to run and that she‚Äôd be his running mate, and no one around her or anywhere else believes she‚Äôd be able to pull off a campaign that started by breaking with him.\n\nSanders, the Vermont senator who has twice sought the Democratic nod, told CNN last month he would not run against Biden. A spokesperson for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, told CNN that nothing has changed since the Massachusetts Democrat told NBC News that she‚Äôs not running for president in 2024 and would be supporting Biden. Jeff Weaver, Sanders‚Äô top political adviser and former campaign manager, said trying to run by appealing to his wing of the party ‚Äúwould be an almost insurmountable climb to get to the top of that mountain, given that Bernie has said he‚Äôs going to be supporting Joe Biden if he runs for re-election.‚Äù\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated a member of Democratic House leadership to come to Congress, told late night host Stephen Colbert at the end of June that she was more focused on preserving American democracy than presidential speculation.\n\nBut she‚Äôs also held off on saying she would support Biden for reelection, noting that the President hasn‚Äôt said he‚Äôs running himself.\n\nAsked by CNN if that left space for her to consider running a youthful, progressive primary against him, a spokesperson for the congresswoman didn‚Äôt return requests for comment.\n\nFacing a ‚Äòsoft‚Äô primary\n\nCarter-Kennedy isn‚Äôt the only historical example on Democrats‚Äô minds. There‚Äôs Ronald Reagan‚Äôs bruising 1976 primary campaign against Republican President Gerald Ford, which helped pave the way for Carter‚Äôs win. Or George H.W. Bush never quite recovering from Pat Buchanan‚Äôs 1992 primary campaign, which hurt him with the GOP base heading into the general election.\n\nSeveral senior Democrats, though, cited 1968, when President Lyndon Johnson faced a primary challenge from Eugene McCarthy. Eventually, other candidates jumped in, leading the President to withdraw that March from running for reelection.\n\nOperatives around a number of prospective presidential candidates argue that Biden is already facing a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù primary challenge from many directions. The goal, they say, is not to run against Biden, but rather to implicitly reassure the President that Democrats have other good options from the next generation or two, and that he should be comfortable passing the torch to them.\n\nThe other goal is for Democrats to get as ready as they can, on the chance that Biden drags out his reelection decision and then changes his mind so late into the presidential cycle that other candidates are hobbled in launching campaigns and raising money.\n\nFor all the free media attention that would come from declaring a primary campaign against Biden, no one seems to want to go down as blowing a hole in the party for Republicans to march back through ‚Äì particularly at a moment when apocalyptic feelings are so high. This is about future ambitions, too: Those would-be candidates are aware Democratic voters would never forgive a spoiler.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about us having his back, not taking back some wing of the party,‚Äù Newsom said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about everybody disabusing ourselves that we have the luxury of division from within.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI believe there will be plenty of time post-Donald Trump to debate the future of the Democratic Party,‚Äù Khanna said. ‚ÄúFor people who have future ambition, they‚Äôd much rather be running in a post-Donald Trump and post-Joe Biden world.‚Äù\n\nBarack Obama faced a flurry of primary speculation at about this point ahead of his own reelection campaign 12 years ago ‚Äì to the point that Gallup tested how well he‚Äôd do if Hillary Clinton ran against him, and Sanders started poking around in New Hampshire about jumping in against him.\n\nMany of the Democratic leaders, operatives and donors who spoke to CNN about having these conversations insist it‚Äôs precisely their fear of Trump beating Biden that is driving them to cast around for possible other options.\n\nNot only is Biden now clocking lower approval ratings than almost every Democratic governor and senator on the ballot in November, but several internal Democratic polls have shown him struggling against Trump in battleground states.\n\nAsked if he understood what was generating the talk of a primary challenge that he thinks may yet emerge, Pritzker paused. First, he reiterated his support of Biden. Then, he repeated his call for more energy and action, without mentioning the President specifically.\n\n‚ÄúWe absolutely need to be stronger and louder in our condemnation of the right wing and what they stand for, and in our defense of the liberties of women and those who are marginalized,‚Äù Pritzker said. ‚ÄúThere is a palpable change in attitude among Democrats.‚Äù\n\nPushing back on the nudging\n\nBefore he launched his 2020 campaign, Biden advisers had bounced around the idea of a one-term pledge as a way to answer questions about his age. Biden nixed the idea, saying he‚Äôd never be able to get anything done as an immediate lame duck. He‚Äôs made similar comments about what would happen to his power at home and on the world stage if he were to announce he‚Äôs not running for reelection.\n\nFew around Biden see that changing. Some even suggested that a primary challenger could inadvertently help him recover from approval numbers stuck below 40% by giving him a foil. If that challenge came from the left and allowed him to argue he hasn‚Äôt kowtowed to progressives ‚Äì as Republicans and some Democratic moderates claim ‚Äì several operatives said that would be even better.\n\nBut as White House aides regularly point out, no incumbent president has launched a reelection campaign this early, and Biden was the last serious primary contender to announce a 2020 campaign, pushing back on those who urged him to declare earlier.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nobody who‚Äôs more infamous about his inability to make a decision about running for president of the United States,‚Äù joked one Democratic member of Congress, who asked not to be named. ‚ÄúAnd hey, he‚Äôs President.‚Äù\n\nAnd while four years ago at this same point ahead of the 2020 cycle, the Democratic National Committee was deep into preparations for primaries and debates, no such efforts are underway.\n\nLong before he became famous for managing Howard Dean‚Äôs anti-establishment 2004 presidential campaign (in what was an open Democratic field), Joe Trippi was a young aide to Kennedy‚Äôs 1980 primary challenge, running the floor operation for several states on the floor of the convention that summer.\n\nTrippi said he hopes anyone thinking of a Biden primary realizes it would be ‚Äúmurder-suicide,‚Äù and warned his fellow Democrats: ‚ÄúNothing good can come from it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI learned that lesson the hard way as a young idealistic progressive in the late 70s early 80s,‚Äù Trippi said. ‚ÄúWhat we got for it was eight years of Reagan and four years of H.W. Bush.‚Äù", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/politics/senate-race-rankings-october-elections/index.html", "title": "The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nThe race for the Senate is in the eye of the beholder less than six weeks from Election Day, with ads about abortion, crime and inflation dominating the airwaves in key states as campaigns test the theory of the 2022 election.\n\nThe cycle started out as a referendum on President Joe Biden ‚Äì an easy target for Republicans, who need a net gain of just one seat to flip the evenly divided chamber. Then the US Supreme Court‚Äôs late June decision overturning Roe v. Wade gave Democrats the opportunity to paint a contrast as Republicans struggled to explain their support for an abortion ruling that the majority of the country opposes. Former President Donald Trump‚Äôs omnipresence in the headlines gave Democrats another foil.\n\nBut the optimism some Democrats felt toward the end of the summer, on the heels of Biden‚Äôs legislative wins and the galvanizing high court decision, has been tempered slightly by the much anticipated tightening of some key races as political advertising ramps up on TV and voters tune in after Labor Day.\n\nRepublicans, who have midterm history on their side as the party out of the White House, have hammered Biden and Democrats for supporting policies they argue exacerbate inflation. Biden‚Äôs approval rating stands at 41% with 54% disapproving in the latest CNN Poll of Polls, which tracks the average of recent surveys. And with some prices inching back up after a brief hiatus, the economy and inflation ‚Äì which Americans across the country identify as their top concern in multiple polls ‚Äì are likely to play a crucial role in deciding voters‚Äô preferences.\n\nBut there‚Äôs been a steady increase in ads about crime too as the GOP returns to a familiar criticism, depicting Democrats as weak on public safety. Cops have been ubiquitous in TV ads this cycle ‚Äì candidates from both sides of the aisle have found law enforcement officers to testify on camera to their pro-police credentials. Democratic ads also feature women talking about the threat of a national abortion ban should the Senate fall into GOP hands, while Republicans have spent comparatively less trying to portray Democrats as the extremists on the topic.\n\nWhile the issue sets have fluctuated, the Senate map hasn‚Äôt changed. Republicans‚Äô top pickup opportunities have always been Nevada, Georgia, Arizona and New Hampshire ‚Äì all states that Biden carried in 2020. In two of those states, however, the GOP has significant problems, although the states themselves keep the races competitive. Arizona nominee Blake Masters is now without the support of the party‚Äôs major super PAC, which thinks its money can be better spent elsewhere, including in New Hampshire, where retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc is far from the nominee the national GOP had wanted. But this is the time of year when poor fundraising can really become evident since TV ad rates favor candidates and a super PAC gets much less bang for its buck.\n\nThe race for Senate control may come down to three states: Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania, all of which are rated as ‚ÄúToss-up‚Äù races by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. As Republicans look to flip the Senate, which Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has called a ‚Äú50-50 proposition,‚Äù they‚Äôre trying to pick up the first two and hold on to the latter.\n\nSenate Democrats‚Äô path to holding their majority lies with defending their incumbents. Picking off a GOP-held seat like Pennsylvania ‚Äì still the most likely to flip in CNN‚Äôs ranking ‚Äì would help mitigate any losses. Wisconsin, where GOP Sen. Ron Johnson is vying for a third term, looks like Democrats‚Äô next best pickup opportunity, but that race drops in the rankings this month as Republican attacks take a toll on the Democratic nominee in the polls.\n\nThese rankings are based on CNN‚Äôs reporting, fundraising and advertising data, and polling, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. It will be updated one more time before Election Day.\n\n1. Pennsylvania\n\nIncumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring)\n\nSarah Silbiger/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe most consistent thing about CNN‚Äôs rankings, dating back to 2021, has been Pennsylvania‚Äôs spot in first place. But the race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey has tightened since the primaries in May, when Republican Mehmet Oz emerged badly bruised from a nasty intraparty contest. In a CNN Poll of Polls average of recent surveys in the state, Democrat John Fetterman, the state lieutenant governor, had the support of 50% of likely voters to Oz‚Äôs 45%. (The Poll of Polls is an average of the four most recent nonpartisan surveys of likely voters that meet CNN‚Äôs standards.) Fetterman is still overperforming Biden, who narrowly carried Pennsylvania in 2020. Fetterman‚Äôs favorability ratings are also consistently higher than Oz‚Äôs.\n\nOne potential trouble spot for the Democrat: More voters in a late September Franklin and Marshall College Poll viewed Oz has having policies that would improve voters‚Äô economic circumstances, with the economy and inflation remaining the top concern for voters across a range of surveys. But nearly five months after the primary, the celebrity surgeon still seems to have residual issues with his base. A higher percentage of Democrats were backing Fetterman than Republicans were backing Oz in a recent Fox News survey, for example, with much of that attributable to lower support from GOP women than men. Fetterman supporters were also much more enthusiastic about their candidate than Oz supporters.\n\nRepublicans have been hammering Fetterman on crime, specifically his tenure on the state Board of Pardons: An ad from the Senate Leadership Fund features a Bucks County sheriff saying, ‚ÄúProtect your family. Don‚Äôt vote Fetterman.‚Äù But the lieutenant governor is also using sheriffs on camera to defend his record. And with suburban voters being a crucial demographic, Democratic advertising is also leaning into abortion, like this Senate Majority PAC ad that features a female doctor as narrator and plays Oz‚Äôs comments from during the primary about abortion being ‚Äúmurder.‚Äù Oz‚Äôs campaign has said that he supports exceptions for ‚Äúthe life of the mother, rape and incest‚Äù and that ‚Äúhe‚Äôd want to make sure that the federal government is not involved in interfering with the state‚Äôs decisions on the topic.‚Äù\n\n2. Nevada\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto\n\nCNN\n\nRepublicans have four main pickup opportunities ‚Äì and right now, Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto‚Äôs seat looks like one of their best shots. Biden carried Nevada by a slightly larger margin than two of those other GOP-targeted states, but the Silver State‚Äôs large transient population adds a degree of uncertainty to this contest.\n\nRepublicans have tried to tie the first-term senator to Washington spending and inflation, which may be particularly resonant in a place where average gas prices are now back up to over $5 a gallon. Democrats are zeroing in on abortion rights and raising the threat that a GOP-controlled Senate could pass a national abortion ban. Former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt ‚Äì the rare GOP nominee to have united McConnell and Trump early on ‚Äì called the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling a ‚Äújoke‚Äù before the Supreme Court overturned the decision in June. Democrats have been all too happy to use that comment against him, but Laxalt has tried to get around those attacks by saying he does not support a national ban and pointing out that the right to an abortion is settled law in Nevada.\n\n3. Georgia\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock\n\nMegan Varner/Getty Images\n\nThe closer we get to Election Day, the more we need to talk about the Georgia Senate race going over the wire. If neither candidate receives a majority of the vote in November, the contest will go to a December runoff. There was no clear leader in a recent Marist poll that had Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who‚Äôs running for a full six-year term, and Republican challenger Herschel Walker both under 50% among those who say they definitely plan to vote.\n\nWarnock‚Äôs edge from earlier this cycle has narrowed, which bumps this seat up one spot on the rankings. The good news for Warnock is that he‚Äôs still overperforming Biden‚Äôs approval numbers in a state that the President flipped in 2020 by less than 12,000 votes. And so far, he seems to be keeping the Senate race closer than the gubernatorial contest, for which several polls have shown GOP Gov. Brian Kemp ahead. Warnock‚Äôs trying to project a bipartisan image that he thinks will help him hold on in what had until recently been a reliably red state. Standing waist-deep in peanuts in one recent ad, he touts his work with Alabama GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville to ‚Äúeliminate the regulations,‚Äù never mentioning his own party. But Republicans have continued to try to tie the senator to his party ‚Äì specifically for voting for measures in Washington that they claim have exacerbated inflation.\n\nDemocrats are hoping that enough Georgians won‚Äôt see voting for Walker as an option ‚Äì even if they do back Kemp. Democrats have amped up their attacks on domestic violence allegations against the former football star and unflattering headlines about his business record. And all eyes will be on the mid-October debate to see how Walker, who has a history of making controversial and illogical comments, handles himself onstage against the more polished incumbent.\n\n4. Wisconsin\n\nIncumbent: Republican Ron Johnson\n\nLeigh VogelPool/Getty Images\n\nSen. Ron Johnson is the only Republican running for reelection in a state Biden won in 2020 ‚Äì in fact, he broke his own term limits pledge to run a third time, saying he believed America was ‚Äúin peril.‚Äù And although Johnson has had low approval numbers for much of the cycle, Democrats have underestimated him before. This contest moves down one spot on the ranking as Johnson‚Äôs race against Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes has tightened, putting the senator in a better position.\n\nBarnes skated through the August primary after his biggest opponents dropped out of the race, but as the nominee, he‚Äôs faced an onslaught of attacks, especially on crime, using against him his past words about ending cash bail and redirecting some funding from police budgets to social services. Barnes has attempted to answer those attacks in his ads, like this one featuring a retired police sergeant who says he knows ‚ÄúMandela doesn‚Äôt want to defund the police.‚Äù\n\nA Marquette University Law School poll from early September showed no clear leader, with Johnson at 49% and Barnes at 48% among likely voters, which is a tightening from the 7-point edge Barnes enjoyed in the same poll‚Äôs August survey. Notably, independents were breaking slightly for Johnson after significantly favoring Barnes in the August survey. The effect of the GOP‚Äôs anti-Barnes advertising can likely be seen in the increasing percentage of registered voters in a late September Fox News survey who view the Democrat as ‚Äútoo extreme,‚Äù putting him on parity with Johnson on that question. Johnson supporters are also much more enthusiastic about their candidate.\n\n5. Arizona\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly\n\nCourtney Pedroza/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly, who‚Äôs running for a full six-year term after winning a 2020 special election, is still one of the most vulnerable Senate incumbents in a state that has only recently grown competitive on the federal level. But Republican nominee Blake Masters is nowhere close to rivaling Kelly in fundraising, and major GOP outside firepower is now gone. After canceling its September TV reservations in Arizona to redirect money to Ohio, the Senate Leadership Fund has cut its October spending too.\n\nOther conservative groups are spending for Masters but still have work to do to hurt Kelly, a well-funded incumbent with a strong personal brand. Kelly led Masters 51% to 41% among registered voters in a September Marist poll, although that gap narrowed among those who said they definitely plan to vote. A Fox survey from a little later in the month similarly showed Kelly with a 5-point edge among those certain to vote, just within the margin of error.\n\nMasters has attempted to moderate his abortion position since winning his August primary, buoyed by a Trump endorsement, but Kelly has continued to attack him on the issue. And a recent court decision allowing the enforcement of a 1901 state ban on nearly all abortions has given Democrats extra fodder to paint Republicans as a threat to women‚Äôs reproductive rights.\n\n6. North Carolina\n\nIncumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring)\n\nDemetrius Freeman/Pool/Getty Images\n\nNorth Carolina slides up one spot on the rankings, trading places with New Hampshire. The open-seat race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Richard Burr hasn‚Äôt generated as much national buzz as other states given that Democrats haven‚Äôt won a Senate seat in the state since 2008.\n\nBut it has remained a tight contest with Democrat Cheri Beasley, who is bidding to become the state‚Äôs first Black senator, facing off against GOP Rep. Ted Budd, for whom Trump recently campaigned. Beasley lost reelection as state Supreme Court chief justice by only about 400 votes in 2020 when Trump narrowly carried the Tar Heel state. But Democrats hope that she‚Äôll be able to boost turnout among rural Black voters who might not otherwise vote during a midterm election and that more moderate Republicans and independents will see Budd as too extreme. One of Beasley‚Äôs recent spots features a series of mostly White, gray-haired retired judges in suits endorsing her as ‚Äúsomeone different‚Äù while attacking Budd as being a typical politician out for himself.\n\nBudd is leaning into current inflation woes, specifically going after Biden in some ads that feature half-empty shopping carts, without even mentioning Beasley. Senate Leadership Fund is doing the work of trying to tie the Democrat to Washington ‚Äì one recent spot almost makes her look like the incumbent in the race, superimposing her photo over an image of the US Capitol and displaying her face next to Biden‚Äôs. Both SLF and Budd are also targeting Beasley over her support for Democrats‚Äô recently enacted health care, tax and climate bill. ‚ÄúLiberal politician Cheri Beasley is coming for you ‚Äì and your wallet,‚Äù the narrator from one SLF ad intones, before later adding, ‚ÄúBeasley‚Äôs gonna knock on your door with an army of new IRS agents.‚Äù (The new law increases funding for the IRS, including for audits. But Democrats and the Trump-appointed IRS commissioner have said the intention is to go after wealthy tax cheats, not the middle class.)\n\n7. New Hampshire\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan\n\nErin Scott/Getty Images\n\nA lot has been made of GOP candidate quality this cycle. But there are few states where the difference between the nominee Republicans have and the one they‚Äôd hoped to have has altered these rankings quite as much as New Hampshire.\n\nRetired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who lost a 2020 GOP bid for the state‚Äôs other Senate seat, won last month‚Äôs Republican primary to take on first-term Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. The problem for him, though, is that he doesn‚Äôt have much money to wage that fight. Bolduc had raised a total of $579,000 through August 24 compared with Hassan‚Äôs $31.4 million. Senate Leadership Fund is on air in New Hampshire to boost the GOP nominee ‚Äì attacking Hassan for voting with Biden and her support of her party‚Äôs health care, tax and climate package. But because super PACs get much less favorable TV advertising rates than candidates, those millions won‚Äôt go anywhere near as far as Hassan‚Äôs dollars will.\n\nA year ago, Republicans were still optimistic that Gov. Chris Sununu would run for Senate, giving them a popular abortion rights-supporting nominee in a state that‚Äôs trended blue in recent federal elections. Bolduc told WMUR after his primary win that he‚Äôd vote against a national abortion ban. But ads from Hassan and Senate Majority PAC have seized on his suggestion in the same interview that the senator should ‚Äúget over‚Äù the abortion issue. Republicans recognize that abortion is a salient factor in a state Biden carried by 7 points, but they also argue that the election ‚Äì as Bolduc said to WMUR ‚Äì will be about the economy and that Hassan is an unpopular and out-of-touch incumbent.\n\nHassan led Bolduc 49% to 41% among likely voters in a Granite State Poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. The incumbent has consolidated Democratic support, but only 83% of Republicans said they were with Bolduc, the survey found. Still, some of those Republicans, like those who said they were undecided, could come home to the GOP nominee as the general election gets closer, which means Bolduc has room to grow. He‚Äôll need more than just Republicans to break his way, however, which is one reason he quickly pivoted on the key issue of whether the 2020 election was stolen days after he won the primary.\n\n8. Ohio\n\nIncumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring)\n\nTING SHEN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nOhio ‚Äì a state that twice voted for Trump by 8 points ‚Äì isn‚Äôt supposed to be on this list at No. 8, above Florida, which backed the former President by much narrower margins. But it‚Äôs at No. 8 for the second month in a row. Republican nominee J.D. Vance‚Äôs poor fundraising has forced Senate Leadership Fund to redirect millions from other races to Ohio to shore him up and attack Rep. Tim Ryan, the Democratic nominee who had the airwaves to himself all summer. The 10-term congressman has been working to distance himself from his party in most of his ads, frequently mentioning that he ‚Äúvoted with Trump on trade‚Äù and criticizing the ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù movement. Vance is finally on the air, trying to poke some holes in Ryan‚Äôs image.\n\nBut polling still shows a tight race with no clear leader. Ryan had an edge with independents in a recent Siena College/Spectrum News poll, which also showed that Vance ‚Äì Trump‚Äôs pick for the nomination ‚Äì has more work to do to consolidate GOP support after an ugly May primary. Assuming he makes up that support and late undecided voters break his way, Vance will likely hold the advantage in the end given the Buckeye State‚Äôs solidifying red lean.\n\n9. Florida\n\nIncumbent: Republican Marco Rubio\n\nDREW ANGERER/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nDemocrats face an uphill battle against GOP Sen. Marco Rubio in an increasingly red-trending state, which Trump carried by about 3 points in 2020 ‚Äì nearly tripling his margin from four years earlier.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Val Demings, who easily won the party‚Äôs nomination in August, is a strong candidate who has even outraised the GOP incumbent, but not by enough to seriously jeopardize his advantage. She‚Äôs leaning into her background as the former Orlando police chief ‚Äì it features prominently in her advertising, in which she repeatedly rejects the idea of defunding the police. Still, Rubio has tried to tie her to the ‚Äúradical left‚Äù in Washington to undercut her own law enforcement background.\n\n10. Colorado\n\nIncumbent: Democrat Michael Bennet\n\nDEMETRIUS FREEMAN/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Michael Bennet is no stranger to tough races. In 2016, he only won reelection by 6 points against an underfunded GOP challenger whom the national party had abandoned. Given GOP fundraising challenges in some of their top races, the party hasn‚Äôt had the resources to seriously invest in the Centennial State this year.\n\nBut in his bid for a third full term, Bennet is up against a stronger challenger in businessman Joe O‚ÄôDea, who told CNN he disagreed with the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. His wife and daughter star in his ads as he tries to cut a more moderate profile and vows not to vote the party line in Washington.\n\nBennet, however, is attacking O‚ÄôDea for voting for a failed 2020 state ballot measure to ban abortion after 22 weeks of pregnancy and arguing that whatever O‚ÄôDea says about supporting abortion rights, he‚Äôd give McConnell ‚Äúthe majority he needs‚Äù to pass a national abortion ban.", "authors": ["Simone Pathe"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/24/republican-gop-presidential-debate-new-hampshire-south-carolina/70641914007/", "title": "First Republican debate: Here's what voters in NH, SC thought", "text": "The first Republican presidential primary debate of the 2024 cycle was a chance for eight GOP candidates to introduce themselves to a national audience.\n\nBut more importantly, it was the first time voters in critical early voting states saw how the candidates fared up against each other. At watch parties in New Hampshire and South Carolina, two states that can make or break a presidential campaign, voters told USA TODAY what they thought of the crowded field of White House hopefuls.\n\nIn South Carolina, which former Gov. Nikki Haley and Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. each call home, young constituents are largely sticking with former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a preference Wednesday‚Äôs debate did little to sway.\n\nAnd in New Hampshire, where voters are famous for pressing candidates with tough questions during the primary season, the debate was an opportunity to see how the Republicans clashed on a national stage.\n\n'The elephant not in the room':5 takeaways from a Republican debate with no Donald Trump\n\nThe crowd favorites: None in New Hampshire, DeSantis in South Carolina\n\nAt Murphy‚Äôs Taproom in Manchester, New Hampshire, where roughly a hundred prospective Republican primary voters gathered, there were no specific crowd favorites as attendees watched the debate Wednesday night. The watch party showed how Granite State voters will give a wide range of candidates a shot: almost every candidate garnered some form of applause during the debate.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see how everybody conducts themselves,‚Äù Kenneth Biel, a 47-year-old software engineer hailing from Chester, said. He added that he‚Äôs most impressed by Trump, DeSantis and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, but he's open to people \"I disagree with.‚Äù\n\nAs former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ramaswamy squabbled over Trump‚Äôs presidency, both candidates drew occasional claps and cheers for their support, or lack thereof, for the former president.\n\nHaley drew cheers from the crowd when the former South Carolina governor invoked former United Kingdom Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, chiming in when the nearly all-male field quarreled on stage.\n\n‚ÄúIf you want something said, ask a man. If you want something done, ask a woman,‚Äù quipped Haley.\n\nBack in Haley‚Äôs home state, a crowd of around 20 people gathered at a Wild Wing Cafe in Greenville, South Carolina for a debate watch party hosted by Young Greenville, a Republican club. Following along with bingo cards of potential phrases or topics, the group of mostly 20-year-old voters paid close attention to the debate with animated reactions ‚àí DeSantis‚Äô criticism of President Joe Biden‚Äôs economic and pandemic policies drew cheers and claps early on.\n\nThe bingo cards referenced GOP talking points ranging from Second Amendment rights to immigration reform to Hunter Biden.\n\nThe Florida governor was a crowd favorite in Greenville: a straw poll by the club at the end of the night, with about half of the attendees remaining, found that just over 60% preferred DeSantis as their first choice for president, and around 40% said he was their second.\n\nDakota Fitzgerald, 28 and a self-described ‚ÄúTrump all the way‚Äù voter, said even though she thought Haley came out strong early in the debate, she did not believe her former governor has what it takes.\n\n‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not the nominee for me,‚Äù Fitzgerald, who works in IT development, said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think she brings enough to the table. I don‚Äôt think she has a good enough track record, and I don‚Äôt know that she‚Äôs a solid enough patriot.‚Äù\n\nWhen it came to Scott, the group of young voters had less to say about their senator.\n\nHayden Turlington, chairwoman of Young Greenville and a wealth advisor, said she thought Scott held his own on the debate stage. A DeSantis supporter though, Turlington said she couldn't move past Scott‚Äôs recent criticism of the Florida governor and his state‚Äôs controversial curriculum changes.\n\n‚ÄúIt left a bad taste in my mouth, his comments,‚Äù Turlington, 27, said. ‚ÄúThey were not far off from Governor (Gavin) Newsom from California‚Äôs comments, and I don‚Äôt think he should ever be finding himself on the same side as a governor who is as far left as Governor Newsom.‚Äù\n\nAbortion isn‚Äôt a catch-all issue for GOP voters\n\nAs the Republican candidates discussed abortion Wednesday night, touting anti-abortion accomplishments, some South Carolinians in the audience complained that Haley and Scott did not mention specific laws in their state.\n\n‚ÄúI think they missed a softball pitch that literally the day of the debate they could‚Äôve talked about that exact subject and something that happened in their home state,‚Äù Chip Turlington, 26, said.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the South Carolina Supreme Court upheld the state‚Äôs six week abortion ban.\n\nIn the more libertarian-leaning state of New Hampshire, anti-abortion messaging largely fell on deaf ears.\n\nWhile former Vice President Mike Pence‚Äôs unapologetic support for a federal abortion ban drew a muted response from the crowd, it was North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum‚Äôs support for leaving the issue to states that garnered wide applause from attendees.\n\nZack Hayes, 39, a software engineer from Northwood, said he personally is against abortion rights. But he said he would oppose a national ban on the procedure, calling it ‚Äútoo broad a policy.‚Äù\n\nWhich candidates were missed on the national debate stage?\n\nBefore the debate began, Pedro Mateo in South Carolina said he didn‚Äôt think any of the candidates on stage had ‚Äúthe sway‚Äù to take on Trump ‚àí a view he still held two hours later.\n\n‚ÄúAt this point, until they‚Äôre able to sit down with Trump, I think unless they get a chance to really debate him, the majority of Americans are just going to think that Trump is just the clear choice,‚Äù Mateo, 28, said as the debate concluded.\n\nTrump, the current GOP frontrunner, opted to sit out of the debate, writing on his Truth Social platform, ‚ÄúThe public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had.‚Äù\n\nMateo, chairman of the political engagement committee for Young Greenville, said he thinks it was in the former president‚Äôs best interest not to join in this initial debate.\n\n‚ÄúIf he did show up, it would be an all-out assault on him,‚Äù Mateo said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs enough talking points to use against him to really steal his thunder on the debate stage.‚Äù\n\nSome viewers in New Hampshire bemoaned the debate‚Äôs qualification rules, saying they wished there were more candidates on the stage.\n\n‚ÄúThere are a couple (candidates) that I would have liked to have seen on stage to hear more from them,‚Äù Tammy Garthewaite, a 59-year-old former lawmaker in New Hampshire's state House from Manchester, said.

Putin's people placed her there by design, choosing a \"nondescript woman,\" as she put it, so the Russian president would have no competition for attention.\n\nFluent in Russian, she often carefully took in the conversations of men who seemed to forget she was there and wrote it all down later, she recalled in an Associated Press interview. \"Hey, if I was a guy, you wouldn't be talking like this in front of me,\" she remembered thinking. \"But go ahead. I'm listening.\"\n\nHill expected not to be similarly invisible when she later went to work for another world leader, Donald Trump, as his Russia adviser in the White House. She could see inside Putin's head, had co-written an acclaimed book about him, but Trump did not want her counsel, either. He ignored her in meeting after meeting, once mistaking her for a secretary and calling her \"darlin'.\"\n\nAgain, though, she was listening. She was reading Trump like she had read Putin.\n\nThe result is \"There Is Nothing for You Here,\" her book out last week. Unlike other tell-all authors from the Trump administration, she isn't obsessed with the scandalous. Much like her measured but riveting testimony in Trump's first impeachment, the book offers a more sober, and thus perhaps more alarming, portrait of the 45th president.\n\nAn unsparing look at Trump\n\nIf Hill's tone is restrained, it is damning by a thousand cuts. It lays out how a career devoted to understanding and managing the Russian threat crashed into her revelation that the greatest threat to America comes from within.\n\nIn fly-on-the-wall detail, she describes a president with a voracious appetite for praise and little to no taste for governing ‚Äî a man so consumed with what others said about him that U.S. relations with other countries rose or fell according to how flattering foreign leaders were in their remarks.\n\nFrom his staff and everyone who came into his orbit, Trump demanded constant attention and adulation,\" she writes. Particularly in international affairs, \"The president's vanity and fragile self-esteem were a point of acute vulnerability.\"\n\nHill describes Putin manipulating Trump by offering or withholding compliments, a maneuver she said was more effective with this president than getting dirt and blackmailing him would have been. At their joint news conference in Finland, when Trump appeared to side with Putin over his own intelligence agencies on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, Hill almost lost it.\n\n\"I wanted to end the whole thing,\" she writes. \"I contemplated throwing a fit or faking a seizure and hurling myself backward into the row of journalists behind me. But it would only have added to the humiliating spectacle.\"\n\nMore:'Fierce, focused and fearless': Fiona Hill emerges as a principled voice in impeachment inquiry\n\nYet in Trump she saw a rare if ultimately wasted talent. He spoke the language of many average people, disdained the same things, operated without a filter, liked the same food and gleefully shredded the tiresome norms of the elite. While Hillary Clinton sipped champagne with donors, Trump was out there pitching coal and steel jobs ‚Äî at least that was the impression.\n\n\"He clearly had a feel for what people wanted,\" she told the AP. \"He could talk the talk, even if he couldn't walk the walk in having their experiences. But he understood it.\"\n\nYet that skill was squandered, in her view. Where it could have been used to mobilize people for good, it was instead used only in service of himself ‚Äî \"Me the People\" as a chapter title puts it.\n\nOn Trump and Putin\n\nTrump's vanity also doomed his Helsinki meeting with Putin and any chances for a coveted arms control deal with Russia. The questions at the news conference \"got right to the heart of his insecurities,\" Hill writes. If Trump had agreed that Russia had interfered in the election on his behalf, in his mind he might as well have said, \"I am illegitimate.\"\n\nIt was clear to Putin that the resulting backlash would undermine even the vague commitments he and Trump had made. \"On his way out the door from the conference,\" Hill writes, \"he told his press secretary, within earshot of our interpreter, that the press conference was 'bullshit.'\"\n\nTrump admired Putin for his wealth, power and fame, seeing him, in Hill's words, as the \"ultimate badass.\" During the course of his presidency, Trump would come to resemble the autocratic and populist Russian leader more than he resembled any recent American presidents, she writes, and \"Sometimes even I was startled by how glaringly obvious the similarities were.\"\n\nPutin's ability to manipulate the Russian political system to potentially stay in power indefinitely also made an impression. \"Trump sees that and says what's there not to like about that kind of situation?\" Hill told the AP.\n\nTrump, a Republican, was impeached by the House in late 2019 for trying to use his leverage over Ukraine to undermine Joe Biden, his eventual Democratic rival, among the first of his efforts to stay in office by unconventional means, stretching to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol by a mob he had told to \" fight like hell.\"\n\nImpeachment trial brought Fiona Hill national attention\n\nHill had served as the national intelligence officer for Russia from early 2006 until late 2009 and was highly respected in Washington circles, but it was only during the impeachment hearings that she was introduced to the nation. She became one of the most damaging witnesses against the president she had served, undercutting his defense by testifying that he had sent his envoys to Ukraine on a \"domestic political errand\" that had nothing to do with national security policy.\n\nShe began her testimony by describing her improbable journey as the daughter of a coal miner from an impoverished town in northeast England to the White House. She also explained her desire to serve a country that \"has offered me opportunities I never would have had in England.\"\n\nMuch of her new book expands on that personal journey, a story told with self-deprecating humor and kindness. Along the way, Hill the Brookings Institution scholar weaves in a study of the changing societies she witnessed over the decades as a child in Britain, a student and researcher in Russia and finally as a citizen of the United States.\n\nThe changes in all three countries are strikingly similar, due in part to the destruction of heavy industry. The result is what she calls a \"crisis of opportunity\" and the rise of populist leaders like Putin, Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson able to tap into the fears and grievances of those feeling left behind.\n\nShe said she went into the White House worried about what Russia was doing and \"came out, having realized fully watching all of this, that actually the problem was the United States ... and the Russians were just exploiting everything.\"\n\nHill calls Russia a cautionary tale, \"America's Ghost of Christmas Future,\" if the U.S. is unable to heal its political divisions.\n\nHailing from a more civil form of politics, President Joe Biden is trying to bring the country together and advance its reputation abroad, she said, but \"he's, in a way, a kind of man standing alone and people are not pulling behind him.\"\n\nAP video journalist Nathan Ellgren contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/15/opinions/search-warrant-trumps-mar-a-lago-trump-criminal-liability/index.html", "title": "Opinion: Trump is worried after FBI search -- and he should be | CNN", "text": "Editor‚Äôs Note: Norman Eisen is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

Individuals are subject to conviction under the act if they willfully retain and fail to deliver information ‚Äúrelating to the national defense‚Äù upon the demand of a federal officer entitled to receive such information that has come into the individuals‚Äô possession.\n\nThis statute comes into play because the FBI retrieved 11 sets of classified documents from Mar-a-Lago last Monday. Information is marked ‚Äúsecret‚Äù if its unauthorized release would cause ‚Äúserious damage to national security.‚Äù Information that would cause ‚Äúexceptionally grave damage to national security‚Äù is marked ‚Äútop secret.‚Äù If information is marked ‚ÄúTS/SCI,‚Äù it is even more highly protected ‚Äì ‚Äútop secret/sensitive compartmented information,‚Äù meaning that it comes from sensitive sources or methods.\n\nIn short, while all the material recovered could be considered stolen government property, the classified documents that the FBI retrieved and that were marked ‚Äútop secret‚Äù and ‚Äúvarious classified/TS/SCI‚Äù are of special concern. Although the Espionage Act does not require that ‚Äúinformation related to the national defense‚Äù be classified, these highly sensitive documents would likely fall under the definition of ‚Äúinformation relating to the national defense‚Äù under the Espionage Act.\n\nFinally, there is the offense of obstructing a pending federal investigation by concealing documents relating to that investigation. It carries the heaviest potential penalty: up to 20 years in prison. As grave as violations of the first two statutes are, interfering with a Justice Department investigation is especially serious.\n\nTrump has denied all wrongdoing and claims the investigation is politically motivated.\n\nReporting has already detailed the concerning pattern of document turnover. It started with negotiations and voluntary requests from national archivists in 2021, resulting in the return of 15 boxes of materials in 2022. That was followed in the spring by a grand jury subpoena evidently compelling production of documents. Then investigators visited in June, taking still more documents with them and at some later point securing the recently reported, evidently false statement that all material marked as classified had been returned.\n\nNeither that subpoena nor the lawyer‚Äôs June delivery produced the 11 sets of classified information that the FBI said it took from Mar-a-Lago last week.\n\nThe warrant‚Äôs release explains what Attorney General Merrick Garland was talking about on Thursday when he spoke of the ‚Äústandard practice to seek less intrusive means‚Äù than a search warrant whenever possible. He was telling us that the Justice Department tried everything else (and then some) first.\n\nNote that if Trump or others did not honestly comply with the subpoena, that‚Äôs a separate possible crime. That might be why the department reportedly subpoenaed the surveillance footage of people going in and out of the document rooms. Government officials were also understandably concerned about who had access to classified documents.\n\nFurther, if Trump and those around him, including his lawyers, made intentionally inaccurate statements to the government, they may be criminally liable for making false statements.\n\nWhile this new report on a lawyer‚Äôs letter casts added light on the situation, gaps necessarily remain. As is standard operating procedure, the Justice Department has not released the FBI agent‚Äôs sworn affidavit supporting the search warrant. Such affidavits, and the evidence they contain, are closely held until soon after the DOJ files any criminal charges.\n\nDisclosing affidavits prematurely can give away the government‚Äôs case and inform targets what investigatory routes they need to block, what evidence to destroy and what potential witnesses‚Äô cooperation they need to forestall. That is why Garland should hold firm despite demands from some of the former President‚Äôs allies in Congress to see the affidavit.\n\nThe ordinary reasons apply with even greater force in a case involving exceptionally sensitive national security data and a highly confidential informant. In our current, hyper-charged political environment, when an armed follower of Trump‚Äôs social media site enters a Cincinnati FBI office with an apparent intent to kill, any public information on a reported Mar-a-Lago informant could easily put that person‚Äôs life in danger.\n\nStill, Garland has adeptly brought the picture into focus with his properly terse statement and release of the warrant ‚Äì while complying with the DOJ‚Äôs stringent rules on what can and cannot be said. We shouldn‚Äôt take the attorney general‚Äôs integrity and prosecutorial experience for granted. After all, we just had Bill Barr, whose distortions as attorney general of the Mueller report may have emboldened Trump‚Äôs belief in complete personal impunity from legal consequences. In the Nixon era, we had enabling Attorney Generals John Mitchell and Richard Kleindienst, both of whom were convicted of crimes\n\nGiven Garland‚Äôs care to follow the rules, we are going to have to be satisfied with his disclosures for a while. We are now in the window Garland laid out in his recent memo about the DOJ avoiding any actions that could be perceived as affecting an election before it takes place. (Although the window is often referred to as a three-month one, the memo is silent as to the actual number of days.)\n\nTrump remains one of the most polarizing characters in American politics, and any action taken could have an impact on the midterm elections. That is so even though Trump has not declared his candidacy for 2024 and is not on any ballot.\n\nThe accumulation of allegations adds to the chances that Trump might be charged. It‚Äôs not just the possible removal of documents, or even the more serious national security ones. It‚Äôs that documents appear to have been withheld again and again.\n\nMoreover, Garland‚Äôs moves last week were not necessarily just about potential document crimes. As an earlier overview explained, the DOJ can use anything found pursuant to the search warrant to prove other possible crimes.\n\nThere are three fronts on which federal criminal investigations are likely to proceed, quietly before November but perhaps more loudly afterward: alleged document crimes, conspiracy to defraud the United States by seeking to overturn the 2020 election before January 6, 2021, and obstruction of Congress on January 6.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion‚Äôs newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nOn Sunday, Trump may have dropped a hint that the FBI seized information related to the latter two. He complained on his site, Truth Social, that the FBI ‚Äútook boxes of ‚Äòattorney-client‚Äô material, and also ‚Äòexecutive‚Äô privilege material which they knowingly should not have taken.‚Äù We know that attorney-client and executive privilege arguments have loomed large in the January 6 investigations. Time will tell whether the FBI also swept up information relating to additional matters separate from the removal of classified documents.\n\nTrump‚Äôs groundless caterwauling this past week proves he‚Äôs concerned about possible prosecution. He should be. There are just too many ongoing investigations to think that he can dodge them all.", "authors": ["Norman Eisen Asha Rangappa Dennis Aftergut", "Norman Eisen", "Asha Rangappa", "Dennis Aftergut"], "publish_date": "2022/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/weather/hurricane-ian-florida-path-thursday/index.html", "title": "'Substantial loss of life' possible in Florida as Hurricane Ian takes ...", "text": "Editor‚Äôs Note: Affected by the storm?

Due to the damage to the causeway, first-responders are only able to get to the island by boat.\n\n‚ÄúThe island is in rough shape,‚Äù said Sanibel Police Chief Bill Dalton. ‚ÄúThe power infrastructure is severely damaged. I would be surprised that there‚Äôs a single structure on the island that hasn‚Äôt been impacted by the storm.‚Äù\n\nSanibel, in Lee County, ‚Äúgot hit with really biblical storm surge,‚Äù Gov. Ron DeSantis said. Lee County Utilities issued a systemwide boil-water notice for all customers effective immediately due to the impacts of the hurricane, according to county officials.\n\n‚ÄúI just literally got out of a helicopter where I was able to take a complete tour of the entire county and there‚Äôs really no words that I can say to tell you what I‚Äôve seen,‚Äù Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marcino said on CNN Thursday. ‚ÄúThe Fort Myers Beach area, buildings, major, major homes and buildings completely washed away with vehicles in the water, vehicles in the bay, boats are upside down.‚Äù\n\nDeSantis said Thursday night that he surveyed damage in Charlotte County and Lee County.\n\n‚ÄúSome of the damage was indescribable,‚Äù DeSantis said, adding he saw cars and homes floating in water. ‚ÄúThe most significant damage I saw was on Fort Myers Beach. Some of the homes were wiped out, some were just concrete slabs.‚Äù\n\nAbout 200 people have been rescued by the Fort Myers Fire Department, Fort Myers Mayor Kevin Anderson told CNN Thursday night. The search and rescue operations appear to have come to an end in the city, according to Anderson.\n\nAnderson said city has not had any fatalities. On Friday, the city will open ‚Äúseveral food, water and ice distribution centers,‚Äù Anderson said.\n\nA boil water notice is in effect in the city of Fort Myers, according to a government statement posted Thursday. ‚ÄúThis applies to water consumed for drinking, washing dishes, and brushing teeth among other uses,‚Äù the statement said.\n\nLee County ‚Äì which includes Fort Myers ‚Äî issued a boil water notice Wednesday.\n\nOfficials in Kissimmee ‚Äì just south of Orlando ‚Äì told CNN Thursday evening ‚Äúit‚Äôs been a worst-case scenario‚Äù for the city.\n\n‚ÄúOne of our hospitals here, Osceola Regional ‚Äì which is a trauma two-level center ‚Äì was surrounded by water this morning.

As of 2 p.m. Thursday, more than 500 people have been rescued in Charlotte and Lee counties, the Florida Department of Emergency Management said in a tweet. In Orlando, emergency responders navigating a street-turned-river told CNN they had conducted at least 200 rescues since early Thursday morning.\n\nThe US Coast Guard‚Äôs 7th District rescued 68 people Thursday, which is included in the 700 state-wide rescues the governor reported Thursday, according to Rear Adm. Brendan McPherson.\n\nFlorida First Lady, Casey DeSantis, said Thursday she launched the Florida Disaster Fund to assist in rescue efforts. The fund raised more than $10 million within 24 hours of its launch, she said.\n\nThe rescue efforts come a day after Ian came ashore near Cayo Costa as a Category 4 hurricane with 150-mph winds, making it one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall on Florida‚Äôs west coast. The storm cut a path from near Fort Myers in the southwest across to the eastern part of the state, and its combination of wind, rain and storm surge caused flooding that DeSantis called ‚Äúa 500-year flood event.‚Äù\n\nHere are the latest developments:\n\n‚Ä¢ Hurricane warnings for South Carolina: Hurricane warnings are in place for the entire coast of South Carolina.

There‚Äôs debris everywhere,‚Äù he said.\n\nAs Ian continued moving northeast, heavy rain and flooding has been reported in the Orlando area, where 8 to 12 inches of rain had already fallen and up to 4 more inches of rain was expected. In Orlando, a reporter for CNN affiliate WESH rescued a woman after seeing her trying to drive through floodwaters, carrying her on his back in waist-high water to dry ground, WESH video showed.\n\nIn Fort Myers ‚Äì where about 90% of electric customers were without power ‚Äì Fire Chief Tracy McMillion told residents to stay inside, and to stay hopeful. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre coming for you, be encouraged,‚Äù he told residents Wednesday night.\n\nThe city‚Äôs downtown streets were flooded Wednesday with almost 4 feet of water, Mayor Kevin Anderson told CNN.\n\nThomas Podgorny was trapped in his two-story home in Fort Myers with three others, watching vehicles float away outside and worrying about others who did not evacuate, he told CNN Wednesday evening.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost my house. I have water and gas flowing through my bottom floor,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMy neighbors have very little breathing room in their one-story house.‚Äù\n\nOne couple there was trapped in their home when the ceiling caved in.\n\n‚ÄúSomething is dripping on me,‚Äù Belinda Collins recalled her partner saying. ‚ÄúHe got up, and the ceiling ‚Äì the family room ceiling ‚Äì caved in.‚Äù They called 911 and were waiting for a call back about when it would be safe to leave, they said.\n\nIn Port Charlotte, the storm tore off the roof above a hospital‚Äôs ICU with patients inside Wednesday, forcing staff to move them to a post-operation recovery area, Dr. Birgit Bodine, an internal medicine specialist at the facility, told CNN.\n\nWater gushed down stairwells to other floors, and other patients needed to be moved either to beds in hallways or to a different, dry wing of the hospital.\n\n‚ÄúWe still have water in hallways that we‚Äôre still sloshing through,‚Äù but patients are safe in dry beds, and as many as possible were transferred to the dry wing, Bodine told CNN Thursday morning.\n\nPeople in nearby Collier County, which includes Naples, were also trapped in their homes, calling for help, after electricity went out. In Naples, half the streets were not passable Wednesday because of high water, officials said.\n\n‚ÄúSome are reporting life threatening medical emergencies in deep water. We will get to them first. Some are reporting water coming into their house but not life threatening. They will have to wait.

Deputies were ‚Äúresponding to the highest priority calls‚Äù that still were in the queue Thursday morning, the office said.\n\nResidents in parts of Pasco County were also asked to boil their tap water as the water distribution system in the area lost pressure and a water main ruptured.\n\nIn Manatee County, residents were asked to limit flushing, showering, doing dishes and laundry due to power outages impacting the system.\n\nIn Cape Coral, authorities were getting reports of significant structural damage across the city, Ryan Lamb, the city‚Äôs fire chief and emergency management director, told CNN.\n\nDeSantis has asked President Biden to approve a major disaster declaration for all 67 counties in the state, his office said in a news release. DeSantis is also asking Biden to grant FEMA the authority to provide 100% federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures for the first 60 days from Ian‚Äôs landfall.\n\nSouth Carolina braces for incoming storm\n\nWith Ian again a Category 1 hurricane, a state of emergency was declared in Charleston County Thursday.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to hit South Carolina Friday near or just after these high tide times in the 11 a.m. hour. It‚Äôs currently located about 240 miles south of Charleston and is moving toward the north-northeast at 10 mph, according to the hurricane center.\n\n‚ÄúWe are looking at an early afternoon landfall,‚Äù said CNN Meteorologist Tom Sater. ‚ÄúThe entire southeastern coastline is pretty much going to be inundated with a surge again. It‚Äôs not going to be what we saw in southwest Florida, but in Charleston you toss in ‚Ä¶ 7 feet of a surge, the entire downtown historic area is flooded.‚Äù\n\nCoastal cities along the East Coast like Jacksonville, Florida, Savannah, Georgia, and Wilmington, North Carolina, could see anywhere from 2-7 feet of storm surge, Sater said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the biggest variable with Hurricane Ian may be ‚Äúhuman reaction‚Äù to the storm.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs people failing to take the necessary precautions. That‚Äôs the real danger that we have, is human error,‚Äù McMaster said. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt make much difference whether this comes in at hurricane strength or below at storm strength or somewhere on the line, cause it‚Äôs going to be blowing strong winds and it‚Äôs going to be all over the state at different levels.‚Äù\n\nThe US Geological Survey coastal change forecasts released Thursday predicts waves and surges will likely cause 11% of South Carolina‚Äôs dunes and 1% of Georgia‚Äôs dunes to be continuously covered by ocean water.\n\n‚ÄúThis is the most severe type of storm effect on coastal beaches, with flooding behind the dunes that may impact coastal communities,‚Äù a news release from the USGS said.\n\nAdditionally, 43% of South Carolina‚Äôs dunes and 24% of Georgia‚Äôs dunes are expected to be overwashed by Ian. This means sand will be pushed inland, resulting in changes to the coastal landscape that could block roadways.\n\n‚ÄúOverwash can reduce the height of protective sand dunes, alter beach profiles and leave areas behind the dunes more vulnerable to future storms,‚Äù the release said.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story had the incorrect location for storm witness Scott Carlos.

Based on our review of surveillance video, social media activity, and witness accounts, we understand you led a tour group through parts of the Capitol complex on January 5, 2021. That group stayed for several hours, despite the complex being closed to the public on that day,‚Äù the committee‚Äôs chairman, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, said Wednesday in a new letter to Loudermilk.\n\n‚ÄúSurveillance footage shows a tour of approximately ten individuals led by you to areas in the Rayburn, Longworth, and Cannon House Office Buildings, as well as the entrances to tunnels leading to the U.S. Capitol,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIndividuals on the tour photographed and recorded areas of the complex not typically of interest to tourists, including hallways, staircases, and security checkpoints.‚Äù\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, a member of the House select committee, told CNN‚Äôs Erin Burnett on ‚ÄúOutFront‚Äù later Wednesday that she was ‚Äúsurprised by the letter because if you look at the video you can see with your own eyes what was happening,‚Äù adding that it ‚Äúwas not reflected in the letter from the Capitol Police.‚Äù\n\nLoudermilk pushes back against ‚Äòfalse narrative‚Äô\n\nLoudermilk said in a statement to CNN after the video‚Äôs release Wednesday that ‚Äúthe Capitol Police already put this false accusation to bed, yet the Committee is undermining the Capitol Police and doubling down on their smear campaign, releasing so-called evidence of a tour of the House Office Buildings, which I have already publicly addressed.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAs Capitol Police confirmed, nothing about this visit with constituents was suspicious. The pictures show children holding bags from the House gift shop, which was open to visitors, and taking pictures of the Rayburn train,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThis false narrative that the Committee and Democrats continue to push, that Republicans, including myself, led reconnaissance tours is verifiably false. No where that I went with the visitors in the House Office Buildings on January 5th were breached on January 6th; and, to my knowledge, no one in that group was criminally charged in relation to January 6th.‚Äù\n\nLoudermilk also said he has received threatening voicemail messages after the committee‚Äôs allegations about the tour.\n\nLofgren, a California Democrat, emphasized that the committee hadn‚Äôt accused Loudermilk of any wrongdoing by requesting he speak with them, saying, ‚ÄúWe asked him to come in and talk to us about this tour, which he has not done even yet.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd as you can see from the video, we were going to go over the video with him. Since he has refused to come in, we released it and he can look at it now,‚Äù she continued.\n\nAsked by Burnett what would motivate the Capitol Police to provide a differing account, Lofgren said, ‚ÄúI have no idea whether it is a competence issue or what, but it is not accurate. And as you can see with your own eyes from the video, what they said was not accurate.‚Äù\n\nConflicting explanations about tour\n\nThe committee first reached out to Loudermilk last month. The committee also indicated it had reviewed evidence that ‚Äúdirectly contradicts‚Äù previous claims by Republican lawmakers who said security footage from the days before January 6 shows there were ‚Äúno tours, no large groups, no one with MAGA hats on‚Äù at the US Capitol complex. Days after the attack, some Democrats began accusing Republicans of providing tours to individuals who later went on to storm the Capitol.\n\nThe committee has not explicitly accused Loudermilk of leading a reconnaissance tour but it did ask him to voluntarily answer questions about what is seen on the video released Wednesday. Loudermilk‚Äôs story, however, has repeatedly shifted in terms of the details of what happened on January 5.\n\nAs the Capitol riot was unfolding, Loudermilk spoke to a local Georgia radio station and said he met with ‚Äúabout a dozen‚Äù people from his home state the day prior on Capitol Hill who had traveled to Washington for the Trump rally that preceded the attack.\n\nLoudermilk said during the interview that he hosted the people in his office and on the day of the riot, checked to make sure they were safe.\n\n‚ÄúWe actually had about a dozen people up here that wanted to come and visit, we had them on our office. They definitely were, uh, peaceful people that we‚Äôd met at church ‚Ä¶ they were supporters of the President, they just wanted to be up here as if it was another rally,‚Äù he told Georgia radio station WBHF on January 6, 2021, from an undisclosed location as rioters were storming the Capitol.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve actually checked on them to make sure they were safe. They saw what it was turning into , they immediately turned and went back down the Mall to get away from the crowd here,‚Äù he added.\n\nIn the time since, Loudermilk has characterized the participants in this January 5 meeting as his constituents, including families with children.\n\nHouse Republicans suggested they may release video they believe exonerates Loudermilk of any insinuation that he led a so-called ‚Äúreconnaissance‚Äù tour the night before the riot.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.", "authors": ["Annie Grayer Zachary Cohen Ryan Nobles", "Annie Grayer", "Zachary Cohen", "Ryan Nobles"], "publish_date": "2022/06/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/25/grasshopper-invasion-curls-cancer-wildfire-tourism-news-around-states/117212516/", "title": "Grasshopper invasion, Curls for Cancer, wildfire tourism: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: Kieran Moise‚Äôs afro, at 19 inches long, was a huge part of his personality. But after six years of growth, the 17-year-old bound for the U.S. Air Force Academy knew he and his hair would soon be parted. So in memory of a friend who died from cancer, he cut it off and donated it to the nonprofit Children With Hair Loss, which provides human hair replacements to children and teenagers facing medically related hair loss due to cancer treatments, alopecia and burns. ‚ÄúI knew I wanted to send a message,‚Äù he said. He did ‚Äì and many responded. Moise printed out flyers and spread the word on social media for an event held by the nonprofit at a brewery in Huntsville. There, family, friends, and even some of his elementary and middle school teachers took turns cutting his hair in braids. His story was widely shared online. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see good news and see ‚Ä¶ that people are still doing good things because all it does is inspire others,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really what I want to come out of this: I want other people to (say), ‚ÄòHey, if he‚Äôs doing this, so can I.‚Äô ‚Äù Moise also launched a fundraiser through St. Jude Children‚Äôs Research Hospital, which had helped his late classmate, Josh Quist, who died when they were in middle school. Initially, Moise hoped he could raise $19,000, or $1,000 per inch of hair. ‚ÄúKieran‚Äôs Curls for Cancer‚Äù has exceeded expectations and has already raised nearly $35,000 for St. Jude.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state is trying to dispose of a 58-year-old ferry and even has offered to give it to the government of the Philippines for free. Gov. Mike Dunleavy offered to give the Malaspina ferry away in a letter last month to the Philippines consul general in San Francisco, CoastAlaska reports. ‚ÄúThis vessel is surplus to our fleet, is in need of some repairs, but does have some service life left,‚Äù according to Dunleavy‚Äôs letter dated May 20 and obtained by the Alaska Public Media in a routine public records request for the governor‚Äôs correspondence. ‚ÄúWe would be willing to provide the vessel to the Philippine government or to a private ferry company in the Philippines free of charge,‚Äù the letter says. The Malaspina, built in 1963, last sailed in 2019. Instead of paying at least $16 million in needed steel work, the state put the ferry into cold storage. The state Department of Transportation has estimated it would cost up to $45 million to overhaul the ferry, including installing new engines. The state is paying about $450,000 a year to keep it in storage. Alaska Marine Highway System General Manager John Falvey said there was only tepid interest in buying the ferry, matching the struggles the state experienced in disposing of three other ferries recently. One went to a scrap yard in India, and two others were sold to a Spanish ferry company.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The University of Arizona has been asked to investigate failures involving its animal research programs that led to the deaths of two sheep and caused it to temporarily halt surgical procedures on mice. In a letter to University President Robert Robbins, the animal rights organization Stop Animal Exploitation Now called for the university to look into five incidents involving animal research in 2020 that resulted in a response from the federal government. Michael Budkie, co-founder of Stop Animal Exploitation Now, urged that staff involved in the incidents be banned from future work with animals and that UA officials terminate the projects during which the incidents occurred. Last year the University of Arizona self-reported four incidents that had a negative effect on the health and well-being of animals involved in research to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, part of the National Institutes of Health. In one incident Nov. 1, 2020, the sheep area of the Campus Agricultural Center was broken into and vandalized. Two sheep were injured, and veterinarians at the center determined they needed to be euthanized. UA said it fixed the problem by implementing additional security measures at the site, according to its response to the federal government.\n\nArkansas\n\nCabot: A sheriff‚Äôs deputy shot and killed a 17-year-old boy during a traffic stop early Wednesday, but authorities didn‚Äôt say what led to the fatal shooting. The Lonoke County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said it has turned the investigation of the shooting that occurred about 3 a.m. over to Arkansas State Police. That agency said the circumstances of the traffic stop and what led the deputy to fire his gun at Hunter Brittain after stopping the truck he was driving ‚Äúwill be documented in the investigation.‚Äù The shooting occurred outside an auto repair shop along Arkansas Highway 89 south of Cabot, state police said. The city of about 26,000 people is about 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. State police said Brittain was from McRae, a small town about 15 miles northeast of Cabot. Later Wednesday, the sheriff‚Äôs office identified the deputy as Sgt. Michael Davis, who has been with the sheriff‚Äôs office since 2013. The office said Davis will be on administrative leave pending the outcome of the state police‚Äôs investigation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Dozens of tule elk at Point Reyes National Seashore have died from starvation and dehydration in the past year because the animals couldn‚Äôt get past a fence that the National Park Service placed to stop them from competing for food and water with cattle, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday against the federal government. Three California residents and the Animal Legal Defense Fund sued the park service in federal court in San Francisco, claiming it is being negligent, and more animals will die if the agency is not ordered to provide food and water during the drought. ‚ÄúThe National Park Service has a responsibility to protect and preserve these beautiful animals. The idea that depriving them of food and water somehow fulfills that responsibility isn‚Äôt just absurd; it‚Äôs undeniably inhumane,‚Äù said Kate Barnekow, of Harvard Law School‚Äôs Animal Law & Policy Clinic, who is representing the plaintiffs. Point Reyes National Seashore spokeswoman Melanie Gunn said she couldn‚Äôt comment on pending litigation. Tule elk are a subspecies native to California. The 700-pound animals, hunted to near-extinction in the 1800s, were reintroduced to the park in 1978. According to the lawsuit, 152 elk ‚Äì more than a third of the population ‚Äì have died since last year, and necropsies show the emaciated elk died of starvation and/or dehydration.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: More than 4.5 million visitors journey to Rocky Mountain National Park annually for views of wildlife along the roads, snow-capped peaks and refreshing waterfalls. But this year they will have the opportunity to marvel at the power of the largest wildfire scars in the park‚Äôs 106-year history. Last year‚Äôs East Troublesome and Cameron Peak fires burned about 10% of the park‚Äôs 265,769 acres and 15% of its 350 miles of trails. While the devastation will cost the park nearly $4 million over the next three years in trail renovation, the burn scar should be a destination rather than a deviation for visitors. Much of the burn scar is located in backcountry wilderness areas closed to visitors due to the severity of the fire. But enough of it can be seen from roads and on trails to offer visitors a once-in-a-lifetime view of the fire‚Äôs delicate stroke and insensitive brush. ‚ÄúIn some areas we are seeing aspen shoots and beautiful wildflowers in green meadows and waterfalls we have never seen before,‚Äù said Doug Parker, the park‚Äôs trails supervisor. ‚ÄúIn other parts, mainly on the west side, it‚Äôs completely black.‚Äù Parker said park staff last fall began the arduous task of assessing the damage and rebuilding trails and bridges where they can. Still, he said, park visitors will be shocked at some of the devastation. ‚ÄúVisitors will have a moment to look like a wildland firefighter because when they hike into some of those areas, they will come out with black legs and clothes that are all black and dirty,‚Äù he said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMystic: The Mystic Aquarium plans to auction off the chance to name three of its five recently arrived beluga whales to raise money for their care and to offset the cost of transporting them from Canada. President and CEO Stephen Coan said the Sea Research Foundation has teamed with New York-based auction house Guernsey‚Äôs to hold a fundraising auction Aug. 19 at the aquarium, which it operates. ‚ÄúThe three whales will get what we refer to as stage names, and they would be referred to by those names going forward,‚Äù he said. The Mystic Aquarium hopes to raise $4 million at the auction, which will also include donated art, perhaps a boat or vintage car, and some unique experiences ‚Äì such as educational dive trips with scientists to places such as the undersea Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument in the Atlantic Ocean, Coan said. It will cost the aquarium about $5 million a year to care for the belugas, he said. That includes about $250,000 a year to pay for food and veterinary care for each animal, as well as costs associated with running the habitat and research. The foundation also spent millions of dollars last month transporting the whales from their previous home at Marineland in Niagara Falls, Ontario, using custom-made stretchers and special tanks inside a C-130 cargo plane, Coan said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: House lawmakers on Wednesday approved a spending plan for the fiscal year starting July 1 that adds hundreds of millions of dollars to the budget that Democratic Gov. John Carney proposed in January. House members voted 38-1, with two abstentions, for a $4.77 billion general fund operating budget for fiscal 2022. That is an increase of almost 5% over the current year‚Äôs budget and roughly $65 million more than what Carney had recommended. House members also voted unanimously for a ‚Äúsupplemental‚Äù budget bill of one-time expenditures that brings the increase over the current year‚Äôs $4.5 billion operating budget to more than 10%. With state revenue estimates having skyrocketed since January, lawmakers included more than $221 million in one-time funds for a variety of expenditures next year. The budget bill, which now goes to the Senate, includes $22.7 million for across-the-board pay raises of $500 or 1%, whichever is higher, for state employees. They also approved almost $15.3 million for $500 bonuses to government retirees. Other one-time expenditures include $20 million for state employee health insurance costs and $5 million for a loan program that helps volunteer fire companies upgrade equipment and improve facilities.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A pedestrian bridge collapsed over a highway in the nation‚Äôs capital Wednesday, sending five people to the hospital and snarling traffic. The collapse happened just before noon along Interstate 295 in Northeast Washington. The bridge was found to be in poor condition at an inspection just a few months earlier. Investigators believe a truck struck the bridge, causing it to come loose and collapse, said Chris Geldart, deputy mayor for public safety and justice. Several other vehicles were also involved in the collapse. He cautioned that the investigation was still in its preliminary stages. The five people taken to the hospital had non-life-threatening injuries, Geldart said. Chunks of concrete and other debris were strewn across the highway, and both directions of traffic were expected to be closed at least until late Friday. The bridge was lying atop the truck, which was leaking diesel fuel along the roadway, officials said. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Wednesday afternoon that there were no recent reports of structural concerns about the bridge. But Geldart said in a statement later Wednesday that the mayor was incorrect. He said the bridge was inspected in February, and a subsequent report May 25 rated it in poor condition. He said the rating ‚Äì 4 on a scale of 9 to 0 ‚Äì marked a threshold prompting a multiyear planning process to replace the bridge.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Wildlife officials have removed 250 alligators from Disney properties in the five years since a 2-year-old boy was killed by an alligator at the Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, a newspaper reports. The company has worked with trappers contracted through the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to remove the gators, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Most of the nuisance gators taken from Disney properties are euthanized and sold for their hide and meat, Tammy Sapp, spokeswoman for the wildlife agency, told the newspaper. Some are also transferred to alligator farms, animal exhibits and zoos, she said. Those less than 4 feet long are relocated, she said. Trappers receive $30 for every captured gator, plus the proceeds from any leather and meat sold, the newspaper reports. After Lane Thomas Graves was killed in June 2016, Disney installed a wall and put up reptile warning signs along waterways throughout its resorts. Disney guests said they‚Äôre glad the resort is proactively removing gators from its properties. A biology expert agreed, adding that the removals should have a minimal impact on the Florida alligator population.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTybee Island: More summer visitors are flocking to the state‚Äôs largest public beach, and that means local officials are writing more tickets for violations. Police on Tybee Island in recent months have been reporting high numbers of citations for beach rule violations such as littering, having glass containers on the beach and climbing on sandbars, WTOC-TV reports. City Manager Shawn Gillen said one particular violation has shown a huge increase: people bringing dogs onto the beach, which the city doesn‚Äôt allow. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve written more dog tickets in the last year than we have in the last four years combined,‚Äù Gillen said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of those things where we‚Äôre getting more and more signage to let people know about the rules, and we ask people to go to our website, look at the beach rules and understand them because the code enforcement will be writing a ticket if they see the violation.‚Äù Gillen said it‚Äôs not just more people coming to the beach that‚Äôs driving up citations after the coronavirus pandemic slowed tourism last year. He said the island also has a full staff of code enforcement officers patrolling the beach, which wasn‚Äôt the case during the height of the pandemic.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: As some on Maui become overwhelmed by an influx of visitors, the first in a series of sustainable tourism town halls this week focused on lessons learned at another Pacific tourist hot spot. Orion Cruz, a Maui attorney who worked with the government of Palau on tourism issues, participated in the virtual panel, The Maui News reports. Cruz, a former legal counsel to the Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Tourism of the Republic of Palau, said the Western Pacific island nation encourages environmentally friendly visitors and enacted measures to ensure sustainability funding. There is a $100 ‚ÄúPalau Pristine Paradise Environmental Fee‚Äù added to every international airline ticket, Cruz said. ‚ÄúThis hundred dollars supports the country in a variety of ways, but a substantial portion goes to fund Palau‚Äôs protected areas network, which is kind of like their national park system,‚Äù Cruz said. Tourists also sign the ‚ÄúPalau Pledge‚Äù and agree to act responsibly both environmentally and culturally. The virtual panel was hosted by Kelly King, chairwoman of the Maui County Council‚Äôs Climate Action, Resilience and Environment Committee. ‚ÄúThe community wants action to ensure a future for the visitor industry that protects the people, culture and environment,‚Äù King said in a statement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will continue playing a $4,551-per-month housing stipend to the governor for now, a special legislative committee has decided, but the panel will reconsider the matter later this year. The Governor‚Äôs Housing Committee voted unanimously to keep the stipend in place, the Idaho Press reports. ‚ÄúWe really need to be talking about should we be doing this, should we be doing it at this rate, is it still needed, what are some of the other states doing,‚Äù said Sen. Abby Lee, R-Fruitland. The panel will meet again in November or December to consider possible changes. ‚ÄúDoes it still make sense today? I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù said House Assistant Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian. ‚ÄúI certainly didn‚Äôt have enough information to make a decision other than let‚Äôs maintain where we‚Äôre at.‚Äù Idaho is one of just five states that does not provide an official residence for its governor. Some states have historic governor‚Äôs mansions, and some require their governors to live in those homes. Idaho hasn‚Äôt had an official residence for its governor since the hilltop Simplot mansion, donated to the state by potato magnate J.R. Simplot‚Äôs family in 2004, reverted back to the family in 2013. No Idaho governor ever lived in the mansion. Then-Gov. C.L. ‚ÄúButch‚Äù Otter was J.R. Simplot‚Äôs ex-son-in-law and opted to stay at his ranch in Star rather than moving to the Boise residence. The Simplot family demolished the house in 2016.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The City Council on Wednesday confirmed the appointment of Chicago‚Äôs first Black female fire commissioner. Annette Nance-Holt was serving as acting fire commissioner after the retirement earlier this year of Richard Ford. When she appointed Nance-Holt acting fire commissioner, Mayor Lori Lightfoot noted she had more than three decades of proven leadership and a passion for public service. Nance-Holt, who joined the department four years after the first women joined the ranks, will take over an agency with a history of racism and sexism. Earlier this year, Chicago‚Äôs inspector general issued a report recommending the department put in place stronger policies to deal with the sexual harassment and racial discrimination. Last month, Nance-Holt welcomed 42 new members to the department, including 13 women and 15 from minority communities. It was during that ceremony that Lightfoot nominated her for the top post. ‚ÄúGraduates, look to Commissioner Nance-Holt‚Äôs exemplary example of sacrifice and service, even in the face of her own personal pain and tragedy,‚Äù Lightfoot said. ‚ÄúShe is the real deal.‚Äù Nance-Holt first gained public notice when her 16-year-old son, Blair Holt, was shot to death in 2007 on a city bus shielding a classmate from gunfire. She went on to establish the nonprofit Purpose Over Pain, which helps parents who have lost children to gun violence.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: In just a week, teenage workers will no longer have to obtain work permits from schools, expediting hiring at a time when the service industry is desperate for workers. ‚ÄúNow we can interview, make the decision to hire, and they can technically start working that day,‚Äù said Matt Eckert, the president of Holiday World, a theme park in southern Indiana where many of the employees are teenagers. The requirement for teenagers to get a work permit from a school has been frustrating for the theme park, not only because it delayed hiring but also because students from Kentucky had to find a school in Indiana to provide that permit, he said. The change in state law will be a help to businesses that rely on younger workers but won‚Äôt do much to improve enforcement of labor laws for underage workers, some labor experts say. The elimination of such work permits was part of a wide-ranging bill targeting teenage employment that passed in 2020 with bipartisan support. The bill also increased the number of hours 16- and 17-year-olds could work from 30 to 40 during school weeks and up to 48 hours during non-school weeks. It also eliminated a requirement for breaks. While most of the changes took effect last year, the elimination of the work permit was delayed until this July.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A blaze that badly damaged a former City Hall building and destroyed a makeshift memorial to Black children was being investigated as ‚Äúsuspicious,‚Äù according to fire officials. The fire early Wednesday destroyed a memorial created last summer by the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement to honor Black Iowa youth who have died in recent years. Lt. Rick Thomas of the Des Moines Fire Department said the fire was still under investigation, and its cause had not yet been determined, but investigators believe the cause is ‚Äúsuspicious.‚Äù Investigators were reviewing video of the fire, reported about 5 a.m. Wednesday. The memorial was at the entrance to the 132-year-old former North Des Moines City Hall, which has been unoccupied for many years. North Des Moines was once its own city but now is part of Des Moines. The memorial, embellished with flowers, candles, signs and other items, has been a site for vigils and marches. About 100 people marched from a park to the memorial June 12 to honor Black and transgender women and children killed in the state and across the country. A statement from the Des Moines Black Liberation Movement said the organization is heartbroken and believes the fire may have been set intentionally.\n\nKansas\n\nGoddard: Health officials have identified the bacteria that caused a outbreak of illnesses at a splash park near Wichita. State and Sedgwick County health investigators said Wednesday that the Shigella bacteria caused a diarrheal illness in at least three infected people who visited Tanganyika Wildlife Park. Those people were the three original cases linked to the park, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and Sedgwick County Health Department said in a news release. Several other visitors to the park have reported becoming ill. The Shigella bacteria is spread from person to person through exposure to contaminated feces, the public health agencies said. That can occur through swallowing contaminated water, touching contaminated items and then touching one‚Äôs mouth, or cleaning up after someone using the bathroom or changing diapers. An investigation began Friday when several people reported becoming ill after visiting the park. More than 200 people have responded to a survey designed to identify Tanganyika visitors with symptoms of fever, diarrhea or vomiting. It is not yet clear how many of the respondents may be connected to the outbreak at Tanganyika‚Äôs Splash Park, The Wichita Eagle reports.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Overhauling the state‚Äôs outdated technology for processing jobless claims could take up to three years, Kentucky‚Äôs labor secretary said Tuesday as lawmakers delved into problems with the pandemic-stressed unemployment insurance system. The state is in the ‚Äúlatter stages‚Äù of selecting a contractor to take on the task of ‚Äúreworking and rebuilding‚Äù the claims-processing system, Labor Secretary Larry Roberts said. ‚ÄúIf we can modernize our system, that‚Äôs going to make a big difference,‚Äù he told the legislative task force that began reviewing problems with the unemployment system. In the meantime, Kentucky labor officials are looking for ways to make more immediate improvements, he said, because of the longer timeline needed to replace the system‚Äôs antiquated computer system, which is expected to cost roughly $40 million. ‚ÄúIt may take two to three years to make that an outcome,‚Äù Roberts said. Like other states, Kentucky was overwhelmed by record waves of claims for jobless assistance caused by the pandemic. Tens of thousands of Kentuckians found themselves in limbo for months as they waited for claims to be processed. Even with most coronavirus restrictions now lifted, lawmakers continue to forward complaints from constituents awaiting jobless aid. Some date back to last spring.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAlexandria: After being missing for 60 years, the gravesite of former Gov. Joseph Walker has been found in Rapides Parish. Walker was the 13th governor of Louisiana, serving from 1850 to 1853. Local historians found the gravesite off Bayou Rapides Road in the city of Alexandria, in central Louisiana, after searching for the landmark since the 1950s, KALB-TV reports. They are hoping a historical marker will be placed at the site. ‚ÄúThe fact that the graveyard had been missing for so long is because the tombstone or the markers that we know from that time period are not where they used to be,‚Äù said Benjamin Fuselier, a metal detectorist. When Walker died in 1856, he was buried in a family graveyard located on his property in Rapides Parish. In 1864, his former home burned to the ground. A century later, nobody could find the grave. ‚ÄúSomething happened around 1960 in which the graveyard was plowed under to use for cultivation of plants. It is a great loss to our state‚Äôs history,‚Äù said local historian Michael Wynne. Historians said aerial maps, artifacts and witness statements helped pinpoint the location of Walker‚Äôs burial site several weeks ago.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The number of people who died from drug overdoses in the state rose to an all-time high last year, surpassing 500 for the first time in the midst of the pandemic, officials said Wednesday. The 504 deaths in 2020 represented a 33% increase over the previous year and easily surpassed the state‚Äôs previous high of 418 overdose deaths in 2017, according to the annual report. Gov. Janet Mills said the jump in deaths represents ‚Äúyet another example‚Äù of how the coronavirus pandemic hurt the state. ‚ÄúMy heart breaks for every single life lost to a drug overdose. Those we lost are friends, loved ones and community members ‚Äì people with meaningful lives,‚Äù Mills said in a statement. While officials blamed the pandemic for the spike in deaths, the exact correlation was unclear, wrote Marcella Sorg, the report‚Äôs author at the University of Maine‚Äôs Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center. An estimated 91% of the deaths were accidental overdoses, the number of suicides remained flat, and only one of the victims with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 actually tested positive for the virus, the report said. ‚ÄúWe are doing more research to explore whether characteristics of the pandemic, such as isolation, access to medical services‚Äù or other factors, contributed to the spike in deaths, she wrote.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Carryout alcohol service will come to an end in this beach resort town just as the Eastern Shore gets ready to celebrate Independence Day, according to officials in Worcester County. And one county over in Wicomico, officials are meeting next week to consider the continuation of carryout alcohol. Gov. Larry Hogan initially allowed establishments to sell carryout alcohol under specific rules to aid struggling restaurants and bars during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hogan used his state of emergency declaration to circumvent county liquor boards. The service became very popular. During the 2021 legislative session, the Maryland General Assembly approved the permanent sale of carryout alcohol, but the new law requires that individual counties opt in. In Worcester County, officials announced Tuesday that carryout alcohol service would be discontinued once Maryland‚Äôs state of emergency is lifted July 1. The Wicomico Board of License Commissioners is set to hold a public hearing on carryout cocktails at 1 p.m. Tuesday. The body will open the floor to discuss formally opting in to takeout and delivery, as well as outline drafted regulations for such permitting.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmherst: The town has approved creating a fund to pay reparations to Black residents. The Amherst Town Council on Monday voted 12-1 in favor of setting up the fund and requiring a two-thirds vote of the council to authorize any spending from it, The Daily Hampshire Gazette reports. Town Manager Paul Bockelman said establishing the fund means the town can now begin accepting contributions for the effort and decide on a plan to finance reparations work going forward. The council is weighing a proposal to designate more than $200,000 in surplus budget funds as an initial seed investment. The council on Monday also approved creating the African Heritage Reparations Assembly, to develop the town‚Äôs reparations plan by Oct. 31, the newspaper reports. It will be made up of six Black residents and one representative from Reparations for Amherst, a local advocacy group. Councilor Mandi Jo Hanneke voted against the fund because she said it was premature to establish it before forming the assembly. Michele Miller, the cofounder of Reparations for Amherst, said Thursday that her group hopes to establish a private fund to bolster the town‚Äôs efforts. ‚ÄúWe look forward to supporting the African Heritage Community to implement a robust and sustainable reparative plan,‚Äù she said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A bipartisan group of lawmakers announced a package of bills Wednesday to curb opioid overdose deaths in the state, which experts say spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic. The announcement came during a media conference to mandate supportive practices in hospitals and increase access to life-saving medications. Before the pandemic, the state had seen some success in reducing the number of opioid-related deaths, even making it a goal to cut the number of deaths in half by 2024. In 2019, opioid-related overdose deaths decreased by 13.2% from 2018, according to the state. However, from January to June of 2020, opioid-related overdose deaths increased by 20% from the same months in 2019, jumping from 874 to 1,045 deaths. An average of five Michiganders a day died from an opioid overdose in 2019, said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Michigan‚Äôs chief medical officer. ‚ÄúUnfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic means we‚Äôve had to fight two crises at the same time, and early data, unfortunately, suggests that we actually saw an increase in overdoses in 2020,‚Äù Khaldun said. ‚ÄúThese deaths are absolutely tragic, but they are preventable as well.‚Äù One bill in the package expands access to Naloxone, a drug used to reverse an opioid overdose, for community organizations.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A new report shows a growing number of law enforcement agencies are using drones to help with search and rescue efforts, investigations and public safety. The legislative report says 93 agencies statewide either maintained or used a drone in 2020, with 1,171 flights recorded. The report is the result of new regulations lawmakers passed last year. The bipartisan law prevents an agency from deploying a drone with facial recognition technology unless authorized by a warrant or in exceptional circumstances including an emergency situation that involves the risk of death or bodily harm to a person, KSTP-TV reports. Each time a law enforcement agency uses a drone for one of those purposes, it must be documented and submitted to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which compiles the annual report for the Legislature. The law also prohibits law enforcement agencies from equipping drones with weapons and limits how long drone video can be retained. The aerial equipment gives Cottage Grove police an advantage from above when every moment matters, said Sgt. Michael McCormick. ‚ÄúThe whole initial idea of it was to save lives,‚Äù McCormick said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got parks and water everywhere, so really the idea was to have an extra set of eyes above to assist with officers.‚Äù\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: A new training facility for people who want to learn coding is coming to the Gulf Coast. The University of Southern Mississippi‚Äôs School of Computing Sciences and Computer Engineering and Mississippi Coding Academies are opening a Biloxi location, according to a press release. Applications are open for the new Biloxi Cyber Center, scheduled to launch in early August. Mississippi Coding Academies offer tuition-free 11-month courses. The program was founded in 2017 as a joint project between Innovate Mississippi and the Mississippi Development Authority, a state agency tasked with recruiting new businesses and promoting economic growth. The program‚Äôs goal is to offer a nontraditional path to getting into the software field and to offer economic mobility for residents, particularly those from disadvantaged and underserved communities. ‚ÄúMost participants come from under-served families and are either not college bound or found that college did not provide the desired economic independence,‚Äù the program‚Äôs website says. ‚ÄúMost only have a high school education and are typically earning part time minimum wages.‚Äù The program has three other training locations, in downtown Jackson, Starkville and south Jackson.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A judge ruled Wednesday that a ballot measure to expand Medicaid in the state is unconstitutional, meaning hundreds of thousands of newly eligible low-income adults won‚Äôt be able to access the health insurance program July 1 as promised. Cole County Circuit Court Judge Jon Beetem wrote that the voter-approved amendment unconstitutionally sought to force lawmakers to set aside money for the expansion. Under the Missouri Constitution, lawmakers can‚Äôt be forced to make appropriations unless the ballot measure includes a funding mechanism. Beetem wrote that the amendment ‚Äúindirectly requires the appropriation of revenues not created by the initiative and is therefore unconstitutional.‚Äù Voters approved Medicaid expansion last August, passing a constitutional amendment by 53% of the vote. It was set to take effect July 1. But Republican Gov. Mike Parson declined to provide coverage for an estimated 275,000 newly eligible low-income adults after the GOP-led Legislature refused to provide any extra funding to do so in the state budget. Three low-income women, including two mothers, sued the state to try to force Parson‚Äôs administration to give them the health insurance coverage. The plaintiff‚Äôs lawyers said they will appeal Beetem‚Äôs decision.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A punishing drought in the West is drying up waterways, sparking wildfires and leaving farmers scrambling for water. Next up: a plague of voracious grasshoppers. Federal agriculture officials are launching what could become their largest grasshopper-killing campaign since the 1980s amid an outbreak of the drought-loving insects that cattle ranchers fear will strip bare public and private rangelands. In central Montana‚Äôs Phillips County, more than 50 miles from the nearest town, Frank Wiederrick said large numbers of grasshoppers started showing up on prairie surrounding his ranch in recent days. Already they‚Äôre beginning to denude trees around his house. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre everywhere,‚Äù Wiederrick said. ‚ÄúDrought and grasshoppers go together, and they are cleaning us out.‚Äù Grasshoppers thrive in warm, dry weather, and populations already were up last year, setting the stage for an even bigger outbreak in 2021. Such outbreaks could become more common as climate change shifts rainfall patterns, scientists said. To blunt the insects‚Äô economic damage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture this week began aerial spraying of the pesticide diflubenzuron to kill grasshopper nymphs before they develop into adults. Approximately 3,000 square miles in Montana are expected to be sprayed, roughly twice the size of Rhode Island.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Federal regulators have ordered a rancher and Cherry County officials to clean up a remote stream after it was deluged with enough sand and sediment to change the shape of the waterway. The Environmental Protection Agency said the Snake River had been a deep and narrow creek until an estimated 1.6 million tons of sand washed into it, turning a 3-mile stretch into a wide, shallow and sandy waterway, according to the Omaha World-Herald. That‚Äôs enough sand to fill an area the size of a football field about 540 feet deep. The stream is a popular fishing and canoeing spot in the Sandhills, a desolate region of grass-covered sand dunes in north-central Nebraska. The sand and sediment flowed into the Snake River after a 2.5-mile ditch was excavated to the river to drain water from a flooded pasture and road. Federal officials said the sand was deposited into the stream without proper permits. Under the federal Clean Water Act, the sand and sediment are considered pollutants. On June 14, the EPA ordered rancher Dick Minor of Gordon, Nebraska, and Cherry County officials to stop the erosion and create a plan within 60 days to permanently stop the flow of sediment into the stream. Minor and the county were also ordered to restore the stream‚Äôs deep channel ‚Äúto the extent technically feasible.‚Äù\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The state has agreed to pay $175,000 in legal fees to settle a lawsuit with a rural church over COVID-19 capacity caps on religious gatherings that a U.S. appeals court found illegal in December. But while no COVID-19 restrictions have been in place since June 1, a second church is continuing to press for a federal court order declaring Gov. Steve Sisolak‚Äôs earlier limits unconstitutional. Lawyers for Calvary Chapel Lone Mountain in Las Vegas filed a motion in U.S. District Court on June 11 seeking permission to amend its complaint against Sisolak, Attorney General Aaron Ford and Justin Luna, chief of the Nevada Division of Emergency Management. They said a formal ruling is necessary to prevent the state from enacting similar illegal orders in the future and to force compensation for the harm suffered by the church‚Äôs parishioners and other businesses deemed nonessential under the governor‚Äôs emergency directives. ‚ÄúUnless and until injunctive relief is granted, plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable harm for which they are left without an adequate remedy at law‚Äù and ‚Äúbe fearful of exercising their right to peacefully pray, assemble, engage in business and to be treated for COVID-19,‚Äù the motion says. Last year, indoor religious gatherings in Nevada were subject to a hard cap of 50 churchgoers, while attendance limits at many businesses, including casinos, were based on a percentage of the buildings‚Äô fire-code capacities.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth College has relaxed many of its COVID-19 rules, including no longer requiring people who are fully vaccinated to wear masks and lifting physical distancing and dining restrictions. Provost Joseph Helble said Wednesday that Dartmouth was easing protocols in light of the fact that 83% of the students who will be on campus this summer have already been vaccinated, the Valley News reports. The college announced in April that all students will be required to be vaccinated ahead of the fall term. Dartmouth also is requiring employees to be vaccinated by Sept. 1. Employees can request religious and medical exemptions, but those who remain unvaccinated will be subject to wearing personal protective equipment, maintaining physical distancing and being tested more frequently for the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTeaneck: With flag twirlers, a gospel choir and seemingly endless proclamations from local officials, Teaneck and Englewood named streets after the Isley Brothers in the towns where the musicians lived in their heyday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a ‚Äòwow‚Äô moment,‚Äù Ernie Isley said. ‚ÄúThis is a spectacular culmination of a lot of dreams and a lot of prayers.‚Äù The suburbs a few miles across the Hudson River from New York City held dual ceremonies Thursday to honor the legendary group that scored hits with songs including ‚ÄúShout,‚Äù ‚ÄúTwist and Shout,‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Your Thing,‚Äù ‚ÄúThat Lady‚Äù and ‚ÄúFight the Power.‚Äù Ron Isley lived in Teaneck and Ernie in neighboring Englewood during the 1960s. Another brother, Rudolph, lived in Irvington, about 12 miles south of Teaneck. The brothers helped put Teaneck on the map when they launched the T-Neck record label, known to generations of music fans for the distinctive orange dust jacket on its 45 rpm records. A local music fan, Teaneck resident Ira Buckman, hit upon the idea of renaming part of Van Arsdale Street as Isley Brothers Way two years ago, inspired by watching a rerun of the movie ‚ÄúAnimal House,‚Äù which iconically features ‚ÄúShout.‚Äù The town‚Äôs council approved it and, after a delay due to the coronavirus pandemic, unveiled the new sign Thursday on Isley Brothers Day. Former bandmates and neighbors reminisced about befriending the brothers in the ‚Äô60s and ‚Äô70s. Neighbors recalled swimming in Ron Isley‚Äôs family‚Äôs backyard pool all summer long and never being turned away, or hearing the group‚Äôs new songs before they were released to the general public.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Many communities are behind the curve when it comes to investing in drinking water infrastructure as persistent drought threatens supplies, and the state‚Äôs fragmented funding process makes it hard to know what taxpayers are getting for their money, legislative analysts said Wednesday. New Mexico provided roughly $876 million for water projects over a five-year period. But the analysts told members of the powerful Legislative Finance Committee during a meeting that communities aren‚Äôt doing enough to leverage federal and local dollars. A review of the state‚Äôs numerous financing mechanisms for water projects found that New Mexico over the past decade made proportionally more grant and loan funding available for water projects than any other state in the U.S. But inconsistent vetting and piecemeal funding put projects at greater risk of being delayed or derailed, according to the review. About one-third of the state-funded local water projects that were examined did not meet their intended purpose ‚Äì even several years after the initial funding was issued. In the village of Maxwell, for example, $1 million was spent to drill and equip a new drinking water well that could be used in times of drought. A $30,000 shortfall resulted in the well not being hooked up to electricity, leaving the project unfinished and unable to yield any public benefits. Similar issues were found with projects in Lovington and Pecos.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The New-York Historical Society is creating a new archive that will focus on ‚Äúmarginalized communities and inclusive voices‚Äù in the city over the past quarter-century. The Diamonstein-Spielvogel Institute for New York City History, Politics, and Community Activism will chronicle ‚Äúimportant political, social, and cultural moments from the mid-1900s to the present,‚Äù the historical society announced Thursday. ‚ÄúWe are so grateful for the initiative and support of the Diamonstein-Spielvogel Foundation for this new endeavor, which will help scholars and the general public to understand how political and social movements, focused on balancing individuals‚Äô right to self-determination with their responsibility to one another, have shaped our city‚Äôs history,‚Äù Dr. Louise Mirrer, the society‚Äôs president and CEO, said in a statement. Initial contributions to the archive will include documents on the building of the High Line in Manhattan. The archive also will include materials already available at the society, including those on Occupy Wall Street. Dr. Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel, the foundation‚Äôs chair and a former commissioner of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission and former chair of the New York State Council on the Arts, is contributing her own papers to the archive.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state would end offering supplemental benefits from the federal government to the unemployed in roughly a month under legislation finalized Wednesday by Republicans in charge of the General Assembly. But House and Senate Democrats voted almost unanimously against the compromise hammered out by GOP leaders from both chambers, signaling a possible veto by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. The legislation would do away with the $300-a-week Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation benefit for at least 200,000 displaced workers in the state. A $100-a-week additional payment for self-employed workers also would end. Both coronavirus aid programs already are set to expire nationwide in September, but Republicans have agreed with business owners‚Äô concerns that the extra benefits are a disincentive for some to return to the workforce after being months at home. Twenty-six states, all but one with Republican governors, have already decided to withdraw early from the program, according to the National Employment Law Project. By ending the $300 weekly supplement benefit, the final legislation sides with what the House approved earlier this month.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A longtime animal doctor from Hettinger has been named the new state veterinarian and animal health division director, Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring announced Wednesday. Dr. Ethan Andress will take over for Dr. Susan Keller, who is retiring after serving the state for 23 years. Andress will start July 12. Andress is owner and partner of West River Veterinary Clinic in Hettinger, where he has worked as a mixed animal practitioner for 24 years. He graduated from South Dakota State University in 1994 with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in biology. He earned his doctor of veterinary medicine degree from Iowa State University in 1997. ‚ÄúDr. Andress brings valuable experience in the field of veterinary medicine and extensive knowledge of bovine, equine and bison medicine,‚Äù Goehring said. ‚ÄúHis business background will also be an asset to our animal health programs and the state.‚Äù\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state that launched the national movement to offer millions of dollars in incentives to boost COVID-19 immunization rates concluded its program Wednesday, still unable to crack the 50% vaccination threshold. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine‚Äôs May 12 announcement of the incentive program had the desired effect off the bat, leading to a 43% boost in state vaccination numbers over the previous week. But numbers of shots administered have dropped since then. ‚ÄúClearly the impact went down after that second week,‚Äù DeWine acknowledged Wednesday. About 5.5 million residents had received at least one shot of a vaccine as of Wednesday, or about 47% of the population. About 5 million people, or 43% of the population, have completed the process. While the incentive‚Äôs success was short-lived, it got Ohioans who either were straddling the line or had no plans to get a shot to make a move, the governor said. As evidence, Jonathan Carlyle of Toledo, an Amazon delivery driver who won the second $1 million prize June 2, said the next day: ‚ÄúWhen y‚Äôall announced the Vax-a-Million, as soon as I heard that, I was like ‚ÄòYes, I need to go do this now.‚Äô ‚Äù DeWine continues to urge Ohioans to get vaccines, saying the end of state social distancing requirements, the return to in-person school classes in the fall, and the multiplying of coronavirus variants remain concerns.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Efforts to build a new food distribution warehouse on the property of Ebenezer Baptist Church experienced an unexpected obstacle related to a hot-button, widely misunderstood topic: critical race theory. The Rev. Derrick Scobey said a professional land surveyor entered into a contract with the church but refused to honor it because he disagreed with the preacher‚Äôs views on critical race theory. Scobey, who is African American, said Bob Manley, with The Manley Co., agreed to provide land surveying services for the warehouse project, with work to be completed no later than June 14. The minister said staff from Manley‚Äôs company came out to the church and did some work, and all the company had left to do was submit the necessary drawings to the church. However, Scobey said Manley, who is white, contacted him to say that he had no plans to finish his part of the project. Scobey said when he asked why, Manley said it was because Scobey was among a group of Black ministers who met with Gov. Kevin Stitt to urge him to veto a measure effectively banning critical race theory from Oklahoma classrooms, a few days before Stitt ultimately signed the measure into law last month. Attempts to reach Manley for comment were unsuccessful.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state‚Äôs aviation authority tried to circumnavigate Oregon‚Äôs land-use system in adopting a plan to extend the runway at Aurora State Airport, the state‚Äôs Court of Appeals determined. The Land Use Board of Appeals‚Äô decision to uphold the aviation board‚Äôs plan was flawed because ‚Äúthere is no evidence in the record to support LUBA‚Äôs erroneous findings‚Äù in the case, the court said in reversing and remanding the body‚Äôs decision. The court said the Land Use Board of Appeals ‚Äúmisunderstood its task‚Äù and mistakenly relied on testimony from Department of Aviation staff and associated businesses around the airport when making its decision. The airport, located just outside the Aurora city limits, is the third-busiest in Oregon and one of 28 the state owns. For years, the state and associated businesses advocated to extend the runway to 6,004 feet from its current 5,004 feet, arguing it wouldn‚Äôt be used for allowing bigger aircraft but would allow the planes that currently use it to fly out with larger fuel loads.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Lawmakers made a final vote Thursday to approve a bill to let parents decide whether to have their children repeat a year of school, a measure designed to help children catch up after a year of schooling disrupted by the pandemic. The Senate voted 50-0 for the proposal, which also would permit students in special education to return for another year, even if they have reached the maximum age of 21. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has not taken a stand on the bill, though his office said Thursday that there are concerns about how it might affect schools‚Äô finances, staffing and programming. ‚ÄúWe will review the bill when it gets to the desk,‚Äù said Wolf press secretary Lyndsay Kensinger. Under the bill, parents would have to decide by July 15 whether their child should repeat a grade. Students could participate in extracurricular activities but would not get another year of eligibility to play sports if they have already maxed out. Students who have reached age 18 would be able to make their own decision about whether to repeat a year. ‚ÄúSome students have struggled, and it makes sense to give parents a stronger say in whether their child should advance to the next grade level or repeat a grade to make up for learning loss,‚Äù said the sponsor, Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, R-Centre.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Years of ‚Äúnoes‚Äù have culminated in the Legislature saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù to a proposal that would remove lawmakers‚Äô authority over approving who has permission to officiate marriages. Lawmakers gave final approval Tuesday to a proposal that would end the General Assembly‚Äôs role in deciding who gets to officiate a wedding in Rhode Island. The bill awaits the signature of Gov. Dan McKee, who has said he supports it. Currently, people who are not either a member of clergy or a judge need special permission from the Legislature before they can perform a wedding in the state. But that can be a time-consuming and confusing process, said those who supported the change. ‚ÄúIt is an inconvenience to the people of Rhode Island that they need to seek a formal act of law just because they want a friend or family member to officiate at their wedding,‚Äù Senate Majority Leader Michael McCaffrey, who introduced the bill in the Senate, said in a statement. There have been multiple attempts in recent years to amend the law. Supporters of the bill also argued that the current law allowed opponents of gay marriage to deny marriage bills for LGBTQ couples.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nWest Columbia: Gov. Henry McMaster again said the state is recovering better from the COVID-19 pandemic than just about any other as he held a ceremonial signing Thursday of a bill preventing people from suing companies over the coronavirus. The new law protects businesses and other groups as long as they follow guidelines to protect people from the virus. Dozens of other states have passed similar measures. McMaster headed less than 2 miles across the river from his Statehouse office to Cafe Strudel, whose owner praised him and the Legislature for taking steps to reduce his risk from reopening after the worst of the pandemic. The governor again said his decision to resist closing restaurants and other businesses and allow them to reopen more quickly meant South Carolina suffered fewer economic problems. ‚ÄúAs a result a lot of other states are struggling to get out of the holes they were in. We‚Äôre ready to blast off,‚Äù McMaster said Thursday before signing the bill that he initially signed April 28. COVID-19 has killed more than 9,800 people in South Carolina since March 2020. Only about 37% of the population has been fully vaccinated against the disease. After the bill signing, McMaster said he wasn‚Äôt worried about the low vaccine rates or new coronavirus variants. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre always on alert,‚Äù the governor said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Shipping delays from China and record-breaking sales from last year are having an impact on fireworks supplies this Fourth of July, according to industry experts. Douglas Bellinger, owner of Extreme Fireworks in Rapid City, said a shortage is limiting the amount of products he can sell this year. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite a shortage on the 24-shot artillery shells and a lot of our littler stuff that we sell,‚Äù he told the Rapid City Journal. According to Bellinger, fireworks supplies from China normally take 30 days for shipping, but this year it‚Äôs taking 60 days. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also trouble when they hit the docks and yards in California; getting a truck here is taking longer, too,‚Äù he said. The fireworks industry was not immune to the coronavirus pandemic that caused closures and staffing problems in the supply chain. ‚ÄúFor example, we ordered seven containers and only got two of them, so we are five short,‚Äù Bellinger said. ‚ÄúEach container holds 800 to 1,000 cases, so the supply issues are impacting how much we have to sell.‚Äù And Bellinger said fireworks have been in high demand since last year when more people celebrated Independence Day at home. ‚ÄúLast year was a great year. They were wanting to get out and were tired of being cooped up,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt ran the supplies short here and emptied a lot of the warehouses.‚Äù\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Residents can now search the full records of many state Supreme Court cases through an online database thanks to the Tennessee State Library and Archives. The opinions have long been available electronically, but the associated case files were stored in more than 10,000 boxes in the attic of the Capitol building, according to a news release from the Administrative Office of the Courts. For more than a decade, Library and Archive staff has been cleaning and indexing these records. Today, about 85% of the collection is available online. Court of Appeals Judge Andy Bennett, through his leadership role in the Tennessee Supreme Court Historical Society, helped make the project happen. ‚ÄúYou can open up a book and find the opinion, but you don‚Äôt have the briefs. You don‚Äôt see the arguments. You don‚Äôt have the depositions,‚Äù Bennett said. ‚ÄúIf you really want to go behind the opinion, these documents are great.‚Äù\n\nTexas\n\nMcKinney: A grand jury has declined to indict eight jailers over the in-custody death of a Black man after struggling with detention officers. But the Collin County grand jury also issued a rare statement Tuesday calling for the creation of a work group to study the March death of Marvin Scott III to prevent something similar from happening again. ‚ÄúWe sincerely hope that the loss of Marvin Scott III will not be in vain,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúWe are therefore recommending that a work group be convened as soon as practicable to study the events of March 14th for lessons learned in an effort to avoid any similar future tragedy.‚Äù The grand jury found no probable cause to charge the eight jailers with a crime in connection with Scott‚Äôs death, which was ruled a homicide in April. A medical examiner found that Scott died of ‚Äúfatal acute stress response‚Äù while struggling with officers who were trying to detain him. The medical examiner said Scott was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia, and his family has said Scott was likely in a mental health crisis at the time. Scott was arrested March 14 at an outlet mall in Allen on a charge of possessing less than 2 ounces of marijuana, authorities have said. Allen officers took Scott to a hospital because he was reportedly acting erratically. He was released, and police took him to the county jail, where he was placed on a restraint bed, authorities have said. Deputies used pepper spray and covered Scott‚Äôs face with a spit mask, which authorities have said fit over his head. Scott became unresponsive at some point and later was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The city has issued a fireworks ban as drought conditions worsen throughout the state. Mayor Erin Mendenhall said Tuesday that the ban covers fireworks including smoke bombs and sparklers. Mendenhall also issued an open burning ban that prohibits people from starting any fires outside. Utah is experiencing its worst drought in decades. About 90% of the state is in extreme or exceptional drought, the two worst categories. ‚ÄúOur foothills, our open spaces, and even our yards and park strips are dry and could be ignited by a single spark,‚Äù Mendenhall, a Democrat, said in a statement. ‚ÄúThese conditions present a very real, immediate threat of fire.‚Äù Fireworks are banned on all state and unincorporated business lands, but Republican Gov. Spencer Cox has said he does not have the legal authority to enact a statewide ban. It is unclear if state law allows cities to outright ban fireworks, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Public safety code prevents local governments from prohibiting explosives around July‚Äôs Independence Day and Pioneer Day holidays, except ‚Äúin certain areas with hazardous environmental conditions.‚Äù Republican legislative leaders have avoided taking action to ban fireworks statewide and instead have encouraged local governments to implement their own restrictions.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: The Norman Rockwell Museum of Vermont is planning to close its doors at the end of the year, almost half a century after its opening. The museum recently reopened after being closed for months because of the pandemic. Business has been slow amid the decline in tourism and travel during the past year, the Rutland Herald reports. Co-owner Colleen Schreiber said the museum is trying to sell its retail stock, but there is no definitive closing date for now. Schreiber also cited personal health concerns as a reason for closing the museum. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in our 80s,‚Äù Schreiber said. ‚ÄúWe have our health issues and nobody to turn it over to.‚Äù Currently, the museum owners are trying to find a new home for the art collection in Vermont before the official closing, which Schreiber said will be before the fall. She said the museum had been open for more than 40 years and housed 2,000 of Rockwell‚Äôs commercial art works. ‚ÄúIt would appear at this time there‚Äôs not a market for (the museum), which is a shame because the Norman Rockwell legacy is a Vermont signature,‚Äù said Lyle Jepson, executive director of the Chamber & Economic Development for the Rutland Region.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Three entities have already expressed interest in acquiring two statues of Confederate generals from downtown parks, including one that was the focus of a violent white nationalist rally in 2017, according to city officials. Earlier this month, the City Council voted unanimously to remove the statues of Robert E. Lee and Thomas ‚ÄúStonewall‚Äù Jackson. Virginia requires a 30-day window for the city to offer the statues to any museum, historical society, government or military battlefield. Officials say three entities have submitted statements of interest so far, according to The Daily Progress. City Manager Chip Boyles said at Monday‚Äôs council meeting that two of the interested entities are in state and one out of state. The offer expires July 7. Downtown business owner Cali Gaston urged the council to remove the statues as quickly as possible and place them in storage until arrangements can be made. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt give them to just any organization offering to pay. They need to be in the hands of an organization that is trusted to speak for the whole community,‚Äù Gaston said. ‚ÄúOne that will help shift the narrative to one that is inclusive and anti-racist.‚Äù White supremacist and neo-Nazi organizers of the August 2017 ‚ÄúUnite the Right‚Äù rally said they went to the city to defend the statue of Lee. They clashed with counterprotesters before a white supremacist plowed his car into a crowd of people, killing a woman.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A local lawmaker wants to condemn a city-owned park with a large homeless encampment next to a courthouse and declare the area a public safety hazard or nuisance property. Under the proposal by King County Councilman Reagan Dunn, the county would acquire the park from the city of Seattle and request that Executive Dow Constantine relocate the park‚Äôs dozens of residents to transitional or permanent housing, provide additional security, and fix damage to the park, The Seattle Times reports. The proposal came after the fatal stabbing June 17 of a 31-year-old man in the park. Seattle police Sgt. Randy Huserik, a spokesperson for the department, said police responded to 100 calls of service at City Hall Park between April 13 and June 20, including assaults, robberies, warrant arrests and public disturbances. ‚ÄúThe city of Seattle has no one to blame except for themselves for failing to abate the nuisance and keep that area safe,‚Äù Dunn said. ‚ÄúPeople have the right to a safe county courthouse, and we shouldn‚Äôt have to fight this hard for it.‚Äù The adjacent King County Courthouse belongs to the county, and taking over City Hall Park would allow it to be policed by the King County Sheriff‚Äôs Office instead of the Seattle Police Department, he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The University of Charleston and Bethany College both say COVID-19 vaccinations will be required for the upcoming academic year at the private schools. University of Charleston President Marty Roth told news outlets that it is the school‚Äôs responsibility to provide a healthy environment for the 1,500 students expected at the Charleston campus and 200 at the Beckley campus. The way to do that is to require students to be inoculated, he said. Students at the university won‚Äôt have to wear masks, but 3 feet of social distancing will be required in classrooms and public spaces, Roth said. Bethany College‚Äôs vaccination requirement was decided by the college‚Äôs Pandemic Response Team in accordance with Centers for Disease Control guidance, the school said. ‚ÄúI applaud our community for its commitment to protecting one another, and I believe strongly that our decision to require the vaccine will maximize the Bethany experience even more,‚Äù Bethany President Tamara Nichols Rodenberg said in an email announcing the update.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state‚Äôs tourism and entertainment businesses, hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, are getting some financial help to recover. Gov. Tony Evers said Thursday that more than $140 million in federal grant money will be available for the lodging industry, movie theaters, live event venues, minor league sports, and other entertainment and tourism businesses. The grants from the federal economic stimulus bill passed by Congress earlier this year will be administered by the Wisconsin Department of Administration and Department of Revenue. ‚ÄúLast year, local venues kept their doors closed to help protect their communities,‚Äù DOA Secretary Joel Brennan said. ‚ÄúNow that nearly half of all Wisconsinites have received at least one dose of the vaccine, life is returning to normal. Minor league ball games are welcoming back families, theaters are reopening, and concert venues are booking new shows. These investments will ensure our communities bounce back stronger than before.‚Äù The lodging industry will receive $75 million in funding, with $12 million reserved for small businesses that host live events and about $11 million for movie theaters.\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: The risk of wildfires is growing with more warm, dry weather in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. The fire danger in Yellowstone is rated as ‚Äúhigh,‚Äù and in Grand Teton it‚Äôs ‚Äúvery high.‚Äù The scale tops out with ‚Äúextreme‚Äù fire risk. The parks aren‚Äôt there yet, but more hot and dry weather is in store for the weeks ahead, Grand Teton officials warned Wednesday. Already this year, firefighters in the Grand Teton area have put out 52 unattended or abandoned campfires, up from 18 at this time in 2020, park officals said. They discouraged visitors from having campfires. Those who do should have plenty of water on hand to douse and stir their fires until the fire pit or ring is cool, they said. Fireworks are prohibited in the parks and surrounding areas. Meanwhile, the U.S. Forest Service has begun efforts to control an invasive grass in the area of a massive wildfire last fall in Medicine Bow National Forest, among Wyoming‚Äôs biggest wildfires in recent memory. A helicopter began spraying herbicide Monday to reduce cheatgrass in burned areas. Spraying will continue for about two months, forest officials said. Cheatgrass is a nonnative species that can proliferate in disturbed environments and burns readily, destroying sagebrush and other native plants.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/23/ai-hiring-bias-dog-bone-beating-searchable-museum-news-around-states/49425693/", "title": "AI hiring bias, dog bone beating: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: Leaders of several American Indian tribes are asking the University of Alabama to return nearly 6,000 human remains and artifacts from the school‚Äôs archaeological park and museum. The Oklahoma-based Muscogee Nation has tried for six years to get the remains back, but bureaucratic red tape has slowed the effort, said RaeLynn Butler, the Muscogee Nation‚Äôs historic and cultural preservation manager. The situation is no different than if someone dug up a family graveyard and took the remains for study, said Del Beaver, second chief of the Muscogee Nation. ‚ÄúAnd then if somebody asked for their grandma back, and we said, ‚ÄòNo, there‚Äôs too much red tape,‚Äô ‚Äù Beaver told the news site Al.com. ‚ÄúJust give us our people back.‚Äù Communications with the university slowed during the pandemic, frustrating tribal leaders who believe the remains and artifacts at the university‚Äôs Moundville Archaeological Park should be reburied, Butler said. This week, a federal review committee is scheduled to consider the evidence linking the seven tribes to Moundville and will rule on whether they can claim the remains as their own. However, the committee can‚Äôt force the university to turn over the remains and artifacts, Butler said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is extending through May a timeline to decide how or whether to proceed with proposed restrictions on mining in the state‚Äôs Bristol Bay region, known for its salmon runs. Acting Regional Administrator Michelle L. Pirzadeh, in a written notice, said an extension through May would allow time ‚Äúto consider available information in order to determine appropriate next steps, which may include revising‚Äù restrictions that were proposed but never finalized under the Obama administration. The EPA, as part of a 2017 settlement with the developer of the proposed Pebble Mine, agreed to initiate a process to suggest withdrawing the proposed restrictions. The developer, the Pebble Limited Partnership, cast the proposed restrictions as an attempt to preemptively veto the copper and gold mine and said it wanted the project vetted through the permitting process. The company subsequently filed a permit application with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In 2019, during the Trump administration, the EPA withdrew the proposed restrictions, removing what it called an ‚Äúoutdated, preemptive proposed veto of the Pebble Mine.‚Äù That action was challenged in court, and the EPA earlier this year asked a judge to vacate the withdrawal decision and send the matter back to the agency for further consideration. The request was granted.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A union representing the largest group of food service workers at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport went on strike Monday, during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year, to amplify concerns about wages, health insurance and retirement contributions. HMS Host is the single largest concessionaire at the airport in Phoenix that served more than 45 million passengers annually before the coronavirus pandemic. Workers with UNITE HERE Local 11 voted overwhelmingly last week to go on strike. The strike won‚Äôt affect flights but will affect hungry travelers because HMS operates more than two dozen restaurants and coffee shops. The company said in a statement that it will offer prepackaged food and scale down offerings for sit-down service during the strike. Four years of negotiations on a contract have failed, the labor union said in a statement. Workers are seeking raises, affordable health insurance, a company-paid retirement contribution and protection from discrimination, according to union officials. HMS Host said it offered substantial wage increases and benefits that include paying 90% of employees‚Äô health care costs. The union represents less than half of the company‚Äôs hourly employees, HMS Host said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A lawsuit settlement has prompted the Arkansas State Police to clarify when troopers can try to slow a fleeing vehicle by striking it with a patrol car. Between 2016 and 2020, use of the tactic ‚Äì which is intended to cause the fleeing vehicle to spin out of control ‚Äì has increased every year, according to data provided by state police, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The tactic came under scrutiny after a July 9, 2020, incident in which state Trooper Rodney K. Dunn tried to stop Janice Nicole Harper for speeding as she drove in Pulaski County. Denton and Zachary PLLC, the law firm representing Harper, say she was looking for a safe place to pull over on the strip of highway that was lined with concrete barriers when Dunn used the maneuver, known as precision immobilization technique, or PIT, and caused Harper‚Äôs car to flip over. State police reached a preliminary settlement with Harper on Friday. Due to the settlement, state police clarified their use-of-force policy, instructing troopers to judge whether using the technique is ‚Äúobjectively reasonable,‚Äù Arkansas State Police spokesman Bill Sadler told the newspaper. Since 2018, at least 1 in 4 pursuits has ended with a PIT maneuver, and police and officials have defended its continued use.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: During a visit Saturday to Alcatraz Island, which became a symbol of the struggles of Native Americans for self-determination following its takeover in the 1960s, U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said progress has been made by Indigenous people, but more remains to be done. Haaland visited the island off San Francisco‚Äôs coast on the 52nd anniversary of the occupation by Indigenous students who were demanding that the U.S. government recognize long-standing agreements with tribes and turn over the deed to the island. The group was removed after a 19-month occupation, but the takeover became a watershed moment in Native American activism. ‚ÄúAlcatraz was borne out of desperation,‚Äù said Haaland, accompanied by some of the dozens of people who occupied the island in 1969. ‚ÄúOut of this we gained a sense of community and visibility in the eyes of the federal government. But more than that, our Indigenous identities were restored.‚Äù Haaland, who is from Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico and the first Native American to lead a Cabinet agency, said that thanks to the actions of those activists, Native Americans no longer have to resort to extreme measures to be heard. ‚ÄúThe fact that I‚Äôm standing here today is a testament to that fact,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI am here. We are here. And we are not going anywhere.‚Äù\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Coloradans with COVID-19 who are at high risk of severe illness will no longer need a doctor‚Äôs referral before getting antibody treatments designed to keep them out of hospitals, starting this week. Gov. Jared Polis made the announcement expanding access to monoclonal antibodies Friday, the Denver Post reports. Colorado‚Äôs hospitals have been stressed by high COVID-19 caseloads, and 2 in every 5 hospitals reporting to the state expected to be short on intensive care beds within the next week. Roughly 45% of hospitals said they were experiencing staff shortages. About 1 in every 62 Colorado residents is currently infected with the coronavirus. Still, the governor has resisted reinstating public health measures such as mask mandates or capacity limits on businesses, despite calls from local public health officials to take more aggressive action. On Monday, the health departments representing Jefferson, Adams and Arapahoe counties ‚Äì which have lobbied Polis to issue a new mask mandate for public indoor spaces ‚Äì planned to consider enacting their own. Public health experts warn coronavirus cases could climb as people gather together during the holiday season. In Colorado Springs, public defenders are working remotely after employees in the office were sent home amid a possible COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Already facing higher fuel and salt prices, the state is looking for snowplow drivers to fill a shortage as winter approaches. The Connecticut Department of Transportation is seeking to hire nearly 140 more drivers to address a 13% driver shortage, The Day reports. DOT spokesperson Kafi Rouse told the newspaper the shortage is due to a recent spate of retirements and a shortage of applicants who have commercial driver‚Äôs licenses. It can be difficult to recruit snowplow drivers because of unpredictable scheduling, Rouse said. Kurt Hayes, owner of Hayes Services, a snow removal service in East Lyme, told The Day he has reduced his customer list due to supply shortages for snowplow parts. Fuel prices have doubled, and salt prices are up about 30%, said Rick Whittle, owner of Allied Snow Plowing Removal in Mystic. Whittle told the newspaper he has had to raise his prices by up to 15%. ‚ÄúSometimes it can snow three times in a week, so it‚Äôs unpredictable to everyone involved, from the salt guy to the plow guy to everyone,‚Äù Whittle said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what makes it hard.‚Äù\n\nDelaware\n\nMiddletown: A blast heard throughout northern Delaware on Sunday was the result of an exploding rifle target that destroyed a nearby abandoned car, according to the State Fire Marshal‚Äôs Office. The explosion near Middletown was reported shortly before noon in a farm field several hundred yards away from the main roadway in the 4700 block of Summit Bridge Road, officials said. No injuries have been reported. Prior to the explosion, several people gathered in the field for target practice with firearms until an explosive mixture, known as a ‚Äúbinary exploding rifle target,‚Äù was placed next to the abandoned vehicle. A long-range rifle detonated the target, leading to the vehicle being destroyed and fragments being scattered across almost 3 acres of farmland, officials said. The explosion sent shockwaves through social media as residents reported hearing a loud boom as far away as Newark and Bear. Numerous commenters also reported their houses shaking due to the explosion. Investigators canvassed the area to see if any property had been damaged as a result of the ‚Äúmisuse‚Äù of the target, officials said. The Delaware State Police Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit also assisted with destroying materials.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Smithsonian‚Äôs National Museum of African American History and Culture has welcomed millions of visitors through its doors since opening in 2016. Now, millions more can visit with the tap of a button, WUSA-TV reports. The museum launched its latest digital initiative, the Searchable Museum, on Thursday. The digital platform at searchablemuseum.com is aimed at capturing the in-house experience of the museum for anyone with access to a laptop, smartphone or other digital device. ‚ÄúThis ongoing project provides a chance for Americans to realize our shared past, bringing the unique museum experience to their homes and on their phones,‚Äù said museum director Kevin Young. The digital project‚Äôs first exhibition, ‚ÄúSlavery and Freedom,‚Äù is based on an exhibition of the same name in the museum‚Äôs David M. Rubenstein History Galleries. Users will virtually experience recreations of striking moments from the gallery exhibition, including the History Elevator, which transports visitors back in time from the present to the early 1400s through images accompanied by the words of Maya Angelou. The Paradox of Liberty depicts Thomas Jefferson, U.S. president and principal author of the Declaration of Independence, surrounded by the names of the 609 people he enslaved over his lifetime.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: A judge on Monday officially exonerated four young African American teens and men of the false accusation that they raped a white woman seven decades ago, making partial and belated amends for one of the greatest miscarriages of justice of Florida‚Äôs Jim Crow era. At the request of the local prosecutor, Administrative Judge Heidi Davis dismissed the indictments of Ernest Thomas and Samuel Shepherd, who were fatally shot by law enforcement, and set aside the convictions and sentences of Charles Greenlee and Walter Irvin. The Groveland Four, who ranged from 16 to 26 years old at the time, were accused of raping a woman in 1949. ‚ÄúWe followed the evidence to see where it led us, and it led us to this moment,‚Äù said Bill Gladson, the local state attorney, following the hearing in the same Lake County courthouse where the original trials were held. Gladson, a Republican, moved last month to have the men exonerated. The men‚Äôs families said maybe this case will spark a reexamination of other convictions of Black men and women from the Jim Crow era. ‚ÄúWe are blessed. I hope that this is a start because lot of people didn‚Äôt get this opportunity,‚Äù said Aaron Newson, Thomas‚Äô nephew. He broke into tears as he spoke. ‚ÄúThis country needs to come together.‚Äù Thomas was killed by a posse that shot him more than 400 times shortly after the rape accusation. The local sheriff, Willis McCall, fatally shot Shepherd and wounded Irvin in 1951 as he drove them to a second trial after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned their first convictions, saying no evidence had been presented. The sheriff claimed the men tried to escape, but Irvin said McCall and his deputy shot them in cold blood.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: A newly launched program aims to provide people experiencing homelessness work for pay while also cleaning the city. ‚ÄúOne of the things I think people can all come to common ground on is if some of the homeless are willing to work for these couple of hours, then that‚Äôs a win for everybody,‚Äù said James Scott, executive director of Sparrow‚Äôs Nest, a Christian ministry serving those in need. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a win-win. A win for them, and also for the community in keeping Athens safe and clean.‚Äù Currently, the initiative pays members of the homeless community $10 an hour for about two hours once a week. It typically opens to the first 10 people to arrive at Sparrow‚Äôs Nest. Scott said the program has been running for more than a month, with hopes to expand it. ‚ÄúWe want to increase it to two to three hours, or two to three times a week, or three to four hours, either-or, to be able to give people opportunity,‚Äù he said. Through expanding the program, Scott said, there‚Äôs hope that it can lead to building leadership and additional opportunities for participants. ‚ÄúMy long-term hope is that we can begin to, because I‚Äôm in ministry, make disciples,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe guy who is picking up today, hopefully, he can be the guy when we move to 20 to be over a group of people.‚Äù\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Some people on Maui want to limit bike tours they say create safety hazards, but company owners worry new restrictions would hurt business. Maui County Council Member Mike Molina introduced a bill last week to limit the times and number of people who could go on guided bike tours, The Maui News reports. Among the proposed rules is a ban on unguided tours and a requirement that guided tours operate only between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. The measure would also limit riders to 10 per group and cap the number of companies that can operate in certain districts to six. Jeremy Hall, co-owner of Haleakala Bike Company, said the proposal goes against small businesses and is anti-tourism. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not some mainland company that‚Äôs popped up and is taking money out of the community, using public resources ‚Äì we‚Äôre people who live Upcountry. My employees live Upcountry,‚Äù said Hall, whose business has been operating on Maui for 30 years. Some residents said the tours create traffic hazards. ‚ÄúThese roadways were not built for bikes; these roadways are even risky for residents who live here,‚Äù said Haiku resident Jasmine Kilborn. ‚ÄúVisitors don‚Äôt know the area. They don‚Äôt know the road or what they‚Äôre getting themselves into.‚Äù\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Most of the state‚Äôs emergency medical services rely entirely on volunteers and don‚Äôt have enough resources to meet the needs of their communities, according to a new report from the Office of Performance Evaluations. Just 18% of EMS directors reported that their agency is able to maintain sufficient staff, according to the report released Friday, and 65% said they experienced delayed emergency response times because of staffing problems within the past year. Under state law, emergency medical services aren‚Äôt considered ‚Äúessential,‚Äù so there is no guarantee that every community will have access to ambulances or paramedics in an emergency. Across Idaho, EMS programs are run by a variety of entities ‚Äì including private organizations, fire departments, local governments and other groups ‚Äì using a patchwork of funding. In rural Idaho, nearly 7 out of 10 EMS providers are volunteers. ‚ÄúAgency officials we interviewed consistently reported that not every Idahoan gets the level of care they need during an emergency. They cited insufficient staffing as the primary reason,‚Äù the Office of Performance Evaluation staffers wrote in the report. A 2010 report from the Office of Performance Evaluations found similar problems, but lawmakers didn‚Äôt follow through on many of the things the office recommended to address the issues.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state wants the public‚Äôs help to return nearly a dozen Purple Heart medals to their rightful owners. The medals are awarded to members of the U.S. military who are injured or killed while serving. Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs said the 11 medals each were left in a bank safe deposit box that went untouched for years. The treasurer‚Äôs office received them as part of the office‚Äôs unclaimed property program after the owners could not be found. ‚ÄúThese medals personify honor, sacrifice and duty,‚Äù Frerichs said. ‚ÄúThey belong in the loving care of families rather than hidden inside our cold basement vault.‚Äù His office released a list Thursday of the last names associated with the safe deposit box, the date in which the medal was recorded with the state treasurer‚Äôs office and the location of the bank. They include multiple banks across Illinois and one in Portland, Oregon. Frerichs asked anyone who may have a lead on locating a veteran or his or her family to contact his office.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: Hundreds of onlookers gathered Sunday morning to watch as a series of blasts brought down an 18-story office tower that had been the city‚Äôs tallest building for than a half-century. Crowds watching from a safe distance cheered as a cloud of smoke enveloped part of downtown Evansville after a rapid series of blasts collapsed the 420 Main Building in less than a half-minute. The office tower had housed Old National Bank‚Äôs headquarters from 1970 to 2004. But after the bank moved out, the tower‚Äôs occupancy dropped, its condition deteriorated, and efforts to rehabilitate it failed. Neil Chapman‚Äôs law firm was the building‚Äôs last tenant. He hosted a party Sunday morning to watch the implosion from his new office in the Fifth Third Center, which at 15 stories is now the tallest structure in the southwestern Indiana city, along the Ohio River. ‚ÄúThis was a man-made structure, 18 stories tall, and to see it come down suddenly and violently within seconds is amazing. It brings out your inner 8-year-old,‚Äù Chapman said. Contractors said most of the 18,000 tons of rubble left will be crushed and reused in the site‚Äôs redevelopment. The implosion makes way for a planned retail and apartment development that will top out at four stories. Property owner Domo is leading that endeavor, called Fifth & Main.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State officials say they will continue to strive for fewer than 300 annual traffic deaths, but it won‚Äôt happen in 2021. The Cedar Rapids Gazette reports that as of Friday, Iowa‚Äôs traffic death count stood at 312. Iowa Department of Transportation officials say that outpaces the death toll for the same date in the four previous years, but it was below the 350 count by the same time in 2016 ‚Äì the last year highway crashes claimed more than 400 lives. Governor‚Äôs Traffic Safety Bureau Chief Brett Tjepkes said a safety campaign will continue to urge drivers to slow down, buckle up, drive sober and remain distraction-free heading into the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel period. State officials cite speeding as a major problem, and the state patrol has been cracking down, issuing more than twice as many tickets in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Conservative legislators struggled Monday to build support among Republicans for a proposal to provide unemployment benefits to workers who lose their jobs for refusing COVID-19 vaccines. The GOP-controlled Legislature opened a special session Monday. The measure on unemployment benefits was tied to another that would make it easier for workers to claim religious exemptions to COVID-19 vaccine mandates. Both are responses to mandates from President Joe Biden covering more than 100 million American workers. The push for unemployment benefits for vaccine-refusing workers comes after GOP lawmakers worried for months that the depletion of funds to pay claims last year during the pandemic would force an increase in the state tax that finances the benefits. There‚Äôs bipartisan concern that the unemployment proposal before lawmakers now could lead to such a tax increase. ‚ÄúMost of our employers are small businesses. That increase in taxes, on unemployment, will be difficult,‚Äù state Sen. Jeff Longbine, of Emporia, told fellow Republicans during a meeting Monday before the session convened.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The chemical giant Chemours, moving to cut emissions of a climate super-pollutant from its facility in the Rubbertown neighborhood, has asked city officials to issue a permit for new abatement equipment that could release chloroform and other hazardous air pollutants. The company plans to capture the climate super-pollutant hydrofluorocarbon-23 and transport the gas to a Chemours plant in West Virginia for destruction. As part of the process to capture HFC-23, about 1,600 pounds a year of chloroform, hydrochloric acid, chlorine and hydrogen fluoride, all hazardous air pollutants, could be emitted into neighborhoods around its Louisville facility. While not a local air pollutant, HFC-23 is one of the most potent greenhouse gases warming the planet. The chemical byproduct is 14,600 times more potent for warming of the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, the primary driver of climate change. Chemours and Louisville officials say the net effect of the abatement project will be a major reduction in greenhouse gases blamed for heating the planet and a plantwide reduction in hazardous air contaminants ‚Äì even though the proposed construction permit shows a chloroform tank and other new equipment could result in the release of those air pollutants.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The director of New Orleans Emergency Medical Services is resigning after more than three years in the job, a spokesperson for the struggling agency said Friday. Dr. Emily Nichols told her paramedics she was leaving the agency, which has been hit by staffing shortages worsened by the coronavirus pandemic. Spokesperson Jonathan Fourcade said Nichols‚Äô departure is expected in the next few weeks. Details about why Nichols quit weren‚Äôt immediately available, but Fourcade said she had not been forced out, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. Mayor LaToya Cantrell appointed Nichols in May 2018. New Orleans Emergency Medical Services was already dealing with staffing shortages and employee burnout when the pandemic began in 2020. COVID-19 sparked even more shortages, with emergency medical technicians and paramedics either out sick or in quarantine. Many ambulances have also broken down. Recently, with only nine ambulances available from a fleet of 40, Nichols decided to send some paramedics and EMTs home despite the staffing shortfalls, leaving the agency unable to answer some emergency medical calls.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: More hunters are seeing purple as property owners use the color to mark land that is off limits to hunting without first obtaining permission. Purple paint can be used on trees, rocks or fence posts as an alternative to nailing a sign on a tree to let others know that no hunting is allowed without advance permission, said Mark Latti of the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. The state‚Äôs ‚Äúpurple paint law‚Äù has been around since 2011, but it‚Äôs being used more and more with each passing year. The marking is a single vertical stripe of purple paint. Hardware stores sell special paint for use in marking properties. According to state law, the signs must be no more than 100 feet apart at locations that are readily visible to people approaching the property, as well as at all vehicular access points off a public road.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Nursing students at the University of Maryland are getting an early jump on their postgraduate careers. The university‚Äôs nursing school is allowing its students who are scheduled to graduate Dec. 23 to leave a few weeks early and begin working in the field. The move is motivated by a nursing shortage amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Baltimore Sun reports it‚Äôs the fourth time the school has approved such an early-exit program. This time, it was in response to a request from Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. All 161 bachelor‚Äôs degree students and 11 master‚Äôs degree students will leave early during a period that runs from Friday to the first week of December. ‚ÄúNurses throughout Maryland have served courageously on the front lines for over 20 months,‚Äù the school‚Äôs dean, Jane Kirschling, said in a statement. ‚ÄúI am proud of our entry-into-practice students for their willingness to support these efforts, and I applaud all of our students for their resiliency and for persevering in their studies during a difficult time marked by uncertainty and ongoing challenges.‚Äù\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: First responders would be allowed to treat and transport injured police dogs to veterinary hospitals under a bill unanimously approved by the state Senate. The bill dubbed Nero‚Äôs Law was named for the K-9 partner of slain Yarmouth Police Sgt. Sean Gannon. Gannon was fatally shot in 2018 while serving an arrest warrant. Nero was also shot, but because of current state law, EMTs weren‚Äôt allowed to treat or transport him. Nero had to be rushed to the animal hospital in the back of a police cruiser and survived the shooting. ‚ÄúK-9 officers protect the men and women in law enforcement as well as the community at large,‚Äù said Democratic state Sen. Mark Montigny, lead sponsor of the bill. ‚ÄúThese animals endure extreme danger from gun violence, narcotics and even explosive materials. Allowing our emergency personnel to provide basic treatment and transport is a commonsense measure that honors their contributions across the commonwealth.‚Äù The bill would permit emergency personnel to treat injured police dogs and bring them to veterinary facilities, as long as there are no injured people still requiring a hospital transport. The bill now heads to the Massachusetts House for consideration.\n\nMichigan\n\nMarshall: The last Kmart has closed in the state where the former brick-and-mortar retail giant got its start. Sunday was the last day at a Kmart in Marshall, 100 miles west of Detroit, City Manager Tom Tarkiewicz said Monday. ‚ÄúThey still had products they were selling,‚Äù Tarkiewicz said. An email seeking comment from Kmart‚Äôs corporate parent wasn‚Äôt immediately returned. The first Kmart store opened in Garden City, a Detroit suburb, in 1962. The chain grew to more than 2,000 stores across the U.S., but its fortunes changed as other big box retailers gained momentum. Kmart reorganized under bankruptcy protection in 2002-03 and began closing hundreds of stores before merging with Sears, Roebuck & Co. in 2004. Kmart‚Äôs website lists 21 stores remaining in the U.S. or U.S. territories. It also sells goods online. Tarkiewicz didn‚Äôt know why the Marshall store was the last in Michigan to stay open but said he had heard it was considered to be a profitable location. ‚ÄúIt was busy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe saw a lot of out-of-state cars. We‚Äôre only 36 miles from Indiana.‚Äù\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: About 50 parishioners protested outside Our Lady of Guadalupe Church on Sunday over what they say is the eradication of culture and tradition from Minnesota‚Äôs first Hispanic parish. Many of the demonstrators were third-generation members of the Roman Catholic church, which has a 90-year history in St. Paul. Among specific complaints, they say Aztec dancers are no longer allowed inside the church, there is no Sunday school or choir, masses previously led in Spanish are now in Latin, and women are not allowed on the altar. One of the protesters, Vincent Mendez, said that ‚Äúit feels like we‚Äôre being forced out again‚Äù and that the parishioners ‚Äújust want to save our church.‚Äù The Rev. Michael Tix, with the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, said in a statement that he and Archbishop Bernard Hebda are involved in conversations between parish leadership and parishioners, the Star Tribune reports. Tix said it is ‚Äúthrough open and honest conversation that concerns will best be addressed and solutions reached for the good of everyone involved.‚Äù\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned the approval of a massive flood-control project in the south Mississippi Delta that officials said was erroneously greenlit in the final days of the Trump administration. In a letter to the Army for Civil Works, EPA officials said the past administration‚Äôs November 2020 decision to approve the Yazoo Pumps Project was in violation of the Clean Water Act and ‚Äúfailed to reflect the recommendations from the career scientists and technical staff.‚Äù Radhika Fox, assistant administrator for the office of water at the EPA, said the federal government is concerned about the serious impacts from flooding on people and the economy of the lower Mississippi Delta. But she said she wants to work with the Corps and others to find ‚Äúa path forward that addresses flooding concerns in an environmentally protective manner.‚Äù The decision was cheered by conservation groups ‚Äì American Rivers, National Audubon Society, Sierra Club and Healthy Gulf ‚Äì which had sued the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service earlier this year over the construction of pumps in the Yazoo Backwater area north of Vicksburg.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday sent a letter demanding a school district return two LGBTQ-themed books to library shelves. The North Kansas City School District pulled ‚ÄúAll Boys Aren‚Äôt Blue‚Äù and ‚ÄúFun Home‚Äù from high schools this month in response to parent complaints, the Kansas City Star reports. The district is reviewing the titles, and the books were expected to be discussed during a Monday school board meeting. In a letter to school officials, the ACLU of Missouri said removing the books violates students‚Äô First Amendment rights by restricting their access to ideas. ‚ÄúStudents must be free to access library books ‚Äì without discrimination or censorship ‚Äì that are LGBTQ+ affirming as well as books that provide an inclusive and accurate history of racism,‚Äù ACLU of Missouri Executive Director Luz Mar√≠a Henr√≠quez said in a statement. Students also are petitioning to have the books returned. ‚ÄúAll Boys Aren‚Äôt Blue‚Äù is a coming-of-age memoir about the author‚Äôs experience as a queer, Black adolescent. ‚ÄúFun Home‚Äù is about the author‚Äôs relationship with her gay father.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: A program in the resort community of Big Sky that offers landlords cash to convert vacation rentals or seasonal homes into long-term homes for locals converted 21 homes and housed 58 locals in its first three months. After a three-month trial of the Rent Local program, launched by the Big Sky Community Housing Trust, the nonprofit launched the full program Nov. 1. The success of the pilot program wasn‚Äôt a surprise, executive director Laura Seyfang said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what we were hoping for,‚Äù she told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. The program hopes to convince some 1,200 owners of seasonal homes or vacation rentals to rent to local residents by bridging the gap in money the homeowner might make with short-term rentals. The housing trust estimated homeowners make on average anywhere from about $3,800 to about $10,400 more annually on short-term rentals than long-term leases. ‚ÄúBy providing this boost, it‚Äôs enough to make it even out,‚Äù Seyfang said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve put in place all these ways to make it easier for an owner to rent to a local worker, but then there was that cash difference. By making up that income difference, it takes away all these excuses.‚Äù The nonprofit estimates the incentive created new inventory 89% faster than through some of its other programs.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A petition drive is underway to change the state‚Äôs constitution and eliminate its Board of Education. The proposal would shift oversight of the Education Department into the governor‚Äôs office and eliminate the elected board, but backers would have to gather roughly 125,000 signatures by next July to put the question on the November 2022 ballot. The Omaha World-Herald reports the measure comes after Gov. Pete Ricketts clashed with the Education Department at times in the past year. Ricketts spoke out strongly when the state board considered adopting new health education standards for schools that incorporated teaching about gender identity and sexual orientation. The board later abandoned those proposed recommendations for local school districts after it encountered strong opposition. Ricketts said in a statement that any changes to the current structure of the department would have to be approved by voters. ‚ÄúThe Nebraska Department of Education should respect that parents are the primary educators of their children, and the agency must continue to be accountable to the people of Nebraska,‚Äù Ricketts said. Critics of the petition drive said it would concentrate too much power in the governor‚Äôs office and mess up a system that is working.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A man has been accused of beating another customer over the head with a dog bone during a quarrel over a pet store‚Äôs mask policy, according to authorities. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police said 22-year-old Juan Hamilton was arrested on a warrant after the Nov. 8 incident that left the unidentified victim with a skull fracture. Court records show Hamilton was still being held on a $5,000 bond on suspicion of attempted murder, battery, abuse of an older person resulting in substantial bodily harm and burglary of a business. The Las Vegas Review-Journal also reports that witnesses told police Hamilton was in line behind another man when the two began arguing over the PetSmart store‚Äôs mask mandate. Witnesses said Hamilton left the store before returning and allegedly beating the victim over the head with a bone. PetSmart employees helped detectives identify Hamilton because he was a regular at the store. Hamilton told police he hadn‚Äôt been to the store for several months and then asked for a lawyer. It was unclear Sunday if Hamilton had an attorney who could speak on his behalf about the case. If Hamilton is released from jail, court records indicate he‚Äôll be required to avoid all PetSmart stores.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state‚Äôs bear population is on the move, and officials are asking residents not to detour the animals with snacks. The Fish and Game Department says the public should hold off on putting out bird feeders until December. Right now, bears are searching for high-fat, protein-rich food to sustain them as they head into their dens, and bird feeders are often a target. Andy Timmins, the state bear project leader, said reports of conflicts between bears and people were low this summer, but there has been an uptick in activity since late October, mostly involving bird feeders. He said a single feeding will cause a bear to return in other seasons, leading to property damage and the bears becoming nuisance animals. ‚ÄúBears have an excellent sense of smell and good memories,‚Äù he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city‚Äôs nine casinos saw their gross operating profit more than double in the third quarter of this year, according to state figures released Monday. The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement figures show the casinos posted a collective gross operating profit of more than $310 million in July, August and September. That is more than twice the $151 million profit they reported in the third quarter of 2020, when they were still operating under state-imposed capacity restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic. For that reason, James Plousis, chair of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, said the results are not directly comparable. Instead, he compared them to the third quarter of 2019, before the pandemic hit, and found the casinos still did nearly 30% better in the third quarter of 2021. ‚ÄúThrough efficiencies, every operator posted a profit in the third quarter, a great accomplishment coming out of an extremely challenging period,‚Äù he said in a statement. ‚ÄúAtlantic City‚Äôs recovery is gaining momentum and is on track for an impressive year.‚Äù Gross operating profit reflects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and other expenses and is a widely accepted measure of profitability in the Atlantic City casino industry.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state‚Äôs exports are barreling toward an annual record this year, marking a sharp turnaround from last year‚Äôs pandemic-induced slowdown. Total state sales worldwide climbed 55% in the first nine months of 2021, from $2.77 billion in the January-September period last year to $4.28 billion this year, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. If those trends continue, the state could well surpass its previous annual export record, reached in 2019, when global sales hit $4.68 billion. In fact, at $4.28 billion as of September, the value of state exports is already more than $1 billion higher than the January-September period in 2019, when sales abroad totaled $3.16 billion. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs looking really good,‚Äù said Jerry Pacheco, trade consultant and executive director of the International Business Accelerator at Santa Teresa in southern New Mexico. ‚ÄúI expect this to be our biggest year yet,‚Äù Pacheco told the Albuquerque Journal. ‚ÄúNew Mexico exports are already well exceeding 2019, which was our flagship year before the pandemic.‚Äù The coronavirus pandemic markedly slashed exports nationwide in 2020 as consumers hunkered down at home, businesses temporarily shut down across the globe, and supply-chain disruptions slowed commerce worldwide.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Job candidates rarely know when hidden artificial intelligence tools are rejecting their resumes or analyzing their video interviews. But New York City residents could soon get more say over the computers making behind-the-scenes decisions about their careers. A bill passed by the City Council this month would ban employers from using automated hiring tools unless a yearly bias audit can show they won‚Äôt discriminate based on an applicant‚Äôs race or gender. It would also force makers of those AI tools to disclose more about their opaque workings and give candidates the option of choosing an alternative process ‚Äì such as a human ‚Äì to review their application. The measure aims to open a window into the complex algorithms that rank the skills and personalities of job applicants based on how they speak or what they write. ‚ÄúI believe this technology is incredibly positive, but it can produce a lot of harms if there isn‚Äôt more transparency,‚Äù said Frida Polli, co-founder and CEO of New York startup Pymetrics, which uses AI to assess job skills through game-like online assessments. Her company lobbied for the legislation, which favors firms like Pymetrics that already publish fairness audits. But some AI experts and digital rights activists are concerned it doesn‚Äôt go far enough to curb bias and implicitly gives the city‚Äôs OK to the technology.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A human rights group is suing the North Carolina Department of Public Safety, alleging its staff censors magazines inmates receive by mail, especially those with articles about prison misconduct. Human Rights Defense Center in Florida filed the suit in U.S. District Court, The News & Observer reports. The nonprofit publishes Prison Legal News and Criminal Legal News, which focus on inmates‚Äô rights, court rulings and other criminal justice issues and circulate to 232 people in state correctional facilities. The group claims that 23 magazine issues or annual reports were banned between 2019 and August. The department‚Äôs policy allows material to be kept from offenders because of ‚Äúthreats to institutional safety and security,‚Äù but the content can‚Äôt reasonably be considered to contain such threats, the lawsuit says. Last month, a contractor began converting prisoners‚Äô letters to digital files, but it doesn‚Äôt handle magazines. The nonprofit claims the state violated its free speech and denied access to readers without notice or opportunity to appeal. It argues the department is suppressing its political message and costing subscriptions. It seeks a declaration that such actions are unconstitutional and an end to the practice.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The city‚Äôs only Democrat in the Legislature won‚Äôt run for reelection next year. State Sen. Erin Oban announced Thursday that she won‚Äôt be seeking a third term, citing the divisive nature of current politics. The Bismarck Tribune reports her departure opens up one of seven seats held by Senate Democrats, who have dwindled to their smallest minority in 50 years in the Republican-controlled Legislature. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obvious that the extreme rhetoric and divisiveness of the national scene have seeped into our state,‚Äù Oban said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe North Dakota Senate has been a place that, for the most part, has maintained decorum and respected the rules that govern the way in which we do business. For that, I am grateful. But it was also considered the more ‚Äòserious‚Äô legislative body, the chamber with far less tolerance for distractions, nonsense, and political theater, and over the last few years, that‚Äôs been changing.‚Äù Oban, 39, is a former junior high math teacher. She was first elected in 2014. Her announcement came a week after Bismarck GOP Sen. Nicole Poolman said she won‚Äôt seek reelection. Poolman, an educator, said she wants to spend more time with her family and students but also cited an eroding civility in politics.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Public health officials are asking folks in Greater Columbus to make sure one particular unwanted guest doesn‚Äôt crash any Thanksgiving gatherings this year. To help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Columbus Public Health is offering free, at-home testing kits from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday in a drive-thru event at the Celeste Center on the Ohio State Fairgrounds. Franklin County residents can get up to 12 home test kits at the event, while supplies last, according to the health department. People are encouraged to test themselves and guests the day of gathering or traveling to someone else‚Äôs house. People who test positive should stay home, follow guidance on isolating and notify others with whom they were in close contact, according to the health department. ‚ÄúTesting before you gather adds another layer of protection, especially for those who are at greater risk of serious illness and those too young to get vaccinated,‚Äù said Columbus Public Health Commissioner Dr. Mysheika Roberts. Along with the drive-thru, free at-home tests are available at local libraries and recreation centers, according to a health department release. Thanksgiving approaches as Ohio is seeing yet another rise in COVID-19 cases. Getting vaccinated is ‚Äúthe safest way to celebrate‚Äù the holiday, Roberts said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma City Thunder announced Monday that beginning Dec. 1, fans attending games in person will no longer be required provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test. ‚ÄúWe have decided to lift our vaccination/testing requirements,‚Äù a team statement said, citing a decline in coronavirus cases and an increase in COVID-19 vaccinations in Oklahoma County. ‚ÄúSince we announced the protocols in September, the Oklahoma Department of Health reports the percentage of Oklahoma County residents 12 and older who are fully or partially vaccinated has risen to 85%,‚Äù according to the statement. ‚ÄúThe number of COVID cases statewide has dropped approximately 60% and hospitalizations have declined at similar rates.‚Äù The requirements remain in place for games scheduled for Wednesday and Friday. The NBA suspended the 2020 season in March that year after two Utah Jazz players tested positive for the coronavirus prior to a scheduled game in Oklahoma City.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state Supreme Court on Monday dismissed two challenges filed by Republicans to new legislative districts approved by the Legislature in September. The lawmakers passed new legislative and congressional boundaries that included a new, sixth U.S. House seat. The ruling Monday was specifically about the 90 state legislative districts that will likely enable Democrats to continue to hold majorities in the House and Senate but will not guarantee the party the three-fifths supermajorities it currently holds. Republicans throughout the redistricting process accused Democrats of gerrymandering. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that in petitions challenging the maps, Republicans alleged that Democratic lawmakers drew districts for partisan political gain and to help incumbents. In its ruling, the Supreme Court said the GOP failed to show that the new districts violated state law.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Sean Parnell, a U.S. Senate candidate endorsed by former President Donald Trump, on Monday suspended his campaign after he lost a court fight over custody of his three children in which the judge said he believed allegations of abuse by Parnell‚Äôs estranged wife. In a statement, Parnell said he was devastated by the judge‚Äôs decision and planned to ask the judge to reconsider, but he cannot continue his campaign. The high-stakes campaign in the battleground state could help determine control of the U.S. Senate in next year‚Äôs election. A Pennsylvania seat is opening up with the retirement in 2023 of two-term Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, and both Republicans and Democrats have a big field of candidates in the politically divided state. Parnell‚Äôs withdrawal comes as many in the state Republican Party remain undecided about their field, which includes conservative commentator Kathy Barnette, real estate investor Jeff Bartos and Carla Sands, Trump‚Äôs ambassador to Denmark. Also swirling is a suggestion from Mehmet Oz ‚Äì the cardiac surgeon and longtime host of TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúDr. Oz Show‚Äù who gained fame as a protege of Oprah Winfrey ‚Äì that he is being encouraged to enter the Republican primary.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: About 1 in 6 households across the state struggles to put enough food on the table ‚Äì significantly lower than during the height of the pandemic last year but higher than pre-pandemic levels, according to a report released Monday. Black and Latino households were particularly hard-hit this year, with 34% each unable to meet basic food needs, according to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank‚Äôs 2021 Status Report on Hunger. Hunger is also ‚Äúalarmingly high‚Äù in families with children, as 1 in 4 cannot meet basic food needs, the report said. The number of food-insecure households in Rhode Island is expected to grow as government programs that supported low-income families during the COVID-19 pandemic end. ‚ÄúPost-pandemic recovery simply doesn‚Äôt apply to the lives of many Rhode Islanders,‚Äù Andrew Schiff, chief executive officer of the food bank, said in a statement. ‚ÄúAs supportive government programs and benefits disappear, the ripple effects of COVID-19 continue to be seen on the kitchen tables of people across the state.‚Äù The numbers are based on the RI Life Index, compiled by Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island and the Brown University School of Public Health.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Federal agents are looking for someone who used a metal detector and dug 19 holes earlier this month looking for artifacts at a historic site that was once the Charleston-area plantation of a signer of the U.S. Constitution. Rangers at the Charles Pinckney National Historic Site found the holes all over the park Nov. 13, the National Park Service said in a statement. Some of them had discarded metal artifacts nearby, and some did not, leading rangers to think a thief was using a metal detector to steal selected artifacts, investigators said. The digging also caused damage to resources at the park, said Kate Funk, chief of resource management at the site. It is illegal both to dig without permission and to have a working metal detector at a national park site, officials said. ‚ÄúArchaeologists make a great effort to record the context from which artifacts are recovered to better understand their use and disposition and the wider historical picture. All this important information is now lost because of this illegal excavation,‚Äù Funk said. The Charles Pinckney National Historic Site was once a Lowcountry plantation that produced rice and indigo and was owned by the man sometimes called one of the forgotten signers of the U.S. Constitution. The site also tells the story of how slaves were treated.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Local police say they‚Äôre staffed and ready to run security for the Parade of Lights in light of recent events out of Wisconsin. The Parade of Lights is returning to downtown Sioux Falls for its 29th celebration this year. The parade is slated to start at 7:30 p.m. Friday, bringing lights, floats and music to downtown. Last year‚Äôs celebration was canceled amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. In a police briefing Monday, Lt. Andrew Siebenborn discussed potential changes to security for the parade given recent events in Wisconsin that led to multiple deaths and more than 40 people injured in a parade. ‚ÄúWe always staff for the worst-case scenario,‚Äù Siebenborn said. The incident in Waukesha, Wisconsin, happened during a Christmas parade Sunday. An SUV rammed through the parade, striking a high school band, children‚Äôs dance group and the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies. Siebenborn said he couldn‚Äôt discuss specifics about the security detail at Sioux Falls‚Äô parade Friday but said weeks and sometimes months of planning go into security protocols. ‚ÄúCredit goes out to our chief and command staff erring on the side of almost overstaffing an event in the interest of safety,‚Äù he said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The ex-girlfriend of the man who detonated an explosive in downtown Nashville last Christmas has filed a lawsuit, saying she should receive $284,000 in rewards offered after the blast. Pamela Perry filed suit Friday in Davidson County Chancery Court seeking the reward because she came forward ‚Äúat great personal risk to aid law enforcement in identifying‚Äù Anthony Warner as the bomber. Warner parked an RV in the middle of a tourist district early Dec. 25 before setting off the blast that killed him, injured several others and heavily damaged dozens of buildings, including a key AT&T network facility. After the blast, Camping World CEO Marcus Lemonis offered a $250,000 reward and Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp. offered $34,500 to anyone who came forward with information identifying the bomber. The Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp. gave the $34,500 it raised to law enforcement organizations including the Metro Nashville Police Department. On Friday, convention officials said they hadn‚Äôt seen the lawsuit and couldn‚Äôt comment, but CEO Butch Spyridon told WTVF-TV in May that hundreds of tips were called in, and an FBI report thanked law enforcement but didn‚Äôt identify citizens who gave tips. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have documentation to say this helped more than anything else,‚Äù Spyridon said.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: A late October land transaction helped to complete one of the largest land purchases and donations of unspoiled coastal land in the state. The final 1,360 acres of the Powderhorn Ranch donated to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department will be added to nearly 15,000 acres donated to TPWD in 2018 by the Texas Park and Wildlife Foundation. The transaction conserves one of the state‚Äôs largest ‚Äúunspoiled coastal prairies in Texas,‚Äù and it one day will become a state park. ‚ÄúIt demonstrates how Texas‚Äô community of conservationists can work hand-in-hand with the state to preserve an extraordinary piece of our natural heritage for generations to come,‚Äù said Dan Friedkin, chairman emeritus of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission. According to a 2015 story published by Texas Monthly, the land‚Äôs history dates back nearly 500 years. The Karankawa hunted there, and the explorers Rene Robert Cavelier and Sieur de La Salle lost a ship to a storm in 1686, according to the story. Included in the land is nearly 11 miles of coast along Matagorda Bay, and the site is near the Aransas Wildlife Refuge, making one of the longest stretches of unspoiled coastline in Texas.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: For decades, the U.S. Forest Service‚Äôs practice of putting out wildfires was a huge success. But the policy backfired, setting the stage for the massive destructive wildfires that have flared with increasing regularity across the West. While putting out fires remains a priority, deliberately setting them is becoming more common, especially in Utah, as a more cost-effective and ecologically sound strategy for fixing forest health, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. The pitfalls of fire suppression are evident across Monroe Mountain in central Utah. The plateau‚Äôs historically abundant aspen stands are disappearing under thickets of fir and other conifers that have long impeded fresh aspen growth that should be succeeding the aging trees but aren‚Äôt. In the hopes of restoring the historic role of fire, at least three Utah national forests plan to sharply expand the use of ‚Äúprescribed fire‚Äù to nurse sickly forests back to health. Like much of the West‚Äôs wooded terrain, large parts of the Fishlake National Forest are ecologically wired to burn from time to time. To thrive, aspen groves need to get wiped out from time to time, said Richfield District Ranger Jason Kling of the Fishlake National Forest. ‚ÄúThat keeps the fuels in check, not allowing the overgrowth to occur, keeping the landscape open, allowing sunlight to reach the forest floor,‚Äù Kling said.\n\nVermont\n\nKillington: Killington ski resort is making final preparations to host women‚Äôs World Cup ski racing on Thanksgiving weekend. The event was postponed last year amid the pandemic. This year tickets are being sold to control attendance, and proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test taken within the prior 72 hours is required to attend. ‚ÄúWe usually have about 15,000 people each day, and we are trying to cut that in about half. Even though it is an outdoor event, we really wanted to be able to get people to be careful in terms of being too close to each other,‚Äù said Mike Solimano, Killington‚Äôs president and general manager. Snow guns have been blasting, and race organizer FIS gave Killington a positive snow control Wednesday, which means the race is on. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre feeling confident. I mean it‚Äôs definitely been warm, and it‚Äôs been a struggle, but it looks like we‚Äôre gonna make it,‚Äù Solimano said last week.\n\nVirginia\n\nManassas: Reports of black bears afflicted with mange are growing in Northern Virginia. What used to be fewer than 10 sightings a year in 2018 has grown to more than 100 annual reports. ‚ÄúThose are just the ones that people see. We‚Äôre sure there are quite a few more bears that are out in the woods that are not encountering a person,‚Äù said Katie Martin, a deer, bear and turkey biologist for the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources. The area where most cases are reported is confined to a dozen counties roughly north of Interstate 64 and west of U.S. 29, including Fauquier, Culpeper, Loudoun and Prince William counties. Infestations of sarcoptic mange can be mild, fatal or anywhere in between. ‚ÄúAnd if it‚Äôs a severe case, and they lose all their hair, and they stop eating and become emaciated, then obviously that bear going into the winter is going to have a much harder time surviving,‚Äù Martin said. Preventing bears from congregating and spreading the disease to one another has proven to be a challenge. Residents are being asked to do their part. Anyone who has seen a bear near their property is asked to take down bird feeders for a minimum of two weeks after the sighting to prevent the bears from returning. Martin said she believes no one should have bird feeders out at all between April and November.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Steve Hobbs was sworn in Monday as Washington‚Äôs 16th secretary of state, the first person of color to head the office and the first Democrat to hold the position in 56 years. Hobbs, who is of Japanese descent, is leaving his Senate seat representing the 44th legislative district to replace Republican Secretary of State Kim Wyman. The fifth consecutive GOP secretary of state in Washington dating back to 1965, Wyman is taking a key election security job in the Biden administration. Hobbs was sworn in by state Supreme Court Justice Mary Yu in the state reception room at the state Capitol, after which he thanked Wyman in his speech, saying she understood and dealt with the threats of cyber and information warfare in the elections sphere. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to build upon that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm glad that we‚Äôll have a partner in Washington, D.C., to build upon that.‚Äù Wyman will serve as the election security lead for the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the agency responsible for safeguarding U.S. elections. In the role, she will serve as the federal government‚Äôs top liaison to the states. Hobbs said that in addition to building upon cybersecurity efforts in the state, he plans to create a plan to respond to misinformation and disinformation that hits elections.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Tolls on the West Virginia Turnpike will increase at the beginning of next year, officials said. The rate for most passenger vehicles will rise by 5% on Jan. 1, going from $4 to $4.25, West Virginia Parkways Authority Executive Director Jeffrey Miller told a legislative committee, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail. The E-Z Pass annual program will also see an increase from $25 annually to $26.50, Miller said. The proposed fee schedule for the turnpike allows up to a 5% increase every three years, he said. Voters approved selling up to $1.6 billion in bonds to fund the Roads to Prosperity program in 2017, and the Parkways Authority has returned $595 million from tolls to the state to support projects for the 10 counties affected by the Turnpike, Miller said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge says the state Department of Natural Resources violated the law by not immediately scheduling a wolf hunting season after federal protections were removed in February. In an order Thursday, Jefferson County Judge Bennett Brantmeier said the agency must hold a hunt immediately any time federal protections are lifted during the statutory hunting season, which runs from November through February. The injunction was issued in response to a lawsuit brought by Hunter Nation Inc. that challenged the agency‚Äôs decision not to hold a hunt as soon as the gray wolf was removed from the endangered list in January, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. Brantmeier is the same judge who last winter ordered the DNR to hold a hunt in the final days of February. State-licensed hunters killed at least 218 wolves in less than three days, more than the state and tribal quotas combined. However, wolf hunting in Wisconsin remains on hold while a Dane County judge considers a lawsuit filed in August by a coalition of wildlife advocacy groups seeking to stop the hunt and invalidate the law requiring it. In a ruling last month, Judge Jacob Frost said the law creating the wolf season is constitutional, but the DNR failed to create permanent regulations enacting it.\n\nWyoming\n\nKemmerer: With just four years left before its coal plant shutters, this southwestern Wyoming town, population 2,750, has been bracing for a seemingly inevitable loss. Along with the neighboring coal mine, the Naughton Power Plant is one of the biggest employers in Kemmerer. Its closure was expected to cut local jobs, slash revenue and force some residents to move away for work. Then nuclear developer TerraPower announced last week that it would build a next-generation nuclear reactor in Naughton‚Äôs place and staff the new facility with the existing Naughton workforce. Kemmerer and three other candidate coal towns ‚Äì Glenrock, Gillette and Rock Springs ‚Äì had waited six months for the decision. Over those months, the prospect of getting an advanced nuclear reactor has injected new optimism into a community used to weathering the booms and busts of the state‚Äôs energy industry, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre absolutely ecstatic,‚Äù Mayor Bill Thek said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been hopeful from the beginning, and as time went on, we became more and more hopeful.‚Äù Some people are apprehensive about living near a demonstration nuclear reactor, he said, but few are outright opposed.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/11/surfboards-printed-home-cherry-blossom-sculptures-news-around-states/116939290/", "title": "Surfboards up, 3D-printed home: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state told a federal judge Tuesday that it has nearly finished construction to use nitrogen gas to carry out death sentences, an execution method authorized by state law but never put into use. The court filing did not describe how the proposed execution system would work. When legislation was approved authorizing nitrogen hypoxia, proponents theorized death by nitrogen hypoxia could be a simpler, more humane execution method. Death would be caused by forcing the inmate to breathe only nitrogen, depriving the body of oxygen. Alabama in 2018 became the third state ‚Äì along with Oklahoma and Mississippi ‚Äì to authorize the untested execution method. Lawyers for the state wrote in a court filing Tuesday that the Alabama Department of Corrections ‚Äúis nearing completion of the initial physical build for the nitrogen hypoxia system and its safety measures.‚Äù The information was disclosed in a court filing Tuesday involving a lawsuit over the presence of spiritual advisers in the death chamber. State lawyers said they did not yet know if advisers could safely be present. No state has used nitrogen hypoxia to carry out an execution or developed a protocol for its use, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. He likened the planned first usage to human experimentation.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: High school seniors in the capital city will be required to earn half a credit less than prior graduating classes under a change adopted this week that was billed as a way to acknowledge the impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on learning. Under the change adopted by the Juneau School District Board of Education, the classes of 2022, 2023 and 2024 would need 22.5 credits to graduate, rather than the 23 credits previously required. Reducing the elective credit total by a half-credit would allow ‚Äúmore time for recovery of core content credits or other credits lost,‚Äù the proposal said. The district superintendent, Bridget Weiss, said students still must complete core academic credits, such as in English and math, KTOO Public Media reports. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre hoping is that this just relieves a little bit of the pressure for those students who lost some credits throughout the pandemic and provides a little bit of space in their schedule to make up those core academic credits,‚Äù she said. Juneau schools would continue meeting state graduation standards.\n\nArizona\n\nTempe: Habitat for Humanity unveiled its progress on a 3D-printed home in the city Wednesday ‚Äì the first of its kind for the nonprofit in the country ‚Äì and said it could be a possible solution to the lack of affordable housing in the area. Between 70% and 80% of the three-bedroom, two-bathroom single-family home is 3D-printed. The remainder is a traditional build. PERI, a company based in Germany, provided its 3D printer for the project, shipping it to the U.S. in March before printing began in May. The company says it built Germany‚Äôs first 3D-printed house in 2020 and Europe‚Äôs largest 3D-printed apartment building. ‚ÄúThe 3D printing project in Tempe is now continuing this success story in the USA,‚Äù PERI managing director Thomas Imbacher said in a news release. Jason Barlow, Habitat for Humanity Central Arizona‚Äôs president and CEO, said the organization had identified a family to live in the home, which was designed by Arizona-based architecture firm Candelaria Design Associates. Barlow said the family has lived and worked in Tempe for years but struggled to find affordable housing. Their new home ‚Äúfits that bill,‚Äù he said. The project has been in the works for more than 18 months and is expected to be completed around September or October.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday approved performance-related merit pay raises of as much as 3% for state employees. Hutchinson announced that $28 million in state and federal funds was allocated for the merit pay increases, which he said will be the largest performance pay raises offered since he took office in 2015. The Republican governor cited the work from the state‚Äôs employees in response to the coronavirus pandemic. He said the raises will be added to employees‚Äô existing pay and won‚Äôt be a one-time raise. Nearly 26,000 employees are eligible for the bumps. ‚ÄúThis last year, our workforce has shown dedication, resilience and flexibility during this pandemic,‚Äù Hutchinson said at a news conference. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been circumstances that no workforce has been through in the last 100 years.‚Äù\n\nCalifornia\n\nLong Beach: City officials have said they will spend $2.5 million to maintain the historic Queen Mary ocean liner for the next six months and plan out the repairs needed to reopen the tourist destination. The Long Beach City Council on Tuesday voted unanimously to enter into a $2 million temporary caretaker contract with the ship‚Äôs current on-ship operator, Evolution Hospitality, for the next six months with the possibility of a six-month extension, The Orange County Register reports. Officials said the remaining $500,000 will pay for the city‚Äôs contract engineer, Moffatt & Nichol, to develop the engineering and design repair work, which is estimated to cost $5 million. It was not immediately known how the city would pay for future repair work. Council members agreed Tuesday that regaining control of the ship for the first time since 1978 provides the city an opportunity to preserve and leverage an asset considered synonymous with the city. ‚ÄúAnywhere we go, the Queen Mary represents Long Beach,‚Äù Councilwoman Mary Zendejas said. ‚ÄúNobody is going to be able to take care of the Queen Mary as much as we can now that we have it back in our hands.‚Äù\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state has its first litter of gray wolf pups since the 1940s, wildlife officials said Wednesday. A state biologist and district wildlife manager each spotted the litter of at least three wolf pups over the weekend with their parents, two adult wolves known to live in the state, Gov. Jared Polis announced in a news release. Most wolf litters have four to six pups, so there could be more. The discovery comes after Colorado voters narrowly approved a ballot measure last year that requires the state to reintroduce the animal on public lands in the western part of the state by the end of 2023. Gray wolves lost their federal protected status as an endangered species earlier this year. But they remain protected at the state level, and hunting the animals in Colorado is illegal. Penalties for violations include fines, jail time and a loss of hunting license privileges. ‚ÄúThese pups will have plenty of potential mates when they grow up to start their own families,‚Äù Polis said in a statement. Gray wolves were hunted, trapped and poisoned into extinction in Colorado in the 1940s. Officials last year confirmed the presence of a small pack of wolves in northwestern Colorado after a number of sightings since 2019. The animals were believed to have come down from Wyoming‚Äôs Yellowstone National Park.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Lawmakers closed out a legislative session like no other Wednesday night, with the state Senate approving a two-year, $46.3 billion budget that proponents said will help Connecticut in its continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic while beginning to address some long-standing inequities in the state. Legislators wrapped up their work shortly before midnight. In the final moments, the House and Senate chambers were nearly filled with lawmakers ‚Äì a rare sight this session, given the strict COVID-19 protocols. As in the House, there was bipartisan support for the budget in the Senate, where the bill passed 31 to 4. Shortly afterward, Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said he will sign it into law, calling it the ‚Äúmost progressive, transformative and life-changing budget our state has ever seen.‚Äù The new fiscal year begins July 1. Wednesday‚Äôs vote marked the culmination of an unusual and challenging legislative session, during which the Capitol was closed to the public, and staff and legislators were forced to rely on Zoom meetings to get much of their work done, including committee meetings and public hearings. Besides dealing with the devastating impacts of the pandemic, the General Assembly was also under pressure to pass a budget that addresses the state‚Äôs racial and economic inequities.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Democratic lawmakers are proposing to give public officials more reasons to deny requests for public records under the state‚Äôs Freedom of Information Act and require people seeking records to pay new fees. The measure cleared a Democrat-led Senate committee Wednesday after a public hearing in which representatives of open-government groups spoke against it and warned that it could lead to more government secrecy. The legislation allows government workers to deny FOIA requests that they consider to be ‚Äúunreasonably broad, unduly burdensome, intended to disrupt the essential functions of the public body‚Äù or ‚Äúabusive.‚Äù The bill was filed on behalf of Democratic Attorney General Kathleen Jenning‚Äôs office, which is charged with reviewing petitions from people whose requests for public records have been denied. State solicitor Aaron Goldstein said the Department of Justice has seen ‚Äúbasically a tripling of the volume of work‚Äù in recent years. While the growing number of petitions suggests that more FOIA requests are being denied, Goldstein told committee members that there are ‚Äúa small amount of abusive filers‚Äù whose record requests undermine the intent of the FOIA.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Organizers of the National Cherry Blossom Festival plan to relocate the ‚ÄúArt in Bloom‚Äù sculptures from this year‚Äôs festival event throughout the area, WUSA-TV reports. Of the 26 oversized cherry blossom sculptures, at least one will remain in each of D.C.‚Äôs eight wards, with another five to be auctioned to the public for their ‚Äúdynamic aesthetics and one-of-kind interpretations,‚Äù according to the festival‚Äôs website. ‚ÄúThe Art in Bloom sculptures radiated springtime across the district and beyond, and now it‚Äôs time to find permanent homes for these one-of-a-kind creations,‚Äù said Diana Mayhew, president and CEO of the National Cherry Blossom Festival. Mayhew said 17 of the sculptures have already been acquired by organizations, businesses and private citizens in the capital region. The five sculptures up for auction will primarily help fund the festival to ensure it can remain free and open to the public, but a portion of the proceeds will also be given to the Trust for the National Mall‚Äôs Cherry Tree Endowment, according to the auction‚Äôs webpage. The sculptures were part of this year‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlossom Hunt,‚Äù in which visitors were tasked with finding the sculptures around the city and posting them on social media for the chance to win prizes. The online auction ends Tuesday.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state Board of Education banned ‚Äúcritical race theory‚Äù from public school classrooms Thursday, adopting new rules it said would shield schoolchildren from curricula that could ‚Äúdistort historical events.‚Äù Florida‚Äôs move was widely expected as a national debate intensifies about how race should be used as a lens in classrooms to examine the country‚Äôs tumultuous history. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis appeared by video at the top of the board‚Äôs meeting, urging its members, many of whom he appointed, to adopt the new measures he asserted would serve students with the facts rather than ‚Äútrying to indoctrinate them with ideology.‚Äù The Black Lives Matter movement has helped bring contentious discussions about race to the forefront of American discourse, and classrooms have become a battleground. Supporters contend that federal law has preserved the unequal treatment of people on the basis of race and that the country was founded on the theft of land and labor. Opponents of critical race theory say schoolchildren should not be taught that America is fundamentally racist. Governors and legislatures in Republican-led states around the country are considering or have signed into law bills that would limit how teachers can frame American history.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Residents receiving unemployment benefits will once again be required to look for work, and those whose hours have been reduced will be able to earn less before payments drop, beginning June 27. Labor Commissioner Mark Butler announced the changes Thursday, also saying employers with many laid-off workers collecting benefits will face higher unemployment insurance taxes after that date. It‚Äôs a further tightening of Georgia‚Äôs unemployment assistance as Butler and other elected Republican leaders say the state needs to do more to push people into the workforce. Georgia announced last month that, beginning June 27, it would cut off federal programs that provide a $300-a-week boost to people on the jobless rolls, as well as programs that pay federal money to people who are not usually eligible for state unemployment or have been receiving jobless aid for longer than the state provides. Those federal programs will last through September. Butler had earlier signaled he would reinstate work-search requirements, a move underway in more than three-quarters of states. Employers will also be asked to report when workers refuse to return to work or refuse a job offer, which could cause workers to lose benefits going forward. To keep drawing benefits after June 26, residents must register with the EmployGeorgia.com website.\n\nHawaii\n\nLahaina: Restaurants are having a hard time serving an influx of tourists returning to the islands as pandemic restrictions across the nation ease. Gov. David Ige has said the 50% capacity limit on restaurants will not increase until 60% of residents are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. But capacity increases won‚Äôt help some restaurants with limited space, Hawaii News Now reports. On Maui, Cool Cat Cafe General Manager Paul Kemp said his restaurant won‚Äôt be able to serve many more people until social distancing rules change. ‚ÄúIf we can get 6 feet to 3 feet, that‚Äôs when everything will really come together for the restaurants and put everything really back to the old norm,‚Äù he said. People are currently waiting about an hour to eat at the cafe, he said. And restaurants that do take reservations are often booked, sometimes for weeks in advance. The owners of Sale Pepe restaurant appreciate the safety measures. ‚ÄúWe need to be safe,‚Äù owner and chef Michele Di Bari said. ‚ÄúPeople think it‚Äôs over, especially people who are coming on vacation.‚Äù The restaurant is booked until the end of the month and has increased its takeout and delivery business. ‚ÄúWe always remember that this is a temporary situation,‚Äù owner and general manager Qiana Di Bari said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs uncomfortable right now. ... We just have to hang in there.‚Äù\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state could finish the fiscal year at the end of June with a record budget surplus of $800 million, Gov. Brad Little announced Wednesday. The Republican governor said he will advocate for additional tax cuts along with investments in key areas, with education topping the priority list. Lawmakers will take up the budget when they meet in January. Little said fiscal conservatism, swift action during the coronavirus pandemic, responsible allocation of billions of dollars in federal COVID-19 rescue money and ‚Äúour relentless focus on cutting red tape are the reasons Idaho‚Äôs economy is catapulting ahead of other states right now.‚Äù Little noted that May revenue numbers came in $580 million ahead of forecasts and, at nearly $850 million, the best in state history. The Division of Financial Management said revenue numbers for May, also released Wednesday, were far above predictions because the deadline for paying income tax was delayed from April to May due to the pandemic. Overall this year, individual income taxes have brought in $2.3 billion, about 25% more than predicted. Sales tax collections are up nearly 8% to $1.8 billion.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: State lawmakers could take up a bill later this month that would restore voting rights to convicted offenders serving time in county jails or state or federal prisons, according to the measure‚Äôs House sponsor. Rep. La Shawn Ford, D-Chicago, said the bill almost came up for a vote during the final days of the regular session but was delayed due to some last-minute confusion. Lawmakers wrapped up the bulk of their spring session June 1, but they did not formally adjourn the session because negotiations were continuing on a massive energy bill that would put Illinois on a path to producing 100% of its electricity from renewable and carbon-free sources. The Senate plans to return next Tuesday to vote on the energy bill, with the House in session the following day. Ford‚Äôs proposal to restore voting rights to convicted inmates was the subject of a committee hearing in March, but the panel never voted on it. During that hearing, Rep. Patrick Windhorst, R-Metropolis, questioned whether it would require a constitutional amendment before it could take effect because the Illinois Constitution states: ‚ÄúA person convicted of a felony, or otherwise under sentence in a correctional institution or jail, shall lose the right to vote, which right shall be restored not later than upon completion of his sentence.‚Äù\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: When muscle is damaged, resident stem cells mediate the repair of the injured tissue. At the same time, circulating immune cells race to the site to aid the repair. The presence of these infiltrating immune cells at injury sites raises questions about their role in coordinating with muscle stem cells to build or regenerate muscle tissue. Shihuan Kuang, a Purdue professor of animal sciences, has identified a previously unknown subset of muscle stem cells, which he has dubbed ‚Äúimmunomyoblasts,‚Äù that have both muscle stem cell and immune cell properties and may shed light on how those cells interact. The National Institutes of Health‚Äôs National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases recently awarded Kuang $2.3 million over five years to develop a basic understanding of these cells‚Äô origins and functions. ‚ÄúThese stem cells have unique properties that raise questions about where they come from and how they relate to muscle and immune cells,‚Äù Kuang said. ‚ÄúThis grant will provide the support for us to answer those fundamental questions and lay a foundation for applied research into ways immunomyoblasts could be targeted to treat diseases and improve animal agriculture.‚Äù The knowledge gained from Kuang‚Äôs work may open new avenues of research in muscular diseases.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Residents will no longer be able to use a state website to check their own vaccination histories or those of their children. The Iowa Department of Public Health is limiting public access to the website, partly because of concerns that employers could surreptitiously use it to see if their workers have been inoculated, department spokeswoman Sarah Ekstrand said. The change comes amid national controversy over whether employers should be able to require workers to receive COVID-19 shots and a state law banning use or government issuance of so-called vaccine passports. Hospitals, clinics and pharmacies have long been required to record vaccinations on the Iowa Immunization Registry Information System, which helps tracking of vaccination efforts, including in communities and for schools‚Äô students. The website also lets health care providers check before administering a vaccine to see if patients have already received the shots elsewhere. Since 2012, individual Iowans could sign on to IRIS using their names, birth dates, and Social Security numbers or Medicaid numbers to view their own vaccination histories, Ekstrand said. They also could check their children‚Äôs records that way. But Ekstrand said legislators heard concerns that employers or others with access to that information could access the records.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Eastern Kansas and western Missouri are facing a ‚Äúblood emergency,‚Äù the Community Blood Center of Greater Kansas City announced Wednesday. The nonprofit organization asked the public to donate blood to help replenish its supply, which it said was only sufficient to last three days. Things were looking ‚Äúa little bit grim‚Äù in terms of the lack of blood donations being made to the donor center the CBC operates in southwest Topeka, said Chelsey Smith, the CBC‚Äôs outreach and communications coordinator. The situation is similar at the six other centers operated by the CBC, Smith said. The blood shortage was triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the center. Smith said while figures weren‚Äôt available for specific locations, about 25,000 people who had been blood donors prior to the pandemic had not yet returned to donate in the greater Kansas City area alone. Meanwhile, Smith said, the CBC was seeing virtually no first-time donors among youths, while the number of blood drives being held had been reduced by hundreds. ‚ÄúComplicating matters, there has been a recent surge in blood usage as hospitals perform surgeries and patients seek medical care that was postponed during the pandemic,‚Äù the CBC said. ‚ÄúThe increased need and lag in donors has created a chronic gap in blood donations.‚Äù\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A former nurse at a nursing home claims in a lawsuit that she was fired last year after raising repeated concerns about infection control and lack of personal protective equipment, such as masks, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Donna Frank, a registered nurse, alleges in the lawsuit filed June 3 that she was wrongly fired by Signature Healthcare at Jefferson Place Rehab and Wellness Center after about six months on the job. Frank was fired Sept. 9, 2020, the day after an investigator from the state Cabinet for Health and Family Services Office of Inspector General showed up to investigate conditions at Signature-Jefferson Place, following a complaint from Frank. The lawsuit alleges she was fired in retaliation for that and other complaints related to COVID-19 and infection control procedures. ‚ÄúThe more she complained, the more of a headache she became, and they just got rid of her,‚Äù said Frank‚Äôs lawyer, Charles W. Miller. A spokeswoman for Signature Healthcare, Ann Bowdan Wilder, said in an email that the company doesn‚Äôt comment on pending legal matters but that ‚Äúthere are two sides to every story and judgement or opinion should be withheld until allegations are proven and/or disproven in the legal process.‚Äù\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: All 5-year-old children in the state should receive a kindergarten education, lawmakers decided Wednesday. With one day remaining in the legislative session, lawmakers sent the measure by Sen. Cleo Fields, D-Baton Rouge, to the governor‚Äôs desk. The Senate voted 38-0 for the final version of the legislation, while the House backed it in a 70-32 vote. Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards has said he supports the bill and will sign it into law. The requirement, to take effect with the 2022-23 school year, is estimated to add up to 2,800 students to kindergarten rolls when the mandate starts. Louisiana children currently must attend school from the ages of 7 to 18, unless they graduate early from high school. Fields‚Äô bill will require kindergarten attendance for children who turn 5 years old by Sept. 30 of each year. A parent can defer the kindergarten enrollment if the child is 4 years old on the first day of school or if the child is enrolled in a pre-K program. Supporters said mandatory kindergarten will help to keep children from falling behind, noting that studies show 90% of brain development happens between birth and age 5. They said 19 other states require mandatory kindergarten, and Southern states with the requirement have higher literacy rates than Louisiana.\n\nMaine\n\nWells: Scientists have determined that a black substance that had settled near the shoreline over several days is made up of millions of dead bugs. One of the regulars who walk Wells Beach, Ed Smith, took photos of the substance in the sand and sent them to the state Department of Environmental Protection, the Portland Press Herald reports. Smith wanted to know more because he said his feet were dyed black after walking through it, and he wanted to know if it was possibly toxic. Steve Dickson, a marine geologist with Maine Geological Survey, figured out what was going on with the help of two retired oceanographers who live nearby. One of them, Linda Stathoplos, took a sample from the beach and looked at it under her microscope. ‚ÄúIt was clearly little bugs,‚Äù Stathoplos said. ‚ÄúThis is the first time I‚Äôve seen or heard of this in my 35 years,‚Äù Dickson said, adding that he is still trying to determine what the bugs are, where they came from and why. But he does not expect it to be a regular occurrence.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: A controversy surrounding the placement of a 149-foot-tall Ferris wheel seems to have reached a conclusion after an amusement park informed town officials that it will move its ride off town property, but with the cost of a fix estimated to top $100,000, the Big Wheel won‚Äôt operate this summer. Ocean City leaders ordered Trimper‚Äôs Rides to move its Ferris wheel off the Boardwalk on Monday night. Questions about the structure‚Äôs proximity to the town-owned Boardwalk arose over the weekend, and the encroachment was confirmed Monday when a survey paid for by Trimper‚Äôs found it overhung town property by at least 10 feet. Park officials told the town it will dismantle the ride Monday, said Jessica Waters, communications and marketing director for Ocean City. The Big Wheel has been shut down, according to Waters, but the town will continue to issue fines for the zoning violation until it‚Äôs off the Boardwalk. Trimper‚Äôs had received at least three fines from Ocean City from Saturday through Monday, she said Tuesday. Each fine was $500, and Waters said it can be increased up to $1,000 each day until the ride is moved. Trimper‚Äôs President Antoinette Bruno has said the incorrect placement was the result of human error: ‚ÄúI think we made an error of a few inches, and we‚Äôre sorry.‚Äù\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Roman Catholics across the state are being called back to Sunday Mass. Cardinal Sean O‚ÄôMalley of the Archdiocese of Boston and the bishops of Springfield and Fall River announced in similar statements Wednesday that the faithful are once again required to attend Mass starting the weekend of June 19-20. Houses of worship have either been closed or open under capacity limits for the past year because of the coronavirus pandemic, and services have either been broadcast or held remotely. O‚ÄôMalley said Father‚Äôs Day was an appropriate time to lift the dispensation. ‚ÄúIn this year of Saint Joseph, who was always a faithful observer of the sabbath, we chose Father‚Äôs Day as an appropriate day to encourage all of our people, and especially our families, to return to the Sunday celebration of the Eucharist,‚Äù he said in his letter to parishioners. Mass is a central part of being Catholic, Springfield Bishop William Byrne said. ‚ÄúThe benefit of that is every time we go to Mass, we encounter Jesus Christ, we get to be together, we get to celebrate the obligation and the goodness of keeping the sabbath holy,‚Äù he said. The obligation to attend Mass does not apply to those who are ill or homebound, the bishops said. Worcester Bishop Robert McManus restored the Mass obligation for his parishioners last month.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation Wednesday that makes it easier for veterans and their families who are licensed professionals to continue their careers when they move to the state. Veterans, active-duty service members and their dependents with valid out-of-state professional licenses can get their licenses in Michigan under the new laws, and the fees for application will be waived. Current law allows veterans to have the initial application fees for professional licenses waived, but the new law expands that waiver to active-duty service members and their dependents. The families of the 550,000 veterans in Michigan face enough struggles seeking employment after service without having to figure out how to get re-licensed when they have a valid out-of-state license, Zeneta Adams, director of the Michigan Veterans Affairs Agency, said Wednesday at a bill signing in Lansing. Whitmer said the bill will help welcome service members and their families to Michigan and promote a skilled workforce, helping the state achieve its goal of raising the number of people with a professional certificate or college degree to 60% by 2030, up from the current 49%. The measure received bipartisan support in the Legislature.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A federal judge has sentenced a man to 15 months in prison for killing and then beheading a 700-pound black bear on the Red Lake Indian Reservation in northern Minnesota. U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson sentenced 39-year-old James Stimac on Wednesday. The bear is one of seven clan animals of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa. The tribe doesn‚Äôt allow non-Indians to hunt bear on its reservation. According to prosecutors, Stimac, of Brainerd, isn‚Äôt a Red Lake tribal member and entered the northern Minnesota reservation without permission in September 2019. He used a compound bow to shoot and kill the bear near the reservation‚Äôs garbage dump. He returned to the dump the next day and posed for photographs with the carcass. He later posted the photos on social media. The bear was too big to move, so he sawed its head off and took it to a taxidermist in Ironton to make it into a trophy. He left the remainder of the carcass to rot.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: A shipyard that‚Äôs the largest private employer in the state says it plans to hire about 3,000 new full-time employees. Ingalls Shipbuilding held a hiring event Wednesday in Pascagoula. Its parent company, Huntington Ingalls Industries, said in a news release that it has been recruiting potential workers in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana. ‚ÄúWe are steadily adding new team members to our growing workforce,‚Äù Ingalls Shipbuilding President Kari Wilkinson said in the release. ‚ÄúShipbuilding is a challenging, extremely rewarding and potentially life-changing career.‚Äù Ingalls is hiring ship fitters, electricians, pipefitters, pipe welders and structural welders. It is seeking people with mechanical, hot work or carpentry experience. The news release said free training is available to those without the required skills or work experience. The shipyard recently finished improvements that include more than a million square feet of covered work area, better access to work sites and tool rooms, cool-down and hydration stations, and a second dining area, the news release said.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A union representing state workers is urging Gov. Mike Parson to make accommodations for employees ordered last month to return to their offices, calling the directive ‚Äúdangerous.‚Äù The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports Natashia Pickens, president of the Missouri State Workers Union Communications Workers of America Local 6355, wrote to Parson on Wednesday, saying that COVID-19 is still ‚Äúraging‚Äù across the state and that Parson‚Äôs office failed to take into account health or child care concerns. The union asked that Parson, a Republican, consider demands that include paid time off to get vaccinated, personal protective equipment for employees, and that the state set up a process so workers with family and child care responsibilities may request a delayed return. Thirty-one House Democrats signed onto the letter. Last month Parson directed all state employees to return to in-person work after many spent most of the previous 14 months working remotely. He cited declining cases of COVID-19.\n\nMontana\n\nNye: Two workers for the only palladium and platinum mining operation in the U.S. have died in an underground accident at a mine, company officials said. The employees were in a utility vehicle called a side-by-side that crashed into an underground locomotive Wednesday afternoon, said Heather McDowell, a vice president with the South Africa-based Sibanye-Stillwater, which owns the Stillwater Mining Co. The cause of the accident at the mine near the community of Nye, north of Yellowstone National Park, is under investigation. Mine officials said they are working with safety regulators. The identities of the workers were not made public. In a statement, company officials said that ‚Äúwe value safety above all else. Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone impacted by this tragic event.‚Äù Stillwater Mining Co. has 2,335 employees and contractors, according to its website, including just over 1,200 workers at the mine in Nye, McDowell said. Its other palladium and platinum mine is near the small Montana city of Big Timber, and the company has a refining complex in the nearby town of Columbus.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state continues to report only a small number of new COVID-19 cases, but that number crept up slightly over the past week. Health officials said Nebraska recorded 280 new coronavirus cases over the past week, up from 237 the week before. But as recently as April, the state was reporting more cases than that in a single day. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska fell over the past two weeks, going from 74.43 new cases per day May 25 to 40.00 new cases per day Tuesday. The state said 54 people were hospitalized with the virus across Nebraska on Wednesday. That number has been below 100 since the middle of May, and it is a fraction of the November peak of 987. Gov. Pete Ricketts ended the last of the state‚Äôs virus-related restrictions last month because hospitalizations remain at such a low level. The state has now confirmed a total of 223,749 virus cases and 2,256 deaths since the pandemic began. Roughly 44.5% of the state‚Äôs population has been vaccinated against COVID-19, but health officials said the pace of vaccinations has slowed significantly over the past month.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Gov. Steve Sisolak on Wednesday signed into law a bill that paves the way for Nevada to become the second state in the nation, after Washington, to offer state-managed health insurance plans. Sisolak signed the measure that seeks to create state-managed health insurance plans by 2026 at a Las Vegas medical center. It passed through the Legislature on May 30. The new law requires insurers that bid to cover Medicaid recipients and state employees to also bid to offer a so-called public option plan. State officials would select certain providers to be in-network for the public option plan and mandate that they charge 5% less in monthly premiums than the average plan on the state insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act and 15% less by four years after it is first offered. Proponents argue a state-based public option will expand coverage to Nevada‚Äôs 350,000 uninsured residents and lower the cost of health insurance throughout the market. The bill‚Äôs detractors decry the price controls and worry that forcing doctors and hospitals to accept patients at lower costs could lead them to leave the state and exacerbate a practitioner shortage. The public option plan will have to undergo an actuarial study, and then the state would need to apply for a waiver from the federal government.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A bill seeking justice for run-over cats is heading to the governor‚Äôs desk, minus the name of the animal that inspired it. State law already requires drivers who injure or kill dogs to notify police or the animals‚Äô owners, or else face a $1,000 fine, but Rep. Daryl Abbas, R-Salem, sponsored a bill to give cats equal footing after the death of his 5-year-old cat, Arrow. The House passed the bill in April, as did the Senate, but the latter objected to dubbing it ‚ÄúArrow‚Äôs Law.‚Äù The House agreed Thursday to drop the name and advance the bill to Gov. Chris Sununu, who has said he will sign it. Rep. Thomas Walsh, chair of the House Transportation Committee, urged his colleagues to support the bill despite the change. ‚ÄúWhile we will always remember Arrow, there was no objection from the committee,‚Äù said Walsh, R-Hooksett. In any state, hitting an animal with a car could be a potential violation as destruction of property, but animal advocates say the New Hampshire bill is part of a trend of states going further. In Massachusetts, the law includes cats and dogs. New York requires drivers to report injuries to dogs, cats, horses or cattle. And Rhode Island‚Äôs statute covers all domesticated animals.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: Surf shops have been swamped with both new and veteran surfers searching for a safe, socially distanced activity during a pandemic, along with the exhilaration that comes with the sport. Now, surfboard manufacturers racing to meet the demand can‚Äôt keep up. Surfers are waiting longer and paying more. Melissa D‚ÄôAnna opened Lucky Dog Surf Co. in Sea Bright in 2017, helping the township recover from superstorm Sandy, and she quickly built a following. She worried the pandemic would put a stop to her momentum. But the surfing industry, estimated by the Surf Industry Manufacturers Assocation to generate upward of $8 billion a year, found itself with a nearly perfect set of circumstances. Some people with vacation homes at the Shore moved there full time and could surf after work. Others had federal relief checks that they could spend on new hobbies. Surfers said they began to see their tight-knit community expand. ‚ÄúYou saw people you hadn‚Äôt seen out the water in a while,‚Äù said Mickey Schluter, a 23-year-old surfer from Fair Haven. Local manufacturers said orders for boards spiked, forcing them to scramble to fill them. Brian Wynn, owner of Wynn Surfboards in Egg Harbor Township, said he‚Äôs about two months behind schedule.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state‚Äôs top information technology official says a new $100 million state account for expanding access to high-speed internet is just a start, and investments of $1 billion are likely needed to modernize infrastructure. Information Technology Secretary John Salazar told a panel of legislators Thursday that international consultant Deloitte is helping the state anticipate opportunities for federal grant money to improve internet access and data transfer rates. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre scoping out those grants,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need to be up there, front and center, asking for the money.‚Äù Salazar said the consultant is also looking at internet infrastructure programs in seven comparable states for effective solutions. He said states like Colorado, Minnesota and Montana have some things in common with New Mexico in terms of geography and obligations to Native American communities. The COVID-19 pandemic and a yearlong pivot to online learning have exposed gaps in internet access across swaths of the state. Over 20% of students were left without internet at home at the start of the pandemic, and a state district court judge has directed the state to move quickly on improvements for pupils.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The traditional Macy‚Äôs Fourth of July fireworks show will return to the city this year after the pandemic forced changes to the celebration in 2020, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday. ‚ÄúThis is really great, a tremendous sign of the rebirth of New York City,‚Äù de Blasio said at a virtual briefing. The fireworks will be launched from five barges in the East River starting at 9:25 p.m. July 4, said Will Coss, executive producer of the show. The show will be broadcast live on NBC as part of a two-hour special featuring the Black Pumas, Coldplay, OneRepublic and Reba McEntire, officials from Macy‚Äôs and NBC said. The big show was replaced by several small, unannounced fireworks displays last year in order to prevent crowds from gathering during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. De Blasio said there will be dedicated areas for fully vaccinated people to enjoy this year‚Äôs show, along with other areas for people who are not vaccinated or who want to join together with people who are not vaccinated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Legislation that includes $2 billion in income tax reductions over the next two years and the phaseout of the state‚Äôs corporate income tax by 2028 received bipartisan approval again in the Senate on Thursday. The Republican-authored measure, which also would send up to $1 billion in federal COVID-19 recovery aid to hundreds of thousands of businesses and nonprofits, already received the Senate‚Äôs initial OK on Wednesday. Seven Democrats joined all Republicans present in voting 34-13 for the bill Thursday. The bill now heads to the House, where action isn‚Äôt expected. Rather, the Senate will insert the package in its state government budget plan later this month and negotiate it with the House after that chamber approves a competing tax and spending proposal. The Senate plan would reduce the individual income tax rate of 5.25% to 4.99% next year and increase the amount of income not subject to taxes for all filers by increasing the standard and per-child deductions. The corporate rate ‚Äì at 2.5%, currently the lowest among those states that have such a tax ‚Äì would start falling in 2024. Democrats opposing the bill say it would give tax breaks to out-of-state corporations and high wage-earners who don‚Äôt need them.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Firefighters found themselves battling a string of dumpster fires on the city‚Äôs southern edge late Tuesday. The fire department said in a news release that the first call came in at 10:50 p.m. A half-hour later, firefighters responded to another dumpster fire at a different location. Three minutes later, they responded to three dumpster fires at the same location. The department said the fires are considered suspicious given the timing and proximity to one another.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine has come out against a controversial bill that would weaken the state‚Äôs vaccination laws and grant more individual freedom. DeWine asked Ohioans to think of the impact vaccines have had on society. ‚ÄúBefore modern medicine, diseases such as mumps, polio, whooping cough were common and caused great, great, great suffering and death to thousands of people every single year,‚Äù DeWine said during a news conference Thursday. A 1955 newspaper photo surfaced recently showing DeWine becoming one of the first second graders in Yellow Springs, Ohio, to get a polio vaccine. Hearings on House Bill 248 have drawn national attention as advocates have spread misinformation and conspiracies. Testimony from Dr. Sherri Tenpenny and nurse Joanna Overholt drew widespread derision and mockery. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen the pictures all over the internet of people who have had these shots, and now they‚Äôre magnetized,‚Äù Tenpenny said. ‚ÄúYou can put a key on their forehead; it sticks. You can put spoons and forks all over, and they can stick because now we think there is a metal piece to that.‚Äù Later, there was some show-and-tell. ‚ÄúExplain to me why the key sticks to me. It sticks to my neck too,‚Äù Overholt said as a key failed to stick to her neck. Tenpenny also mentioned the false claim that the COVID-19 vaccine contains particles that can connect with 5G wireless technology.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: Workers began excavating remains of possible Tulsa Race Massacre victims this week, removing them from a cemetery where searchers have found at least 27 bodies, according to Oklahoma State Archaeologist Kary Stackelbeck. The 1921 massacre occurred when a white mob descended on the Black section of Tulsa ‚Äì Greenwood ‚Äì and burned more than 1,000 homes, looted hundreds of others and destroyed its thriving business district. Most historians who have studied the event estimate the death toll to be between 75 and 300. The remains that have been found will be transferred for examinations led by forensic anthropologist Phoebe Stubblefield. Both Stackelbeck and Tulsa Mass Graves Investigation Public Oversight Committee Chairman Kavin Ross said it‚Äôs possible the remains are from people who died from other things, such as the Spanish flu pandemic that killed an estimated 7,350 in Oklahoma in 1918 and 1919. The search began last year, and researchers in October found at least 12 sets of remains, although the remains were covered back up at that time for further study. Stackelbeck has estimated more than 30 bodies could be in the site. Searches of two other sites are planned.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Nearly six months after a Republican legislator let violent, far-right protesters into the state Capitol, a special committee will examine his role and could recommend he be the first member of the House to be expelled in its 160-year history. Ahead of the panel‚Äôs inaugural meeting Monday afternoon, more than 200 people sent written testimony. Some excoriated Rep. Mike Nearman as a seditionist. Others praised him for letting people into the Capitol on Dec. 21, 2020, when it was closed to the public because of coronavirus safety protocols, saying people should be allowed to attend even though hearings are livestreamed on video. ‚ÄúMike Nearman‚Äôs behavior ‚Ä¶ was abhorrent and anti-democratic,‚Äù David Alba wrote to the committee. ‚ÄúFurthermore, by aiding and supporting extremists, he has placed people‚Äôs lives in danger. He should be removed from office and he is not fit to represent my district.‚Äù After video emerged in local news reports Friday showing Nearman choreographing how he would let protesters into the Capitol, pinpointing the door he would open for them and disclosing his cellphone number so protesters could text him, every other Republican member of the House on Monday strongly recommended he step down.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: An ambitious Republican proposal to revamp state election law was unveiled Thursday ‚Äì a 149-page bill that would change deadlines, adopt new rules for early voting, alter mail-in ballot procedures and mandate IDs for all in-person voters. The measure produced by State Government Committee Chairman Seth Grove is likely to encounter severe pushback from Democrats in a state where both parties are competitive in statewide races. Although Pennsylvania‚Äôs closely watched 2020 election was carried out smoothly, many Republicans have called for election-law changes in the wake of former President Donald Trump‚Äôs baseless claims of widespread voting fraud. ‚ÄúThis is not a view of the Republicans or the Democrats,‚Äù said Grove, R-York, whose committee conducted hearings on the topic this spring. ‚ÄúThis is a view of what we heard through 10 extensive hearings from all sides.‚Äù The bill was introduced by Grove and House Republican leaders with just three weeks left before lawmakers are due to wrap up business and head home for the summer. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf‚Äôs press secretary, Lyndsay Kensinger, said the bill aimed to install new barriers against voting, in effect silencing people‚Äôs voices and turning ballot access into a political weapon.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A trip to the beach this weekend could come with immunity benefits. The state Department of Environmental Management and the state Department of Health are partnering to host a free COVID-19 vaccination clinic at Misquamicut State Beach in Westerly starting at 11 a.m. Saturday, officials said in a statement. The clinic ‚Äì which will offer the one shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine ‚Äì is open to beach employees and visitors, and state residents and nonresidents alike are eligible. People getting a shot must be 18 or older. The vaccine is free, but normal parking fees will still apply, officials said. There are just 37 people in Rhode Island‚Äôs hospitals with confirmed cases of the coronavirus, according to the latest data released Thursday by the Department of Health ‚Äì the lowest single-day total since the early days of the pandemic in March 2020. Of those patients, five are in intensive care and on ventilators. The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the state peaked at more than 500 in December. Rhode Island also reported about 40 newly confirmed cases, for a daily positivity rate of 0.7%, and no new virus-related deaths. Nearly 585,000 people in the state have now been fully vaccinated against the disease, according to agency data.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a law requiring sex offenders to register for life, without prior judicial review, is unconstitutional. In a unanimous ruling, justices wrote that the ‚Äúrequirement that sex offenders must register for life without any opportunity for judicial review violates due process because it is arbitrary and cannot be deemed rationally related to the General Assembly‚Äôs stated purpose of protecting the public from those with a high risk of re-offending.‚Äù Justices set a 12-month timeline to implement the ruling, to give state lawmakers time to ‚Äúcorrect the deficiency in the statute regarding judicial review.‚Äù The case stems from a lawsuit originally brought by Dennis Powell, who was arrested in 2008 for criminal solicitation of a minor after authorities said he had graphic online conversations with someone who he thought was a 12-year-old girl but who was actually an undercover officer. After pleading guilty, Powell was sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to register as a sex offender, which South Carolina‚Äôs statute mandates as a lifelong situation. South Carolina‚Äôs sex offender statute requires biannual registration in person at a sheriff‚Äôs office but provides for no periodic review by a judge, a situation the court called ‚Äúthe most stringent in the country.‚Äù\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The union that had threatened a strike at a Smithfield pork processing plant says it has reached a tentative agreement with the company on a four-year contract. The Sioux Falls chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers had negotiated with Virginia-based Smithfield Foods for two days after union members rejected a previous contract proposal and authorized a strike. Union leaders said its members will vote on the proposed contract next week. The agreement appeared to assuage the possibility of a strike at the plant, which produces nearly 5% of the nation‚Äôs pork every day. UFCW said in a statement late Wednesday that the company dropped plans to take away a 15-minute break, and ‚Äúthe parties have reached an agreement on wages.‚Äù The union had pressed for Smithfield to boost pay from a proposed base wage of $18 an hour, as well as to keep a break during the second half of worker shifts. Smithfield has said that its initial proposal would have still ensured two 15-minute breaks for employees who work eight-hour shifts and that the company‚Äôs offer was ‚Äúin full alignment‚Äù with agreements that the UFCW accepted at other locations.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: A former governor‚Äôs administration helped fund a contract murder of a key federal witness decades ago while embroiled in the state‚Äôs largest political scandal, law enforcement officials announced Wednesday. The new details revealed for the first time Wednesday have elements that ring of a movie: a trusted ally of union boss Jimmy Hoffa gunned down after testifying about a corrupt governor selling prison pardons and a gunman who donned a wig and blackface to throw authorities off the scent. Investigators in Hamilton County have been chipping away at the 42-year-old cold case of Samuel Pettyjohn since they renewed their investigation in 2015. No new charges will be filed because all of the major players involved are now dead, but authorities say closing the case provides closure to one aspect of a complicated piece of Tennessee history. Pettyjohn, a Chattanooga businessman and close friend of Hoffa, was fatally shot in 1979 in downtown Chattanooga after testifying before a federal grand jury during the early phases of Tennessee‚Äôs notorious ‚Äúcash-for-clemency‚Äù scandal. The scandal ultimately led to the ousting of Democratic Gov. Ray Blanton, who was never indicted, but three of his aides were. However, questions have lingered about the extent to which the governor‚Äôs administration actively worked to thwart the investigation. Officials say at least five witnesses in the case were murdered or killed themselves.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The El Paso Museum of Archaeology will reopen June 24, city officials announced Wednesday. The COVID-19 pandemic forced the museum to close in March 2020, but under the advisement of the Department of Public Health and the Office of Emergency Management, visitors will once again be able to learn about the Indigenous history along the Rio Grande Valley. ‚ÄúThe reopening of the Museum of Archaeology along with the opening of the Camp Cohen Water Park are great illustrators of our commitment to enhancing the quality of life in Northeast El Paso and for all El Pasoans,‚Äù said Cultural Affairs and Recreation Managing Director Ben Fyffe. The museum will be open with free admission from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thursday through Saturday. Upon opening, visitors can experience the exhibit ‚ÄúFrom the Edge of Center: The Chacoan Outliers.‚Äù The museum will showcase many artifacts from its permanent collection, as well as artifacts on loan from the Salmon Ruins near Farmington, New Mexico, and the San Juan County Museum Association. The El Paso Museum of Archaeology highlights 14,000 years of prehistory in the area, the greater Southwest and northern Mexico. The museum also features nature trails on 15 acres of land and an American Indian Garden.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state‚Äôs congressional delegation on Wednesday requested a meeting with President Joe Biden before he makes his final decision on whether the boundaries of two sprawling national monuments in Utah should be restored. The delegation of Republicans sent a letter to Biden in which they also requested that Interior Secretary Deb Haaland‚Äôs full report be made available to Congress. ‚ÄúIt is past time to end the political back-and-forth that the communities in our state have been subjected to for more than 25 years, and you have a historic opportunity to do so by working with Congress,‚Äù the letter said. Haaland made her recommendation about whether to reverse former President Donald Trump‚Äôs decision to downsize Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante last week, but details of her decision were not released. The Interior Department gave her report to Biden on June 2, according to a court filing Thursday in a legal battle that began more than three years ago after Trump‚Äôs decision. U.S. Department of Justice attorneys mentioned the report as part of a request to have until July 13 to address the judge‚Äôs question about whether the legal battle has become a moot point.\n\nVermont\n\nMarlboro: The ongoing ownership dispute over the former Marlboro College campus has prompted the organizers of a music festival to offer to front the costs of campus maintenance this summer. The Marlboro School of Music asked a court Wednesday to allow it to temporarily pay for campus upkeep so that its annual music festival, which is held there over 10 weeks, can move forward, the Brattleboro Reformer reports. Marlboro College merged with Emerson College in Massachusetts and finalized the sale of its campus in July 2020 to a nonprofit group, Democracy Builders. But there is now a dispute about whether Democracy Builders owns the campus or whether another group, Type I Civilization Academy, holds the deed. A judge for Windham Superior Court ruled that the music school may place its $250,000 rent payment in escrow. The estimated maintenance costs could be $1 million, the newspaper reports. In court, the parties agreed to review the maintenance expenses paid by the School of Music at the end of the summer and then determine what should happen to the escrowed rent and what expenses might need to be reimbursed to the music school by the rightful owner, whoever that might be.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A city engineer who fatally shot 12 people in a Virginia Beach municipal building in 2019 ‚Äúwas motivated by perceived workplace grievances‚Äù that ‚Äúhe fixated on for years,‚Äù according to findings released by the FBI on Wednesday. The investigation, conducted by the FBI‚Äôs Behavioral Analysis Unit, found that DeWayne Craddock ‚Äústruggled with how he perceived his own work performance and how others at work viewed him.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe shooter‚Äôs inflated sense of self-importance contributed to this conflict and led him to believe he was unjustly and repeatedly criticized and slighted,‚Äù the FBI said in a news release. ‚ÄúViolence was viewed by the shooter as a way to reconcile this conflict and restore his perverted view of justice.‚Äù But the FBI cautioned that no person or group was in a position to ‚Äúsee the confluence of behaviors that may have forewarned the attack‚Äù because Craddock had purposely isolated himself and disengaged from his relationships. The agency also said that Craddock suffered from significant mental health stressors, although they ‚Äúalone cannot explain the Virginia Beach attack.‚Äù The FBI‚Äôs findings appear to go a step further than two previous investigations into the mass shooting in the coastal city of nearly half a million people. Virginia Beach police said in March that they could not determine a motive.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A pet dog who vanished for two days after being ejected from a vehicle during a car accident has been found apparently doing the job it was bred to do ‚Äì herding sheep. Linda Oswald‚Äôs family and their dog, Tilly, were driving along Idaho State Highway 41 on Sunday when they crashed into another car, launching the dog through the rear window, The Spokesman-Review reports. The unharmed but stunned dog then ran away, prompting an immediate search with at least six complete strangers who witnessed the crash and pulled over along the highway to help, Oswald said. ‚ÄúPeople just kept going out,‚Äù she said, noting that the search lasted about 10 hours Sunday before the family went home. ‚ÄúWe were sore and exhausted.‚Äù Oswald said the family then wrote a Facebook post that included a picture of the 2-year-old border collie and red heeler mix, and more than 3,000 people shared the post. That‚Äôs when Tyler, Travis and Zane Potter recognized the dog in the photo as the same dog they saw on their family farm south of Rathdrum on Tuesday. Both the Potters and Oswald think Tilly was drawn to the farm and their sheep. ‚ÄúI think that dog was trying to herd,‚Äù Travis Potter said. Oswald said if it weren‚Äôt for the post, he would still be out there.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Two newly dedicated state offices will deal with child welfare and family assistance. The state is creating a Bureau for Social Services and a Bureau for Family Assistance and Supports to streamline its handling of child welfare, The Herald-Dispatch of Huntington reports. Their staff will continue operating under the Department of Health and Human Resources. Both bureaus will be tailored to their mission, and the changes will take place in July. They were previously within the Bureau for Children and Families. Cammie Chapman, counsel for the Department of Health and Human Resources, detailed the changes to a legislative commission Tuesday.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Jim Doyle and Scott Walker don‚Äôt agree on much, but the former governors are joining together to call for people to get COVID-19 vaccines in a new public service television advertisement. The spot released Thursday, produced by UW Health, features Walker, a Republican, placing a Zoom call to Doyle, a Democrat. Both are in their personal offices and never appear in the same room together. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just ready to be done with this pandemic,‚Äù Walker says. Doyle responds: ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt agree with you more.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought,‚Äù Walker says. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs another thought: Let‚Äôs do a commercial together ‚Äì reminding people in Wisconsin how important it is to be vaccinated.‚Äù Doyle quips: ‚ÄúThat may be the best idea you‚Äôve ever had.‚Äù Both Walker and Doyle have been vaccinated. Both governors said in statements that they hoped the ad would encourage everyone to get vaccinated to enjoy the summer and return to a more normal life. ‚ÄúIt just makes sense,‚Äù Walker said Thursday on Twitter in response to a post about the ad. A third former governor, current interim University of Wisconsin System President Tommy Thompson, wielded a sledgehammer in a series of videos last year urging people to ‚Äúsmash COVID.‚Äù\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Gov. Mark Gordon has announced that up to $12 million of the remaining $67 million of coronavirus relief money sent to the state will be allocated toward oil and gas projects through the Energy Rebound Program. The Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission will accept applications for funding from June 15 through June 25, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The Energy Rebound Program, which was launched in November, was created to boost the state‚Äôs oil and gas industry as it recovers from an economic decline by using federal aid as an incentive to push efforts to create jobs and stimulate the economy in Wyoming instead of in other states. ‚ÄúThis is about trying to keep jobs in Wyoming,‚Äù Petroleum Association of Wyoming spokesman Ryan McConnaughey said, noting that projects will still need large investments because of a $500,000 cap on each project of the $12 million. The program was initially allocated $15 million from the federal government, but Gordon doubled the amount ‚Äì all of which was awarded, governor‚Äôs office spokesman Michael Pearlman said. The Wyoming Business Council estimated that the last round of program projects will receive more than $150 million in oil and natural gas in 2021.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/18/cash-tower-leak-underwater-plaque-library-union-news-around-states/50247181/", "title": "Cash tower leak, underwater plaque: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nThomasville: The whole town celebrated in 2020 when, early in the coronavirus pandemic, Thomasville Regional Medical Center opened, offering state-of-the-art medicine that was previously unavailable in a poor, isolated part of the state. The timing for the ribbon-cutting seemed perfect: New treatment options would be available in an underserved area just as a global health crisis was unfolding. In the end, that same timing may be the reason for the hospital‚Äôs undoing. Now deep in the red two years into the pandemic, the 29-bed, $40 million hospital with a soaring, sun-drenched lobby and 110 employees is among three medical centers in the United States that say they are missing out on millions in federal pandemic relief money because the facilities are so new they lack full financial statements from before the crisis to prove how much it cost them. In Thomasville, located in timber country about 95 miles north of Mobile, hospital officials have worked more than a year to convince federal officials they should have gotten $8.2 million through the CARES Act, not just the $1 million they received. With a total debt of $35 million, the quest gets more urgent each day, said Curtis James, the chief executive officer. ‚ÄúNo hospital can sustain itself without getting the CARES Act money that everybody else got,‚Äù James said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state court judge has said a majority of members on the board tasked with redrawing Alaska‚Äôs political boundaries appeared to have adopted a map that splits the Eagle River area into two Senate districts for ‚Äúpolitical reasons,‚Äù and he ordered a new map to be used this year. Superior Court Judge Thomas Matthews in a decision made public late Monday ordered the Alaska Redistricting Board to adopt on an interim basis a map that in part pairs the Eagle River area House districts into a Senate district. The decision comes in a second round of redistricting challenges. The map that the judge ordered be adopted was the other option the board had considered when weighing a revised map. Matthews said he expected a quick review of his decision by the Alaska Supreme Court. The candidate filing deadline for the August primary is June 1. The Alaska Supreme Court in March found constitutional issues with elements of a map drawn by the board last fall. In one of the instances, the court ruled that a state Senate district pairing part of east Anchorage and the Eagle River area constituted an ‚Äúunconstitutional political gerrymander.‚Äù\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state Senate on Monday opened an ethics investigation into a firebrand Republican member who tweeted inflammatory comments about last weekend‚Äôs racist attack at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket that left 10 people dead. The referral of Sen. Wendy Rogers of Flagstaff to the Ethics Committee was in lieu of the immediate expulsion that Democratic lawmakers were planning, GOP Majority Leader Rick Gray said. Due process considerations require no less than an ethics investigation, he said. But Democrats were furious, noting that Rogers was just censured in March for a repeated series of tweets and statements that embraced white nationalism and called for violence. On Saturday, as news came out of the mass shooting by a white suspect who had posted a racist screed on the internet and driven about 200 miles to a primarily Black neighborhood in Buffalo, Rogers tweeted: ‚ÄúFed boy summer has started in Buffalo.‚Äù Many in both parties took that tweet to mean that Rogers was blaming the attack on the federal government, especially in light of Rogers‚Äô history of embracing conspiracy theories and posting of racist tropes. GOP Senate leaders tried to get in front of the controversy Monday, putting out a statement condemning the violence and ‚Äúall hate speech that has served as an inspiration for these kinds of heinous crimes.‚Äù\n\nArkansas\n\nKingsland: The silhouette of ‚ÄúThe Man in Black‚Äù is painted on the side of the town‚Äôs water tower. But someone shot the painting of Johnny Cash just to watch it leak. The tower was still leaking the town‚Äôs drinking water Tuesday. The gunshot hit the image of the iconic country singer in the crotch. The water tower in Kingsland, a small town of 400 about an hour south of Little Rock, features a mural of country music legend Johnny Cash, according to the Cleveland County Herald. The shooter fired the shot May 11, and repairs continued this week. The town had just spent $300,000 on the water tower. Cash was born in 1932 in Kingsland. The Cleveland County Sheriff‚Äôs Department is investigating the case of vandalism. Anyone with information can call the sheriff at 870-325-6222.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Homelessness increased nearly 9% in the San Francisco Bay Area over the past three years, despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent to keep people off the streets during the coronavirus pandemic, preliminary numbers released Monday show. San Francisco proper appeared to be the one bright spot, seeing homelessness decline slightly. Alameda County, which includes the city of Oakland, reported a 22% increase in this year‚Äôs point-in-time survey, while neighboring Contra Costa County saw a 35% jump in people spotted living in shelters, vehicles or outdoors. The largest county in the region, Santa Clara, reported a 3% increase from 2019, including an 11% increase in the city of San Jose. San Francisco reported a 3.5% decline to nearly 7,800 homeless residents, which housing advocates chalked up in part to a wealth tax approved by voters in 2018. In total, seven of the Bay Area‚Äôs nine counties reported counting more than 35,000 people experiencing homelessness in late February. The count is required every other year by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and helps determine funding. San Mateo and Solano counties did not report preliminary numbers Monday. Housing advocates said increases across the region would have been worse without strong and speedy intervention from the state and local government.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The partner of an embattled former police chief in suburban Denver is accused of falsely reporting that a vocal opponent of the chief was sexually abusing her son, authorities alleged in court documents filed Monday. Robin Niceta, a county social worker at the time, allegedly made an anonymous call to a child abuse hotline Jan. 28 alleging that she saw Aurora City Councilmember Danielle Jurinsky inappropriately touching Jurinsky‚Äôs son, an affidavit for an arrest warrant for Niceta said. The call came a day after Jurinsky called for police Chief Vanessa Wilson to resign, saying on a talk radio show that Wilson was ‚Äútrash.‚Äù An investigation cleared Jurinsky of any wrongdoing, and she told investigators she thought the tip was retaliation for her comments about Wilson. According to an affidavit seeking Niceta‚Äôs arrest, the call came from Niceta‚Äôs personal cellphone on file with the county, and a search of her laptop showed a search for the hotline number and Jurinsky‚Äôs address just before the call was made. Niceta denied making the call. She said Wilson and her two children also had access to her phone, though she said her children would not have called. When pressed about who could have called, Niceta said that ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt me,‚Äù the affidavit said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Britain: A fire official has been fired and seven other firefighters have been disciplined following an investigation into drug use at firehouses around the city, the mayor said. The investigation began after the apparent drug-related death of a 36-year-old off-duty firefighter in his home in January. A lieutenant in the department was fired in February after an investigation showed he was ‚Äúknowingly supplying, giving, selling, sharing and using illegal drugs and (his) prescription Adderall pills,‚Äù according to a termination letter from Mayor Erin Stewart that was first obtained by The Hartford Courant. The other seven, including four with the rank of lieutenant or above, have been required to take 30 days of unpaid leave, demoted to the rank of private and placed on probation for three years, during which time they cannot seek promotion and will be subject to random drug testing, according to the mayor‚Äôs office. The drugs involved include prescription Adderall as well as fentanyl, heroin and marijuana, Stewart said. A criminal investigation is ongoing, but no charges have been filed. Several other firefighters have resigned since January‚Äôs death. The results of toxicology tests were pending, but officials have said it was an apparent drug overdose.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A judge has refused to dismiss a criminal charge accusing the embattled state auditor of deliberately breaking up payments for a contract into which she entered with a former campaign consultant in order to avoid compliance with state procurement law. In a ruling dated Friday, Superior Court Judge William Carpenter Jr. ruled that an indictment against Kathleen McGuiness sufficiently alleged that she willfully fragmented or structured the payments to circumvent the state procurement code. Defense attorney Steve Wood argued that the indictment failed to charge an offense or provide fair notice of what McGuiness needed to defend against. He also argued that the indictment failed to allege that she structured two or more no-bid contracts and that it didn‚Äôt specify which section of the procurement code or state Budget and Accounting Policy Manual she intended to violate. McGuiness, a Democrat who was elected in 2018 and is responsible for rooting out government fraud, waste and abuse, was indicted in October on felony counts of theft and witness intimidation, as well as misdemeanor charges of official misconduct, conflict of interest and noncompliance with procurement laws. A trial is scheduled to start later this month. McGuiness has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Karine Jean-Pierre held her first briefing as the new White House press secretary Monday, crediting ‚Äúbarrier-breaking people‚Äù who came before her for making it possible for a Black, gay, immigrant woman like herself to rise to one of the most high-profile jobs in American government. ‚ÄúI stand on their shoulders. If it were not for generations of barrier-breaking people before me, I would not be here,‚Äù Jean-Pierre said. ‚ÄúBut I benefit from their sacrifices. I have learned from their excellence, and I am forever grateful to them.‚Äù President Joe Biden entrusted Jean-Pierre, 47, with the responsibility of being his chief spokesperson earlier this month. Jen Psaki, who had held the job since the start of the administration, stepped down last Friday. Jean-Pierre, the daughter of Haitian immigrants, is the first Black woman and the first openly LGBTQ person to serve as White House press secretary. She had been the principal deputy press secretary and led the briefing on several occasions, making history in May 2021 when she first subbed for Psaki. She also held regular off-camera ‚Äúgaggles‚Äù with the much smaller group of reporters who travel aboard Air Force One with the president.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey Largo: The 20th anniversary of the storied intentional sinking of a former Naval ship to become an artificial reef in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary was celebrated Tuesday. The 510-foot-long Spiegel Grove earned international notoriety when it sank prematurely May 17, 2002, and landed with its upside-down bow protruding above the ocean‚Äôs surface about 6 miles off Key Largo. A massive remediation effort began, resulting in the former Landing Ship Dock being fully sunk on its starboard side June 10, 2002. Three years later, strong currents and waves generated from Hurricane Dennis when it was east of Cuba pushed the ship into the intended upright position on the ocean bottom about 130 feet below the surface. ‚ÄúUltimately, the Spiegel Grove is a story that Hollywood would never have been able to script in a million years,‚Äù said Rob Bleser, a Key Largo dive operator and the vessel‚Äôs sinking project manager. Bleser and other key individuals planned to gather Tuesday evening at a local cultural center for a reception and panel discussion on the fascinating events surrounding the ship. On Sunday, divers affixed a commemorative plaque to the Spiegel Grove, sponsored by a group of Navy veterans who had served on it, recognizing the multimillion-dollar project‚Äôs supporters, as well as military personnel who were stationed on the ship commissioned in 1956.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Several Black students who were suspended for trying to protest Confederate flag displays at their school have filed a federal lawsuit against the school district and its board members, accusing them of allowing an extensive pattern of racism including ‚Äúovert bigotry and animosity by some white students and teachers against African American students.‚Äù The students, joined by their mothers as plaintiffs, already made news when their protest at Coosa High School was stifled last fall. Now, in their lawsuit filed Tuesday against the Floyd County school district and its board members, they allege an extensive pattern of racism, including white students reenacting the murder of George Floyd and posting it on social media, as well as a student who carried what appeared to be a whip and told a Black student, ‚ÄúWe used to whip you.‚Äù They also allege unfair punishment: Students are banned from wearing Black Lives Matter shirts, but Confederate flag apparel is acceptable under the school‚Äôs dress code, the lawsuit says. The suit faults administrators for ‚Äúdeliberate indifference to acts of racial animosity toward black students perpetrated by white students and teachers; as well as the school‚Äôs viewpoint discrimination in its dress code and the inconsistent administration of disciplinary policies to the detriment of Black students.‚Äù\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state is on course to receive $14 million in federal funding to help protect endangered forest birds and other species, officials said Monday. U.S. Rep. Ed Case, D-Hawaii, said the funding will help the state fight mosquitoes that threaten birds found nowhere else in the world. There are an estimated 45 akikiki left on Kauai and 135 kiwikiu remaining on Maui, said Lainie Berry, the wildlife program manager for the state Department of Land and Natural Resources. ‚ÄúThis tremendous level of additional federal dollars will go a long way toward supplementing and increasing earnest efforts already in place to save these species, as well as the akekee and akohekohe, whose wild population numbers are slightly higher,‚Äù Berry said. Avian malaria carried by mosquitoes is wiping out Hawaii‚Äôs forest birds. Neither the disease nor the mosquitoes that carry them are native to Hawaii. An April report from federal and state conservation officials concluded the birds have grim prospects without intervention. There are fewer of these birds compared to the past two decades and even years. Their available range has been significantly reduced as species move higher into the mountains to escape mosquitoes.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A hospital that went on lockdown in March after far-right activists protested outside is suing Ammon Bundy, Diego Rodriguez and their various political organizations for defamation and ‚Äúsustained online attacks.‚Äù St. Luke‚Äôs Health System filed the lawsuit Wednesday against Bundy, his gubernatorial campaign and his People‚Äôs Rights Network organization. The hospital system is also suing Rodriguez ‚Äì the grandfather of the child involved in the protection case ‚Äì as well as Rodriguez‚Äôs website Freedom Man Press and the Freedom Man political action committee. Rodriguez is an associate of Bundy who has been active in Bundy‚Äôs political campaign. The child protection case involved a 10-month-old baby who was temporarily removed from family custody in March after officials determined the infant was ‚Äúsuffering from severe malnourishment‚Äù and at risk of injury or death, the Meridian Police Department said at the time. The baby‚Äôs parents had refused to let officers check on the child‚Äôs welfare after the family canceled a medical appointment, the police statement said. Bundy, well-known for participating in armed standoffs with law enforcement, was arrested the following day on a misdemeanor trespassing charge after he protested at a different hospital where he believed the baby was being treated. He also asked his followers to protest at the hospital and the homes of child protection service workers, law enforcement officers and others involved in the child protection case.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Three women who were found dead at a senior living facility on Chicago‚Äôs North Side amid high heat have been identified, the Cook County Medical Examiner‚Äôs Office said Monday. The women found dead Saturday were 76-year-old Delores McNeely, 72-year-old Gwendolyn Osborne and 68-year-old Janice Reed, the office said. All three women were found unresponsive over a 12-hour span at the James Sneider Apartments, where residents started complaining of oppressively hot conditions days earlier. Alderwoman Maria Hadden said she believes a lack of air conditioning in the building likely caused the deaths. Paul Roldan, the president and chief executive of the Hispanic Housing Development Corporation, said his team was ‚Äúdeeply saddened‚Äù by the news of the deaths. ‚ÄúThe safety and security of our residents has always been our highest priority at HHDC,‚Äù Roldan said. Hadden said she went to the building Thursday and learned no one had air conditioning. She said a facilities manager told her the company was still running heat to avoid potentially being cited by the city for shutting it off too early. A city ordinance requires rental properties to be at least 68 degrees during overnight hours between Sept. 15 and June 1.\n\nIndiana\n\nPalmyra: Two men were fatally shot after a police officer and two good Samaritans stopped along a southern Indiana highway to help a driver who was stopped in the roadway, police said. The shooting happened Monday night after an officer with the Palmyra Police Department stopped to assist the ‚Äúapparent stranded motorist‚Äù on State Road 135, Indiana State Police said, but they didn‚Äôt say what precipitated the gunfire or who fired the shots. As the officer arrived, two good Samaritans also stopped in a pickup truck to help, but ‚Äúwithin seconds of exiting their cars, shots were fired‚Äù at the scene just south of Palmyra, about 20 miles northwest of Louisville, Kentucky, police said in a statement. State police did not provide additional details, saying in the news release that investigators have not said how many weapons were involved, how many shots were fired or who fired them. The shooting killed the SUV‚Äôs driver, 31-year-old Justin Moore of Owensboro, Kentucky, and one of the good Samaritans, 24-year-old Jacob Tyler McClanahan, of Corydon, Indiana, police said. Autopsies were scheduled for Wednesday, according to Indiana State Police, who were investigating at the request of Harrison County authorities.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Elaine Bohling, of Creston, earned the title Iowan of the Day in 2015 for her volunteer work. Ralph Hodson, of Ackworth, never missed a fair since 1947, but it was his volunteer work that earned him the honor in 2018. Even former Gov. Robert Ray earned the honor ‚Äì a first for an elected official ‚Äì in 2014. With less than 100 days until the Fairgrounds open for the Iowa State Fair, the Blue Ribbon Foundation and Cookies Food Products are ready to find a new group of Iowans to select for the honor. The tradition, now in its 25th year, honors Iowans with a ‚Äústrong work ethic, loyalty to helping others, and an exceptional sense of Iowa pride.‚Äù The Iowa State Fair Blue Ribbon Foundation founded the Iowan of the Day in 1997 to celebrate the dedication residents have for their communities all over the state. Every year, the foundation selects 10 Iowans, who are celebrated on 10 out of 11 days of the State Fair. Anyone can nominate someone to become Iowan of the Day by going to blueribbonfoundation.org/IOTD for the nomination form before July 1. Nominations must come with references attesting to the nominee‚Äôs efforts along with supplementary materials to showcase the nominee‚Äôs awards, photos, articles or documents that showcase their work. Even letters of recommendation can be part of the nomination.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: In a historic first, lawyers faced off before the Kansas Supreme Court on Monday over the constitutionality of a set of GOP-authored congressional maps struck down by a lower court judge last month. It was unclear from the arguments which way the justices are set to rule on the matter, which marks the first time they have been asked to adjudicate whether the Kansas Constitution can be interpreted to apply to redistricting. Attorneys defending the maps argued politically slanted lines were an inherent part of allowing legislators to handle redistricting, though this perspective earned pushback from some members of the high court. Meanwhile, lawyers representing three sets of challengers to the maps‚Äô allowability argued they were produced from a clear intent to hamstring certain racial and political groups, clashing with one of the court‚Äôs conservative judges in the process. At issue is whether the district lines illicitly divide the Kansas City, Kansas, area or improperly place Lawrence in the sweeping 1st Congressional District dominated by western Kansas. The maps were enacted by the Legislature over the veto of Gov. Laura Kelly but were later struck down when Wyandotte County District Court Judge Bill Klapper ruled the maps to be racial and partisan gerrymandering in an April ruling.\n\nKentucky\n\nPineville: The U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration has cited the owners of an eastern Kentucky surface mine where a worker was killed by a falling tree, according to a published report. Nally & Hamilton Enterprises was cited for not following a plan that required removing trees on top of the mine‚Äôs high wall and for failing to identify, report and correct a hazardous situation, the federal agency said, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. A tree fell from the high wall above the roadway at the Bell County mine in January and struck a vehicle with two workers as it passed. One worker died, and another was seriously injured. The federal agency said Nally & Hamilton did not make sure that trees were cleared a safe distance from the edge of the top of the high wall. In addition, inspections for possible hazardous conditions at the mine were inadequate and contributed to the accident, the mine safety agency concluded. Weather conditions also likely played a role, with heavy precipitation and cycles of freezing and thawing that caused conditions which loosened support for the tree, the report said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Now is the time to head off a COVID-19 surge like the one that swamped area hospitals last summer, the head of the New Orleans Health Department said Tuesday. Case counts average 155 a day, five times higher than a month ago, and wastewater tests show increased coronavirus concentrations in both residential and tourist areas, Dr. Jennifer Avegno said. She noted that many people use home tests, so the case count ‚Äúis a big underrepresentation.‚Äù She asked residents and visitors to mask up in indoor public spaces, get tested if they have been exposed to someone with the disease and get treated if appropriate. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not surprised at a summer surge. This is the third year in a row,‚Äù Avegno said in a livestreamed news conference. ‚ÄúBut none of us want to have the surge we did last year‚Äù from the delta variant of the coronavirus. She said the city is not ordering masks and noted that many residents followed previous recommendations. ‚ÄúShort-term but widespread indoor masking can return to not needing masks much quicker,‚Äù she said. Wastewater testing for coronavirus concentration, new since last summer, let the city ‚Äúsee this coming and predict the rise in cases and mobilize resources more quickly than we have in the past,‚Äù Avegno said.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: Attorney General Aaron Frey said the state is preparing for a lawsuit against manufacturers of so-called forever chemicals. Frey said at the Democratic State Convention last weekend that steps are being taken to ‚Äúhold these chemical manufacturers to account.‚Äù He said an announcement could be made within weeks. The Bangor Daily News reports that the attorney general is enlisting outside counsel to assist his office. In September, the state asked law firms to submit proposals for the work. The last time that happened was during negotiations on the multistate tobacco settlement of 1998, Frey said. The lawsuit is expected to target manufacturers of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and similar chemicals that have been used in a variety of products. PFAS-contaminated soil has been found in several locations around the state. Gov. Janet Mills and lawmakers set aside $60 million of a $1.2 billion spending package this year for PFAS relief.\n\nMaryland\n\nSnow Hill: The Black-Eyed Susan riverboat will undergo partial repairs. Town Council members voted 2-1 in favor of committing to repairs that would allow the stern-wheel paddleboat to stay in service at a reduced capacity while officials seek additional funding for a full restoration. The move will preserve the boat‚Äôs purpose ‚Äúas a tourist attraction and economic driver for the Lower Eastern Shore,‚Äù according to a news release from Town Manager Rick Pollitt. Snow Hill purchased the riverboat in 2020 using a combination of grant money and loans from the county and state. The Black-Eyed Susan was then in the fourth year of a five-year mandated U.S. Coast Guard inspection routine, the release said. Voyages started in August 2021 with Washington‚Äôs Inc. as the operator responsible for catered cruises along the Pocomoke River. The Black-Eyed Susan was then taken in February to Colonna‚Äôs Shipyard in Norfolk for an extensive inspection that revealed multiple issues with the hull, hydraulics system and paddlewheel frame, according to the release. Repairs were estimated at more than $600,000, a price tag outside the town budgetary means. Consultation with legal counsel determined it would also be expensive for the town to try to sell the Black-Eyed Susan on the open market.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state has agreed to pay $56 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by the families of veterans who died or became sick after contracting COVID-19 at a state-run veterans‚Äô care center during one of the deadliest outbreaks at a long-term care facility in the U.S., officials said Thursday. The families of 84 veterans who died during the outbreak at the Holyoke Soldiers‚Äô Home will receive a minimum of $400,000 each, while 84 veterans who contracted the disease and survived will receive a minimum of $10,000 under terms of the settlement that requires a federal judge‚Äôs approval. ‚ÄúThe suit contends that what happened at the Soldiers‚Äô Home was so severe that it rose to the level of a deprivation of the veterans‚Äô constitutional rights to be free from harms recklessly created by the government,‚Äù Tom Lesser, one of the families‚Äô attorneys, said in a statement. ‚ÄúNo amount of money can bring back the veterans who died or erase the pain and suffering that this tragedy needlessly caused those veterans and their families, but justice required that those wrongs not go unaddressed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis settlement recognizes that the tragedy was preventable and never should have happened.‚Äù\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A judge on Tuesday suspended the state‚Äôs dormant, decades-old ban on abortion, which means the procedure would not be illegal in Michigan even if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its historic Roe v. Wade decision. The Michigan law, which makes it a crime to assist in an abortion, has been on the books since 1931. But it has had no practical effect since the Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide in 1973. The court, however, could throw out that landmark ruling before July, leaving abortion issues for each state to decide. Court of Claims Judge Elizabeth Gleicher granted a preliminary injunction sought by Planned Parenthood of Michigan, saying the abortion ban likely violates the state constitution. ‚ÄúAfter 50 years of legal abortion in Michigan, there can be no doubt but that the right of personal autonomy and bodily integrity enjoyed by our citizens includes the right of a woman, in consultation with her physician, to terminate a pregnancy,‚Äù the judge said. ‚ÄúFrom a constitutional standpoint, the right to obtain a safe medical treatment is indistinguishable from the right of a patient to refuse treatment.‚Äù Gleicher said other Michigan laws regulating abortion will remain in full effect.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Former broadcaster Cory Hepola, who‚Äôs running for governor with the upstart Forward Party of Minnesota, named school administrator Tamara Uselman as his running mate Tuesday. Uselman, who lives in Pelican Rapids, is director of equity and inclusion for Fargo Public Schools in North Dakota. Before that, she was assistant superintendent for Moorhead Public Schools in Minnesota. She has also been superintendent of Bismarck Public Schools in North Dakota and superintendent of Perham-Dent Public Schools in Minnesota. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty passionate about creating an education system that is ready to deliver what kids need today,‚Äù Uselman said at a news conference. ‚ÄúI also believe strongly that taxpayers deserve an academic return on their investment for education.‚Äù Hepola said he will unveil an education platform next month that will include ‚Äústreaming schooling‚Äù as an option so kids, no matter where they live, can choose to focus on things like science, technology, engineering, mathematics or language arts. He said it would be in addition to in-person classes, not like the distance learning that schools used earlier in the pandemic. Democrats have criticized Hepola as a spoiler because of the chance he could peel away votes from incumbent Gov. Tim Walz in what‚Äôs expected to be a close election.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Nearly 45 million gallons of untreated wastewater were released into the environment over a four-month period due to sewer failures in Jackson, according to the latest quarterly report the city submitted to federal regulators. The report, required under Jackson‚Äôs sewer consent decree, covers the period from Dec. 1 through March 21, WLBT-TV reports. It was submitted April 30. During the reporting period, 259 sewer overflows were reported in Jackson, which released more than 44.7 million gallons of sewage into the environment. An estimated 33.9 million gallons went into waters classified as ‚ÄúWaters of the U.S.‚Äù Under terms of its sewer decree, the city is fined for each overflow that reaches one of those waters. Jackson entered into the decree in 2012 with the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Justice to bring its sewer system into compliance with federal water quality laws. According to the city‚Äôs annual report, Jackson does not have the funding or the manpower to address overflows or other decree mandates. City officials said Jackson also has equipment issues. According to the report, two of the city‚Äôs four trucks used to clean grease and solids out of clogged lines were down for repairs.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Workers at a public library system based in the city are voting this week on whether to become the only active public librarians union in the state. If employees at the Daniel Boone Regional Library, which has branches in Columbia, Fulton, Ashland and Holts Summit, ratify the union, they would join a growing movement toward unionization across the country, sparked in part by the coronavirus pandemic. The issues supporters cite are typical of most union efforts: the need for better pay and benefits, career opportunities, and safety concerns, as well as a lack of communication with administrators. Union supporters say the pandemic produced a variety of issues and underscored some that already existed: high staff turnover, differing treatment of employees, abuse of staff by patrons over masking, and a lack of clear direction for pandemic-related work. Tori Patrick, a full-time circulation assistant at the library, said there was strong support for the union but acknowledged some employees do not think a union is necessary, particularly in the smaller branches outside Columbia. ‚ÄúThat was a hard connection to make. We didn‚Äôt know who worked there and how to talk to them,‚Äù Patrick said. ‚ÄúWe have made some strong inroads, but we‚Äôre still facing a difficult path to connection with some workers.‚Äù\n\nMontana\n\nWarm Springs: The state health department confirmed Tuesday that it is investigating an allegation of a patient-on-patient sexual assault that occurred at the Montana State Hospital over the weekend, the Daily Montanan reports. According to an employee who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution, the alleged assault happened about 11 p.m. Friday. When a nurse checked on patients at shift change, the nurse found two male patients in the unit‚Äôs TV room, where one patient was sexually assaulting the other, according to the employee, who spoke to the nurse about the incident and relayed the information to the Daily Montanan. The employee said police were called, and the hospital‚Äôs new administrator, Carter Anderson, was aware of the incident. While Jon Ebelt, spokesperson for the Department of Public Health and Human Services, would not comment on the specifics of the matter, he confirmed that the state was investigating and that police had been called to the facility, as reported to the Daily Montanan by two staff members. ‚ÄúDue to confidentiality, we cannot comment on the matter at this point in time,‚Äù Ebelt said in an email.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts said he would push to outlaw abortion, without exceptions for rape or incest, if the U.S. Supreme Court follows through with a draft opinion suggesting it plans to overturn Roe v. Wade. Ricketts told ‚ÄúState of the Union‚Äù host Dana Bash on CNN on Sunday that Roe was a ‚Äúhorrible constitutional decision‚Äù and, when pressed about the possibility of the exceptions, said that ‚Äúthey‚Äôre still babies,‚Äù according to the Omaha World-Herald.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A judge has vacated the murder conviction of a 78-year-old Las Vegas woman who spent 20 years in prison for the 1994 killing of her millionaire husband before she was paroled. Margaret Rudin was found guilty in 2001 of murder in the death of real estate mogul Ron Rudin. Prosecutors said he had been shot in the head as he slept and his body dumped in the desert. U.S. District Judge Richard Boulware ruled Sunday that Margaret Rudin had received ineffective assistance of counsel from her late defense attorney, Michael Amador, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The Clark County district attorney‚Äôs office didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment from the Associated Press about whether prosecutors were considering appealing or retrying her. Rudin, who maintained her innocence all along, was paroled in 2020. ‚ÄúI will be 79 years old at the end of this month, so I am very, very grateful,‚Äù she told the newspaper Monday. A socialite antiques shop owner the media later dubbed the ‚ÄúBlack Widow,‚Äù she was indicted in 1997 in what authorities portrayed as a crime committed for financial gain. She vanished before she was indicted and spent two years as a fugitive until a tip generated by a ‚Äúmost wanted‚Äù TV show led to her arrest in 1999 in Massachusetts.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State House and Senate negotiators approved yet another congressional map Monday with time running out to meet both legislative and judicial deadlines. New Hampshire is one of a few states that have yet to complete the redistricting process required every 10 years to bring districts in line with population changes. Democrats hold both U.S. seats, but Republicans hold majorities in the Legislature and thus control the redistricting process. Lawmakers passed a plan in March that would have given the GOP an advantage in the 1st District, but Republican Gov. Chris Sununu promised to veto it. The House later passed a second plan that would clump together communities along the I-93 corridor, but the Senate rejected it, sending the matter to a committee of conference to come up with a compromise. Under the plan approved by the committee Monday, the 1st District would cover the southeast corner of the state, while the 2nd District would cover the western half of the state and the north country. Lawmakers said it would give Republicans an edge in the 1st District, though not as prominently as the previous plans. The only Democrat on the conference committee, Sen. Donna Soucy, of Manchester, said putting the state‚Äôs two largest cities in the same district was a disservice to rural communities.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: More than a century after its birth in North Jersey, the film industry is in the midst of a Garden State resurgence. Gov. Phil Murphy and local officials were in Newark on Tuesday to announce the latest project: a $125 million film and television studio to be built over the next two years at the site of a former public housing project in the South Ward. The facility, to be anchored by Lionsgate Studio, is expected to create more than 600 jobs for the region, with a priority given to Newark residents, as well as internships and educational opportunities to be overseen by the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, state officials said. ‚ÄúOne of my administration‚Äôs priorities has been to enhance New Jersey‚Äôs film industry and create new revenue streams for our state,‚Äù Murphy said in a statement released Tuesday. ‚ÄúWith the addition of the Lionsgate Newark Studio, New Jersey will cement its position as a hub for television and film production.‚Äù Set to open in 2024, the 300,000 square-foot facility will be a joint project by Lionsgate, the arts center and Great Points Studio, a studio management business that will own the site. The property has sat unoccupied since 2015, when the Seth Boyden Housing project was abandoned. The buildings were demolished in February.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: In a marked departure from his recent findings, the independent monitor overseeing the Albuquerque Police Department reforms wrote in his latest report that he saw ‚Äì ‚Äúperhaps for the first time‚Äù ‚Äì a serious willingness to identify and correct behavior that is counter to the effort. Also for the first time, the chief and his top brass have articulated an end date to the process. In an interview with the Albuquerque Journal, Police Chief Harold Medina said their goal is that the department will be in full compliance with the Court Approved Settlement Agreement in two years. The agreement made between the city of Albuquerque and the U.S. Department of Justice in 2014 lays out the requirements for reforming APD after federal investigators found officers had a pattern and practice of using excessive force. ‚ÄúWe may not meet that goal, and we could get criticized later that we didn‚Äôt meet our goal,‚Äù Medina said. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre going to set the goal. ‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre going to believe in ourselves, and we‚Äôre going to try our best. If, two years from now, we recognize we need one more period, well, you know what, it‚Äôs a whole lot better than anybody else has done.‚Äù\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A court-appointed expert has released a draft of new congressional maps for the state that are more favorable to Republicans than the original gerrymandered political maps drawn by Democrats. The draft maps released Monday would help the GOP by creating five districts that lean Republican and at least four other districts where Republicans would be competitive. Maps drawn by the Democratic-controlled Legislature as part of the redistricting process occurring every 10 years would have given Democrats a strong majority in 22 of 26 congressional districts, starting with this year‚Äôs election, but those maps were struck down by a court. Currently, the state has 27 congressional districts but is losing one as a result of the 2020 census. Republicans hold eight of those seats. The proposed maps could also pit several incumbents against each other or force them to run in new areas. The new maps are a blow to national Democrats‚Äô plans draw favorable maps in New York in order to maximize the number of seats they could win in the U.S. House of Representatives. Last month, New York‚Äôs highest court, the Court of Appeals, ruled those maps and others for the state Senate were unconstitutional and failed to abide by an anti-gerrymandering process approved by voters.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Last fall, the General Assembly approved $30 million to address a lack of air conditioning in the state‚Äôs prison system. But with summer approaching, none of the actual construction has begun. WRAL-TV reports that although most prisons have at least some air conditioning, about 15,400 beds are in rooms without it, according to a breakdown provided by the state. Prison officials in Gov. Roy Cooper‚Äôs administration hope to have the first three projects complete around the start of next year. At the North Carolina Correctional Institute for Women in Raleigh ‚Äì the system‚Äôs largest facility for women ‚Äì three-quarters of the beds don‚Äôt have air conditioning. Kristie Puckett Williams, the North Carolina American Civil Liberties Union‚Äôs deputy director for engagement and mobilization, said the temperature can surpass 100 degrees inside the prison in the summer. The campus will be one of the first prisons retrofitted with air conditioning. Prisons spokesman John Bull said Dan River Prison Work Farm and Caswell Correctional Center are also top priorities. Bull said several things complicate the effort, including the high demand right now for construction crews across the economy, as well as supply chain issues.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Despite millions of dollars in promised subsidies, a unit of the state‚Äôs only Fortune 500 company says it won‚Äôt pursue plans to build a natural gas pipeline from western North Dakota‚Äôs oil patch to the eastern part of the state. WBI Energy, a subsidiary of Bismarck-based MDU Resources Group, said the project is not viable due to regulatory uncertainty, limited in-state demand, and rising construction, labor and land-acquisition costs. In a letter to North Dakota Pipeline Authority Director Justin Kringstad, the company said materials and construction costs have risen up to 50% in just the past nine months. ‚ÄúThe recent and potential future inflationary pressure presents a significant challenge to a large-scale pipeline project from western to eastern North Dakota,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúThis challenge is further compounded by the fact that the actual construction of a major pipeline project, if it were to proceed, would occur four to five years in the future, following an uncertain siting/regulatory process.‚Äù The Legislature in November set aside $150 million in federal coronavirus aid to help construct such a trans-state pipeline for natural gas, which is a byproduct of oil production. The idea, backed by Republican Gov. Doug Burgum, was to help cut down on the wasteful flaring at well sites and send the gas elsewhere to spur industrial development.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: High school principals in the state have overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to allow prep athletes to sign deals cashing in on their name, image and likeness, the Ohio High School Athletic Association said Tuesday. In voting that began May 1 and finished Monday, principals from OHSAA member schools voted 538-254 not to allow the marketing deals for high school athletes. Students would lose their athletic eligibility were they to sign such a deal. The principals could vote again on the deals at a later date. ‚ÄúIf NIL is going to enter the Ohio interscholastic landscape, we want the schools to be the ones to make that determination,‚Äù said OHSAA Executive Director Doug Ute in a statement. ‚ÄúWhatever we do moving forward, it will include discussion on this issue with our school administrators, Board of Directors, staff and leaders of other state high school athletic associations.‚Äù OHSAA spokesperson Tim Stried previously said the organization opposed marketing deals for high school athletes. While there are exceptions, the amounts college athletes are earning from NIL deals are small. According to data gathered by Opendorse Deals, the average payout since July for large-school Division I athletes is $664. It‚Äôs just $59 for Division II athletes and $43 for Division III athletes.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The three known living survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre are receiving a $1 million donation from a New York philanthropic organization. Business for Good co-founders Ed and Lisa Mitzen say 108-year-old Viola Ford Fletcher, 107-year-old Lessie Benningfield Randle and 101-year-old Hughes Van Ellis will share the donation. Ed Mitzen, a businessman and philanthropist, told reporters in Tulsa that he was prompted to make the donation after reading news reports about the massacre. Business for Good did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment Tuesday. Fletcher, Randle and Ellis previously received $100,000 each from the Justice for Greenwood Foundation, a Tulsa-based nonprofit. The three and descendants of victims are currently suing the city of Tulsa and other entities for reparations for the destruction and lost wealth as a result of the massacre, in which a white mob attacked and killed hundreds of Black residents. The mob destroyed what had been the nation‚Äôs most prosperous Black business district in the northeastern Oklahoma city. A Tulsa judge earlier this month rejected a request to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state remains poised to see a potentially ‚Äúchallenging‚Äù wildfire season this summer, despite a wet and cool spring in much of western Oregon, one of the state‚Äôs top fire watchers said Monday. The rain and snow have helped to push back a fire season that threatened to start as early as this month, according to Mike Shaw, fire chief with the Oregon Department of Forestry. But he noted much of the precipitation on the coast and in the Willamette Valley hasn‚Äôt made it over the Cascade Mountains to central, southern and eastern Oregon, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Expanding drought conditions there have set the stage for fires to spread rapidly later this summer, Shaw said. ‚ÄúThis will likely translate to a very challenging fire season,‚Äù Shaw said at a news conference. ‚ÄúThe fires that start in these regions will be very hard to suppress.‚Äù Gov. Kate Brown said climate change has added complexity to the state‚Äôs wildfire response. She has declared drought in 15 counties ‚Äì the earliest Oregon has seen that level of water scarcity in recent history. The state is preparing with help from Senate Bill 762, which Brown signed into law last year. The bill provided for additional firefighting aircraft and money to hire more wildland firefighters. Crews are expected to be strategically placed around the state.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nLancaster: It will take several days for Lancaster County to count all its mail ballots because some of them will not scan, officials announced at a news conference Tuesday. Elections officials found Tuesday morning that many of the mail ballots would not scan because they contained the wrong identification code, according to a news release. The county faced a similar problem in the 2021 primary with a different mail ballot vendor, which the county fired. As of early Tuesday morning, the office had received more than 21,000 completed mail ballots, said Christa L. Miller, chief registrar/chief clerk of elections. To fix the issue, the elections staff will remark the affected mail ballots so they can be scanned into the scanner, but it will take longer than normal, Lancaster County Vice Chairman Commissioner Joshua G. Parsons said. The last time this happened, Miller said, it took about four days. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll do it as fast as possible, but our main priority is accuracy and not how fast we can do something,‚Äù Miller said. A Pennsylvania Department of State spokesperson said it is not aware of any other counties reporting this problem. Lancaster County has the sixth-largest population in the state.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State lawmakers unveiled changes Tuesday to a bill to legalize and regulate recreational marijuana, aiming to ensure the legislation passes the General Assembly. The amended bill was released Tuesday in advance of committee votes scheduled for Wednesday. Both the House and Senate are expected to vote next week. The bill now provides for the automatic expungement of any prior conviction for possession of cannabis that would be decriminalized by the legislation, without requiring a person to file a request, pay a fee or have a hearing. The expungements would occur by July 1, 2024, with an expedited process offered for anyone who wants to have their record expunged sooner. In the original bill, an expungement had to be requested. The start date for recreational sales was pushed from Oct. 1 to Dec. 1. The amended bill would eliminate current fees charged to patients and caregivers for registration in the state‚Äôs medical marijuana program. Lawmakers also changed how people would be appointed to the commission that would oversee the industry, to address concerns raised by the governor about separation of powers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The governor has quietly signed into law a bill that would ban transgender students from playing girls‚Äô or women‚Äôs sports in public schools and colleges as the state joins about a dozen others that have passed similar laws in the past two years. The bill was one of 43 acts Gov. Henry McMaster signed into law Monday with no fanfare or ceremony. McMaster posted on Twitter the next day that he was proud to enact the proposal to protect young men and women. Just before the Republican-dominated General Assembly passed the proposal earlier this month, McMaster said that ‚ÄúI think the girls ought to play girls, and the boys ought to play boys. That‚Äôs the way we‚Äôve always done it.‚Äù When asked if he meant biological boys, the Republican governor responded: ‚ÄúAre there any other kind?‚Äù The law requires transgender students to compete with the ‚Äúbiological sex‚Äù listed on their birth certificates ‚Äúfiled at or near the time‚Äù of birth. Supporters of a ban warn that in a rapidly changing society, transgender girls would have an unfair biological advantage from having been born stronger males. Opponents of the bill said it is a cruel idea, singling out students who are not elite athletes but are just looking for a way to be a regular student, hang out with friends and learn life lessons through competition.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: In a private 2020 meeting, Republicans in the state Senate planned how to achieve an already-negotiated outcome to a committee investigating a pair of lawmakers for being intoxicated during legislative proceedings even before the committee had a chance to meet, according to a television report. A transcript of the April 2020 Republican caucus meeting obtained by KELO-TV showed how Republicans held a private caucus meeting to discuss how to quickly and quietly resolve a legislative investigation into the two most powerful senators at the time, Sens. Kris Langer and Brock Greenfield. The pair were accused of showing up intoxicated at a legislative session that had stretched into the early morning hours as lawmakers discussed the state‚Äôs response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For critics of Republican rule in South Dakota‚Äôs Statehouse, the revelation of the meeting‚Äôs details provided an egregious example of how the fate of bills and the workings of state government are often decided in closed-door GOP meetings. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very closed, very secretive,‚Äù said Peggy Gibson, a former Democratic House member who spent years advocating, mostly without success, for ethics reforms in the Legislature. ‚ÄúEverything is decided ahead of time.‚Äù\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Tuesday struck down the state‚Äôs first-of-its-kind law requiring businesses to post special signs if they allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger makes permanent her previous decision from July 2021 that blocked enforcement of the law just days after it took effect. Businesses had sued over the law, arguing the signs would violate their First Amendment rights by compelling them to communicate language they find offensive. In her latest decision, the judge deemed the law ‚Äúa brazen attempt to single out trans-inclusive establishments and force them to parrot a message that they reasonably believe would sow fear and misunderstanding about the very transgender Tennesseans whom those establishments are trying to provide with some semblance of a safe and welcoming environment.‚Äù The 2021 law was signed by Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who has approved a wide range of bills targeting the LGBTQ community with the support of the state‚Äôs GOP-controlled Legislature. In the past several years, Tennessee has enacted more anti-LGBTQ laws than almost any other state in the country, with five approved last year and more signed this year.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: With an unseasonably hot May giving the state‚Äôs strained power grid about all it can handle, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas says it‚Äôs ready for demand for electricity to hit anticipated record levels amid even hotter temperatures this summer. ERCOT, the state agency charged with operating the grid, said this week that generation capacity is expected to be sufficient to serve peak summer demand ‚Äúunder normal system conditions‚Äù and most of the scenarios it has modeled for moderately worse to extreme weather and grid conditions. But it remains to be seen if Texans will find the agency‚Äôs annual summer assessment of the grid reassuring. ERCOT issued a call for conservation Friday, urging people to turn up thermostats and avoid using big appliances during peak hours through Sunday. It attributed the need for conservation to high demand amid hotter-than-normal temperatures and unanticipated outages at six generation plants. In addition, ERCOT has spent much of May asking power generators to postpone taking their plants offline for scheduled maintenance. Power generators in Texas often perform maintenance in the spring to prepare for the hot summer months.\n\nUtah\n\nKanab: A teenager visiting Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park died Sunday after he was entrapped beneath a sand dune that had collapsed on him a day prior. Ian Spendlove, a 13-year-old from the St. George suburbs, was pronounced dead Sunday after not regaining brain activity lost in the incident, the Utah State Parks Department said Monday. After a family member alerted authorities, park rangers arrived at Spendlove‚Äôs location Saturday evening to dig him out from what they said was about 6.5 feet of sand. Rangers said they believed Spendlove had been digging a tunnel into the sand dune when it collapsed on him. After rangers and Kane County Sheriff‚Äôs deputies rescued him and found he had a pulse, Spendlove was transported to St. George Regional Hospital and then to Primary Children‚Äôs Hospital in Salt Lake City, where he was declared dead. The department said the incident remains under investigation and urged visitors to be safe, wear helmets or life jackets, and alert others of recreation plans when in state parks. ‚ÄúThe Utah Division of State Parks extends our condolences to Ian Spendlove‚Äôs friends and family impacted by this tragedy,‚Äù it said in the press release.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he‚Äôs running for reelection. Scott said he is seeking a fourth two-year term in November because there‚Äôs much more work to do. The governor said in a campaign email that he has worked to bring people together at a time when the country seems more polarized than ever. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve proven that when we put politics aside and pull together, we can successfully navigate a once-in-a-century pandemic better than most every other state across the country,‚Äù Scott said. He said his priority will be on doing his job as governor and not campaigning. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never run a negative campaign and never will, because Vermonters, and all Americans, deserve a better and more civil political space ‚Äì if for no other reason than to be better role models for our children, because they‚Äôre watching us,‚Äù he said. No candidates have filed paperwork with the state yet, but activist Brenda Siegel, a Democrat, has announced she is running for the seat.\n\nVirginia\n\nOrange: The board that manages former President James Madison‚Äôs Montpelier estate has elected 11 new members representing descendants of people once enslaved there. Monday‚Äôs vote came two months after the board had retracted a commitment to share power with a group representing African Americans who trace their roots to the historic estate. New members were selected from 20 nominees submitted last month by the Montpelier Descendants Committee, a nationwide group drawn from the descendants‚Äô community of the historic site in Orange County, Virginia, the Culpeper Star-Exponent reports. The new board members include scholars, historians, two university deans and former CNN anchor Soledad O‚ÄôBrien. They will oversee management of the home of Madison, the fourth president known as the father of the Constitution; his wife, Dolley; and their enslaved workers. The committee and the foundation‚Äôs new appointees invited the candidates who were not chosen to join an advisory council so they all can help, said Cultural Heritage Partners, a law firm representing the descendants committee. All of the candidates agreed to serve. The board now has 25 members, including 14 endorsed by the committee, according to Greg Werkheiser of Cultural Heritage Partners, general counsel to the committee.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: State Supreme Court Justice Raquel Montoya-Lewis announced Monday that she will be on family medical leave for the court‚Äôs spring term to concentrate on her health, but officials with the court didn‚Äôt release additional details, citing the justice‚Äôs desire for privacy. The high court‚Äôs spring oral arguments began Tuesday and end June 28. ‚ÄúI look forward to returning to the Court as quickly as possible and would like to express my appreciation of the support of my staff and colleagues during this time,‚Äù Montoya-Lewis said in a statement released by the Administrative Office of the Courts. Wendy Ferrell, associate director of the Administrative Office of the Courts, said in an email that Montoya-Lewis has been meeting with her medical team ‚Äúand appreciates privacy during this time while she concentrates on her well-being.‚Äù Montoya-Lewis, an enrolled member of the Pueblo of Isleta who is the court‚Äôs first Native American justice, was appointed by Gov. Jay Inslee in December 2019 and sworn in the following month to fulfill the remaining year of the late Chief Justice Mary Fairhurst, who had been battling cancer and stepped down to focus on her treatment. Fairhurst died in December at age 64.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A city has been ordered to stop opening its council meetings with the Lord‚Äôs Prayer. U.S. District Judge John T. Copenhaver Jr. ruled Tuesday that Parkersburg City Council‚Äôs practice of opening its meetings with the New Testament prayer violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits government from favoring one religion over others. The judge issued a permanent injunction against the prayer recitation and awarded $1 in damages to each plaintiff. Copenhaver ruled in a lawsuit filed by the Freedom from Religion Foundation. The Madison, Wisconsin-based group and two of its members sued the city in 2018. The judge issued a permanent injunction against the prayer recital and awarded $1 in damages to each plaintiff. The lawsuit said residents stood at each Parkersburg City Council meeting to recite the prayer with council members. Plaintiffs Daryl Cobranchi and Eric Engle of Parkersburg attended some meetings, remained seated and did not participate in the prayer‚Äôs recital.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Two Democratic electors and a voter on Tuesday sued Republicans who attempted to cast electoral ballots for Donald Trump in 2020 despite Joe Biden‚Äôs victory in the battleground state. Their lawsuit filed in Dane County Circuit Court alleges a conspiracy by Trump and his allies to overturn his loss in the presidential race, calling it ‚Äúas legally baseless as it was repugnant to democracy.‚Äù It seeks up to $2.4 million in damages as well as disqualifying the Republicans from ever serving as electors again. The plaintiffs say it‚Äôs the first such lawsuit in the seven swing states where GOP electors falsely declared Trump the winner and cast their votes for him in December 2020. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs essential to have accountability and to make sure this doesn‚Äôt happen again,‚Äù said Jeffrey Mandell, an attorney for the plaintiffs. ‚ÄúWe have heard in the more than a year since the fraudulent electors met the excuse that what they did was not wrong, it was totally fine. We want a court to make clear that is not true.‚Äù Republican electors named in the lawsuit who have spoken publicly about what they did have long argued that they weren‚Äôt trying to change the Wisconsin result. Instead, they said, they were trying to preserve all their legal options in case a court ruled in favor of Trump.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: The state has the nation‚Äôs worst rate of workplace fatalities, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reports. Wyoming ranked worst in the U.S. in 2020 and consistently has one of the highest rates of occupational fatalities, according to U.S. Labor Department data cited by the newspaper.

It could have involved moving you to another seat to achieve proper center of gravity. Or bumping your baggage due to weight restrictions. Or maybe even bumping you. What you need to know is that under certain conditions, balancing a full aircraft presents operational challenges that can affect your flight.\n\nMore:Southwest Airlines under FAA investigation for aircraft weight, balance calculations\n\nA delicate balance\n\nDuring my airline career I was a loadmaster on cargo aircraft and later was involved in dispatching passenger flights. Both roles mandated that airplanes were safely loaded within maximum weight limits. Is it really a safety issue?\n\nMost definitely ‚Äî an improperly loaded and/or overloaded airplane is a danger to everyone on board. Depending upon how deeply you care to dive into the whys, the FAA offers a comprehensive online \"Weight and Balance Handbook.\" But the takeaway is simple: ‚ÄúBecause of abnormal stresses placed upon the structure of an improperly loaded aircraft, or because of changed flying characteristics of the aircraft, loss of life and destruction of valuable equipment may result.‚Äù Such errors have contributed to more than a few fatal airline accidents over time.\n\nThe challenge for airlines is to fill airplanes with as many passengers and as much baggage (and cargo) as possible, while not exceeding weight limits that can be affected by weather and takeoff restrictions such as short runways. And such conditions can require additional fuel, which means a higher takeoff weight, so that delicate balance can be elusive.\n\nBaggage is individually weighed at some airlines, but methodologies vary. Passenger weights are generally estimated and averaged; in addition, some carriers modify such averages seasonally to accommodate for heavier clothing by using ‚Äúwinter weights‚Äù in certain climates.\n\nWhat follows is a rundown of typical scenarios in which weight and balance requirements may affect your travel plans, along with advice on how to respond. It‚Äôs neither practical nor possible to compensate for such issues in all cases, but knowledge can help you make better decisions.\n\nSmaller aircraft\n\nTo underscore the severity, the National Transportation Safety Board reported that 136 general aviation accidents in nine years were due to improper or missing calculations. You‚Äôre more likely to encounter weight issues when flying on smaller airplanes, particularly codeshare regional flights.\n\nDelta‚Äôs Contract of Carriage states that among the conditions for which you will not be entitled to compensation if denied boarding is when a flight is operated by aircraft designed to hold 60 or fewer passengers, and Delta is unable to accommodate you ‚Äúdue to weight/balance restrictions when required by operational or safety reasons.‚Äù United‚Äôs Contract of Carriage and American‚Äôs Conditions of Carriage provide almost identical language, right down to 60-passenger capacity.\n\nIf you‚Äôre uncertain what size aircraft will operate your flight, check the site or travel agent before booking, then visit the airline‚Äôs fleet data. For example, Delta‚Äôs online ‚ÄúOur Aircraft‚Äù page specifies the Bombardier CRJ-200 is configured for 50 passengers. On some routes, you may be able to rebook to larger aircraft.\n\nBut a word of warning: Nearly every airline reserves the right to ‚Äúswap‚Äù aircraft right up until departure time. So the aircraft type scheduled to operate a given flight may not necessarily be the aircraft assigned to that flight. Passenger rights in the U.S. are heavily restricted by such contracts.\n\nMore:Contracts of carriage: Deciphering murky airline rules\n\nNatural and structural restrictions\n\nAircraft engine performance can be negatively affected by high-altitude airports, high temperatures and high winds, so flight planning needs to account for such factors with additional fuel ‚Äî which could mean fewer passengers and/or bags. Geography and infrastructure can affect takeoff weight in other ways; shorter runways can necessitate lighter loads, as can mountainous terrain or other obstructions that limit usable runway length. Keep in mind that some of the shortest runways are at two of the nation‚Äôs busiest airports, New York‚Äôs LaGuardia and Washington National, and subsequently those two facilities restrict larger widebody aircraft.\n\nTraveling with wheelchairs\n\nUnited‚Äôs contract specifically states the airline will refuse large wheelchairs or other assistive devices that would ‚Äúcause a load imbalance in a small baggage compartment and violate weight and balance safety requirements.‚Äù That said, United says it will ‚Äúuse reasonable efforts‚Äù to ‚Äúidentify‚Äù a flight that can accommodate the wheelchair ‚Äî but that‚Äôs no guarantee, particularly for such a vital accessory, so plan in advance.\n\nHelicopters/air taxis\n\nWeight and balance problems are particularly acute on helicopters and small aircraft used for sightseeing and island-hopping, particularly in leisure destinations such as Hawaii and the Caribbean. If you‚Äôre planning such trips, consider weather and other factors by contacting the operator the day before to ensure your flights are still scheduled.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to remember that even the most technologically sophisticated aircraft are still subject to the laws of physics, so modifications that may seem arbitrary can in fact be critical to your safety.\n\nBill McGee, a contributing editor to Consumer Reports and the former editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter, is an FAA-licensed aircraft dispatcher who worked in airline operations and management for several years.

And that pricing scheme will soon be in effect on short-hop international flights to the U.S. territory of American Samoa.\n\nAs for the carrier's weight-based pay scheme, the BBC reports \"passengers pay a fixed price per kilogram, which varies depending on the route length.\"\n\nSamoa Air has used the weight-based pay structure on domestic flights since November. But, the carrier said Wednesday it will start pricing its first international flights based on the weight of its passengers and their bags. Depending on the flight, each kilogram (2.2 pounds) costs 93 cents to $1.06.\n\nThat means the average American man weighing 195 pounds with a 35-pound bag would pay $97 to go one-way between Apia, Samoa, and Pago Pago, American Samoa. Competitors typically charge $130 to $140 round-trip for similar routes.\n\nSamoa Air has been using the pricing model since November, but in January the U.S. Department of Transportation approved the airline's first international route, which will operate between American Samoa and Samoa.\n\nSamoa Air CEO Chris Langton told The Associated Press on Tuesday that \"planes are run by weight and not by seat, and travelers should be educated on this important issue. The plane can only carry a certain amount of weight and that weight needs to be paid. There is no other way.\"\n\nLangton tells ABC News that charging by weight helps address safety concerns for the company's small Britten and Cessna turboprop aircraft.\n\n\"The smaller the aircraft you're in, the less variance you can accept in terms of the differences in weights between passengers,\" he tells ABC News.\n\n\"It's always been the fairest way, but the industry has been trying to pack square pegs into round holes for many years,\" Langton adds to AP.\n\nLangton said the airline has received mixed responses since it began promoting the pricing on its website\n\nand Facebook\n\n.\n\n\"People who have been most pleasantly surprised are families, because we don't charge on the seat requirement even though a child is required to have a seat, we just weigh them,\" Langton adds to Australia's ABC News radio.\n\n\"So a family of maybe two adults and a couple of mid-sized kids and younger children can travel at considerably less than what they were being charged before,\" he adds, according to Australia Network News.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald reports that \"under the new system, Samoa Air passengers must type in their weight and the weight of their baggage into the online booking section of the airline's website. ... Passengers are then weighed again on scales at the airport, to check that they weren't fibbing online.\"\n\nIslands in the Pacific have the highest rates of obesity in the world. According to a 2011 report by the World Health Organization, 86 percent of Samoans are overweight, the fourth worst among all nations.

But it can also be incredibly stressful.\n\nYou want to head for the gate with the swagger of a seasoned traveler, but that‚Äôs hard to pull off when you don‚Äôt know how much it costs to check a bag, or what to expect when you go through airport security.\n\nSo how can you deal? Reviewing these steps before takeoff can boost your confidence, making your trip easier and more worry-free.\n\nHow much you can pack and how much it will cost\n\nIt‚Äôs easy to overpack ‚Äî but if you do, it could cost you. Before your flight, visit your airline‚Äôs website to review luggage size and weight restrictions, as well as baggage fees. While these vary by airline and fare paid, here‚Äôs what you can typically bring with a standard fare on a major airline:\n\nTwo carry-on items for free: one full-size carry-on the size of a small rolling suitcase or smaller, and one small personal item, such as a purse or backpack\n\nOne checked suitcase (often, one weighing under 50 pounds) for $25 to $30; checking additional bags could cost more\n\nIf your carry-on bag is too bulky, you may have to pay to check it. Likewise, if your checked bag is over a certain size, you may have to pay a higher-than-usual fee to check it. It‚Äôs best to avoid these surprises, if possible.\n\n‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a nervous flyer, little things can really set you off,‚Äù says Jackie Sills-Dellegrazie of New York City, founder of the travel blog The Globetrotting Teacher. ‚ÄúEven if it‚Äôs not a big deal, and you get to the check-in counter, and they say, ‚ÄòOh, by the way, there‚Äôs a $30 bag fee,‚Äô and you weren‚Äôt expecting that, that could just be something that rattles you.‚Äù\n\nRemember, if you pack light enough, you could avoid baggage fees altogether.\n\nHaving an airline credit card can mean waived checked baggage fees, as well.\n\nWhat you should put in a carry-on\n\nIf you‚Äôre packing anything that‚Äôs hard to replace ‚Äî say, prescription medicine, contacts or glasses, or important paperwork ‚Äî put it in your carry-on bag. This way, you won‚Äôt be without that item in the rare event your checked bag goes missing. You‚Äôll also want to pack some in-flight entertainment, such as your laptop, headphones and a book or magazine.\n\nJust make sure you‚Äôre following the Transportation Security Administration‚Äôs rules for what you can pack. You can‚Äôt, for example, bring a big bottle of contact lens solution in your carry-on, but you can bring a 3.4-ounce bottle. And keep in mind that if your carry-on bag is too big to fit under the seat in front of you, you may have to check it. More rules may apply if you‚Äôre flying internationally.\n\n‚ÄúThe overhead compartments fill up quickly,‚Äù says Jeff Klee, CEO of CheapAir.com, an online travel agency based in Calabasas, California. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre in the back of the plane, you might find that there‚Äôs no more room, and you‚Äôll have to do a gate check of your bag at the last minute, which isn‚Äôt particularly fun.‚Äù Checking your bag at the gate means your full-sized carry-on bag will travel with the other checked bags during the flight, rather than in the overhead bin.\n\nWhat time to get to the airport\n\nCatching a plane isn‚Äôt like catching a bus; it‚Äôs a much longer process. In fact, the TSA recommends showing up at least two hours before takeoff for domestic travel, and three hours for international travel.\n\nUltimately, you need to give yourself enough time to get your boarding pass, check your bags and go through security before your plane starts boarding. Sometimes, that takes 10 minutes. Other times, especially during peak travel times, it can take much longer.\n\nIt‚Äôs worth keeping in mind that boarding the plane isn‚Äôt a free-for-all, either. Airlines typically start boarding passengers 30 minutes before takeoff in groups. Generally, a boarding time will be printed on your ticket.\n\nWhen to have your ID ready\n\nDecades ago, airport security was relatively lax. ‚ÄúThere was one point where you could just walk up to a gate, whether you were flying or not, whether you had ID or not,‚Äù Klee says. Nowadays, TSA agents check IDs for passengers over 18.\n\nSave time by having your ID card, driver‚Äôs license or passport handy as soon as you step foot into the airport. You‚Äôll need it when checking bags and going through security, and you don‚Äôt want to hold up the line while rummaging through your wallet.\n\nWhat to expect when going through security\n\nGoing through airport security might be the most stressful part of flying ‚Äî but if you know what to expect, the whole rigmarole can feel much less taxing. Typically, unless you have TSA PreCheck or Global Entry, you have to:\n\nRemove your shoes (unless you‚Äôre 12 and under or 75 and older)\n\nEmpty the contents of your pockets and remove your hat, belt, jacket, wallet and bulky jewelry\n\nRemove your laptop and liquids from your bag\n\nSend these items ‚Äî and your carry-on bag ‚Äî through an X-ray machine\n\nWalk through a metal detector or a body scanner (or opt for a pat-down)\n\nPreparing for this ‚Äî say, by wearing shoes you can easily slip on and off and making sure the items in your carry-on are TSA-compliant ‚Äî can make the process faster.\n\nHow to be considerate during a flight\n\nThese days, flights are generally fully booked, and most seats offer limited legroom. This might stress out your fellow flyers, so be sensitive.\n\n‚ÄúIf any of your stuff or body parts are going into another space that‚Äôs not yours, you really have to be mindful of that,‚Äù Sills-Dellegrazie says. ‚ÄúIt can be as simple as, you put your ponytail over the top of the seat and now it‚Äôs hanging ‚Ä¶ across someone‚Äôs TV screen, and you don‚Äôt even realize it.‚Äù\n\nSimilarly, if you wear perfume or cologne, eat smelly foods or listen to loud music, you might unintentionally upset the person sitting next to you. Of course, you can‚Äôt plan for everything ‚Äî maybe you‚Äôre traveling with an upset child, for example ‚Äî but do what you can to avoid an in-flight faux pas.\n\nWhat to do if you miss a flight\n\nNow for a game of ‚Äúworst-case scenario,‚Äù first-time flyer edition: What happens if you miss your flight?\n\nFirst, take a deep breath. If you miss your plane because of unforeseen circumstances, such as a major traffic delay, the airline will often put you on standby for the next flight without charging extra. Just remember that you generally need to notify the airline within a couple of hours of missing your flight to get rebooked for free.\n\nIf it looks like you‚Äôll miss a connecting flight, check the smartphone app offered by your airline or the screen in the airport to find out which gate your flight departs from, and whether you‚Äôve actually missed it. If the flight is delayed, you may still have a chance to board. But if you miss the connection and the airline was responsible, you can generally also rebook that flight free of charge ‚Äî and maybe even get some free meal or hotel vouchers for the hassle.\n\nThe key in both cases: Be proactive. Have the airline‚Äôs customer service phone number handy in case you get stuck in traffic, so you can call as soon as possible. Or if you‚Äôre already at the airport, go to the customer service desk and asking about rebooking. Missing a flight can be a setback, but it doesn‚Äôt have to derail your travel plans.\n\nMore From NerdWallet\n\nClaire Tsosie is a writer at NerdWallet. Email: claire@nerdwallet.com.

Does this imbalance affect aircraft performance? Shouldn't the weight be distributed evenly on each side of the aircraft?\n\n‚Äî Submitted by reader Matthew R, Syracuse, N.Y.\n\nAnswer: The weight is balanced due to the aisle being offset a bit. Airplanes such as the DC-9, MD-80/90 and Boeing 717 have the 3‚Äì2 seating in the main cabin. They fly normally with no imbalance due to good design engineering.\n\nQ: On Allegiant Air they try to get customers to pay for picking a particular seat. Recently, while traveling with my wife on tickets booked together they seated us in different rows. They then make an announcement saying that nobody should switch seats because they use a computerized weight and balance system on the plane. I can appreciate the fact that balance is important in aircraft performance but baggage seems to get loaded in a pretty random manner with little concern for weight and balance. Can you provide any clarification?\n\n‚Äî Joe, Springfield, Ill.\n\nA: Many airlines use computer weight and balance programs. The airplane is divided into zones and the number of passengers in each zone is entered in the program. This allows for the balance of the airplane to be determined.\n\nIt is likely that your flight was near a limit and they did not want people changing zones.\n\nYour statement about baggage being loaded randomly is not correct. The weight in each cargo compartment is calculated prior to loading. Airlines use standard weights for bags and people, allowing them to do the calculations in advance. This speeds up the loading process significantly.\n\nQ: I was flying Akron Canton to Charlotte on United and right before we left the flight attendant needed someone to move to the back because of weight. How can 100-200 pounds make a difference and why?\n\n‚Äî Lisa Crall, Bolivar, Ohio\n\nA: In some airplanes, it can make a difference. Before every flight, performance calculations are done to ensure that the airplane can safely take off and land. One of the calculations is the weight of the airplane, another is the balance. Balance is important for proper control (primarily pitch control) during takeoff and in flight. During certification, the manufacturer demonstrates various balance points, known as center of gravity, to the regulator (in the U.S., that is the FAA). Based on those demonstrated points, a flight envelope is developed. To maintain the proper balance, the center of gravity must be within the envelope and the airplane is loaded with passengers, cargo and fuel accordingly. In your case, it was necessary to move one person aft to move the center of gravity back and into the envelope.\n\nQ: Why would passengers be removed unwillingly for an overweight aircraft? Aren't the paying passengers the first part of the weight and balance formula?\n\n‚Äî Neil, East Aurora, N.Y.\n\nA: The first part of the weight and balance plan is the fuel needed for the flight. Load planning agents then account for the scheduled passengers, bags and cargo. Variations to the planned load can result in overweight conditions. A decision has to be made how the weight can be reduced; sometimes it is removing a few passengers. Removing passengers can be faster than removing an equal amount of bags. This is a difficult decision for the ground staff to make.\n\nJohn Cox is a retired airline captain with US Airways and runs his own aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2019/02/18/southwest-airlines-under-faa-investigation-weight-balance-baggage/2905071002/", "title": "Southwest Airlines aircraft weight, balance investigated by FAA", "text": "Southwest Airlines has been under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration for a year, with the probe focused on its aircraft weight and balance calculations, a critical step before takeoff.\n\nThe investigation, disclosed for the first time Monday by the Wall Street Journal, began in February 2018, FAA spokesman Gregory Martin confirmed to USA TODAY. There have been no fines nor enforcement action from the investigation to date.\n\n\"Since that time, the FAA has directed the development of a comprehensive solution to the methods and processes used by Southwest Airlines to determine this (weight and balance) performance data,'' he said in a statement. \"The FAA will not close its investigation until it is satisfied that Southwest‚Äôs corrective actions are consistent and sustained.''\n\nSouthwest spokeswoman Brandy King said the airline's approach to calculating weight and balance ‚Äî a detailed process that factors in the weight of bags, cargo and passengers and where they are positioned on the plane to help determine things like fuel needed and takeoff and landing speeds ‚Äî has served it well for its 47-year history.\n\nShe said Southwest switched to a new system, approved by the FAA, in August 2017 to improve reliability, efficiencies and accuracy, and made more changes in 2018. This year, following a test at three airports in 2018, Southwest plans to start scanning each bag as it's loaded onto the plane, a process in place at other airlines. The airline's baggage handlers have been manually counting bags because Southwest's technology priority the past few years was its new reservations system.\n\n\"While no system can ever be perfect, our weight and balance program is a proven, reliable system with checks and balances installed to ensure safe operations by any measure or standard,'' King said in a statement.\n\nThe Journal's report, based on internal FAA documents and interviews with unnamed FAA officials, says as many as one third of Southwest's 4,000 daily flights could have operated with inaccurate weight data during certain periods due to the manual counting of bags by baggage handlers instead of computerized scanning. Southwest said there is no evidence to support that number. King also notes that safety margins are built into its system \"to allow for the possibility of discrepancies and to assure performance limitations are never compromised.''\n\nWhy are aircraft weight and balance so important?\n\nWeight and balance calculations on any type of plane are critical. Weight is the total weight of passengers, bags and cargo, while balance is how it's all proportioned on the plane.\n\nThere are significant risks to having an overweight or improperly balanced plane, especially in case of an emergency, said Brent Bowen, professor of aeronautical science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona.\n\nHe uses US Airways Flight 1549, the plane that successfully landed on the Hudson River 10 years ago after a bird strike knocked out both engines, as an example.\n\n\"If that plane had been overweight, it could have stalled and spun in (to the Hudson River),'' he said.\n\nSimilarly, a plane that is too heavy can cause problems if it skids toward the end of the runway during a snow or ice storm, Bowen said.\n\n\"If the plane is overweight it will have difficulty stopping,'' he said.\n\nWeight and balance is also critical during extreme heat, such as the triple-digit temperatures in Phoenix in the summer.\n\n\"It makes the air feel like it's at a higher altitude,'' he said. \"I don't think I would be comfortable using a (baggage weight) estimate in extreme conditions.''\n\nThe Journal said the investigation was initiated after allegations were raised by a whistle blower and on an FAA hotline for safety complaints.\n\nSouthwest, the nation's largest domestic carrier, says it voluntarily alerted the FAA to baggage weight discrepancies.\n\nIn early 2018, when the investigation was launched, the Journal said, \"the FAA told the carrier 'there have been numerous reports of ground operations personnel and/or flight operations personnel not following Southwest Airlines procedures for entering correct and complete weight information' before takeoff. One early document called it a ‚Äúhigh-risk concern.‚Äù\n\n\"The inaccuracies prompted swift FAA responses, and were considered serious enough to require Southwest to physically audit the number of bags unloaded daily from 25 percent of its flights,'' the Journal said. \"That sample was later reduced, at Southwest‚Äôs request, to 15 percent. The airline continues to provide daily status reports to the agency.''\n\nIn the wake of the Southwest investigation, Bowen, who also publishes the annual Airline Quality Rating, said he plans to incorporate the topic of weight and balance in a new airline safety report card due out later this year.\n\nNews of the FAA investigation comes on the heels of an unrelated operations \"emergency'' Southwest executives declared last week due to a higher than usual number of planes out of service. The airline, which has been in prolonged contract negotiations with its mechanics, ordered all maintenance hands on deck until the situation is resolved and said mechanics \"alleging sickness'' will be required to provide a doctor's note.\n\nAnd it comes as Southwest is in the final stages of seeking FAA certification to begin flights to Hawaii.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/cox/2020/06/05/ask-captain-there-takeoff-change-empty-vs-full-planes/3154794001/", "title": "Ask the Captain: Is there a takeoff change for empty vs. full planes?", "text": "John Cox\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, planes flew with very few or no passengers. Do you notice a significant difference in performance in takeoff in near-empty planes versus planes full of passengers?\n\n‚Äì Vance Carpenter\n\nThe number of passengers definitely can change the performance of any airplane. Before every takeoff, the pilots compute the weight and balance of the airplane. This gives them the proper speeds for critical decisions and when to raise the nose and start the climb.\n\nPassenger weights are a part of the overall weight, hence the fewer passengers, the less the weight. Lighter airplanes lift off the runway at a lower speed, climb faster, cruise higher and land at a slower speed.\n\nThere is definitely a significant difference in a lightweight airplane (few passengers and bags) and a full flight.\n\nHow long does it take a new pilot to work up from small, short-flight jets to captaining a transoceanic flight?\n\n‚Äì Joe Mc.\n\nIt can vary greatly. If an airline is growing internationally, that transition can occur in a few years. If the airline is stagnant or shrinking, it may not occur at all.\n\nIt also depends on the pilot‚Äôs preference to be more senior (having more control of his/her schedule) or fly bigger airplanes (with less control of the schedule).\n\nI was extremely fortunate. From being a new-hire first officer to my initial upgrade to captain, it took 3¬Ω years, which is very quick. Later in my career, I could have flown larger airplanes internationally but would have been very junior ‚Äì flying less-desirable trips with little control of my schedule. I chose to fly smaller jets as a more-senior captain to have better control of the schedule. I was also doing air-safety work that took a lot of time, so being senior made adjusting the schedule more important.\n\nThere is not a simple answer to your question.\n\nJohn Cox is a retired airline captain with US Airways and runs his own aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/05"}]}

She needed treatment late in regulation but stayed on the field and, five minutes later, Alexandra Popp equalized from the penalty spot. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nSophie Roman Haug‚Äôs hat trick kick-started Norway‚Äôs dormant offense and sparked a 6-0 blowout win over the Philippines on Sunday that moved the Norwegians into to the knockout stage of the Women‚Äôs World Cup. The Philippines‚Äô debut run in the tournament came to an end as Norway scored early and often, netting three goals in the first 31 minutes. Norway‚Äôs spot in the round of 16 was secured when Switzerland and New Zealand simultaneously played to a 0-0 draw and the Norwegians. Norway and New Zealand were tied in Group A but Norway advanced on goal differential. New Zealand became the first host country to be eliminated in the group stage in tournament history. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nNew Zealand outshot Switzerland and even moved goalkeeper Victoria Esson into an attack position several times, but failed to break a 0-0 tie Sunday in the Women‚Äôs World Cup and became the first host nation to be eliminated in group play in tournament history.The Football Ferns are co-hosting the World Cup with Australia, which must win Monday against Canada to avoid its own early elimination. Switzerland advanced to the round of 16. The Swiss also played to a scoreless draw against Norway, but won the group with the draw against New Zealand, coupled with the Norwegians' simultaneous 6-0 rout of the Philippines. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nFrance proved it is still Brazil's kryptonite. A 2-1 loss at the Women‚Äôs World Cup on Saturday stretched Brazil's winless run against the French to 12 games. The result is all too familiar for Brazil, which lost to France in the quarterfinals the 2019 Women‚Äôs World Cup by the same score. Brazil then hired the experienced Pia Sundhage as its head coach in hopes of making the changes needed to defeat teams like France. Sundhage had coached the United States to two Olympic gold medals and a runner-up finish in the 2011 Women's World Cup. This year‚Äôs team features 11 first-time World Cup players, but despite the changes Brazil is left still searching for its first win over Les Bleues. The best they've managed is five draws. France‚Äôs game-winning goal came in the 83rd minute off Wendie Renard's header from a corner kick. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nAfter leaving it to the last minute against South Africa, Sweden left nothing to chance Saturday in a 5-0 win over Italy which sealed its place in the knockout rounds of the Women's World Cup. Sweden relied on Amanda Ilestedt's 90th-minute winner to salvage a 2-1 win from a sub-par performance in its opener against South Africa. Ilestedt was Sweden's first scorer Saturday, this time in the 39th, and her glancing header from a corner sparked a flood of four Swedish goals in 11 minutes on either side of halftime. Her second goal came in the 50th and was a mirror image of the first. Rebecka Blomqvist finished it off in stoppage time with Sweden's fifth goal. ‚ÄúWe are good at set pieces,\" said Ilestedt, who is now the tournament‚Äôs leading scorer with three goals. ‚ÄúWe have good shooters and we know we are good headers so it feels good the balls are coming where they should.‚Äù ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nDefender Allyson Swaby scored in the 56th minute and Jamaica hung on to edge Panama 1-0 on Saturday for its first-ever win at the Women‚Äôs World Cup. Swaby, who grew up in West Hartford, Conn., and played for Boston College, knocked in a header off Trudi Carter‚Äôs corner kick to clinch a win that moved the Jamaicans into a surprising share of top spot in Group F with France. The Reggae Girlz were without captain and leading scorer Khadija Shaw, who received a red card in second-half stoppage time of the team‚Äôs opening 0-0 draw against France. Born to a Jamaican father, Allyson and her younger sister Chantelle both are starting in their second Women‚Äôs World Cup. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nDespite playing with 10 players for more than an hour, China defied the odds to secure a 1-0 victory over Haiti on Friday in its second game of the Women's World Cup. Forward Wang Shuang scored her first-ever goal at a World Cup in the 74th minute, converting a penalty after VAR ajudged her teammate Zhang Linyan was fouled in the area. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nIn the end, it was worth the wait.With a flash of early brilliance, Lauren James ended England's run of more than seven hours without a goal from open play to seal a 1-0 win against Denmark at the Women‚Äôs World Cup on Friday. The Chelsea star scored after six minutes of her first start at the tournament to put the Lionesses on course for back-to-back wins in Group D. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nArgentina scored two game-saving goals in a flurry of five minutes during the second half Friday to salvage a 2-2 draw with South Africa at the Women‚Äôs World Cup. The draw gave both teams a single point in Group G. Sweden and Italy, the co-leaders of the group with three points each, play Saturday. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nAsisat Oshoala had to watch from Nigeria's bench for an hour, desperate to get into the action, before getting a chance to unleash all her pent up energy against co-host Australia at the Women's World Cup. The Barcelona striker entered the game in the 63rd minute and Nigeria took the lead two minutes later for the first time, 2-1. Within nine minutes, Oshoala scored a goal that sealed an upset victory, sparked her jersey-shedding celebration and left Australia in a must-win scenario for World Cup survival. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nTelma Encarnacao scored one goal and assisted on another as Portugal defeated Vietnam 2-0 on Thursday in the Women‚Äôs World Cup, a win that ensured Vietnam will not advance to the knockout stage. Portugal jumped ahead in the seventh minute following a quick series of decisive passes through the Vietnamese defense. Lucia Alves dropped in a perfect cross to Encarnacao at the top of the six-yard box for a simple finish. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nLindsey Horan scored on a thunderous header after a collision with Lyon teammate Danielle van de Donk on Thursday to salvaging a 1-1 draw with the Netherlands and keeping the U.S. women‚Äôs national team's hopes of winning Group E alive. The two-time defending champs can claim the top spot ‚Äì and a road to the final that likely wouldn‚Äôt include England, Germany or France ‚Äì by beating Portugal and maintaining their plus-2 goal differential against the Netherlands. The Americans gave up a goal in the 17th minute, the first time since the 2011 quarterfinals they have trailed in a World Cup game. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nCanada recovered from conceding directly from a corner kick to seal a come-from-behind 2-1 win against Ireland in the Women's World Cup on Wednesday. Adriana Leon's second-half strike at Perth‚Äôs rain-soaked Rectangular Stadium boosted Olympic champion Canada's hopes of advancing to the round of 16 by moving to the top of Group B. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nAs she has many times before, Jennifer Hermoso answered the call for Spain on Wednesday night. She scored twice and assisted in her 100th international appearance to push La Roja past Zambia 5-0 on Wednesday, a victory that locked both Spain and Japan into the Women‚Äôs World Cup knockout round. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nHikaru Naomoto and Aoba Fujino scored two minutes apart in the first half to lead Japan to a 2-0 Women‚Äôs World Cup victory over Costa Rica on Wednesday, and the Japanese qualified for the knockout stage later when Spain beat Zambia. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nGoalkeeper Gaelle Thalmann shielded Switzerland to a 0-0 draw against Norway on Tuesday at the Women‚Äôs World Cup, as the Norwegians played without star striker Ada Hegerberg because of injury. Hegerberg was initially listed to start, but the team announced during the match that the former Ballon d‚ÄôOr winner was unable to play after experiencing ‚Äúa feeling in the groin‚Äù toward the end of her pre-match warmups. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nPhilippines made history at its first Women‚Äôs World Cup with its first goal and first win Tuesday, holding on under pressure to upset co-host New Zealand. The New Zealanders only five days earlier had celebrated their first win in six trips to the Women‚Äôs World Cup. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nCasey Phair has become the youngest player in soccer World Cup history at the age of 16 years and 26 days. Phair went on as a replacement in South Korea's 2-0 loss to Colombia in Sydney at the Women's World Cup on Tuesday. Phair has an American father and a South Korean mother and was raised in the United States. She says ‚ÄúIt was a scary moment, but then going on and running around, I think it just settled in.‚Äù The record was previously held by the late Ifeanyi Chiejine, who was 16 years and 34 days old when she played for Nigeria in the 1999 FIFA Women‚Äôs World Cup. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nAry Borges scored a hat trick as Brazil made a flying start at the Women's World Cup on Monday by beating Panama 4-0. An early contender for goal of the tournament had to be Bia Zaneratto finishing off a move full of Brazilian flair. And Borges, playing at her first World Cup, was right at the heart of it with a back-heeled assist following a brilliant team move. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nAlexandra Popp scored twice in the first half and Germany added four more in the second in a 6-0 rout of a Morocco team on its debut at the Women‚Äôs World Cup on Monday. The margin of victory is the largest of the tournament so far as the two-time champions dominated throughout against Morocco, the first Arab and North African country to qualify for the tournament. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nCristiana Girelli's goal in the 87th minute broke a stalemate and Italy kicked off the Women's World Cup with a 1-0 victory over Argentina on Monday night. Italy put the ball in the back of the net twice in the opening half but both times were offside, before Girelli's breakthrough header. Girelli came into the match as a substitute in the 83rd minute. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nHerv√© Renard knows all about World Cup shocks. He also knows an early setback can be overcome in international soccer. With that in mind, the France coach was not unduly concerned by his team's 0-0 with Jamaica on Sunday, which was one of the biggest surprises so far at the Women‚Äôs World Cup. Renard led Saudi Arabia to a famous win against Argentina at the men's World Cup in Qatar last year, before Lionel Messi's team rebounded and went on to lift the trophy for their country. ‚ÄúThere are lots of people, lots of teams that start with the fanfare and are not there come the final and others are maybe slow to get out of the starting blocks,‚Äù he said. While there is no need for France to panic, this was still an unexpected result for the fifth-ranked team in the world and one of the tournament favorites. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nSweden produced a drab opening Women's World Cup performance on a gloomy night of mist and rain but managed to pull off a surprisingly difficult 2-1 victory to fend off plucky South Africa on Sunday. South Africa caught Sweden off guard when Hildah Magaia scored in the 48th minute to take a shocking lead in the Group G match while threatening to notch the first major upset of the tournament. Sweden got on the board in the 64th minute with Fridolina Rolfo‚Äôs equalizer. Amanda Ilestedt then produced a perfect header from a corner with a minute left in regulation to help Sweden escape at the end of an unimpressive opening game effort. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nStefanie van der Gragt scored on a header in the 13th minute, leading the Netherlands to a 1-0 win over Portugal at the Women‚Äôs World Cup on Sunday as the 2019 finalists began their tournament run. The Dutch defender gathered herself as teammate Sherida Spitse lofted a corner kick her way, then headed the ball across the goal into the far side of the net. An offside review delayed the celebration. The goal by the 30-year-old van der Gragt, who plans to retire after the Women's World Cup, was the quickest first goal of the tournament. The Dutch controlled the tempo of the game ‚Äî Portugal‚Äôs first shot of the match didn‚Äôt come until the 82nd minute. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nSubstitute Amalie Vangsgaard scored in the 90th minute as Denmark beat China 1-0 at the Women‚Äôs World Cup on Saturday. With time running out in a game of few chances, she rose to head home Pernille Harder‚Äôs late corner. Vangsgaard had only come on in the 85th and made a quick impact with her first goal for the country. It was also the first headed goal of the tournament and sparked joyous celebrations from Denmark‚Äôs players. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nThe champions of Europe had to struggle for a 1-0 win over a Haiti lineup feeding off Melchie Dumornay's forays through the England defense and Kerly Theus' series of athletic saves in its Women‚Äôs World Cup debut on Saturday. The difference between the world's No. 4-ranked team and the unheralded, under-resourced, 53-ranked team from strife-torn Haiti came down to a handball. A retaken penalty from Georgia Stanway in the 29th minute was enough for England to earn three points, the primary objective in the Group D opener for England manager Sarina Wiegman. But it did expose some deficiencies in her injury-depleted team. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nHinata Miyazawa scored a pair of goals, while Mina Tanaka and Jun Endo each added a goal and an assist, as Japan shut out Zambia 5-0 to open Women‚Äôs World Cup play Saturday for both sides. Miyazawa found the back of the net with one-time finishes on either side of halftime to secure an easy win over the Copper Queens in what was their World Cup debut. Tanaka, denied goals twice on offside calls, scored in similar fashion in the 55th minute, assisted by Endo. Endo then scored in the 71st minute, finding herself alone on the left side of goalkeeper Catherine Musonda‚Äôs goal and slotting home a left-footed strike. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nSophia Smith scored twice for the United States in the opening half and the two-time defending champions kicked off the Women‚Äôs World Cup with a 3-0 victory over tournament first-timers Vietnam on Saturday. Lindsey Horan added a goal for the favored Americans, who have won four World Cups overall and are vying for an unprecedented three-peat at the tournament co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand. Vietnam drew comparisons to the Americans‚Äô opponent in the 2019 World Cup opener, Thailand, which the U.S. thumped 13-0. But Vietnam was surprisingly resilient and kept the game as close as possible. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nThey were outscored 3-0. They were outshot 12-1. And for a nightmarish first half a the Women's World Cup, every ball seemed to find the wrong foot. Costa Rica had a difficult showing to start its Women‚Äôs World Cup effort, losing 3-0 to Spain on a cold and rainy Friday night. About the best thing to take away for Las Ticas was they didn‚Äôt quit. In the 22nd minute, a Spanish cross bounced off the leg of Costa Rica‚Äôs Valeria Del Campo and into her own net.Within six minutes of Del Campo‚Äôs error, Spain‚Äôs Aitana Bonmati and Esther Gonz√°lez each scored. The match was out of reach before the half-hour mark. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nRamona Bachmann drilled her penalty kick into the left side of the net moments before halftime to set up Switzerland‚Äôs 2-0 win over Philippines on Friday in the Women‚Äôs World Cup opener for both teams. Switzerland‚Äôs Seraina Piubel added a second-half goal, scoring on the rebound from a missed shot by Coumba Sow that ricocheted off Philippines goalkeeper Olivia McDaniel. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nOlympic champion Canada has been held to a 0-0 draw by Nigeria in its Women‚Äôs World Cup opener after Nigerian goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie made several key saves, including one on a penalty from Christine Sinclair. It was a crucial miss for the Canadian veteran, who is the leading all-time scorer in international soccer, men or women, with 190 goals. Sinclair lined up for the shot in the 50th minute but couldn't beat a diving Nnadozie. ‚Äî Associated Press\n\nRocked by the late withdrawal of Sam Kerr through injury, Australia needed time to settle before getting off to a winning start at the Women's World Cup on Thursday with a 1-0 victory over Ireland.

Antonin Thuillier/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThat means the USWNT will earn $6.5 million for the US Men‚Äôs National Team‚Äôs (USMNT) exploits thus far in Qatar. If the team defeats the Netherlands in the round of 16 and reaches the quarterfinals or beyond, that figure will continue to increase.\n\nIn contrast, the USWNT earned $6 million in total for its successive World Cup wins in 2015 and 2019 ‚Äì $2 million in 2015 and $4 million in 2019.\n\nThe 2019 Women‚Äôs World Cup total prize money was $30 million, doubled from the $15 million in 2015.\n\nThe US jcocer equal pay agreement means the USMNT will pick up half of the USWNT‚Äôs prize money in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, at the men‚Äôs World Cup this year, the winner of the tournament will get $42 million and the total prize money is $440 million ‚Äì over 14 times as much as the women‚Äôs edition of the tournament.\n\n‚ÄúFIFA has always treated the women‚Äôs World Cup as an afterthought, which is a big reason why equal-pay deals like the one struck between the USMNT and USWNT are so important,‚Äù wrote sports reporter Lindsay Gibbs in her newsletter ‚ÄúPowerPlays.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThey put more pressure on FIFA to invest in the women‚Äôs game, because now the lack of resources given to the women directly impact the men, too.

Smith added an assist on Lindsey Horan‚Äôs goal late in the second half.\n\nThe USWNT next plays the Netherlands on Wednesday in a match that will go a long way toward deciding the winner of Group E. That‚Äôs no small thing, given the group winner is likely to avoid England, Germany, France or Canada until the final.\n\nThat the USWNT beat Vietnam was hardly a surprise. They are four-time World Cup champions and have been ranked No. 1 for all but 10 months over the last 15 years. Vietnam, ranked 32nd, is playing in its first-ever World Cup, and its coach likened the USWNT to a ‚Äúmountain‚Äù on Thursday.\n\nBut this is a young and inexperienced U.S. squad. This is the first major international tournament for 12 of the 23 players, and six of the USWNT‚Äôs starters were making their World Cup debuts ‚Äì including Savannah DeMelo, who got her first cap just 13 days ago.\n\nAs much as a win, this was an opportunity to get the youngsters experience and confidence for the rest of the tournament.\n\nAnd, indeed, the USWNT dominated the game, both to the eye and on the stat sheet. They easily could have had a half-dozen goals in the first half ‚Äì Alex Morgan missed a penalty kick and Vietnam keeper Tran Thi Kim Thanh made three other saves ‚Äì and had already had two good chances before Smith got the Americans on the board in the 14th minute.\n\nHighlights from USWNT 3-0 win over Vietnam\n\nFirst-time World Cup player Sophia Smith stole the show in the USWNT's opening game, scoring two goals before halftime.\n\nHoran, wearing the captain‚Äôs armband for the first time at a World Cup, floated a nice pass that Morgan moved forward with a backheel flick. It fell to Smith just inside the box, and she put it beneath the goalkeeper‚Äôs legs and into the net for her first World Cup goal.\n\nSmith‚Äôs second goal came in stoppage time. Naomi Girma lobbed a short corner into the box that Tran punched back into traffic. Smith jumped on it and her shot had just enough power to get into the net. Initially ruled offside, it was confirmed as a goal after a review by video-assistant referee.\n\nHoran added to the USWNT cushion in the 77th minute. Julie Ertz had lofted a pass from deep in USWNT territory that Smith brought down and played back to Horan, her fellow Colorado native, in the middle. Horan took a touch, freezing the keeper, and then left fly from about 15 yards out.\n\nWhen is the next USWNT game?\n\nAfter a 3-0 win over Vietnam, the USWNT is next scheduled to take on the Netherlands in group play. That game will take place Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET in the United States, which is 1 p.m. Thursday in Auckland, New Zealand. (We know the time difference can be super confusing. Your best bet is to add Auckland to the world clock tab on your smart phone.)\n\nThe Netherlands game will be a rematch of the 2019 World Cup final, which the U.S. won 2-0. This year's matchup is likely to be the Americans' toughest game of group play. The Netherlands plays its first 2023 World Cup game vs. Portugal Sunday evening in Auckland.\n\nAs a reminder, the Americans are scheduled to play three group games before moving on to the knockout round.\n\nFriday, July 21: USWNT vs. Vietnam, 9 p.m. ET -- a 3-0 U.S. win.\n\nUSWNT vs. Vietnam, 9 p.m. ET -- a 3-0 U.S. win.

Horan settled herself and let fly from about 15 yards. It is her third World Cup goal all time. The score gave the U.S. a 3-0 lead over Vietnam.\n\nAlyssa Thompson, Sofia Huerta make World Cup debuts for USWNT\n\nPlenty of USWNT players got time in the Americans‚Äô first World Cup game against Vietnam.\n\nAlyssa Thompson, the teenager who was the No. 1 draft pick in the 2023 NWSL draft, subbed on in the 75th minute for the USWNT. She was the seventh player to make her World Cup debut Friday.\n\nThompson, who is just 18 and missed her high school graduation ceremony to train for the World Cup, made her first USWNT appearance Oct. 7, 2022. She has yet to score a goal for the Americans, though her speed makes her an instant threat.\n\nIn the 84th minute, Kelley O‚ÄôHara came in for Crystal Dunn, and Sofia Huerta subbed in for Emily Fox. It is also Huerta's debut.\n\nSophia Smith gives USWNT 2-0 lead at half\n\nSophia Smith‚Äôs tear continues, as she gave the USWNT a 2-0 lead in the 7th minute of first-half stoppage time.\n\nAfter a long ball from defender Naomi Girma resulted in a scrum in front of the goal, the ball got recirculated to Smith, whose off-balance shot settled into the far corner of the net.\n\nIt was initially called offside, and replays seemed to show Alex Morgan just slightly in front of the Vietnamese defender. But VAR ruled the USWNT was onside, giving Smith a brace before the half.\n\nFor the half, the USWNT had 16 shots on goal, while Vietnam had 0.\n\nMegan Rapinoe subs in for 200th cap with USWNT\n\nSuper subs Megan Rapinoe and Rose Lavelle entered the game for the USWNT in the 63rd minute, replacing Alex Morgan and Savannah DeMelo, respectively.\n\nIt is Rapinoe‚Äôs 200th appearance for the USWNT. She said before the team left for New Zealand that this World Cup will be her last, and she will retire at the end of this season. Her legacy will endure on and off the field.\n\nRose Lavelle back on track after injury\n\nLavelle being on the field was a welcome sight for many USWNT fans. The 28-year-old midfield, who scored three goals and won the Bronze Ball at the 2019 World Cup, has not played for club (OL Reign) or country since injuring her knee in a friendly against Ireland April 8. Some were worried she might be left off the U.S. roster all together.\n\nLavelle's play was key in the 2019 World Cup, as her goal in the 69th minute sealed the USWNT's win over the Netherlands in the final.\n\nYellow card for USWNT's Lindsey Horan\n\nUSWNT captain Lindsey Horan was issued a yellow card in the 56th minute, pretty much the only thing that‚Äôs gone wrong for the Americans in their opening World Cup game against Vietnam.\n\nThe U.S. leads 2-0 behind two goals from next-generation superstar Sophia Smith, as the Americans seek their third consecutive World Cup title and fifth overall.\n\nJulie Ertz is back 10 months after having baby\n\nWhen Julie Ertz took the soccer field with boys on the Phoenix Rising U-19 Academy Team ‚Äî none of whom knew they‚Äôd be sharing the pitch that day with a two-time World Cup winner ‚Äî Paul Taylor just smiled to himself.\n\n‚ÄúA few of the boys recognized her and they were saying, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs going on here?‚Äô\" Taylor, who‚Äôs known and coached Ertz since her high school days, told USA TODAY Sports. \"Well, within a few minutes they knew what was going on because it was, ‚ÄòGimme the ball. Go there. Do it this way.

Ertz ‚Äî 31 and just a few months removed from giving birth to her first child, a son named Madden ‚Äî versus a roster full of speedy, strong MLS hopefuls who only know how to play one way: fast and hard.\n\nBut, Ertz fit right in.

The PK was awarded after Trinity Rodman was tripped in the box by a Vietnam player. It was an unusual miss for Morgan, one of the best scorers in the history of U.S. soccer.\n\nMorgan missed the penalty and an open look off the rebound then collided with a Vietnam player on the second shot and was momentarily sidelined.\n\nSophia Smith scores, gives USWNT early 1-0 lead\n\nIt only took Sophia Smith 14 minutes to leave her mark on the 2023 World Cup.\n\nIn the 14th minute of the USWNT‚Äôs opener against Vietnam, Lindsey Horan passed to Alex Morgan who passed to Smith, whose left-footed strike gave the Americans a 1-0 lead. The Vietnam goal keeper had no chance to save Smith‚Äôs shot.\n\nSmith, who is making her World Cup debut, is expected to be one of the USWNT‚Äôs next superstars, a future she predicted when she was just 14.\n\nUSWNT subs, including Megan Rapinoe, already warming up\n\nThe USWNT subs, including forward Megan Rapinoe, midfielder Rose Lavelle and goalkeeper Casey Murphy are already warming up, about 30 minutes into the Americans‚Äô opening game.\n\nU.S. coach Vlatko Andonovski had said he would probably get the No. 2 keeper some playing time in the group stage so the team didn't have another debacle like they did at the Tokyo Olympics, where starter Alyssa Naeher got hurt and backup A.D. Franch had to go in cold.\n\nTrinity Rodman hurt less than one minute into World Cup opener\n\nLess than a minute into their World Cup opener, the U.S. women‚Äôs national team, already hampered by injuries, is having issues.\n\nForward Trinity Rodman landed hard, and awkwardly, on her back just 30 seconds into the game when she was taken out by a Vietnam player. In obvious pain, Rodman stood up and walked off the field on her own power right after a stretcher came out on to the field. She stood on the sideline for a minute to catch her breath before going back in.\n\nUSWNT starting lineup vs. Vietnam : Rodman at forward, Ertz at centerback\n\nThe starting lineup for the USWNT‚Äôs first World Cup game, against Vietnam, is out.\n\nThe biggest notes: Midfielders Julie Ertz and Savannah DeMelo are in, while midfielder Rose Lavelle will start on the bench. Trinity Rodman, who came off the bench to score two goals in the Americans‚Äô 2-0 win over Wales in the USWNT‚Äôs send-off game, will also start, alongside fellow forwards Alex Morgan and Sophia Smith. Megan Rapinoe, the hero of the 2019 World Cup, is also available off the bench.\n\nHere‚Äôs the USWNT's full lineup:\n\nAlyssa NaeherCrystal DunnJulie ErtzNaomi Girma Emily Fox Lindsey Horan (C)Savannah DeMeloAndi SullivanTrinity RodmanSophia SmithAlex Morgan\n\nWhen does the USWNT play?\n\nThe Americans play their first Group stage game Friday at 9 p.m. ET.

It will be her last.\n\nPresident Biden cheering on USWNT\n\nPreside Joe Biden will be watching Friday night, and probably cheering extra loud for Rapinoe. Last July, Biden awarded Rapinoe the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation‚Äôs highest civilian honor.\n\nUSWNT schedule World Cup\n\nThe Americans are scheduled to play three group games.\n\nFriday, July 21: USWNT vs. Vietnam, 9 p.m. ET\n\nUSWNT vs. Vietnam, 9 p.m. ET Wednesday, July 26: USWNT vs. Netherlands, 9 p.m. ET\n\nUSWNT vs. Netherlands, 9 p.m. ET Tuesday, Aug. 1: USWNT vs. Portugal, 3 a.m. ET\n\nWhere is the 2023 World Cup being played?\n\nFor the first time in women‚Äôs World Cup history, the tournament will be hosted by two countries, Australia and New Zealand. (The 2022 men‚Äôs World Cup was hosted by Japan and South Korea and in 2026, it will be hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada.)\n\nMany people associate Australia and New Zealand with surfing, sandy beaches and stunning swimming spots, all happening in sunny weather. But it‚Äôs winter in the southern hemisphere, which means temperatures will be anything but scorching.\n\nWhat will the weather be like at the 2023 World Cup in New Zealand and Australia?\n\nHere‚Äôs a look at the typical weather in Australia and New Zealand in July and August. Thirty minutes before kickoff Friday, the temperature was 57 degrees and partially cloudy.\n\nWhat time is it in New Zealand?\n\nAuckland is 16 hours ahead of the East Coast of the United States.\n\nSecond Gentleman Doug Emhoff in New Zealand to watch USWNT\n\nSecond Gentleman Doug Emhoff, better known as the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, is in New Zealand to cheer on the USWNT, according to his wife.\n\nEmhoff visited practice earlier this week and before making the trek all the way to Auckland, he FaceTimed with USWNT captains Alex Morgan and Lindsey Horan, asking about the wide age range of this year‚Äôs roster. He assured Morgan and Horan they‚Äôd be able to hear him cheering during the Americans‚Äô first game.\n\nPenalty kicks dominate early World Cup games\n\nPenalty kicks have ruled the first five games of the World Cup ‚Ä¶ sort of.\n\nEach of the games played so far in Australia and New Zealand have featured a penalty kick, though only one team has managed to capitalized. Australia defender Steph Catley scored in the 51st minute against Ireland Thursday, giving the Matildas a 1-0 win to open group play. It was an especially big win for the host country considering it will be without star forward Sam Kerr for at least a couple games due to a calf injury.\n\nBut probably the most noteworthy penalty kick came courtesy of Canada‚Äôs Christine Sinclair, who on Friday was trying to become the firs player in history to score in six different World Cups. In the 49th minute of Canada‚Äôs opening game against Nigeria, Sinclair, who has scored more international goals than any player, man or woman, had her chance to etch her name in the record books ‚Äî but she missed, due in part to a brilliant save by Nigeria keeper Chiamaka Nnadozie.\n\nThe game ended in a 0-0 draw, a shocking result for Canada, which won gold at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nWhat are the World Cup betting odds?\n\nUnderstanding the different World Cup betting odds and wager types is paramount to learning how to bet on sports in general. Not only can bettors predict the winner of the event ‚Äî BetRivers lists the Americans as +250 favorites ‚Äî but there is also plenty of action around which player will take home awards such as the Golden Boot, which goes to the World Cup's top goal-scorer.\n\nIn addition to shopping around for the best odds, the type of wagering you plan on doing will likely determine which online sportsbook is right for you.

(The men's World Cup, meanwhile, has been played since 1930.) The U.S. is seeking to become the first team, men‚Äôs or women‚Äôs, to win three consecutive titles.

Even the referee‚Äôs attempt to get the two to make nice didn‚Äôt calm Horan, who was still muttering when Rose Lavelle lined up in the corner.\n\nHoran got the last word.\n\n‚Äî Nancy Armour, USA TODAY Sports columnist\n\nWhen does the USWNT play next?\n\nThe USWNT concludes group play next week vs. Portugal. The game will kickoff Tuesday at 3 a.m. ET in the U.S., which is 7 p.m. in Auckland, New Zealand. Bookmark our World Cup schedule hub so you don‚Äôt miss a game.\n\nUnited States vs. Portugal\n\nEven after getting only 1 point for a tie against Netherlands, the USWNT has an edge to win Group E because of goal differential. The U.S. won its opener against Vietnam 3-0, while the Dutch only beat Portugal 1-0.\n\nThat means Netherlands can only win the group by beating Vietnam in its next match and scoring three more goals than the USWNT scores against Portugal.\n\nThere can be no letting off the gas for the Americans.\n\nLindsey Horan World Cup goal vs. Netherlands\n\nMaybe the U.S. women should try to make Lindsey Horan mad before every game. That fight from Horan, and the resilience the young Americans had to show, could end up being a positive for the defending champions. A potentially defining moment, too.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you ever want to get me mad, because I don‚Äôt react in a good way. Usually I just go and I want something more. I want to do more for my team and win these games,‚Äù Horan said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to see more and more of this in the World Cup,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great for us to have this in the group stage, to feel that kind of pressure and feel such a great opponent. So now we move forward. We learned a few lessons from this game and now we focus on Portugal.‚Äù\n\nThe USWNT is going to get pushed in the knockout rounds and is going to have to respond, and that isn‚Äôt something that can be taught in a video session or replicated in practice. It‚Äôs something that has to be experienced, so this game against the Netherlands was actually kind of perfect for the Americans.\n\nThe next challenge is for the USWNT to show this kind of grit from the opening whistle. And not need Horan to get in a cage match to spark it.\n\nUSWNT vs. Netherlands highlights: Alex Morgan almost scores game-winner\n\nThe goals were few and far between. The Dutch scored early and the Americans evened the game in the 62nd minute. It looked, briefly, like Alex Morgan scored a game-winner for the U.S., but the goal was called back for offside.\n\n(Still confused about what offside is? Let us explain.)\n\nUSWNT World Cup scenarios, Group E standings after draw vs Netherlands\n\nBecause of the USWNT‚Äôs awful first half against the Netherlands on Thursday, they have to win or draw with Portugal to ensure a spot in the knockout rounds. Lose, and the Americans could be going home after the group stage for the first time ever at the World Cup or Olympics.\n\nThere is a scenario where the Americans could lose and still advance if Vietnam beats the Netherlands and scores at least three goals. Given Vietnam has been outscored 5-0 in its first two games and was eliminated with its loss to Portugal, however, the chances of that are not good.\n\nWhich means the Americans need to win. Preferably by a large enough margin they maintain their advantage in goal differential ‚Äì currently at plus-2 ‚Äì over the Netherlands so they win the group and avoid the possibility of seeing England, Germany and France before the final.\n\nThe World Cup began in 1991, the Olympic tournament five years later, and not once has the USWNT failed to make it out of the group stage. In fact, with the exception of the 2016 Olympics, the U.S. women have gotten to the semifinals or better at every major tournament.\n\nWhy did Dani√´lle van de Donk wear a swim cap at end of USA-Netherlands game?\n\nNetherlands player Dani√´lle van de Donk went viral late in the 1-1 tie after a collision with USWNT midfielder Rose Lavelle left van de Donk with a gash on the side of her head.\n\nWhen the cut couldn‚Äôt stop bleeding, van de Donk reached for an interesting bandage: a swim camp. Videos and photos of her in the cap quickly circulated the internet and social media, leaving many to wonder what the heck was happening.\n\n‚ÄúIt just opened up and it's bleeding too much so I couldn't continue the game without it,‚Äù van de Donk said afterward.\n\n‚ÄúPlus,\" she added with a laugh, \"it‚Äôs fashionable.\"\n\nWho was the USA vs. Netherlands referee?\n\nYoshimi Yamashita, a Japan official, was the referee during the USWNT‚Äôs 1-1 draw vs. Netherlands.\n\nThis is Yamashita‚Äôs second World Cup in as many years ‚Äî last summer, she was one of six female referees to work the men‚Äôs World Cup in Qatar. The 37-year-old also regularly officiates games in Japan‚Äôs J League, the country‚Äôs top men‚Äôs league. Of course, she‚Äôs also one of the women‚Äôs games top officials. (This is her second women‚Äôs World Cup.)\n\nIn the U.S. vs. Netherlands‚Äôs game, Yamashita had to break up a heated argument and shoving match between U.S. midfielder Lindsey Horan and Netherlands‚Äô midfielder Dani√´lle van de Donk, after a hard tackle from van de Donk sent Horan to the ground in pain. Yamashita called the Lyon teammates together before she allowed the USWNT to take a corner kick.\n\n\"(Horan) came over, we just had a little talk,\" van de Donk said. \"The referee came in between us. It wasn‚Äôt very necessary. We just played football again after that.\"\n\nHoran had the last word, scoring on a header on the corner to tie the game.\n\nBut if anyone is thinking of putting Yamashita up for the Nobel Peace Prize, don't expect Horan to write the nomination.\n\n\"I don't know what (Yamashita) said,‚Äù the USWNT captain told reporters, rolling her eyes. ‚ÄúIt was too long.\"\n\n2023 World Cup: USWNT stats\n\nLindsey Horan has arguably been the most reliable player for the USWNT through two World Cup games, scoring a goal against both Vietnam and Netherlands. Sophia Smith has tallied two goals also, though both of hers came against Vietnam in the Americans‚Äô first win of group play.\n\nAdditionally, through two games Smith has notched one assist, as have Alex Morgan and super sub Rose Lavelle.\n\nAgainst Netherlands, the Dutch finished with just three shots on goal, which impressed USWNT coach Vlatko Andonovski.\n\n\"That‚Äôs a good defense,\" Andonovski said. \"Anyone that can keep the Netherlands on three shots for 90 minutes is pretty good.\"\n\nUSWNT ties Netherlands 1-1 on header from Lindsey Horan\n\nA header from Lindsey Horan in the 62nd minute gave the UWSNT a goal it desperately needed, tying Netherlands 1-1.\n\nHoran had taken a hard foul from Danielle Van de Donk, and was still complaining to the referee about it when Rose Lavalle lined up to take a corner kick. Horan tracked it the whole way and outmuscled several Dutch defenders before burying it with a thunderous header.\n\nThe Americans had several other chances over the last 30 minutes, including a goal by Alex Morgan that was waved off for being offside. There was also a screamer by Trinity Rodman that went just wide and a shot by Sophia Smith that was cleared off the line.\n\nRose Lavelle subs in for USWNT, gets yellow card\n\nRose Lavelle, the 28-year-old midfielder who had a spectacular 2019 World Cup and scored the winning goal in the USWNT‚Äôs 2-0 win over Netherlands in the final, started the second half in place of Savannah DeMelo. The Americans trail 1-0 in the second game of group play.\n\nLavelle, who also came in as a sub vs. Vietnam, has been sidelined the last couple months with a knee injury. The Americans are hoping that like 2019, she provides a spark on the field.\n\nMinutes into the second half, Lavelle was issued a yellow card for a hard tackle on a Dutch player.\n\nWhat happens if US loses to Netherlands, are they out of World Cup?\n\nNo need to panic just yet. The US-Netherlands game is just the second of group play for the Americans. They‚Äôve got Portugal next week. The top two teams from each group will advance to the knockout round ‚Äî but the second place spot from Group E is a much tougher path to the World Cup final.\n\nIf Netherlands hangs on for a win tonight vs. the USWNT, that makes the game against Portugal a must win.\n\nUSWNT trailing Netherlands 1-0 at halftime\n\nThe USWNT couldn't equal Netherlands in the first half of play, trailing 1-0 as teams went to the locker room. The Americans look all out of sorts, and the stats aren't encouraging: The U.S. possessed the ball just 33% of the time, compared to 52% for the Dutch.\n\nThe Americans have just two shots on goal, while Netherlands is 1-for-1 in that category.\n\nExpect to see multiple U.S. subs in the second half.\n\nInstant analysis from Wellington: USWNT loses composure after early score\n\nThe USWNT was playing as well as it has in a long time early in the game. It was finding spaces, connecting passes and probing the Dutch defense, and it was working, with a couple of chances. But the Americans seemed to completely lose their composure after the Netherlands' goal. They looked tentative and disorganized, and they were out of sync when they did have chances.\n\nThat said, Sophia Smith was very active in the closing minutes of the half. The Dutch were manhandling her, but if she can shake them in the second half, a goal will come.\n\n‚Äî Nancy Armour, USA TODAY Sports columnist\n\nCarli Lloyd questions USWNT's 'heart' vs. Netherlands\n\nCarli Lloyd did not hold back on the team she once played for. Nor did she forget from where she came from.\n\n\"I'm going to bring my Jersey bluntness,\" Lloyd said on the FOX halftime set in Sydney, Australia at the 2023 World Cup.\n\nAnalyzing the U.S. women's national team's first-half performance against the Netherlands, which left the Americans in a 1-0 deficit, Lloyd did that and then some: \"They look flat,\" said Lloyd, a member of the last two World Cup winning teams. \"I'm questioning their heart.\" ‚Äî Chris Bumbaca\n\nJill Roord goal gives Netherlands early 1-0 lead on USWNT\n\nThe Netherlands took a 1-0 lead on the USWNT in the 17th minute after a whole lot of miscues by the Americans. A hard shot from Jill Roord found the corner of the net, just past Alyssa Naeher's hands. It was the Netherlands' first shot of the day.\n\nThe USWNT trails in a Women's World Cup match for the first time since the July 10, 2011 Quarterfinal match vs Brazil, according to ESPN.\n\nWhat time is it in New Zealand?\n\nWellington, where the USWNT is taking on the Netherlands, is 16 hours ahead of the East Coast of the United States.\n\nWorld Cup standings\n\nIt can be hard to keep up with 2023 World Cup results given the time difference from the U.S., not to mention the different time zones across Australia and New Zealand. But we've got you covered, and you can check the standings right here.\n\nUSWNT starting lineup today\n\nWe've got the starting lineup for the USWNT's second group game of the 2023 World Cup, vs. the Netherlands, and it's the same as the other night vs. Vietnam.\n\nHere's the full lineup:\n\nGoalkeeper: Alyssa Naeher\n\nDefenders: Crystal Dunn, Naomi Girma, Julie Ertz, Emily Fox\n\nMidfielders: Lindsey Horan, Andi Sullivan, Savannah DeMelo\n\nForwards: Sophia Smith, Alex Morgan, Trinity Rodman\n\nUSWNT game tonight\n\nThe United States play their second Group stage game Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET. They face Netherlands.\n\nUSA vs. Netherlands predictions\n\nNancy Armour, columnist: It will be another tight and physical game, as they always are when the USWNT and the Netherlands play. But the USWNT tends to respond when people claim they've lost their edge on the rest of the world, and I expect no different in this game. USWNT 3-0.\n\nLindsay Schnell, reporter: It‚Äôs time for Alex Morgan to join the scoring party, and you can expect the veteran forward to do just that. This game will be a mix of old and new, with both Morgan and Sophia Smith scoring ‚Äî and I think both will come on assists from Trinity Rodman. USWNT 2-1.\n\nIs Alex Morgan playing tonight?\n\nYes, the forward is in the USWNT‚Äôs starting lineup, and looking to add to her 121-goal total. Morgan missed a penalty kick in the Americans' opener vs. Vietnam, but she's not stressed about it.\n\nUSWNT suits\n\nThe Americans wore their custom menswear-inspired ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù suits again for Game 2, arriving in style to Wellington Regional Stadium.\n\nWomen‚Äôs World Cup winners\n\nThe 2023 World Cup marks just the ninth time the event has taken place. (The men's World Cup, meanwhile, has been played since 1930.) The U.S. is seeking to become the first team, men‚Äôs or women‚Äôs, to win three consecutive titles. Germany, which won in 2003 and 2007, had a chance to do that in 2011 but couldn‚Äôt pull it off. The U.S. has won more women's World Cup titles than any other country. Here‚Äôs a list of every women‚Äôs World Cup winner.\n\n1991: United States\n\n1995: Norway\n\n1999: United States\n\n2003: Germany\n\n2007: Germany\n\n2011: Japan\n\n2015: United States\n\n2019: United States\n\nUSWNT missed opportunities vs. Vietnam: Why you shouldn‚Äôt be concerned\n\nWhen Sophia Smith has two goals and an assist in her first World Cup game, Lindsey Horan has a highlight reel‚Äôs worth of sick passes, and a roster full of newcomers get a much-needed dose of confidence, it‚Äôs hard to question the result.\n\nAnd yet, this is the United States women‚Äôs national team. Leave goals out on the field, as the USWNT did several times over in their 3-0 win against Vietnam on Saturday (Friday night in the U.S.), and those watching are going to be picky.\n\nThe good thing is, the USWNT isn‚Äôt satisfied, either.\n\nNetherlands starting lineup vs. USWNT\n\nThe Netherlands will be without two key pieces vs. the USWNT: Forwards Lineth Beerensteyn (ankle) and Vivianne Miedema (ACL) both started for the Dutch in the 2019 World Cup final, which the U.S. won 2-0. Many are looking at the 2023 meeting tonight as a rematch of sorts.\n\nBeerensteyn was injured in the Netherlands' opening game vs. Portugal, a 1-0 win for the Dutch. Miedema, 26, is one of the best players in the world. She tore her ACL in December.\n\nUSWNT jerseys and merch\n\nLooking for official the World Cup kits worn by Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and others?

Alex Morgan has been a staple of the USWNT since her debut on a snowy day in 2010.\n\nShe scored her first goal that fall and since then, she's scored 121 times for the Stars and Stripes and won back-to-back World Cups. The Southern California native was named a captain for this year's tournament where the team will attempt to make history with their third straight title. ‚Äî Victoria Hernandez\n\nHow Alex Morgan grew from USWNT rising star to powerful advocate and disruptor\n\nMost of America knows Alex Morgan as the USWNT‚Äôs active leading goal scorer, No. 5 on the all-time list. Or as one of its most marketable stars: Attractive and wholesome-looking, appealing to both soccer diehards and those who don‚Äôt know the first thing about the sport.\n\nBut Morgan is also a disruptor. Keenly aware of the advantages her stardom has afforded her, she actively uses them to advocate for others.\n\n‚ÄúShe deserves a ton more credit than she gets in this regard,‚Äù said Becca Roux, executive director of the USWNT Players Association. ‚ÄúA lot of people talk,‚Äù Roux added. ‚ÄúShe does a lot of work that people never see.‚Äù\n\nRead Nancy Armour‚Äôs full feature here.\n\nHow Naomi Girma, Sophia Smith keep friend, late Stanford teammate Katie Meyer in hearts\n\nKatie Meyer‚Äôs parents joke that their daughter would have taken a plane, a ferry, even \"a trained dolphin\" to be in the stands at this World Cup, cheering on the Stanford teammates who were so close they were more like sisters than friends.\n\nGina and Steve Meyer are certain their daughter is still riding with the U.S. women, thanks to Sophia Smith, Naomi Girma and other players using the biggest moment of their careers to make sure Katie isn‚Äôt forgotten and no one else has to feel a similar loss.\n\n\"It is so heartwarming. And heartbreaking,\" Gina Meyer told USA TODAY Sports. \"We‚Äôre just so proud of them. They didn‚Äôt have to do anything but to remember their friend, but they really want to talk about this subject, which is usually brushed under the rug.\n\n\"It‚Äôs such a beautiful thing that this whole team jumped on board and said, 'We want to be a part of this.'\"\n\nRead Nancy Armour‚Äôs full feature here.\n\nUSWNT: Why the Americans embrace the pressure of this World Cup\n\nIt doesn't matter whether the U.S. women are in sweats, training gear or those sharp-looking Nike x Martine Rose suits they're rocking at this World Cup.\n\nThey always wear a target on their backs. They're well aware of this. And they embrace it.\n\n‚ÄúThis is not team that does any sort of resting on its laurels,\" Megan Rapinoe said last month. \"That's what has been the fuel for this team always: To strive to be the very best. To try to win every single game, whether it‚Äôs in practice or actually on the field.\n\n‚ÄúFor us, it‚Äôs just about continuing to put our best foot forward and continuing to try to be dominant and be the best team in the world.‚Äù\n\nRead Nancy Armour‚Äôs full column here.\n\nWellington weather forecast: Windy\n\nUSA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour is on the ground in Wellington, New Zealand and reports that it‚Äôs very, very windy at the stadium.

The USWNT's road to glory ‚Äî and becoming the first team to win three consecutive World Cups ‚Äî will not be easy. The journey starts early Sunday morning (get that ‚òï ready!) against an old nemesis, Sweden.\n\nHere is a look at all of the Round of 16 matchups at the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand:\n\nSwitzerland vs. Spain\n\nDate/time: Saturday, 1 a.m. ET | TV: FS1\n\nSpain entered the World Cup on the short list of favorites and looked the part through its first two games, outscoring Costa Rica and Zambia 8-0. But that momentum came to a crashing halt in a 4-0 loss to Japan on Monday. Switzerland won Group A but lacked style points. After a 2-0 win over the Philippines, Switzerland played to scoreless draws against Norway and New Zealand. Jennifer Hermoso, who has two goals in this World Cup, is Spain's all-time top women's goal-scorer with 50.\n\nJapan vs. Norway\n\nDate/time: Saturday, 4 a.m. ET | TV: FS1\n\nHinata Miyazawa is tied for the lead (with Alexandra Popp of Germany, which has been eliminated) for the Golden Boot award with four goals scored for a Japan squad that arguably has been the World Cup's most impressive team so far. Japan cruised to its Group C win by outscoring opponents 11-0, including steamrolling Spain in its group stage finale. A Japan win, coupled with a United States win over Sweden, would set up a rematch of the 2015 World Cup final in the quarterfinals. Norway's Sophie Rom√°n Haug is among the group of players with three goals scored and nipping at Miyazawa's heels in the Golden Boot race. Norway won the 1995 World Cup, while Japan won the trophy in 2011.\n\nNetherlands vs. South Africa\n\nDate/time: Saturday, 10 p.m. ET | TV: Fox\n\nIt was Netherlands, and not the USWNT, that won Group E and with it a more ideal television time for viewers in the United States States. South Africa pulled off a major upset of Italy, its first win in a women's World Cup, to be the biggest surprise team in the Round of 16. The Dutch should be the favorites, however, after making the final in 2019.\n\nSweden vs. United States\n\nDate/time: Sunday, 5 a.m. ET | TV: Fox\n\nSweden and the USWNT have a long-standing rivalry. This will be the sixth straight World Cup that the two teams have met. Two years ago at the Tokyo Olympics, Sweden dominated the U.S., winning 3-0 in the opening game of the tournament. The U.S. settled for bronze in those Games, while Sweden lost to Canada in the gold medal game. At the 2016 Olympics, the USWNT lost to Sweden on penalty kicks in the quarterfinals, which represents the team's worst-ever result at a major tournament. This U.S. team, which has been disjointed the entire World Cup, will aim to avoid an undesirable place in team history.\n\nEngland vs. Nigeria\n\nDate/time: Monday, 3:30 a.m. ET | TV: FS1\n\nNigeria also is a surprise entrant in the knockout rounds. England, however, is not, and likely enters the Round of 16 as the team to beat moving forward. The reigning European champions haven't missed a beat in Australia, winning each of its group stage games with Lauren James leading the way with three goals. England is on the opposite side of the bracket from Japan, the Netherlands, Spain and United States, making a clearer path to the final for the Lionesses.\n\nAustralia vs. Denmark\n\nDate/time: Monday, 6:30 a.m. ET | TV: FS1\n\nWith New Zealand eliminated, Australia carries the torch for the co-hosts. The best Australia has ever done at a World Cup is reach the quarterfinals (2007, 2011 and 2015), but could the potential return of star player Sam Kerr and playing in front of the home fans inspire an even deeper run? Denmark ‚Äî which did not make it out of the group stage of last summer's European championships ‚Äî has conceded just one goal so far at the World Cup.\n\nColombia vs. Jamaica\n\nDate/time: Tuesday, 4 a.m. ET | TV: FS1\n\nColombia was a surprising winner of Group H ‚Äî an upset victory over Germany set in motion a chain of events in which Morocco took second in the group and the two-time World Cup champions were eliminated. Jamaica, meanwhile, not only collected its first World Cup win but also made history as the first Caribbean nation to qualify for the knockout rounds. The journey has not been easy for the Reggae Girlz, who received financial assistance ahead of the World Cup by way of a GoFundMe set by by Sandra Phillips-Brower, the mother of midfielder Havana Solaun.\n\nFrance vs. Morocco\n\nDate/time: Tuesday, 7 a.m. ET | TV: FS1\n\nMorocco sent Germany packing and reached the knockout round in its first-ever World Cup after a 1-0 win over Colombia, becoming the only World Cup newcomer to advance and the first Arab or North African nation to go beyond the group stage. The reward is a Round of 16 encounter with France, which has advanced to the quarterfinals of the last two World Cup and is one of this tournament's favorites.

The men's team also won the 2008 and 2012 European Championships.\n\n‚ÄúThey made it possible for people to watch women‚Äôs soccer the same way that they watch men‚Äôs soccer,‚Äù said 20-year-old Erika Macarro at a viewing party in Madrid. ‚ÄúThis is great for young girls who are being able to experience this. We never expected this team to get this far and they did. It shows that you always have to believe.‚ÄùJorge\n\nThe match commentator on Spanish television lauded that ‚Äúthe dream of an entire country became reality and, 4,788 days later, Spain is a world champion again,\" adding that ‚ÄúThe women‚Äôs team has won a star just like the men's team in 2010.‚Äù\n\nXavi, a men's World Cup winner with Spain and Barcelona‚Äôs current coach, said he was moved by the women‚Äôs team victory.\n\n‚ÄúThey played very well, we are very happy for all of them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey have suffered a lot to be able to play soccer and deserve a lot of credit.‚Äù\n\nThe celebrations were not comparable to those after the men's World Cup title, but the gatherings to support the women's team were still significant.\n\nThere were viewing parties organized by local officials in more than 100 cities across Spain. In Madrid, fans watched the final in bars throughout the city and at an arena where a big screen was set up for nearly 7,000 people who signed up in advance for free tickets.\n\nSome went out to the nearby plaza to celebrate, sporting the nation‚Äôs red-and-yellow colors, waving flags and chanting despite the high temperatures in the Spanish capital.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a historic moment, it shows that our women also have their worth in soccer,‚Äù said fan Esther Ros. ‚ÄúWhat they‚Äôve done is amazing.‚Äù\n\nSpain's Queen Letizia was in Sydney to cheer on La Roja and received a jersey from the players after the match.\n\n‚ÄúYou are the best soccer players in the world,\" Spain‚Äôs royal family said on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"This is FOOTBALL and it is HISTORY!‚Äù\n\nAfter the final, Olga Carmona ‚Äî who scored what turned out to be the winning goal in the first half ‚Äî learned of her father‚Äôs death. The federation did not say when Carmona‚Äôs father died or give a cause of death. It also did not say exactly when Carmona was informed about the news or who told her. She had appeared to celebrate normally with her teammates after the final whistle.\n\nThe federation said earlier that title celebrations were set to take place after the squad‚Äôs arrival in Madrid on Monday night, with a big screen and attractions set up for fans in the Spanish capital.\n\nSpain's coach had said after the semifinals that the women‚Äôs team was making the entire nation proud and had called for fans to take to the streets on Sunday.\n\n‚ÄúNow they can celebrate,‚Äù Vilda said. ‚ÄúI can only imagine what Spain looks like right now.‚Äù\n\nThere was still mixed reaction about Vilda after some players rebelled against him less than a year ago. Fifteen players stepped away from the national team for their mental health and demanding a more professional environment.\n\nMany fans jeered Vilda at the viewing party in Madrid when his name was announced.\n\n‚ÄúYou feel that the issue hasn‚Äôt been fully resolved yet, but that doesn‚Äôt change what they‚Äôve achieved,‚Äù Macarro said. ‚ÄúThe credit has to go to the players, because they are the ones out there making it happen.‚Äù\n\nSpain‚Äôs women had never advanced past the round of 16 at a World Cup, and expectations were not too high this time following the problems involving Vilda and some of the players.\n\nSpain was playing in only its third Women‚Äôs World Cup. Four years ago, it advanced to the knockout rounds but lost to eventual champions the United States.\n\n___\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/20"}]}

Out of an abundance of caution, MSWD, working with the State Water Resources Control Board, Division of Drinking Water, and the Riverside County Health Department, advises residents in these areas to use boiled tap water or bottled water for drinking and cooking as a safety precaution.

It's not just you\n\nThe entire region was knocked off kilter by Tropical Storm Hilary. So it's only appropriate for the valley's airport ‚Äî or at least the sign for it ‚Äî to be a bit out of sorts, too.\n\nOne of the major signs for Palm Springs International Airport, at Gene Autry Trail and Ramon Road, was slumped to one side Monday. Flooding had apparently shifted a large amount of the earth under the right side of its supports.\n\nFortunately, things were more centered inside the gates, where flights were taking off and arriving, mostly on time with a few delays.\n\n‚ÄîEric Hartley\n\nThe Whitewater River crossed I-10 during storm, NWS says\n\nSo much rain fell so fast from steep mountains above the valley floor that ‚Äùthe I-10 got jumped last night by the Whitewater River,‚Äù said veteran National Weather Service meteorologist Alex Tardy.\n\n\"The Whitewater River jumped its banks, broke a berm and then that just sent a wall of mud and debris partially over the I-10 last night, going over Highway 111, and then came down here (at Indian Canyon Drive) and just completely overwhelmed this area,\" he said in a video he posted online after touring the area on Monday.\n\n‚ÄúThis is different, this is really massive,‚Äù he said of the unusual storm, which dumped water on normally dry mountain peaks as well as wetter ones, including Mount San Gorgonio and Mount San Jacinto.\n\n‚ÄúSo we got it in all directions ... with an average storm you don‚Äôt typically get that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis magnitude, I've never seen this broad of an area of flash flooding.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt has also damaged and undercut the two main rail lines, so you have no trains coming in or out of the Coachella Valley.‚Äù\n\nHe said the boulders unleashed by the storm under cover of darkness were ‚Äúmassive ... could easily destroy your car‚Äù and that the debris flow was ‚Äúeasily four to six feet.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄîJanet Wilson\n\nCathedral City firefighters rescue 14 seniors from home care facility\n\nFourteen people were trapped in an elderly home care facility overnight in Cathedral City, Cathedral City Fire Department Battalion Chief Robert Williams said.

Larson Foundation Trauma Center, with abandoned golf cart submerged in water. However, that did not cause interruptions in care.\n\n‚ÄúThe flooding yesterday in the ambulance bay and water in a back hallway was resolved in just over an hour,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPatient care space was not affected and care in the Emergency Department continues without delay.\"\n\nWholihan added that some Eisenhower Health clinic locations were closed Monday, such as its urgent care center in Palm Springs, ‚Äúprimarily due to employees being challenged by road closures.‚Äù Eisenhower Urgent Care in Rancho Mirage is open to patients, while Eisenhower Urgent Care in La Quinta may open later in the day when more staff have arrived.\n\n‚ÄúData and communications systems are functional, allowing Eisenhower to notify patients of any delays or cancellations of appointments,‚Äù Wholihan said. ‚ÄúEisenhower Health thanks its remarkable teams for their tremendous efforts to ensure the safety of staff and patients throughout the weekend.‚Äù\n\nSimilarly, Desert Care Network hospitals, which includes Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs, JFK Memorial Hospital in Indio and Hi-Desert Medical Center in Joshua Tree, are fully operational and experienced ‚Äúminor issues that were quickly remediated without disrupting patient care,‚Äù spokesperson Richard Ramhoff said.\n\n‚ÄúAs a result of localized flooding in some areas of the community that has made travel potentially dangerous, we have rescheduled elective cases out of precaution,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe remain open to visitors but ask everyone to follow the guidelines of emergency agencies.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄîEma Sasic\n\nCity of Coachella declares State of Emergency\n\nCoachella has officially declared a local state of emergency in the city as a result of extreme damage and compromised safety resulting from the effects of Tropical Storm Hilary, the city announced via press release. The proclamation will go before City Council for ratification this week.\n\nThis emergency proclamation could help make the Coachella eligible for potential federal and state assistance, including repairs to damaged areas. It also allows the city to quickly procure items necessary for emergency response and repair.\n\nCity staff is currently removing excess water from areas that have been flooded, down trees are being removed to eliminate road obstruction, and damage assessments are being made for all public parks, roadways, bridges and city facilities.\n\n‚ÄîNiki Kottmann\n\nCathedral City officials announce road closure updates\n\nThe following roads are still closed in Cathedral City:\n\n‚Ä¢Vista Chino between Date Palm Drive and Avenida Maravilla\n\n‚Ä¢Date Palm Drive between Vista Chino and 30th Ave\n\n‚Ä¢Ortega Road between Moreno Road and Via De Anza\n\n‚Ä¢Vista Chino at the wash (per the direction of Palm Springs)\n\n‚Ä¢Los Gatos Road at Date Palm Drive\n\n‚Ä¢Via De Anza at Ocotillo Road\n\n‚ÄîNiki Kottmann\n\nJoshua Tree National Park reopening for day use only Tuesday\n\nThis past weekend, Joshua Tree National Park experienced heavy rains and flooding from Tropical Storm Hilary.

All visitor centers and paved roads will be open. All dirt roads and campgrounds will remain closed until further assessment can be done.

Between Monterey Avenue and Bob Hope Drive, two lanes are currently open. All four lanes are open west of Bob Hope Drive.\n\nThe agency also announced that it has reduced the closure of the eastbound lanes to the stretch between Date Palm Drive and Bob Hope Drive. A detour has been set for eastbound traffic that will direct it to exit at Date Palm Drive, go north on Varner Road and reenter the freeway at Monterey Avenue.\n\nCHP said it has not determine how long the eastbound lanes will need to remain closed for.\n\nThe reopening of the westbound lanes, combined with the reopening of Highway 111, means that drivers leaving Palm Springs will again be able to access the inland empire and points to the west, which they were previously cut off from. The reopenings also mean that people in Desert Hot Springs will again be able to access Palm Springs.\n\n‚ÄîPaul Albani-Burgio\n\nRancho Mirage announces road closures\n\nRancho Mirage is the latest desert city to announce road closures Monday:\n\nFrank Sinatra Drive, Country Club Drive and Parkview Drive are closed at the Whitewater Wash in both directions\n\nRamon Road is closed in both directions between Los Alamos Road and Interstate 10\n\nBob Hope Drive is closed in both directions from Casino Way to Interstate 10\n\n‚ÄîPaul Albani-Burgio\n\nLa Quinta residents assess damage\n\nIt was a surreal scene in La Quinta on Monday morning as residents walked their dogs around Civic Center Park or sat at the local coffee shop, enjoying a beautiful Monday morning, while fallen trees and damage from Tropical Storm Hilary were all around them.\n\nLa Quinta seemed to be hit particularly hard by the wind.\n\nThe La Quinta Village shopping center parking lot had a downed palm tree blocking the entrance, a flooded area near a bank and a snapped off tree by the Starbucks drive thru. Despite all that, it was business as usual.\n\nAcross the street from that shopping center is La Quinta City Hall, and its parking lot featured three uprooted trees.\n\nThe attached Civic Center Park was particularly unlucky. Multiple large trees were uprooted or snapped in half. Several residents on their morning walk through the park stopped to take pictures of the damage.\n\nA short drive along Avenue 52 in front of the Tradition Golf Club, was particularly startling as it seemed like every other tree was damaged as workers with chainsaws were clearing away broken branches.\n\n‚ÄúWe made it through without any damage, really, but there are so many trees down around this area,‚Äù said David Eves, who was with his wife, Sheila, and dog, Libby, sitting outside Starbucks at the La Quinta Village. The couple lives at PGA West. ‚ÄúThey did a good job of getting the word out about the storm, so we were prepared and canceled a trip to stay home to be at our house during it, but not much happened at our place. This is definitely something unique and something you don‚Äôt expect to occur. It really spiced up our summer, I guess you could say.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄîShad Powers\n\nMountain-area rainfall totals impress\n\nThe greatest storm rainfall occurred high above the Coachella Valley and Inland Empire areas, although water and mud came roaring down creeks and mountain slopes toward the desert floor. Upper Mission Creek in the San Bernardino Mountains got a whopping 14.1 inches in 48 hours, while 11.73 inches fell at Raywood Flats, and Mount San Jacinto by the Palm Springs Tramway saw 11.74 inches, according to National Weather Service San Diego meteorologist Casey Oswant.\n\n‚ÄîJanet Wilson\n\nAvenue 44 in Indio partially destroyed\n\nThe roadway at Avenue 44 in north Indio east of Golf Center Parkway has eroded away because of rushing water through the wash, which runs just south of Interstate 10.\n\n‚ÄîLarry Bohannan\n\nRoads begin to open up in Palm Springs\n\nThese roads are now open as of 10:45 a.m. in Palm Springs:\n\nEl Cielo Road between Ramon Road and Sonora Road\n\nFarrell Drive between Ramon Road and Mesquite Avenue\n\nEl Cielo Road between Ramon Road and Sonora Road\n\nHighway 111 between Windy Point and Palm Springs city limits\n\nOutbound Highway 111 from Gateway to I-10\n\nGolf Club at the wash\n\nAraby Drive at the Palm Canyon Wash\n\n‚ÄîNiki Kottmann\n\nEvacuation orders lifted in Imperial County\n\nIn the aftermath of Tropical Storm Hilary, Imperial County authorities have lifted evacuation orders for the townships of Ocotillo, Salton City, Salton Sea Beach, Bombay Beach, and Desert Shores. Residents are now permitted to return to their homes.\n\n‚ÄîJanet Wilson\n\nState and national park visitor centers closed across the region\n\nTeams at the area's sweeping national and state recreation areas were assessing damage Monday morning. Joshua Tree National Park remains closed for now. All visitor centers in the San Bernadino National Forest are closed for the safety of visitors and staff today, but campgrounds and other facilities remain open, with caution advised, said spokesman Gustavo Bahena.\n\nThe Palm Springs Tramway was already closed all month for scheduled maintenance.\n\nClosed visitor centers in the national forest include: Santa Rosa & San Jacinto Mountains National Monument; Lytle Creek - Cajon Pass Recreation Area; Fuller Mill Creek Picnic Area; and Barton Flats Family Campground.\n\n‚ÄúDuring the summer, a typical weekend would be really busy at all of these visitor centers, and even on a Monday, if you have campers staying over from the weekend,‚Äù said San Bernardino National Forest spokesman Gustavo Bahena. \"Our primary concern is the safety of our visitors and our employees because of possibly hazardous conditions.‚Äù\n\nOcotillo Wells State Park inland units are all closed but expected to re-open tomorrow, including the popular Ocotillo Wells off-road vehicle riding area, said Superintendent Andrew Ahlberg. \"They're still out doing assessments. From what I'm hearing, it is very, very wet. Some of the staff are unable to continue down trails, they had turned around so they wouldn't themselves get stuck.

CAL Trans said I-10 would remain closed until further notice.\n\nTrained weather-spotters reported water flowing across I-10 in multiple locations on both the eastbound and westbound lanes.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Officer David Torres said late Monday morning that he did not have an ETA for the opening of Interstate 10. He said they are hopeful to at least open the section from Haugen-Lehmann to Highway 111 once the ‚Äúall clear‚Äù is received from the City of Palm Springs.\n\nMany other roads are closed due to storm damage and flooding across the Coachella Valley, leaving significant clean-up work to allow residents to travel across the valley again.\n\nRoad closures in Palm Springs:\n\nAccording to California Highway Patrol and Palm Springs Police Department, the following roads remain closed until further notice.\n\nIndian Canyon Drive between Sunrise Parkway and Train Station Road\n\nGene Autry Trail between Via Escuela and RR bridge\n\nVista Chino between Clubhouse View Drive and Cathedral City limits\n\nLawrence Crossley Road (Golf Club) between East Palm Canyon Drive and 34th Avenue\n\nDinah Shore bridge between Lawrence Crossley and Cathedral Canyon Drive\n\nCHP has closed Interstate 10 between Bob Hope Drive and Haugen-Lehmann Way\n\nCrews are assessing the road damage and mud residual on arterials which will take time.

Motorists are advised to use an alternate route, such as State Route 18, said a spokesman with the national forest.\n\nCrews repairing sinkhole\n\nThe heavy rain caused a 15-foot by 15-foot sinkhole to develop at the intersection of Washington Avenue and Fred Waring Drive around 3:30 p.m on Sunday, and the rushing water falling into the pit damaged a Coachella Valley Water District sewer line.\n\nCVWD operations and engineering crews have been working to fix the line throughout Monday. Lorraine Garcia, public information officer for CVWD, said there is no timetable on when the line and sinkhole will be repaired, but added that it has not caused an interruption in service.\n\nSouthbound traffic on Washington has been reduced to one lane at that busy intersection that divides La Quinta and Indian Wells near Southwest Church.\n\n‚ÄîShad Powers\n\nStatus of mail delivery uncertain Monday\n\nA staff member who answered the phone at the Palm Springs Post Office said the team there is still trying to determine if mail will be delivered out of that office today.

On Saturday, the high temperature recorded by the National Weather Service at Phoenix Sky Harbor only reached 95 degrees.\n\nThe last time highs did not reach 100 degrees was on June 13.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been clouded over for most of the day, and we‚Äôve also had convection out in the west so we‚Äôve had some rain-cooled air that‚Äôs moved into the area,‚Äù said Alex Young, a meteorologist with the weather service.\n\nWith Hurricane Hilary moving through the Baja California peninsula over the weekend, the effects of the storm are expected to have an effect on Arizona on Sunday, according to Young.\n\nFEMA director urges residents to be prepared for 'dangerous storm'\n\nOfficials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Saturday that they are preparing for ‚Äúheavy impacts from rain and flooding‚Äù to communities in Hurricane Hilary‚Äôs path.\n\n‚ÄúAs you heard from the president yesterday at Camp David, he is fully briefed and he has encouraged everyone to make sure that they are aware of what this dangerous storm is potentially going to bring, and to listen to their local officials on the steps they can take to make sure they are keeping safe,‚Äù said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell.\n\nCriswell said she has been in touch with California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Nevada Gov. John Lombardo about their preparations for the storm. As of midday Saturday, she said she had not reached out to Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs certainly something I can do as I continue to get updates on what the significance and severity of this storm will be,‚Äù Criswell said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll look with my team and see if they have something scheduled for the day. The important part is, I always like to reach out to the governors to open up that line of communication.‚Äù\n\nThe agency also has staff embedded in local emergency management offices as the Southwest braces for the storm.\n\nCriswell urged residents to be prepared. She highlighted three immediate steps they should take to ensure they are hurricane ready:\n\nHave a plan to communicate with family and friends before, during and after the storm.\n\nSet up emergency weather alerts and ensure you can receive them on your mobile phone.\n\nFollow the direction of local officials. They are most familiar with immediate conditions in your area.\n\nSky Harbor sees flight delays and cancellations as Hurricane Hilary nears landfall\n\nNearly 20 flights had been canceled and about 70 were delayed from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport as of midday Saturday, according to the airport‚Äôs website.\n\nSaturday‚Äôs canceled flights included several to Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Los Cabos, Mexico. About 25 additional flight cancellations had already been announced for Sunday, with destinations ranging from Denver to St. Louis.\n\nThe travel interruptions came as Hurricane Hilary prompted even more delays and cancellations at other Southwestern hubs.\n\nLos Angeles International Airport and San Diego International Airport were experiencing flight delays averaging 45 minutes as of midday Saturday, per the Federal Aviation Administration. Delay times at both airports are expected to increase as Hurricane Hilary barrels toward Southern California.\n\nHilary's path in northern Arizona shifts westward\n\nMuch of northern and central Arizona could be spared the worst of Hurricane Hilary's impacts as radar suggests the storm is moving further west.\n\nScattered storms are expected today in Flagstaff and heading west with isolated storms elsewhere across northern and central Arizona, according to the National Weather Service in Flagstaff. But while the moisture looks to be moving further west, the agency warns that any of the weekend's storms still have the potential to produce heavy rainfall and subsequent flash flooding.\n\nRain is expected to pick up tonight through Sunday, mostly confined to far western Arizona including much of Mohave County.\n\nWith up to an inch of rain projected to fall in the area through the weekend, large swaths of the county including Kingman, Lake Havasu, Fort Mohave and Bullhead City are all under a flood watch until 5 p.m. Monday.\n\nFar western, southwest Arizona to face brunt of Hurricane Hilary\n\nThe greatest impact from Hurricane Hillary is expected in Southern California, far western and southwest Arizona, according to the National Weather Service. Currently a Category 3, the hurricane is expected to make landfall midday Sunday on the northwest Baja California coast, moving across southern California in the afternoon and night.\n\nThe weather service is also saying that Sunday will see strong and severe thunderstorms in southwest Arizona ‚Äî generally along and southwest of Flagstaff, Phoenix and Tucson. There will be intense rainfall and flash flooding, along with damaging winds and isolated spin-up tornadoes.\n\nHurricane Hilary downgraded to Category 3 storm\n\nHurricane Hilary weakened from a Category 4 to Category 3 storm as it headed toward the West Coast, according to The National Hurricane Center.\n\nOn the morning of Aug. 19, Hurricane Hilary was about 235 miles southwest of the Baja California peninsula, moving north northwest and producing powerful winds of up to 125 mph.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center expected Hilary‚Äôs impact would produce ‚Äúcatastrophic and life-threatening flooding likely over Baja California and the southwestern U.S. through Monday.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî The Republic staff\n\nFlood watch in effect for southern Arizona\n\nA flood watch in Yuma and La Paz counties was in effect from Saturday morning until Monday 5 p.m., as flash flooding could be caused by excessive rainfall over the weekend.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Phoenix, Saturday through Sunday will see most of Hilary's impact for southwestern Arizona, describing the conditions as \"deteriorating\" for areas such as Yuma and La Paz counties.\n\nStrong storm activity in Yuma County was reported as early as Saturday at 6 a.m., according to the weather service.\n\n‚Äî Joanna Jacobo Rivera\n\nWhere to get sandbags in Pinal County\n\nPinal County asked residents to call ahead to pick up sandbags at various locations in preparation for monsoon weather that could hit Arizona.

The city will evaluate, based on weather forecasts, whether the station should stay open into next week.\n\nThe station will be stocked with sand and empty bags for residents to self-fill sandbags while supplies last. A limited number of bags and sand may be available after 7 p.m.\n\nShovels may be available at the station as well, but the city recommends residents bring their own shovels when visiting the sandbag station. Residents are allowed five sandbags per vehicle.\n\n‚Äî Michelle Cruz\n\nWhat will Hilary bring to Arizona?\n\nThe historic storm's effects are already being felt. Rain chances are increasing, with the National Weather Service forecasting strong to severe thunderstorms with concerns of local damaging winds and flooding starting Friday. Increased moisture levels spurred showers around parts of the state on Thursday.\n\n\"Think of it as a more widespread monsoon event,\" said Tom Frieders, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service. \"We're expecting several rounds of storms, especially across northwest portions of the state.\"\n\nA flood watch for western Coconino County went into effect early Friday morning and will last until 6 a.m. Saturday.

Four other people died in storm-related incidents as Ian churned into North Carolina.\n\nMore than 1,600 people have been rescued from Hurricane Ian‚Äôs path in parts of southwest and central Florida since last week, Gov.

They were securing homes for neighbors who weren‚Äôt on the island, and by the time they finished, they no longer felt like they had time to leave, the couple told CNN.\n\nThe Schulz‚Äôs home took on several feet of storm surge and ‚Äúpretty much everything‚Äù in the house is ruined.\n\nDespite all the destruction, Emig told CNN she remained hopeful her community would rebuild. ‚ÄúSanibel‚Äôs full of a lot of working people who care about the island and we‚Äôll be back,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSanibel will be back.‚Äù\n\nFor now, many homes in that once-tranquil island community ‚Äúare not livable,‚Äù Sanibel Fire Chief William Briscoe said previously, also noting many homes are off their foundations and alligators and snakes are present across the island.\n\nIn addition to the devastation on the island itself, Ian ripped away several parts of the causeway that was Sanibel‚Äôs only access to Florida‚Äôs mainland, leaving dozens of people stranded and hindering recovery efforts.\n\nOn Wednesday, DeSantis also toured the damage on Sanibel Wednesday for the first time.\n\n‚ÄúYou can go over it in a helicopter and you see damage, but it does not do it justice until you are actually on the ground, and you see concrete utility poles sawed off right in half, massive power lines everywhere, massive amounts of debris,‚Äù he said.\n\nOfficials said most electrical poles, transmission lines and wastewater systems remain down, meaning a return to normal is still a while away.\n\nIan damaged the Sanibel Causeway that connects Fort Myers to the island community. Joe Cavaretta/South Florida Sun-Sentinel/AP\n\nIt could take a month or longer just to restore power to some areas of Sanibel and Pine islands, Lee County Electric Cooperative spokesperson Karen Ryan told CNN. ‚ÄúIt will be much easier to restore power once we can gain access to the island,‚Äù she said.\n\nAn estimated 6,400 people lived in the City of Sanibel as of April 2021, according to the US Census Bureau. The island is also home to a number of hotels and resorts and sees a significant amount of tourists each year.\n\nDeSantis has directed transportation authorities to prioritize the repair of the Sanibel Causeway.\n\nNeighboring Pine Island residents should be able to access their community by car later Wednesday, DeSantis announced, when crews are expected to complete a temporary fix for a part of a damaged bridge washed away in the storm.\n\nResidents lost both their homes and their jobs\n\nAt Salty Sam‚Äôs Marina in Fort Myers, owner Darrell Hanson and many of his employees ‚Äì about 120 at this time of year and up to 200 at the height of tourist season ‚Äì are working to salvage what they can, some of them dealing with the loss of their livelihoods and personal property.\n\n‚ÄúIn the parking lot, we must have had about 12 feet of water. Everything on the first floor was ‚Ä¶ destroyed,‚Äù said Hanson, who has so far been unable to access his own home on Sanibel Island. ‚ÄúAll our gift stores and restaurants and everything, they‚Äôve lost all their inventory. It‚Äôs hundreds of thousands of dollars that each business lost.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut the employees have all come together,‚Äù he said, choking back tears. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all out there working their butt off.‚Äù\n\nEmployee Ty Landers, who works on a pirate cruise at the marina, rode out the storm at his family‚Äôs home in Fort Myers. Fortunately the home and his family are safe, he said.\n\nBut some of his coworkers weren‚Äôt so lucky.\n\n‚ÄúMany of our employees, even on the pirate ships, my crewmates, they lost their houses, they lost everything,‚Äù Landers told CNN. ‚ÄúHopefully when the time‚Äôs right they‚Äôll come back. But right now their lives fell apart, and they‚Äôre putting it back together.‚Äù\n\nSalty Sam's Marina, which employs about 120 people this time of year, was heavily damaged by Hurricane Ian. CNN\n\nDespite ongoing struggles, ‚Äòthere‚Äôs hope to rebuild‚Äô\n\nMany areas remain under boil water notices since the storm made landfall, damaging critical infrastructure, as well as homes.\n\nResidents of Lee and Charlotte counties ‚Äì the two counties with the highest death tolls from the hurricane ‚Äì will be able to get temporary blue coverings with fiber-reinforced sheeting at no cost for their roofs to help reduce further damage, according to a Charlotte County news release.\n\nIn Charlotte County, which is north of Fort Myers, public schools will be closed until further notice after several of its 22 schools were damaged by Ian. ‚ÄúThe storm lasted here for over 12 hours, just hammering away. Nothing is safe right now,‚Äù Charlotte County public schools spokesperson Mike Riley said.\n\nPublic schools in Collier County are set to open Thursday, according to district spokesperson Chad Oliver, who added he did not know how many kids will show up for classes. More than than 22% of the district‚Äôs teachers live in hard-hit Lee County, but Oliver says the district is confident it is ready to reopen with the help of more than 800 substitute teachers.\n\nFlorida hospitals have also been struggling. Emergency departments sustained damage, staffing is impacted as hospital workers were displaced or lost their vehicles, and some facilities lost reliable access to water.\n\n‚ÄúWe were ready, we had our generators all ready. We had plenty of fuel. What we couldn‚Äôt anticipate and didn‚Äôt anticipate was the loss of water from our utility companies,‚Äù said Dr. Larry Antonucci, president and CEO of Lee Health.\n\nMembers of the Miami-Dade Task Force 1 Search and Rescue team look Tuesday through debris for victims in Matlacha, Florida.

Some coastal homes in the area collapsed and a few toppled structures fell into the sea or were surrounded by floodwater, pictures sent from the province Saturday morning showed.\n\nIn Channel-Port aux Basques, houses were washed away, Mayor Brian Button said in a Facebook video Saturday.

It does not affect the storm‚Äôs ability to produce intense winds, rain and storm surge, it just means the storm‚Äôs interior mechanics have changed.\n\nFiona had the potential to become Canada‚Äôs version of Superstorm Sandy, Chris Fogarty, Canadian Hurricane Centre manager, said before Fiona hit. Sandy in 2012 affected 24 states and all of the eastern seaboard, causing an estimated $78.7 billion in damage.\n\nAn unofficial barometric pressure of 931.6 mb was recorded Saturday at Hart Island, which would make Fiona the lowest pressure landfalling storm on record in Canada, according to the Canadian Hurricane Centre.", "authors": ["Jason Hanna Susannah Cullinane Christina Maxouris", "Jason Hanna", "Susannah Cullinane", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/27/weather/hurricane-ian-cuba-florida-tuesday/index.html", "title": "Hurricane Ian now heading toward Florida where officials urge ...", "text": "Editor‚Äôs Note: Affected by the storm?

An apparent tornado at North Perry Airport in Broward County caused ‚Äúsignificant damage‚Äù to several aircraft and hangars, Mayor Michael Udine said on Twitter.\n\nThe Category 3 storm was churning 120 mph winds Tuesday night with its center roughly 180 miles south-southwest of the city of Punta Gorda, close to where it‚Äôs expected to make landfall in less than 24 hours. City authorities there announced Tuesday night emergency services, including police and fire response will be suspended until after the storm passes, when it will be safe to resume response calls again.\n\nFor days, forecasters and Florida officials have warned this will be a dangerous storm with life-threatening storm surge and flooding and fierce winds. Tuesday night, Ian‚Äôs hurricane-force winds extended 40 miles out from its center and tropical storm-force winds extended roughly 140 miles out, with some parts of the Florida Keys reporting wind gusts stronger than 50 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n‚ÄúI implore, I urge everyone that is in an evacuation zone that has been asked to evacuate ‚Äì the time is now. You must evacuate now. There will be a time when it will not be safe to travel the roads,‚Äù Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie warned in a news conference Tuesday evening.\n\n‚ÄúThere will come a point in time when local public safety officials will not be able to respond to your cry for help. You may be left to fend for yourself,‚Äù he added.\n\nIan will likely make landfall Wednesday afternoon to evening between Sarasota and Port Charlotte as a Category 3 or Category 4 hurricane. (Hurricanes are designated as Category 4 when winds reach speeds of 130 mph to 156 mph.) Whichever of the two it is, one forecaster warned the storm still be a ‚Äúlarge and destructive hurricane‚Äù for the state, urging residents to listen to local leaders‚Äô advice.\n\nAnd it‚Äôs not just southwest Florida taking a hit.\n\n‚ÄúThis is going to be a lot of impacts that will be felt far and wide throughout the state of Florida,‚Äù Gov. Ron DeSantis said in Tuesday evening‚Äôs news conference. ‚ÄúAs the storm moves in, you‚Äôre going to potentially have (evacuation) directives issued from folks in the interior of our state or even the east coast of the state for low-lying areas that absolutely could end up flooding.‚Äù\n\nAll of Cuba in the dark\n\nIan made landfall in Cuba earlier Tuesday as a Category 3 hurricane. Tuesday night, Cuban state media reported the entire island was in a nationwide blackout. Cuban officials said the hurricane caused the power outage and they hoped to begin restoring electricity late Tuesday or early Wednesday.\n\nEarlier, state electric company Uni√≥n El√©ctrica de Cuba said they would keep power off in Havana to avoid deaths and property damage until the weather improved. The company said they had turned the power off in the area ahead of the storm to avoid electrocutions and to prevent fires.\n\nCuba‚Äôs tobacco-rich Pinar del Rio province lost power because of the storm, according to Cuban state television. Floodwater covered fields and fallen trees lay in front of buildings in San Juan y Martinez, a town in the province, images from state media outlet Cubadebate show.\n\nUp to 16 inches of rain and mudslides and flash flooding were possible in western Cuba, the hurricane center said. Mayelin Suarez, a resident of Pinar del Rio city, told Reuters the storm made for the darkest night of her life.\n\n‚ÄúWe almost lost the roof off our house,‚Äù Suarez told Reuters. ‚ÄúMy daughter, my husband and I tied it down with a rope to keep it from flying away.‚Äù\n\nA man walks down a street in Havana, Cuba, on Tuesday during Hurricane Ian.

Most were in Lee County, which encompasses Fort Myers.\n\nMandatory evacuation orders were issued for parts of counties in the hurricane warning area stretching from north of Tampa to the Fort Myers area. That included Pinellas, Hillsborough and Manatee counties in the Tampa area, Hernando, Sarasota and Charlotte counties, and parts of Lee County. Emergency shelters have been opened.\n\nIn Pinellas County, where more than 440,000 people are under mandatory evacuations, Clearwater Mayor Frank Hibbard told CNN Tuesday afternoon it was becoming too late for residents to leave.\n\n‚ÄúIf you have not yet evacuated, if you have not yet gotten supplies, it‚Äôs becoming too late. You just need to shelter-in-place and wait out the storm,‚Äù the mayor said.\n\nState agencies were also working to help prepare and protect senior residents, conducting on-site visits to nursing homes and assisted living facilities in the path of the storm.\n\nAhead of the storm, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also issued a state of emergency Tuesday, warning of heavy rainfall and damaging winds in the state later in the week.\n\nSign up for CNN‚Äôs free Weather Brief newsletter to get email updates on Hurricane Ian.\n\nWhat the threats are\n\nThe approaching storm threatens several perils for west-central Florida:\n\n‚Ä¢ Storm surge: A storm surge warning ‚Äì meaning the surge could threaten life ‚Äì is in effect for much of Florida‚Äôs west coast, from Suwanee in the Big Bend region to the peninsula‚Äôs tip in the Everglades.\n\nA warning also is in effect for far northeastern Florida‚Äôs coast, from near the Georgia state line down to Marineland, as well as for St. John‚Äôs River further inland.\n\nThe worst ‚Äì 8 to 12 feet ‚Äì is forecast for Florida‚Äôs west coast from just south of Bradenton down to Bonita Beach south of Fort Myers, the hurricane center said.

Trees were either knocked down or standing and stripped bare. Debris could also be seen flying down the street and the only vehicle visible in the city had ‚ÄúSTORMCHASER‚Äù written on the side.\n\nThe storm made landfall as a Category 4 near Cayo Costa around 3:05 p.m., with winds near 150 mph, according to the hurricane center. At this point, Hurricane Ian is tied for the strongest storm to make landfall on the west coast of the Florida peninsula, matching the wind speed of Hurricane Charley in 2004. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday Ian will rank as one of the top five hurricanes to ever hit the Florida peninsula, behind Hurricanes Andrew (1992) and Michael (2018).\n\nIan weakened to a Category 1 hurricane by Wednesday night as it moved across central Florida, churning sustained winds of 90 mph.\n\nNearly 2 million Florida utility customers were without power as of 6 p.m., according to PowerOutage.us. Officials in Cape Coral and Punta Gorda reported significant impacts, and the storm surge set records for the highest water levels ever observed in Fort Myers and Naples.\n\n‚ÄúThe storm surge is very significant. We‚Äôre seeing cars and boats float down the street. We‚Äôre seeing trees nearly bent in half,‚Äù Frank Loni, an architect from California staying in Fort Myers Beach for the storm, said midday Wednesday. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs quite a bit of chaos on the streets.‚Äù\n\nDeSantis said storm surge from Ian has hit up to 12 feet in some areas.‚ÄùIt is our meteorologist‚Äôs view that the storm surge has likely peaked and will be less in the coming hours,‚Äù he said.\n\nIan is expected to retain hurricane strength through the day and into tomorrow as the center of the storm moves northeast over the Florida Peninsula, passing close to Orlando and Daytona Beach, before moving back into the Atlantic Ocean Thursday afternoon. Hurricane warnings have been issued for not only southwest Florida, but also much of central Florida from coast to coast.\n\nA number of other weather advisories have also been issued throughout Florida. A flash flood emergency impacting more than 300,000 people is in effect south central Sarasota county, southeast Manatee, northwest Desoto, Hardee, and northwest Highlands counties through 10:45 p.m..\n\nAn extreme wind warning is in effect for Sebrin, Avon Park and Arcadia until 9:30 p.m. for extremely dangerous hurricane winds as the storm passes.\n\n‚ÄòThe worst storm I have ever seen‚Äô\n\nWater levels in Fort Myers rose more than 6 feet over the span of seven hours and were still rising as strong winds continue to push water from the Gulf of Mexico ashore, according to CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here since the mid-70s, this is actually ‚Äì by far ‚Äì the worst storm I have ever seen,‚Äù Fort Myers Mayor Kevin Anderson told CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper.\n\nAbout 96% of Fort Myers is without electricity, Anderson told CNN‚Äôs Anderson Cooper late Wednesday. The mayor does not know how many people did not heed evacuation orders, but there are thousands currently in shelters.\n\nAnderson also emphasized that it is still unsafe to be outside and that people should stay away from floodwaters.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no telling what‚Äôs in those waters, they are not safe. You know you could step on debris. You know, there‚Äôs runoff from sewers and just ‚Äì it‚Äôs just not a good situation,‚Äù he said.\n\nJennifer Dexter, a spokesperson for the town of Fort Myers Beach, told CNN backup water pumps are down.\n\n‚ÄúWhen the backup water pump system goes down, that shows you how serious it is,‚Äù Dexter said. A boil water notice went into effect due to storm surge, loss of power and damage to the backup generators for the drinking water supply.\n\nPresident Biden spoke with the mayor Wednesday, the White House said in a statement. The two leaders ‚Äúdiscussed Fort Myers‚Äô ongoing needs including support for the elderly members of the community, families that live in mobile homes and other community members who are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of the storm,‚Äù according to a readout of the call provided by the White House.\n\nThe President also tried to reach the mayors of Cape Coral, Sarasota and the Chair of Charlotte County, Florida, but was unable to reach them and left messages instead, the White House said.\n\nHurricane Ian made landfall in Florida as a dangerous Category 4 hurricane Wednesday afternoon. Lokman Vural Elibol/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nIn Tampa, Mayor Jane Castor urged residents Wednesday to shelter in place, saying the worst of the storm is ‚Äúyet to come.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe are expecting that we‚Äôre going to get the majority of the rain and the higher winds starting about 8 p.m. and they‚Äôre going to last throughout the night,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe are still expecting widespread flooding throughout our city, and anywhere from tropical storm wind speeds to the possibly of category one hurricane wind speeds.‚Äù\n\nCastor said that officials are expecting flooding sometime in the next 24 hours.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to see the continued rain, the rain will increase dramatically and then that water is going to come back into the Bay as Hurricane Ian continues its northeasterly trajectory.‚Äù\n\nFurther south, The Olde Naples Seaport, a community of condos that overlooks the Naples Bay, was consumed by storm surge, according to video shot by Graham Pederson. Pederson experienced knee-high water trying to escape.\n\nIn another video shot from the second floor, wind is seen whipping trees and trucks nearly submerged by the water. Pederson retreated to the second floor to wait out the storm, his brother-in-law Kyle Wendel told CNN.\n\nVideo was taken from Estero Blvd in Fort Myers Beach, Florida, on Wednesday, September 28, 2022. Frank Loni\n\nDeSantis said Wednesday calls for help are coming into several counties due to the storm. The governor said emergency responders have received calls from people in evacuation zones that did not evacuate. Those calls are being logged, he said.\n\n‚ÄúLocal first responders will deploy as soon as it‚Äôs safe to do so,‚Äù DeSantis said. ‚ÄúBy and large until the storm passes, they are not going to go into a situation for rescue and put their own folks at risk.‚Äù\n\nDeSantis requested Biden approve a major disaster declaration for all 67 counties in the state due to Hurricane Ian, his office said in a news release. DeSantis is also requesting that the President grant FEMA the authority to provide 100% federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures for the first 60 days from Ian‚Äôs landfall.\n\nIan already producing record water surge levels\n\nMuch of west-central Florida and places inland face ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù storm surge, rain and crushing winds. ‚ÄúThis is a wind storm and a surge storm and a flood storm, all in one,‚Äù CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said.\n\nImages and video have showed extensive flooding in coastal neighborhoods in Naples and Fort Myers Beach.\n\nStorm surge began rising late Wednesday morning ‚Äì more than 4.5 feet above normal highest tides was recorded before noon in Naples, already higher than the previous record there of 4.02 feet from Hurricane Irma in 2017.\n\nMandatory evacuations were ordered for flood-prone areas on the coast, and the National Weather Service warned those who stayed behind to move to upper floors in case of rising water levels.\n\nIan‚Äôs dangers still include:\n\n‚Ä¢ Storm surge: Some 12 to 18 feet of seawater pushed onto land was predicted Wednesday for the coastal Fort Myers area, from Englewood to Bonita Beach, forecasters said. Only slightly less is forecast for a stretch from Bonita Beach down to near the Everglades (8 to 12 feet), and from near Bradenton to Englewood (6 to 10 feet), forecasters said.\n\nLower ‚Äì but still life-threatening ‚Äì surge is possible elsewhere, including north of Tampa and along Florida‚Äôs northeast coast near Jacksonville.\n\n‚Ä¢ Winds: Southwest Florida is facing ‚Äúcatastrophic wind damage‚Äù from ongoing hurricane-force winds. Winds near the core of Hurricane Ian could exceed 140 mph, with higher gusts, the hurricane center said. Multiple locations, including Sanibel Island, recorded wind gusts above 100 mph.\n\n‚Ä¢ Flooding rain: 12 to 30 inches of rain could fall in central and northeastern Florida ‚Äì including Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville. That makes for a top-of-scale risk for flooding rainfall across this area. This amount of rain would usually be two to three months‚Äô worth, but is now falling in less than two days, according to CNN meteorologist Gene Norman.\n\n‚ÄúAs this storm passes your community, understand this is still a hazardous situation‚Äù because of downed powerlines, misuse of generators and standing water, Gov. DeSantis said during a Wednesday evening news conference.\n\nWhere the hurricane is headed\n\nIan‚Äôs center is expected to move over central Florida through Thursday morning. Heavy rain and flooding also is possible in southern Florida, Georgia and coastal South Carolina. The governors of Virginia, North and South Carolina have already declared states of emergency in their respective states.\n\nStorm warnings have expanded northward to North Carolina, according to the National Hurricane Center‚Äôs 5 p.m. update. A tropical storm warning has been extended to Surf City and a tropical storm watch has been issued from north of Surf City to Cape Lookout, North Carolina.\n\nA storm surge watch has been issued north of South Santee River, South Carolina, to Little River Inlet.\n\nBecause Ian slowly approached land, the worst conditions could remain over some areas for eight or more hours.\n\n‚ÄúWidespread, life-threatening catastrophic flash, urban, and river flooding is expected‚Äù across central and southern Florida, the hurricane center said.\n\nBy late Thursday, Ian is due to emerge over the Atlantic Ocean, where it could strengthen again and affect another part of the US.\n\nPrior to nearing Florida, Hurricane Ian pummeled Cuba on Tuesday, leaving at least two dead and an islandwide blackout. The US Coast Guard said it has rescued at least three people off the Florida coast, about 2 miles south of Boca Chica.\n\n‚ÄúThey were brought to the local hospital for symptoms of exhaustion and dehydration. Air crews are still searching,‚Äù the Coast Guard said in a tweet.\n\nAccording to US Border Patrol Chief for the Miami Sector, the agency has been searching for more than 20 migrants after the arrival of Cubans who swam to shore after their boat sank due to Ian.\n\nAfter the devastation in Cuba, more than 2.5 million people in Florida were advised to flee, including 1.75 million under mandatory evacuation orders ‚Äì no small ask in a state with a large elderly population.\n\nOfficials prepare for post-storm rescue\n\nSarasota County Sheriff Deputies block the access to a downtown bridge over to the barrier islands as Hurricane Ian approaches Florida's Gulf Coast on September 28. Steve Nesius/Reuters\n\nLaw enforcement officials around the state warned that people who stayed behind in evacuation areas cannot expect rescuers to respond to calls for help during the storm when winds are high.\n\n‚ÄúIf you call for help, once we pull (officers) off the road ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre not coming. ‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre not putting people in peril when (others) didn‚Äôt heed the mandatory evacuation order,‚Äù Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said Wednesday.\n\nNot everyone moved. Chelsye Napier, of Fort Myers, stayed home with her fiance and cats despite being in an evacuation zone, she told CNN Wednesday. They waited ‚Äúbecause we don‚Äôt know anyone down here,‚Äù and ultimately decided to stay put, she said.\n\nIan's winds could be catastrophic Category 4: 130-156 mph ‚Ä¢ Most of the area is uninhabitable for weeks or months. ‚Ä¢ Power outages last weeks to months. ‚Ä¢ Fallen trees and power poles isolate residential areas. + Well-built framed homes sustain severe damage. Category 5: 157+ mph + A high percentage of framed homes are destroyed. Source: National Hurricane Center\n\n‚ÄúIf anything happens, we have everything that we need here. We‚Äôve got food, we got water. We have everything that we need here,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs all OK for right now. We‚Äôll see, though, later on.‚Äù\n\nAs millions were told evacuate, 176 shelters opened statewide and hotels and Airbnbs opened to people leaving evacuation zones, DeSantis said.\n\nLocal governments and state agencies also prepared those living in nursing homes and other senior care facilities to evacuate. Florida has around 6 million residents over the age of 60, according to the state‚Äôs Department of Elder Affairs ‚Äì nearly 30% of its total population.\n\nHeather Danenhower, with Duke Energy, walks around utility trucks that are staged in a rural lot in The Villages of Sumter County on Wednesday. Stephen M. Dowell/Orlando Sentinel via AP\n\nAuthorities also readied services to fan out and respond to calls for rescue and then, in the aftermath of the hurricane, for recovery and repair efforts.\n\nNearly 400 ambulances, buses and support vehicles were responding to areas where the hurricane was expected to make landfall, according to the governor‚Äôs office.\n\nDeSantis activated 5,000 Florida National Guard members for Ian‚Äôs response operations, and 2,000 more guardsmen from Tennessee, Georgia and North Carolina were being activated to assist.\n\nFlorida urban search and rescue teams also were prepping.\n\n‚ÄúWe have five state teams that are activated with additional five FEMA teams that are in play,‚Äù Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis said at a news conference Tuesday night. ‚ÄúWe have over 600 resources to bear in addition to these out-of-town teams.‚Äù\n\nHelp is coming from out of state, too. At least 26 states have answered the call for assistance by Florida, DeSantis said Wednesday evening, including Alabama and Louisiana.\n\nLouisiana Gov.

Andrew West/USA Today Network In pictures: Hurricane Ian slams the Southeast Prev Next\n\nFlorida residents assessing storm damage Thursday found collapsed buildings, ongoing flooding, downed power lines and impassable roads, including a key bridge connecting Sanibel and Captiva islands to Florida‚Äôs mainland that has been washed out.\n\nApproximately 40 people were taken off the Sanibel Thursday, 12 of whom were injured. Due to the damage to the causeway, first-responders are only able to get to the island by boat.\n\n‚ÄúThe island is in rough shape,‚Äù said Sanibel Police Chief Bill Dalton. ‚ÄúThe power infrastructure is severely damaged. I would be surprised that there‚Äôs a single structure on the island that hasn‚Äôt been impacted by the storm.‚Äù\n\nSanibel, in Lee County, ‚Äúgot hit with really biblical storm surge,‚Äù Gov. Ron DeSantis said. Lee County Utilities issued a systemwide boil-water notice for all customers effective immediately due to the impacts of the hurricane, according to county officials.\n\n‚ÄúI just literally got out of a helicopter where I was able to take a complete tour of the entire county and there‚Äôs really no words that I can say to tell you what I‚Äôve seen,‚Äù Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marcino said on CNN Thursday. ‚ÄúThe Fort Myers Beach area, buildings, major, major homes and buildings completely washed away with vehicles in the water, vehicles in the bay, boats are upside down.‚Äù\n\nDeSantis said Thursday night that he surveyed damage in Charlotte County and Lee County.\n\n‚ÄúSome of the damage was indescribable,‚Äù DeSantis said, adding he saw cars and homes floating in water. ‚ÄúThe most significant damage I saw was on Fort Myers Beach. Some of the homes were wiped out, some were just concrete slabs.‚Äù\n\nAbout 200 people have been rescued by the Fort Myers Fire Department, Fort Myers Mayor Kevin Anderson told CNN Thursday night. The search and rescue operations appear to have come to an end in the city, according to Anderson.\n\nAnderson said city has not had any fatalities. On Friday, the city will open ‚Äúseveral food, water and ice distribution centers,‚Äù Anderson said.\n\nA boil water notice is in effect in the city of Fort Myers, according to a government statement posted Thursday. ‚ÄúThis applies to water consumed for drinking, washing dishes, and brushing teeth among other uses,‚Äù the statement said.\n\nLee County ‚Äì which includes Fort Myers ‚Äî issued a boil water notice Wednesday.\n\nOfficials in Kissimmee ‚Äì just south of Orlando ‚Äì told CNN Thursday evening ‚Äúit‚Äôs been a worst-case scenario‚Äù for the city.\n\n‚ÄúOne of our hospitals here, Osceola Regional ‚Äì which is a trauma two-level center ‚Äì was surrounded by water this morning. Our rescues could not make entry,‚Äù Bill Litton, Osceola County‚Äôs emergency management director, told CNN Thursday evening.\n\nEmergency responders conducted rescues by air, land and boat to save people trapped by the floodwaters. As of 2 p.m. Thursday, more than 500 people have been rescued in Charlotte and Lee counties, the Florida Department of Emergency Management said in a tweet. In Orlando, emergency responders navigating a street-turned-river told CNN they had conducted at least 200 rescues since early Thursday morning.\n\nThe US Coast Guard‚Äôs 7th District rescued 68 people Thursday, which is included in the 700 state-wide rescues the governor reported Thursday, according to Rear Adm. Brendan McPherson.\n\nFlorida First Lady, Casey DeSantis, said Thursday she launched the Florida Disaster Fund to assist in rescue efforts. The fund raised more than $10 million within 24 hours of its launch, she said.\n\nThe rescue efforts come a day after Ian came ashore near Cayo Costa as a Category 4 hurricane with 150-mph winds, making it one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall on Florida‚Äôs west coast. The storm cut a path from near Fort Myers in the southwest across to the eastern part of the state, and its combination of wind, rain and storm surge caused flooding that DeSantis called ‚Äúa 500-year flood event.‚Äù\n\nHere are the latest developments:\n\n‚Ä¢ Hurricane warnings for South Carolina: Hurricane warnings are in place for the entire coast of South Carolina. In addition, Tropical Storm warnings are in place from Jupiter, Florida, up the east coast to Duck, North Carolina.\n\n‚Ä¢ Record-high storm surges: Ian‚Äôs storm surge hit up to 12 feet in some places in western Florida. On Thursday morning, a storm surge warning ‚Äì meaning life-threatening surges could hit ‚Äì was in place for a coastal stretch from northeastern Florida into an area north of Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n‚Ä¢ More than a foot of rainfall: Lehigh Acres near Fort Myers got 14.42 inches of rain, and Warm Mineral Springs near Port Charlotte got 11.05 inches. Up to 30 inches of rain may have fallen in parts of Florida by storm‚Äôs end, forecasters say.\n\nRescue teams navigate waters to free trapped residents\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'I know we all look crazy': Resident shares why she didn't leave before storm 04:14 - Source: CNN\n\nSunrise on Thursday gave Florida residents their first look at Ian‚Äôs overnight wrath ‚Äì and the results were not pretty.\n\nAs Ian pushed inland, ocean water piled up onshore Wednesday ‚Äì 12 feet in some places ‚Äì and 150-mph winds whipped. 911 call centers in several counties were inundated.\n\nScott Carlos, who rode out the storm in his fourth-story Fort Myers condo, saw waves of water crash into homes across the street, up to their roofs, he said. Roads are littered Thursday with washed-out vehicles, he told CNN on Thursday.\n\n‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs garages basically just gave out. ‚Ä¶ Cars are everywhere, smashed up in the street. There‚Äôs debris everywhere,‚Äù he said.\n\nAs Ian continued moving northeast, heavy rain and flooding has been reported in the Orlando area, where 8 to 12 inches of rain had already fallen and up to 4 more inches of rain was expected. In Orlando, a reporter for CNN affiliate WESH rescued a woman after seeing her trying to drive through floodwaters, carrying her on his back in waist-high water to dry ground, WESH video showed.\n\nIn Fort Myers ‚Äì where about 90% of electric customers were without power ‚Äì Fire Chief Tracy McMillion told residents to stay inside, and to stay hopeful. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre coming for you, be encouraged,‚Äù he told residents Wednesday night.\n\nThe city‚Äôs downtown streets were flooded Wednesday with almost 4 feet of water, Mayor Kevin Anderson told CNN.\n\nThomas Podgorny was trapped in his two-story home in Fort Myers with three others, watching vehicles float away outside and worrying about others who did not evacuate, he told CNN Wednesday evening.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost my house. I have water and gas flowing through my bottom floor,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMy neighbors have very little breathing room in their one-story house.‚Äù\n\nOne couple there was trapped in their home when the ceiling caved in.\n\n‚ÄúSomething is dripping on me,‚Äù Belinda Collins recalled her partner saying. ‚ÄúHe got up, and the ceiling ‚Äì the family room ceiling ‚Äì caved in.‚Äù They called 911 and were waiting for a call back about when it would be safe to leave, they said.\n\nIn Port Charlotte, the storm tore off the roof above a hospital‚Äôs ICU with patients inside Wednesday, forcing staff to move them to a post-operation recovery area, Dr. Birgit Bodine, an internal medicine specialist at the facility, told CNN.\n\nWater gushed down stairwells to other floors, and other patients needed to be moved either to beds in hallways or to a different, dry wing of the hospital.\n\n‚ÄúWe still have water in hallways that we‚Äôre still sloshing through,‚Äù but patients are safe in dry beds, and as many as possible were transferred to the dry wing, Bodine told CNN Thursday morning.\n\nPeople in nearby Collier County, which includes Naples, were also trapped in their homes, calling for help, after electricity went out. In Naples, half the streets were not passable Wednesday because of high water, officials said.\n\n‚ÄúSome are reporting life threatening medical emergencies in deep water. We will get to them first. Some are reporting water coming into their house but not life threatening. They will have to wait. Possibly until the water recedes,‚Äù the Collier County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said Wednesday evening.\n\n9/28 5pm EDT: #Ian will cross the FL peninsula and likely bring life-threatening storm surge on Thursday & Friday along the coasts of northeast Florida, Georgia, & South Carolina, where a storm surge warning is in effect.

Deputies were ‚Äúresponding to the highest priority calls‚Äù that still were in the queue Thursday morning, the office said.\n\nResidents in parts of Pasco County were also asked to boil their tap water as the water distribution system in the area lost pressure and a water main ruptured.\n\nIn Manatee County, residents were asked to limit flushing, showering, doing dishes and laundry due to power outages impacting the system.\n\nIn Cape Coral, authorities were getting reports of significant structural damage across the city, Ryan Lamb, the city‚Äôs fire chief and emergency management director, told CNN.\n\nDeSantis has asked President Biden to approve a major disaster declaration for all 67 counties in the state, his office said in a news release. DeSantis is also asking Biden to grant FEMA the authority to provide 100% federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures for the first 60 days from Ian‚Äôs landfall.\n\nSouth Carolina braces for incoming storm\n\nWith Ian again a Category 1 hurricane, a state of emergency was declared in Charleston County Thursday.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to hit South Carolina Friday near or just after these high tide times in the 11 a.m. hour. It‚Äôs currently located about 240 miles south of Charleston and is moving toward the north-northeast at 10 mph, according to the hurricane center.\n\n‚ÄúWe are looking at an early afternoon landfall,‚Äù said CNN Meteorologist Tom Sater. ‚ÄúThe entire southeastern coastline is pretty much going to be inundated with a surge again. It‚Äôs not going to be what we saw in southwest Florida, but in Charleston you toss in ‚Ä¶ 7 feet of a surge, the entire downtown historic area is flooded.‚Äù\n\nCoastal cities along the East Coast like Jacksonville, Florida, Savannah, Georgia, and Wilmington, North Carolina, could see anywhere from 2-7 feet of storm surge, Sater said.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the biggest variable with Hurricane Ian may be ‚Äúhuman reaction‚Äù to the storm.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs people failing to take the necessary precautions. That‚Äôs the real danger that we have, is human error,‚Äù McMaster said. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt make much difference whether this comes in at hurricane strength or below at storm strength or somewhere on the line, cause it‚Äôs going to be blowing strong winds and it‚Äôs going to be all over the state at different levels.‚Äù\n\nThe US Geological Survey coastal change forecasts released Thursday predicts waves and surges will likely cause 11% of South Carolina‚Äôs dunes and 1% of Georgia‚Äôs dunes to be continuously covered by ocean water.\n\n‚ÄúThis is the most severe type of storm effect on coastal beaches, with flooding behind the dunes that may impact coastal communities,‚Äù a news release from the USGS said.\n\nAdditionally, 43% of South Carolina‚Äôs dunes and 24% of Georgia‚Äôs dunes are expected to be overwashed by Ian. This means sand will be pushed inland, resulting in changes to the coastal landscape that could block roadways.\n\n‚ÄúOverwash can reduce the height of protective sand dunes, alter beach profiles and leave areas behind the dunes more vulnerable to future storms,‚Äù the release said.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story had the incorrect location for storm witness Scott Carlos.

She said her car flooded and her double-wide mobile home is now missing a roof.\n\nSusan Tadey waits in line at a Disaster Recovery Center in Fort Myers, Florida.

Fernandes came to the Disaster Recovery Center in hopes of getting a motel room so they do not have to live in their car.\n\nShe told CNN she put in an application for help online a week ago, but she hasn‚Äôt gotten any response. She also said she attempted to call the center but could never get through.\n\n‚ÄúOne time it said 105 minutes. One time it said two hours and 48 minutes.

CNN\n\nAnd then there are residents in the unincorporated community of Harlem Heights, about 10 miles south of Fort Myers and part of the metropolitan area, who feel left out of the government response.\n\nTwo residents, both of whom are Black, told CNN they‚Äôve not seen as fast a response in their neighborhood as they‚Äôve seen in Fort Myers Beach or Sanibel Island.\n\n‚ÄúYou literally have to drive through Harlem Heights to get to Fort Myers Beach and to get to Sanibel, so we felt left out,‚Äù said Sharee Mobley while at a community event in Harlem Heights sponsored by Mount Pleasant Missionary Baptist Church where volunteers gave out food and supplies.\n\nTerry Mobley added: ‚ÄúI do feel like we‚Äôre getting help [now], but it‚Äôs outside organizations, still not my local government, no.

If you just let it toil, then that‚Äôs how they end up maybe never coming back. So I think there is a sense of urgency on it and we‚Äôre working across the board with all those,‚Äù DeSantis said.\n\nThe governor also praised efforts to restore power and water, saying ‚Äúall but 1.86% of the state‚Äù has power restored.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to have had a lot of people working really hard, not just over the past week, but the week leading into this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd to be honest, these are things you have to practice going into a hurricane season, and so we take pride in that in Florida to have strong disaster response.‚Äù\n\nResidents face life without water, electricity and even their homes\n\nMany survivors are still in the dark or relying on generators. Statewide, more than 170,000 customers had no power as of Thursday evening, according to PowerOutage.us, many of them in hard-hit Lee and Charlotte counties.\n\nFlorida Power & Light Company Chairman and CEO Eric Silagy said in Fort Myers Thursday more than two million customers‚Äô power has been restored, with less than 100,000 without power in its service area.\n\n‚ÄúWe will continue to work around the clock until those last remaining customers who are able to receive power are restored,‚Äù Silagy said.\n\nResidents in more than 22 Florida counties also don‚Äôt have clean running water. Boil Water Notices have been issued for 120 areas after damage from Hurricane Ian, according to the Florida Department of Health.\n\nMatlacha resident Cindy Walton, who returned home after evacuating to Miami, said she‚Äôd rather have water than electricity.\n\n‚ÄúIf you had a choice between water and electric ‚Äì give me water. I don‚Äôt need electricity; I have a candle. I don‚Äôt need to be out at night when it‚Äôs dark,‚Äù Walton said.\n\nShe said the Army Corps has been distributing potable water, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äúprecious commodity.‚Äù\n\nSnowbirds Bruce and Kathy Hickey, both 70, stand outside their damaged winter home in a mobile home park on San Carlos Island. Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nAs families deal with storm-damaged homes and infrastructure, many families across the state are also grieving loved ones.\n\nAt least 125 people died because of Ian, officials said ‚Äì 120 of them in Florida and five in North Carolina. The death toll was revised down Friday after the medical examiner in Lee County reclassified some deaths as non-storm-related, according to Sheriff Carmine Marceno.\n\nAt least 40 storm victims had drowning listed as a possible or known circumstance in their deaths, according to data on 72 people provided by the Florida Medical Examiners Commission Tuesday night.\n\nThe death toll has been increasing as rescue crews comb through the rubble searching for signs of life. There have been 2,500 rescues made as of Wednesday morning, according to the office of Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nAs those efforts continue, it‚Äôs unclear how many people are still unaccounted for.\n\nIan left school divisions in disarray\n\nThe damage is keeping many schools closed across hard-hit areas, and those planning to open do not know how many children will show up to class.\n\nPublic schools in Collier County are set to open Thursday with the help of more than 800 substitute teachers, since 22% of the district‚Äôs teachers live in hard hit Lee County, according to Collier County Public Schools spokesperson Chad Oliver.\n\nBut it‚Äôs unlikely all the district‚Äôs roughly 50,000 students will return.\n\nA bible covered in mud was found on the side of the road off West Gulf Drive, in Sanibel. Lelya Santiago/CNN\n\nSeveral families showed up to a school donation drive Wednesday to say goodbye to teachers. They say their homes are destroyed, and they must move, according to Oliver.\n\nMeanwhile, four school districts in the hardest hit areas remain closed until ‚Äúfurther notice,‚Äù according to the Florida Department of Education. They include schools in Charlotte, DeSoto, Hardee and Lee counties. Sarasota County will partially reopen schools Monday.\n\nOfficials with Lee County Schools plan to make an announcement regarding the district operation plans by Friday.\n\nEarlier this week, Lee County said a preliminary damage assessment found 54% of their schools were in need of repair and some may be beyond repair.\n\n‚ÄúWe will open when we can, and we will do it safely,‚Äù superintendent Christopher Bernier said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Charlotte County School District hopes to have students back in school by October 24.\n\nSpeaking on CNN Thursday morning, superintendent Stephen Dionisio said every single one of their school sites received damage, and many buildings suffered roof damage.\n\n‚ÄúThe kids have already dealt with so much, through the last few days, that the last thing you want them to do is to have to learn a whole new school because you got to send them somewhere else,‚Äù he said.\n\nHospitals strained in aftermath of the storm\n\nIan‚Äôs damage has also been straining hospitals in southwest Florida.\n\nSarasota Memorial Health Care System set up a 30-bed tent facility outside its hospital in Venice, which is in Sarasota County just north of hard-hit Lee and Charlotte counties, to help with an influx of patients.\n\nA second disaster medical assistance team opened in Charlotte County ‚Äúto help reduce the strain in local ERs while hospitals in that region gradually reopen,‚Äù a news release from Sarasota Memorial Health Care System said.\n\n‚ÄúMost hospitals south of Sarasota on Florida‚Äôs Gulf Coast were evacuated and remained closed for several days due to damage from the storm.

And between 2 to 6 inches are expected from parts of the US southeast to the southern and central Appalachians and western mid-Atlantic, the hurricane center said.\n\nNicole weakened to a tropical storm shortly after landfall, and then became a depression late Thursday. It‚Äôs expected to become a post-tropical cyclone over the Southeast.\n\nHere‚Äôs what to know now:\n\nResidents outside Florida should now prepare: There are nearly three million people under a tornado watch issued for southeast Georgia, eastern and southern South Carolina and portions of far southern North Carolina. ‚ÄúGiven the uncertainty of the storm‚Äôs strength and path as it approaches South Carolina, residents need to have their personal emergency plans ready to go just in case we need to take safety precautions later in the week,‚Äù said Kim Stenson, who heads the state‚Äôs emergency management division.\n\nTens of thousands without power: More than 237,000 homes and businesses in Florida were without power late Thursday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nLow tide limits storm surge: Nicole‚Äôs peak winds coincided with low tide, limiting the storm surge and inundation on the shore. At Port Canaveral, the surge was measured at just under 6 feet around 4 a.m. ET, just after landfall. Later Thursday morning, surge was down to around 3 feet, but water levels are expected to remain high through high tide, between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.\n\nNicole's storm surge pushes Wednesday into East Boynton Beach in Florida.

It was also 94% effective in those who had at least one underlying medical condition.\n\n‚ÄúToday‚Äôs approval of the first RSV vaccine is an important public health achievement to prevent a disease which can be life-threatening and reflects the FDA‚Äôs continued commitment to facilitating the development of safe and effective vaccines for use in the United States,\" said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\n\nRespiratory syncytial virus infects nearly everyone by age 2 and typically causes cold symptoms. But it‚Äôs also the leading cause of hospitalizations among newborns and younger children. Among those under 5, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports between 58,000 and 80,000 hospitalizations a year.\n\nRSV also strikes late in life, causing more than 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths among older adults each year.\n\nDuring an FDA advisory panel meeting in February, GSK researchers reported a few cases of neurological disorders post-vaccination, including one case of Guillain-Barr√© in a 78-year-old woman in Japan about nine days after receiving the shot.\n\nHowever, panel members voted to recommend the vaccine, saying it was still safe and effective for older adults.\n\nGuillain-Barr√© syndrome, or GBS, is a rare neurological disorder in which the body‚Äôs immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis, according to the CDC.

Getting boosted this fall is still an important way to renew protection, even among people who were previously infected or vaccinated.\n\nBut the hope was that by tweaking the vaccine recipe to include currently circulating strains of the Omicron variant, it would help broaden immunity against those variants and perhaps offer better and longer-lasting protection.\n\nWhen the researchers compared the immune responses of people who got a booster dose of the original shot to people who got the updated bivalent boosters, they looked about the same.\n\n‚ÄúWe see essentially no difference‚Äù between the old boosters and the new about a month after the shot, said Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia, whose team authored one of the studies.\n\nImmunologists say a vaccine against two strains may not be better than a single strain shot because of a phenomenon called immune imprinting. Scientists say imprinting may complicate efforts to stay ahead of new variants as the coronavirus continues to evolve, and it adds urgency to the development of new vaccine technologies to fight the virus.\n\nWhen the US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorizations for new bivalent Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna at the end of August, it did so on the basis of studies in mice and previous human trials with a different two-strain booster formulation. Little was known about the how protective the shots might be in people; full data from clinical trials testing the BA.4 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines in humans hasn‚Äôt yet been made public.\n\nBut modeling data suggested that getting the boosters out in September could save tens of thousands of lives if the country had another winter surge, so the FDA authorized the shots, ahead of results from clinical trials, in order to get them to the public more quickly.\n\nThe updated shots contain instructions that show cells how to make spike proteins from the original virus that caused Covid-19, as well as spikes from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. These spikes get assembled by our cells and displayed to our immune system so it can make antibodies to fight the real thing during an active infection.\n\nThe original strain of the virus, sometimes called the ancestral or wild-type strain, is no longer circulating, however. When we boost, we are mostly boosting antibodies against a virus that‚Äôs long gone.\n\nAs the virus has evolved, the vaccines have not kept pace. Each new variant has become more and more resistant to the antibodies we make against it, increasing the risk of breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nRight now, protection against infection begins to wane just a few months after each booster dose. Protection against severe outcomes ‚Äì hospitalization or death from Covid-19 ‚Äì lasts longer, but can also fade, especially for vulnerable groups such as people who are over 65, who have weakened immune systems or who have underlying medical conditions.\n\nSimilar immune responses\n\nThe studies have important limitations, and they aren‚Äôt the final word on the updated boosters.\n\nBoth studies were small. Ho‚Äôs study looked at the immune responses of 19 people who were boosted with a fourth dose of the original recipe vaccine and 21 people who got a fourth dose of the updated boosters. The other study, from Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor at Harvard and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, looked at 15 people who got the original booster and 18 people who got bivalent shots.\n\nBoth reports were posted as preprints, before scrutiny by independent experts.\n\nThe studies also measured immune responses over a short period of time ‚Äì about three to five weeks after the fourth doses. Ho says these results could change with time, as immune cells mature.\n\n‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt say that a few months from now, there won‚Äôt be any difference,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt know that until these individuals are followed for a longer period of time.‚Äù\n\nDespite these caveats, experts who were not involved in the research say that two studies from well-regarded labs arriving at roughly the same conclusions about the vaccines gives them confidence that the results are correct.\n\n‚ÄúAt least at this time point, there‚Äôs no discernible benefit‚Äù over the older boosters, Ho said.\n\nClinical trials being conducted by vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna involve hundreds of people who have had the updated boosters and are being followed for longer periods of time. Data from those studies are still coming.\n\nBoth companies declined to comment on Ho and Barouch‚Äôs studies, citing company policies not to weigh in on research they have not been involved in.\n\nIn comparing the immune responses of people who got the old boosters with those who got the newer ones, the researchers found that neutralizing antibodies spiked after both shots to about the same high levels, which was good news.\n\nIn Barouch‚Äôs study, antibody concentrations were 15 times higher after the original boosters, rising from 184 to 2,829. They were 17 times higher after the updated shots, jumping from 211 to 3,693. The difference in antibody levels between shots didn‚Äôt pass a statistical test, however, so the results may have been due to chance.\n\nMore importantly, that slight difference in antibody levels probably wouldn‚Äôt protect people any better in the real world.\n\n‚ÄúWe would not expect this to be clinically significant,‚Äù said Barouch, who worked on the development of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nBut the bulk of the antibodies generated after either shot were ones that would bind the original virus, with fewer directed specifically against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\nBarouch‚Äôs team also looked specifically at T cells, which help the body hold the memory of germs it has been exposed to. These cells are thought to play a key role in how long immune protection lasts. Antibody levels naturally drop off over time, but T cells stick around.\n\nThe numbers of T cells didn‚Äôt budge much after either vaccine.\n\n‚ÄúUnfortunately, neither one increased T-cell responses very much, and we believe that T-cell responses in addition to antibody responses are important for protection against severe disease,‚Äù Barouch said.\n\n‚ÄòA booster is a booster‚Äô\n\nDr. Eric Topol, who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the study results ‚Äúcan be considered a disappointment,‚Äù especially because the US government raced to make them available and because there had been high hopes for an improved vaccine in time for a predicted winter Covid-19 surge.\n\nTopol also said it would be a mistake to skip these shots. They still work; they just may not be much of an improvement over the older ones.\n\n‚ÄúA booster is a booster until proven otherwise and we are in great need of getting more of them in the US,‚Äù Topol, who was not involved in the new studies, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nFewer than 20 million people ‚Äì less than 10% of the population ages 5 and up ‚Äì have gotten the updated booster, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAfter waiting the recommended three months since his last Covid-19 infection, President Joe Biden got an updated booster Tuesday and urged eligible Americans to do the same.\n\n‚ÄúYour old vaccine or your previous Covid infection will not give you maximum protection,‚Äù Biden said.\n\nPublic health officials had hoped that the rollout of the updated boosters would mark a turning point, where Americans might be able to get annual Covid-19 shots instead of boosters every few months.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA‚Äôs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, recently told Stat that he wasn‚Äôt sure whether the country had reached that point.\n\n‚ÄúI would be lying to you if [I said] it doesn‚Äôt keep me up at night worrying that there is a certain chance that we may have to deploy another booster ‚Äì at least for a portion of the population, perhaps older individuals ‚Äì before next September, October,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen, but it‚Äôs what keeps me up at night, because we see how fast this virus is evolving.‚Äù\n\nImprinting may complicate quest for better immunity\n\nThe studies probably didn‚Äôt find any difference between the new and old boosters because of immune imprinting, says Michael Worobey, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies the evolution of viruses and the origins and control of pandemics.\n\n‚ÄúYour body is on a hair trigger to create more antibodies of what it has a good memory of,‚Äù said Worobey, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, our immune systems were blank slates when it came to the coronavirus. By now, most of us have been exposed to one version of the virus or another through the vaccine, an infection or both. That exposure programs cells called B cells to make specific kinds of antibodies, and more B cells get this programming during their first exposure to the virus than they do in subsequent brushes with it.\n\nThat‚Äôs the reason some strains of the flu may hit certain age groups harder than others, too. When viruses look more similar to the first infection or vaccine you had, your body tends to do a better job fighting them off.\n\nWorobey said that both new studies have limitations, ‚Äúbut I think when you put them together, they paint a pretty clear picture that that antigenic imprinting is causing issues here, for sure.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs possible to break through immune imprinting, he said. Certain kinds of vaccine ingredients, or adjuvants ‚Äì ‚Äúthings that just happen to really wake up the immune system‚Äù ‚Äì can do it.\n\nBut it‚Äôs not easy to add the kind of adjuvants he‚Äôs thinking about to mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna‚Äôs. In this case, he says, judging by the study findings, it probably would have been better to update the vaccine by including only the components against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\n‚ÄúFor me, the take-home message is, if you want to boost and provide protection against Omicron, leave the original variant out of the vaccine.‚Äù\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA‚Äôs vaccine advisory committee, says the new studies bear out data that was presented to the FDA‚Äôs advisers in June.\n\nHe says it‚Äôs one of the reasons he voted against the FDA requiring companies to add an Omicron strain to the boosters used in the US.\n\n‚ÄúCertainly, the hope that this would be significantly better in terms of protection against the circulating strains, I think, is unlikely to be realized,‚Äù said Offit, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWorobey says that when the strains are combined as they are in the updated boosters, they actually end up competing. The body‚Äôs response to the original strain is so strong, it will end up blocking the updated portion of the vaccine from stimulating those blank slate B cells against the newer variants and reshaping the immune response.\n\nThus, imprinting will complicate efforts to keep up with the virus, he says. We may need different kinds of vaccine technologies if the virus ever changes so much that it outcompetes our immunity altogether.\n\nThat‚Äôs something the FDA‚Äôs Marks has considered, too.\n\n‚ÄúI would love to see us have a very ecumenical look over all of the available vaccines and all of the vaccines in development to try to see what‚Äôs best moving forward,‚Äù he told Stat. ‚ÄúNot to diss the current mRNA vaccines but because we owe it to the population to see what might provide the greatest breadth, depth and duration of immunity against Covid-19.‚Äù", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/13/politics/letter-fda-defended-monkeypox-vaccine-strategy/index.html", "title": "Letter obtained by CNN shows FDA defended new monkeypox ...", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration defended the federal government‚Äôs recent decision to stretch out its limited supply of the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine by giving individuals smaller doses using a different method of injection, pointing out in a letter to the company that manufactures the vaccine that a 2015 clinical study showed ‚Äúa very similar immune response‚Äù to the new method as well as the previously used one.\n\nIn a letter Friday to Bavarian Nordic CEO Paul Chaplin, two top FDA officials responded to concerns Chaplin had raised earlier this week. They wrote that the agency recently determined that the benefits of stretching its limited supply of the two-dose Jynneos vaccine by giving individuals smaller doses outweighed the known possible risks.\n\nThe decision came after the FDA ruled out ‚Äì at least for now ‚Äì the use of alternative vaccines, as well as the option of delaying the second vaccine dose by three to six months, the agency said.\n\nThe FDA‚Äôs letter, obtained by CNN Saturday, was signed by FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf and Dr. Peter Marks, the director of the FDA‚Äôs Center for Biologics and Evaluation Research.\n\nThe letter cited a 2015 clinical study, which Chaplin co-authored, in which ‚Äúindividuals who received the vaccine intradermally received a lower volume (one fifth) than individuals who received the vaccine subcutaneously.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe results of this study demonstrated that intradermal administration produced a very similar immune response to subcutaneous (SC) administration,‚Äù the letter said. While the intradermal injection method ‚Äúdid result in more redness, firmness, itchiness and swelling at the injection site, but less pain,‚Äù the letter continued, ‚Äúthese side effects were manageable.‚Äù\n\nThe FDA also detailed other options that the agency had considered. But the use of alternative vaccines to prevent monkeypox ‚Äúwas determined to be either impractical or inadvisable at this time,‚Äù according to the letter. Specifically, the ACAM2000 vaccine, which is FDA approved for prevention of smallpox, ‚Äúmay not be appropriate now for a potentially immunocompromised population,‚Äù the letter said.\n\nThe FDA also looked into the option of delaying the second vaccine doses by three to six months, rather than giving the second dose the recommended 28 days after the first.\n\nBut the agency ultimately determined that there was not any data to demonstrate that this method would provide sufficient protection, and that delaying the second dose could also give people ‚Äúa false sense of reassurance that they were protected against monkeypox when the actual level of protection would be unknown and quite possibly inadequate,‚Äù the letter said.\n\nThe federal government‚Äôs announcement this week authorizing health care providers to give smaller doses of Jynneos came in an attempt to better meet the high demand for the vaccine. Top Biden administration health officials have made clear in recent days that given the speed of the spread of monkeypox ‚Äì which it earlier this month declared a public health emergency ‚Äì the US did not have enough vaccine supply to meet demand. This week‚Äôs decision to stretch out the available Jynneos vaccines was aimed at addressing the limited supply.\n\nDr. Marks of the FDA said Thursday that there were an estimated 1.6 million to 1.7 million people in the US who are now eligible for the two-dose Jynneos vaccine. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, around 634,213 vials have been sent to jurisdictions as of Friday.\n\nThe low-dose intradermal strategy immediately prompted concern among some public health experts, including about the limited amount of research surrounding the new method.\n\n‚ÄúThis approach raises red flag after red flag, and appears to be rushed ahead without data on efficacy, safety, or alternative dosing strategies,‚Äù David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, said in a statement this week.\n\nChaplin, the CEO of Bavarian Nordic, also raised concerns. CNN reported that Chaplin wrote in a letter Tuesday to Califf and HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra that he had concerns about the ‚Äúvery limited safety data available‚Äù on the newly announced vaccination strategy, and that a relatively high percentage of people in the clinical study ‚Äì 20% ‚Äì did not get their second shot.\n\n‚ÄúWhile we have certain reservations, we are trying to find the best way to support the [emergency use authorization] by collecting additional data and aligning on the responses to assist state officials in the rollout,‚Äù Chaplin wrote. ‚ÄúWe are also investing in expanding the manufacturing capacity at both BN and external facilities, with likely more announcements soon to come.‚Äù", "authors": ["Mj Lee"], "publish_date": "2022/08/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/health/rsv-vaccines-therapies/index.html", "title": "New RSV vaccines may soon put an end to rough seasons | CNN", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nIt‚Äôs shaping up to be a severe season for respiratory syncytial virus infections ‚Äì one of the worst some doctors say they can remember.

In a recent clinical trial, the antibody shot was 75% effective at heading off RSV infections that required medical attention.\n\nExperts say the therapies look so promising, they could end bad RSV seasons as we know them.\n\nAnd the relief could come soon: Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the White House Covid-19 Response Task Force, told CNN that he‚Äôs ‚Äúhopeful‚Äù there will be an RSV vaccine by next fall.\n\nCharlotte Brown jumped at the chance to enroll her own son, a squawky, active 10-month-old named James, in one of the vaccine trials this summer.\n\n‚ÄúAs soon as he qualified, we were like ‚Äòabsolutely, we are in,‚Äô ‚Äù Brown said.\n\nBabies have to be at least 6 months old to enter the trial, which is testing a vaccine developed at the National Institutes of Health ‚Äì the result of decades of scientific research.\n\nBrown is a pediatrician who cares for hospitalized children at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, and she sees the ravages of RSV firsthand.

The virus infects the lower lungs, where it causes a hacking cough and may lead to severe complications like pneumonia and inflammation of the tiny airways in the lungs called bronchiolitis.\n\nWorldwide, RSV causes about 33 million infections in children under the age of 5 and hospitalizes 3.6 million annually. Nearly a quarter-million young children die each year from complications of their infections.\n\nRSV also preys on seniors, leading to an estimated 159,000 hospitalizations and about 10,000 deaths a year in adults 65 and over, a burden roughly on par with influenza.\n\nDespite this heavy toll, doctors haven‚Äôt had any new tools to head off RSV for more than two decades. The last therapy approved was in 1998. The monoclonal antibody, Synagis, is given monthly during RSV season to protect preemies and other high-risk babies.\n\nLessons learned after grave setback\n\nThe hunt for an effective way to protect against RSV stalled for decades after two children died in a disastrous vaccine trial in the 1960s.\n\nThat study tested a vaccine made with an RSV virus that had been chemically treated to render it inert and mixed with an ingredient called alum, to wake up the immune system and help it respond.\n\nIt was tested at clinical trial sites in the US between 1966 and 1968.\n\nAt first, everything looked good. The vaccine was tested in animals, who tolerated it well, and then given to children, who also appeared to respond well.\n\n‚ÄúUnfortunately, that fall, when RSV season started, many of the children that were vaccinated required hospitalization and got more severe RSV disease than what would have normally occurred,‚Äù said Steven Varga, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, who has been studying RSV for more than 20 years and is developing a nanoparticle vaccine against the virus.\n\nA study published on the trial found that 80% of the vaccinated children who caught RSV later required hospitalization, compared with only 5% of the children who got a placebo. Two of the babies who had participated in the trial died.\n\nThe outcomes of the trial were a seismic shock to vaccine science. Efforts to develop new vaccines and treatments against RSV halted as researchers tried to untangle what went so wrong.\n\n‚ÄúThe original vaccine studies were so devastatingly bad. They didn‚Äôt understand immunology well in those days, so everybody said ‚Äòoh no, this ain‚Äôt gonna work.‚Äô And it really was like it stopped things cold for 30, 40 years,‚Äù said Dr. Aaron Glatt, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Sinai South Nassau in New York.\n\nRegulators re-evaluated the guardrails around clinical trials, putting new safety measures into place.\n\n‚ÄúIt is in fact, in many ways, why we have some of the things that we have in place today to monitor vaccine safety,‚Äù Varga said.\n\nResearchers at the clinical trial sites didn‚Äôt communicate with each other, Varga said, and so the US Food and Drug Administration put the publicly accessible Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System into place. Now, when an adverse event is reported at one clinical trial site, other sites are notified.\n\nAnother problem turned out to be how the vaccine was made.\n\nProteins are three-dimensional structures. They are made of chains of building blocks called amino acids that fold into complex shapes, and their shapes determine how they work.\n\nIn the failed RSV vaccine trial, the chemical the researchers used to deactivate the virus denatured its proteins ‚Äì essentially flattening them.\n\n‚ÄúNow you have a long sheet of acids but no more beautiful shapes,‚Äù said Ulla Buchholz, chief of the RNA Viruses Section at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n‚ÄúEverything that the immune system needs to form neutralizing antibodies that can block and block attachment and entry of this virus to the cell had been destroyed in that vaccine,‚Äù said Buchholz, who designed the RSV vaccine for toddlers that‚Äôs being tested at Vanderbilt and other US sites.\n\nIn the 1960s trial, the kids still made antibodies to the flattened viral proteins, but they were distorted. When the actual virus came along, these antibodies didn‚Äôt work as intended. Not only did they fail to recognize or block the virus, they triggered a powerful misdirected immune response that made the children much sicker, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement of disease.\n\nThe investigators hadn‚Äôt spotted the enhancement in animal studies, Varga says, because the vaccinated animals weren‚Äôt later challenged with the live virus.\n\n‚ÄúSo of course, we require now extensive animal testing of new vaccines before they‚Äôre ever put into humans, again, for that very reason of making sure that there aren‚Äôt early signs that a vaccine will be problematic,‚Äù Varga said.\n\nA breakthrough reinvigorates the field\n\nAbout 10 years ago, a team of researchers at the NIH ‚Äì some of the same investigators who developed the first Covid-19 vaccines ‚Äì reported what would turn out to be a pivotal advance.\n\nThey had isolated the structure of the virus‚Äôs F-protein, the site that lets it dock onto human cells. Normally, the F-protein flips back and forth, changing shapes after it attaches to a cell. The NIH researchers figured out to how freeze the F-protein into the shape it takes before it fuses with a cell.\n\nThis protein, when locked into place, allows the immune system to recognize the virus in the form it‚Äôs in when it first enters the body ‚Äì and develop strong antibodies against it.\n\n‚ÄúThe companies coming forward now, for the most part, are taking advantage of that discovery,‚Äù said Dr. Phil Dormitzer, a senior vice president of vaccine development at GlaxoSmithKline. ‚ÄúAnd now we have this new generation of vaccine candidates that perform far better than the old generation.‚Äù\n\nThe first vaccines up for FDA review will be given to adults: seniors and pregnant woman. Vaccination in pregnancy is meant to ultimately protect newborns ‚Äì a group particularly vulnerable to the virus ‚Äì via antibodies that cross the placenta.\n\nVaccines for children are a bit farther behind in development but moving through the pipeline, too.\n\nFour companies have RSV vaccines for adults in the final phases of human trials: Pfizer and GSK are testing vaccines for pregnant women as well as seniors. Janssen and Bavarian Nordic are developing shots for seniors.\n\nPfizer and GSK use protein subunit vaccines, a more traditional kind of vaccine technology. Two other companies build on innovations made during the pandemic: Janssen ‚Äì the vaccine division of Johnson & Johnson ‚Äì relies on an adenoviral vector, the same kind of system that‚Äôs used in its Covid-19 vaccine, and Moderna has a vaccine for RSV in Phase 2 trials that uses mRNA technology.\n\nSo far, early results shared by some companies are promising. Janssen, Pfizer and GSK each appear effective at preventing infections in adults for the first RSV season after the vaccine.\n\nIn an August news release, Annaliesa Anderson, Pfizer‚Äôs chief scientific officer of Vaccine Research and Development, said she was ‚Äúdelighted‚Äù with the results. The company plans to submit its data to the FDA for approval this fall.\n\nGSK has also wrapped up its Phase 3 trial for seniors. It recently presented the results at a medical conference, but full data hasn‚Äôt been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal. Early results show that this vaccine is 83% effective at preventing disease in the lower lungs of adults 60 and older. It appears to be even more protective ‚Äì 94% ‚Äì for severe RSV disease in those over 70 and those with underlying medical conditions.\n\n‚ÄúWe are very pleased with these results,‚Äù Dormitzer told CNN. He said the company was moving ‚Äúwith all due haste‚Äù to get its results to the FDA for review.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre confident enough that we‚Äôve started manufacturing the actual commercial launch materials. So we have the bulk vaccine actually in the refrigerator, ready to supply when we are licensed,‚Äù he said.\n\nEven as the company applies for licensure, GSK‚Äôs trial will continue for two more RSV seasons. Half the group getting the vaccine will be followed with no additional shots, while the other group will get annual boosters. The aim is to see which approach is most protective to guide future vaccination strategies.\n\nJanssen‚Äôs vaccine for older adults appears to be about 70% to 80% effective in clinical trials so far, the company announced in December.\n\nIn a study on Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine for pregnant women published in the New England Journal of Medicine this year, the company reported that the mothers enrolled in the study made antibodies to the vaccine and that these antibodies crossed the placenta and were detected in umbilical cord blood just after birth.\n\nThe vaccines for pregnant women are meant to get newborns through their first RSV season. But not all newborns will benefit from those. Most maternal antibodies are passed to baby in the third trimester, so preemies may not be protected, even if mom gets the vaccine.\n\nFor vulnerable infants and those whose mothers decline to be vaccinated, Dr. Helen Chu, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Washington, says the long-acting antibody shot for newborns, called nirsevimab, should cover them for the first six months of life. She expects it to be a ‚Äúgame-changer.‚Äù\n\nThat shot, which has been developed by AstraZeneca, was recently recommended for approval in the European Union. It has not yet been approved in the United States.\n\nHope on the horizon\n\nThe field is so close to a new approval that public health officials say they‚Äôve been asked to study up on the data.\n\nChu, who is also a member of an RSV study group of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a panel that advises the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its vaccine recommendations, says her group has started to evaluate the new vaccines ‚Äì a sign that an FDA review is just around the corner.\n\nNo companies have yet announced that process is underway. FDA reviews can take several months, and then there are typically discussions and votes by FDA and CDC advisory groups before vaccines are made available.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been working on this for several months now to start reviewing the data,‚Äù Chu said. ‚ÄúSo I think this is imminent.‚Äù\n\nWatching this year‚Äôs RSV season unfold, Brown, the pediatrician who enrolled her son in the vaccine trial for toddlers, says progress can‚Äôt come fast enough.\n\n‚ÄúThe hospital is surging. We‚Äôre not drowning the way some states are. I mean, Connecticut, South Carolina, North Carolina, they‚Äôre really drowning. But our numbers are huge, and our services are so busy,‚Äù she says.\n\nBrown says her son is mostly healthy. He doesn‚Äôt have any of the risks for severe RSV she sees with some of her patients, so she was happy to have a way to help others.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAnd while it‚Äôs far too early to say whether the vaccine James is helping to test will prove to be effective, the trial was unblinded last week, and Brown learned that her son was in the group that got the active vaccine, not the placebo\n\nHe has done well through this heavy season of illness, she says. The NIH-sponsored study they participated in is scheduled to be completed next year.\n\nThe vaccine, which is made with a live but very weak version of virus, is given through a couple of squirts up the nose, so there are no needles. The hardest part for squirmy James, she said, was being held still.\n\n‚ÄúIf we can do anything to move science forward and help another child, like, sorry, James.

Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine candidate is administered to pregnant women who then make antibodies that cross the placenta and protect the baby after birth.\n\n‚ÄúThe [study data monitoring committee] recommended, based on the data that we have, that we should go ahead and file, that this offers the potential for a safe and effective vaccine that could really dramatically help to prevent RSV during the winter season,‚Äù Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer‚Äôs senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, told CNN.\n\nIn the trial, the vaccine was given to pregnant people and appeared to be about 80% effective at preventing severe RSV disease in their infants in the first three months of life. It also cut a baby‚Äôs risk of needing to see a doctor for an RSV infection by half.\n\nPotential for first new product in decades\n\nIf approved, Pfizer‚Äôs inoculation will be the first against RSV and the first new product related to the infection in over two decades.\n\nIn March, the FDA designated Pfizer‚Äôs RSV vaccine a breakthrough therapy, a status that speeds its review.\n\n‚ÄúThat puts us in a very good position to essentially have something well in advance of next winter,‚Äù Gruber said, noting that both Pfizer and the FDA are conscious of the ongoing heavy RSV season in the US.\n\n‚ÄúIt will be up to them whether or not they can think of any other path that could allow this to come sooner,‚Äù he said.\n\nPfizer‚Äôs vaccine contains the virus‚Äô F-protein, the site that it uses to attach to human cells. The protein is frozen into the shape it folds into before it fuses with a cell, so the immune system can build antibodies against it. Pfizer‚Äôs RSV vaccine is bivalent, containing F-proteins from both the A and B subgroups of the RSV virus, which are the two most commonly circulating strains.\n\nIn a study of 7,400 pregnant people and infants, the vaccine was 82% effective at preventing severe lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized babies for the first three months of life. It was about 70% effective at preventing severe RSV in hospitalized infants for six months.\n\nBabies were considered to have severe RSV if they were breathing very rapidly, over 70 breaths per minute in a 2-month-old; if their blood oxygen levels fell below 93%; if they required high-flow oxygen, or if they were admitted to the ICU; or if they lost consciousness.\n\nThe vaccine cut the need for infants to need to see a doctor because of RSV by an average of more than 50% compared with a placebo. That result did not fall within a statistical range that was specified by the FDA before the outset of the trial, however, so the company acknowledges that the vaccine missed that particular goalpost.\n\nGruber points out, however, that a 50% reduction in doctor visits due to RSV is still likely to be a noticeable and important benefit in the real world.\n\n‚ÄúThis is clearly sufficient and frankly, great news, for filing for our approval,‚Äù he said.\n\nPfizer also recently announced positive results in an ongoing trial of the same vaccine in older adults.\n\nLonger-term research\n\nThe drugmaker‚Äôs FDA filing would make it the first in a crowded field of companies developing vaccines against RSV. GSK had been testing a maternal vaccine but paused its study after learning of a safety problem.\n\nGSK said Monday that the trial remains stopped, though it did not share any details on the safety issue.\n\n‚ÄúFurther analysis to better understand safety data from these trials is ongoing,‚Äù spokesperson Alison Hunt said in a statement to CNN. ‚ÄúThe relevant regulatory authorities and trial investigators have been informed. We‚Äôre committed to transparently sharing more data as we have it.‚Äù\n\nNo safety issues have been identified with Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine, Gruber said, and a panel of independent reviewers that looks over the study findings while the trial is progressing found no problems.\n\n‚ÄúThe vaccine is very tolerable, and no safety signals were identified,‚Äù he said, though the full results of the trial have not been published.\n\nAlthough Pfizer will suspend enrollment in the maternal vaccination trial, Gruber says it will continue to follow the infants who are enrolled.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n‚ÄúWe know that children that have RSV end up having compromised lung status, and they become more susceptible, in many instances, to other respiratory infections that puts them back in the hospital.

Moderna‚Äôs updated vaccine is a 50-microgram dose authorized for people age 18 and older.\n\nThe shots can be administered after they‚Äôre recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC‚Äôs vaccine advisory group is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to support recommending the boosters for use. Then, the CDC director must sign off on the recommendation.\n\nAn OK from the CDC would mean updated boosters could be administered within days ‚Äì both to older people who may have received a booster just a few months ago and younger people who haven‚Äôt been eligible for an additional booster during the latest wave of cases.\n\nBooster shift\n\nThe updated vaccines do not replace shots for the primary series, but they do replace the booster people older than 12 receive.\n\n‚ÄúWith today‚Äôs authorization, the monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are not authorized as booster doses for individuals 12 years of age and older,‚Äù the FDA said.\n\nIndividuals ages 12 and up are eligible for the Pfizer bivalent booster if they have received their primary series and it has been at least two months since their last vaccine dose. Individuals ages 18 and up are eligible for Moderna boosters on the same schedule.\n\nPeople too young to receive an updated booster can still be boosted with the earlier vaccine.\n\nThe FDA said it will ‚Äúwork quickly‚Äù to evaluate future submissions for authorization of bivalent boosters for younger people. Pfizer said in a news release it expects to submit an application for authorization of its updated booster for children ages 5 through 11 in early October, and it‚Äôs working to prepare an application for children ages 6 months through 4 years.\n\n‚ÄúWe want to make sure that adults and the adolescents covered by this authorization are able to get the most up-to-date version of a booster vaccine, and that‚Äôs why we are no longer authorizing the monovalent ‚Äì the original ‚Äì booster for administration as a booster dose to those populations,‚Äù Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA‚Äôs Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said during a news briefing.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the total US population is vaccinated against Covid-19 with an initial series, according to data from the CDC. But less than half of those with their initial series ‚Äì and less than a third of the total population ‚Äì has also gotten a booster.\n\nThere‚Äôs no plan yet to phase out the earlier vaccines used in the primary series, Marks said, but this is a ‚Äútransitional year,‚Äù when people need to make sure they have a ‚Äúgood base upon which we build ‚Ä¶ which will help protect us against the unknown.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve not yet received a booster dose, or it‚Äôs been several months since your last booster dose, now‚Äôs the time to consider getting one,‚Äù Marks said.\n\nOfficials defend swift authorization\n\nOn Wednesday, FDA officials defended their swift emergency use authorization of the updated Covid vaccine booster. Pfizer and Moderna submitted for authorization last week.\n\n‚ÄúThe public can rest assured that a great deal of care has been taken by the FDA to ensure that these updated boosters meet our rigorous safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality standards for emergency use authorization,‚Äù Marks said.\n\nThe agency has authorized these boosters after studies in mice, but ahead of the results of clinical trials in humans.\n\nThis is similar to the way annual flu vaccines are tested each year, but it‚Äôs a first for Covid-19 vaccines. The approach has generated some controversy among vaccine experts. In making the authorization, the agency did not call a new meeting of its independent vaccine advisers, who often weigh in on vaccine changes; the advisory group had offered its insight on updating the original vaccine in meetings over the summer.\n\n‚ÄúWe have been planning for and gathering input on our approach to updated boosters since earlier this year,‚Äù FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said during the news briefing. ‚ÄúThe FDA has extensive experience with evaluating strain changes for influenza vaccines and is confident in the data supporting these latest booster authorizations.‚Äù\n\nIn addition to the animal data, the FDA said it was basing its decision on more than a year of experience with hundreds of millions of doses of mRNA vaccines given around the globe. They are also relying on human clinical trials of different bivalent vaccines that target the original Omicron strain. That vaccine has been authorized in the UK, but will not be available in the US. More than 1,400 participants were enrolled in clinical trials of the Pfizer and Moderna bivalent vaccines against BA.1.\n\nHuman studies of the bivalent boosters, which combine the companies‚Äô original vaccine with one that targets the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sublineages, have started, Marks said on Wednesday.

However, we do have some reservations on the [intradermal] approach,‚Äù CEO Paul Chaplin wrote in a letter Tuesday to Califf and US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nThose reservations include ‚Äúthe very limited safety data available‚Äù on this vaccination strategy for monkeypox, the higher reactogenicity compared with the standard dose and subcutaneous route, and the fact that a relatively high percentage of people, 20%, did not get their second shot during a controlled clinical study.\n\n‚ÄúWhile we have certain reservations, we are trying to find the best way to support the EUA by collecting additional data and aligning on the responses to assist state officials in the rollout,‚Äù Chaplin said. ‚ÄúWe are also investing in expanding the manufacturing capacity at both BN and external facilities, with likely more announcements soon to come.‚Äù\n\nThe Chicago Department of Public Health said Wednesday that it will be going along with the federal plan to stretch out the supply of monkeypox vaccine by changing to smaller doses given in a different way ‚Äì but it won‚Äôt happen overnight.\n\n‚ÄúI do think it‚Äôll be a couple of weeks until we‚Äôre rolled out more broadly,‚Äù Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said.\n\nOther city health departments, like Columbus Public Health in Ohio, are still reviewing the new federal strategy and what it means for their local response.\n\n‚ÄúBecause this guidance is new, we are currently reviewing it to determine the impact on our vaccine effort, staffing and supplies,‚Äù Kelli Newman, a spokesperson for Columbus Public Health, wrote in an email to CNN on Wednesday.\n\nA need for ‚Äòformal clinical efficacy data‚Äô\n\nThe efficacy of Jynneos for the prevention of monkeypox originally was tested in animals that were exposed to the virus, and it can be inferred from antibody responses seen in people who participated in smallpox clinical studies.\n\nBut the Jynneos vaccine was originally developed to contribute to the nation‚Äôs defense against smallpox as a bioterrorism response effort ‚Äì so there still isn‚Äôt much data on exactly how well it protects against monkeypox infection, even with a subcutaneous dose.\n\n‚ÄúThere is no formal clinical efficacy data with the monkeypox vaccine ‚Äì but that‚Äôs not a criticism of the vaccine. In fact, I think it‚Äôs a testament to the vaccine development efforts that we actually have a vaccine for monkeypox already, largely before this major outbreak occurred,‚Äù said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\n\nThe FDA approved the Jynneos vaccine in 2019 to prevent smallpox and monkeypox disease, but the approval was mostly to offer a smallpox vaccine option that does not contain live virus. Before then, Sanofi Pasteur Biologics‚Äô ACAM2000 was the only FDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of smallpox. Jynneos has been the preferred vaccine in the current outbreak because ACAM2000 has the potential for more side effects and is not recommended for people with severely weakened immune systems.\n\n‚ÄúJynneos was a second-generation smallpox vaccine whose use case was to be a backup vaccine for individuals who could not get ACAM2000 in the event of a smallpox biological weapons attack,‚Äù said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\n‚ÄúThere was no intention of using ACAM2000 or Jynneos for monkeypox,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEven though they were effective against it, it wasn‚Äôt considered something that they were developing it for.‚Äù\n\nWhen Jynneos was approved, FDA officials said its effectiveness for the prevention of smallpox was determined by a clinical study of about 400 healthy adults. Half of them received ACAM2000, and half got Jynneos.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the Jynneos and ACAM2000 smallpox vaccines are at least 85% effective in preventing monkeypox.\n\n‚ÄúAlthough we don‚Äôt have clinical efficacy data, it is likely that Jynneos will be highly effective, because of what we know about the smallpox vaccine and because of the efficacy with Jynneos against monkeypox in animals,‚Äù Barouch said.\n\nHe added that ‚Äúin general, vaccines are usually more effective at preventing the severe consequences of the disease than preventing acquisition of infection with the pathogen.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe can be confident that this will likely be a highly effective vaccine, but the specifics of it in terms of the exact numerical efficacy ‚Äì and whether that will be prevention of infection or prevention of severe disease ‚Äì those details are really not known at this point,‚Äù Barouch said. ‚ÄúI do think that high-risk people should be vaccinated, but right now, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to give very precise guidance as to exactly what that protection will look like.‚Äù\n\nA chance to ‚Äògreatly improve‚Äô availability\n\nThe uncertainties surrounding the effectiveness of the Jynneos vaccine will be magnified by the change to a lower dose of the vaccine in the real world, outside of a clinical trial, Dr. Philip Krause, former deputy director of the FDA‚Äôs Office of Vaccines Research and Review, and infectious disease physician Dr. Luciana Borio wrote in Stat News on Tuesday.\n\n‚ÄúIf the vaccine can be administered at lower doses at no risk to effectiveness, lower-dose intradermal injections make sense,‚Äù Krause and Borio wrote. ‚ÄúBut this strategy could also backfire. If there is a risk to effectiveness, it may be better to focus the available full doses of vaccine on individuals at highest risk ‚Äî men who have sex with multiple male partners ‚Äî to provide the best chance of getting the outbreak under control.‚Äù\n\nThroughout the outbreak, the vaccine has been given to health-care workers treating people with monkeypox, to close contacts of patients and to people who have been able to find doses at local clinics. The CDC has estimated that at least 1.5 million people in the US are eligible for monkeypox vaccination.\n\n‚ÄúWe have a line out around the corner,‚Äù Dr. Stacy Lane, a clinician at the Central Outreach Wellness Center in Pittsburgh, said Tuesday of the demand for the monkeypox vaccine at her clinic.\n\nHHS has delivered more than 670,000 doses of the Jynneos vaccine from the Strategic National Stockpile to support local monkeypox response efforts on the ground.\n\n‚ÄúIn addition, the SNS is preparing to distribute approximately 400,000 additional vials to states and jurisdictions as part of the next phase of the national vaccine strategy,‚Äù according to the White House. ‚ÄúJurisdictions that administer 90% of their current vaccine supply may request additional doses sooner.‚Äù\n\nAnd because of the authorization of intradermal injections, ‚Äúthe 400,000 vials of vaccine in the SNS‚Äôs inventory that have been allocated but not yet distributed hold the potential to provide up to 2 million doses using intradermal administration. Additionally, vaccines that have been received by jurisdictions, but not yet administered, are eligible for intradermal administration.‚Äù\n\nLane said the shift to an intradermal strategy could ‚Äúgreatly improve‚Äù the availability of vaccine. Her clinic has ordered the shorter syringes needed to administer the vaccine intradermally, the same ones used for tuberculosis testing, she said.\n\n‚ÄúI ordered those this afternoon,‚Äù she said Tuesday, before the FDA issued its authorization.\n\nLane said many of her patients are worried about getting monkeypox, and she refers them to the ACAM2000 vaccine data as a reference point for how well the Jynneos vaccine may protect against monkeypox.\n\n‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre educating people on is that we know from historical data that the ACAM2000 vaccine that was historically given in Africa was about 85% protective against monkeypox. We know that these orthopox families of viruses tend to be responding to the same treatment, as well as the vaccine being somewhat effective,‚Äù Lane said.\n\nShe added that she does not anticipate any concern around the new vaccination strategy.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not really seeing any vaccine hesitancy, at least at this point,‚Äù she said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDr. Paulette Grey Riveria agreed that the intradermal strategy could be an effective way to stretch the supply.\n\n‚ÄúGiven that less vaccine volume is needed for an intradermal versus a subcutaneous dose, intradermal Jynneos injections could be a reasonable option to maximize supply while not compromising vaccine protection,‚Äù Grey Riveria, family medicine physician with the virtual health platform PlushCare and a regional medical director for the state of Louisiana, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\n‚ÄúScientists are actively studying to determine if immune cells under the skin can activate an antibody response with equal or greater efficiency compared to the subcutaneous route.‚Äù", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/07/17/rsv-babies-toddlers-fda-approves-new-drug-beyfortus-sanofi/70421062007/", "title": "RSV drug Beyfortus gets FDA approval for babies, toddlers", "text": "The Food and Drug Administration approved Monday a drug aimed at protecting infants and toddlers from respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.\n\nThe monoclonal antibody from Sanofi and AstraZeneca, called Beyfortus, is the first of its kind likely to be widely available to everyone up to 24 months of age beyond a small population of immunocompromised children.\n\n‚ÄúRSV can cause serious disease in infants and some children and results in a large number of emergency department and physician office visits each year,‚Äù said Dr. John Farley, director of the Office of Infectious Diseases in the FDA‚Äôs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

(Australian authorities had imposed tough new biosecurity measures on all arrivals after a foot and mouth disease outbreak in Indonesian livestock.)\n\nIn a separate incident a few days earlier, an Australian woman was fined $1,844 after she forgot to declare a leftover Subway sandwich she bought in Singapore.\n\nIn the past year alone, US border officials have fined passengers for bringing a wide range of undeclared food items in their luggage, including balut eggs, pork bologna and turkey ham. Border officials conducted ‚Äú630,150 positive passenger inspections‚Äù in 2021, according to statistics for the fiscal year released by US Customs and Border Protection, and issued thousands of penalties and violations to travelers who failed to declare prohibited agriculture items.\n\nCBP officials at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston discovered balut eggs in a passenger's luggage on March 6. Balut eggs contain a duck embryo, and are boiled and eaten from the shell. US Customs and Border Protection\n\nFailure to declare food products at US air, sea and land border entry points can lead to fines and penalties of up to $10,000, according to the CBP.\n\nHere‚Äôs what you need to know before bringing food products into the US.\n\nWhy are some foods not allowed?\n\nTravelers bringing food products into the US can inadvertently introduce foreign pests and food-borne diseases into the country, which can have a devastating effect on agriculture and the environment. And a pest or disease outbreak could impact more than just farmers. It also means higher grocery bills and shortage of some food items for consumers.\n\nLast year, border officials discovered 264 pests at US ports of entry, a slightly higher number than the 250 found the prior year. Pests intercepted last year include a Saunders 1850 butterfly larvae found in pineapples from Costa Rica. The larvae feeds on plants and legumes, and is considered an invasive pest mainly found in Amazonian tropical rainforest. Introducing it in the US ecosystem could be detrimental to the agriculture industry, the CBP said.\n\n‚ÄúWe work closely with the US Department of Agriculture, Animal and Health Inspection Services to prevent the introduction of plant pests and foreign animal diseases,‚Äù a CBP spokesperson told CNN.\n\nWhat food products are not allowed into the country?\n\nMost meat, poultry, milk and egg products are either banned or restricted in the US ‚Äì with rules depending on the country of origin and what livestock diseases are prevalent in the region.\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture prohibits animal and bird products from countries with reported cases of livestock diseases such as mad cow, foot-and-mouth, avian flu and swine fever. The USDA provides a link where travelers can check common animal diseases in specific countries.\n\nSometimes, there are gray areas. Pork products from Mexico are banned, for example, but a small amount for personal use ‚Äì like a ham sandwich ‚Äì may be allowed at land borders if the meat is thoroughly cooked.\n\nWhat food products can you bring?\n\nA long list of food items are allowed into the US, including condiments, cooking oils, bread, cookies, crackers, cakes, cereal, packed tea and other baked and processed products. The CBP provides a list of allowed items on its website.\n\nJarvis, a beagle, works in the baggage claim area at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. He's part of the Beagle Brigade, which works with border officials to sniff out banned food items in luggage. Daniel Acker/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBut there‚Äôs a catch: If a traveler brings over 50 pounds of an item, it‚Äôs considered a commercial shipment and must undergo additional measures, including extra safety inspections. And every agricultural food item has to be declared on US Customs forms, so inspectors can examine them and ensure they do not carry harmful foreign pests or diseases.\n\n‚ÄúThe declaration must cover all items carried in checked baggage, carry-on luggage or in a vehicle,‚Äù the CBP‚Äôs website notes.\n\nCan you bring in fruits or vegetables?\n\nThe short answer is no.\n\nNearly all fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables are prohibited from entering the US due to risks of pests and diseases ‚Äì some of which can survive in frigid temperatures, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Even the fruits and vegetable snacks provided on an airplane or cruise ship should be left behind, says Lucero Hernandez of the federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\n\nTravelers crossing a land border into the United States from Canada can bring some fresh fruits and vegetables ‚Äì as long as they were grown in Canada. But they need proof that the produce is free of soil, pests, and diseases, and that it was grown in Canada, not just sold there, the USDA says.\n\nAnd in all cases, travelers coming to the US should save receipts and original packaging to prove food products‚Äô country of origin, according to the CBP.\n\nWhat happens if you bring forbidden items?\n\nTravelers who declare agricultural products in their luggage don‚Äôt face penalties ‚Äì even if an inspector concludes the items are not eligible to enter the country, the USDA says. In such cases, the food is destroyed.\n\n‚ÄúAn apple or snack that can mistakenly be brought won‚Äôt always make a significant incident,‚Äù the CBP spokesperson explained of an unintentional failure to declare a food item. ‚ÄúHowever, attempting to bring in prohibited items would lead to traveler delays and may result in a fine.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFailure to declare a prohibited food item may result in the issuance of a civil penalty,‚Äù the spokesperson added.", "authors": ["Faith Karimi"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/04/06/unagi-often-illegal-eel-report-finds-what-know-sushi/11573272002/", "title": "Unagi is often illegal eel, report finds.

A study has found 44% of North American eel samples ‚Äì that's unagi when used in sushi ‚Äì were actually from the critically endangered European eel, whose export has been illegal since 2010.\n\nEel has long been a beloved component of Japanese cuisine. Marinated and grilled, it is served in a donburi dish with rice or as an ingredient in sushi, where it's generally listed as \"unagi,\" Japanese for eel.\n\nWith the popularity of Japanese cuisine worldwide, eel consumption has spiked. In 2019, 280,000 tons of freshwater eels were produced for the consumer market.\n\nUnfortunately, Japan's native eel has been overfished and is now endangered, so sellers have turned to the critically endangered European eel (Anguilla anguilla), but its population is estimated to be 5% of what it once was. To protect the species, the European Union banned its exportation in 2010.\n\nNEWS:Maine lobster industry sues California aquarium for 'red list' that led to boycott\n\nLOBSTERS AND WHALES:Saving endangered right whales pits advocates against lobstermen\n\nThat's why researchers in the United Kingdom were stunned at what they found when they did a DNA analysis of unagi samples purchased in Europe, North America and Asia.\n\n\"I was very surprised to find so much European eel in our North American samples ‚Äì because it‚Äôs illegal to export it,\" said Andrew Griffiths, a lecturer in biological sciences at the University of Exeter and lead author on the study.\n\nThose levels of European eel could link the unagi in your sushi to global organized crime rings depleting an ancient species on the brink of extinction, he said.\n\n\"It's really suggestive of some sort of illegal sale and links to illegal trafficking of live eels to Asia.\"\n\nWhat did university researchers find?\n\nFish fraud has long been a problem, with cheaper fish being sold as pricier fillets. Cheap tilapia is sold as rare red snapper. Rounds cut from skate wings can be sold as pricey scallops.\n\nThe issue with eels is a little more complex. Highly endangered European baby eels are being poached in Europe and smuggled to Asia, where they're grown out in fish farms and sold back to Japan, Europe and North America ‚Äì labeled only as \"eel,\" according to a March paper in the journal Trends in Organized Crime.\n\nThis eel study actually got its start in the San Francisco Bay Area, when one of the authors, Kristen Steele, was working there. \"I started noticing a seeming increase in the number of Japanese restaurants in the Bay Area selling eel in various forms and was surprised, dismayed and intrigued,\" she said.\n\nSteele, at the University College London, together with researchers at the University of Exeter led a study that gathered 114 samples of eel sold in Europe, North America and Asia. The eel samples mostly came from Japanese restaurants as sushi, though a small number were from traditional dishes sold in the United Kingdom, including jellied, stewed and smoked eel.\n\nOCEAN NEWS:Sea life could benefit from the nation's new 'Ocean Climate Action Plan'\n\nBACKGROUND:Fish fraud is off the scale\n\nThe researchers did a DNA analysis of each sample and found that 44% of the North American samples were European eel and 56% were American eel. There were no Japanese eel (Anguilla rostrata) in the samples, which came from New York, Seattle, San Francisco, Dallas, San Diego, Boston and Reno, Nevada.\n\nIn continental Europe, 35% of the samples were Japanese eel and 65% were American eel, which is threatened but whose export is legal.\n\n\"It wasn't what we were expecting,\" Griffiths said.\n\nWhat's wrong with European eels ending up as unagi in sushi?\n\nBecause of habitat destruction, pollution, climate change and overfishing, the European eel population has seen massive declines since the 1960s and has now dropped to 5% of what it once was. The species was declared critically endangered in 2009, and in 2010 the European Union banned its import or export.\n\nBecause of that, there shouldn't have been lots of European eel ending up as sushi in North America, Griffiths said.\n\n\"If our results are broadly representative of sales of European eel in North America, it is difficult to account for all the European eel on sale via licensed and legal routes.\"\n\nHow do the mysterious origins of eels fit into this?\n\nExactly how eels reproduced was a mystery for thousands of years. Only in the past decade was it finally unraveled.\n\nEuropean and American eels spawn in the Sargasso Sea in the Atlantic Ocean. The tiny baby eels swim to coastal areas and then upriver. Called glass eels at this point, they are transparent and are no longer than a pinky finger.\n\nFor millennia, no one realized glass eels were actually the juvenile form of adult eels; they were thought to be another species entirely. When the eels reach freshwater, they grow for a decade or more before they head back to the ocean to reproduce.\n\nTo this day, no one has been able to mimic the lifecycle of eels enough to farm them the way salmon and other fish are farmed. Instead, the tiny glass eels are caught in rivers and then fattened up in eel farms for harvest ‚Äì almost entirely in China.\n\nHow do European eels end up in Chinese eel farms?\n\nThere is a massive illegal trade in European glass eels. Poachers use nets to gather them from European rivers and streams, selling them to middlemen for thousands of dollars a pound. They are then sold to smugglers who either conceal them in fresh-produce shipments or luggage to get them to Asia.\n\nThe tiny eels generally end up in China's Fujian and Guangdong provinces, which have more than 600 eel farms and eel processing plants. It's estimated that 87% of the world's eel farms are in China.\n\nAccording to a paper published March 22 in the journal Trends in Organized Crime, the glass eels are often kept in hidden ponds in underground warehouses near airports before being shipped.\n\nHow does climate change affect you?

The species isn't considered endangered by the United States but is so depleted it was added to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's endangered list in 2014.\n\nWhile European eel was most common in samples taken in North America, Griffiths said that worldwide, American eel made up 66% of unagi products, meaning possible poachers seem to be shifting to U.S.-sourced glass eels.\n\nThe trade is lucrative. The eels can sell for up to $2,200 a pound, said Ellen Shell, whose book on eels, \"Slippery Beasts,\" arrives next year.\n\n\"It's a complicated and risky business,\" she said.\n\nShould you eat unagi?\n\nThe Seafood Watch program at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California has European, Japanese and American eel all on its Red list, meaning they should be avoided because of concerns about the species and the aquaculture used to raise them in Asia.\n\nPart of the problem with eating unagi is that it's very difficult to pin down which eel species you're eating.\n\nThe U.S. government monitors only about 45% of the seafood coming into the United States, so \"you have no idea where your unagi came from,\" said Marla Valentine, director of the ocean nonprofit Oceana's Illegal Fishing and Transparency campaign.\n\n\"Most people don't have any idea how complex and interconnected the network of eel trade has become,\" Steele said, \"and how easy it is for illegally caught and traded eels to get mixed into the legal market.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/07/05/fukushima-water-release-2023/70382604007/", "title": "Fukushima water release plan from Japan approved by UN", "text": "Twelve years after an earthquake and tsunami destroyed parts of the Fukushima nuclear plant and contaminated water supplies, the United Nations has approved Japan's highly anticipated waste disposal plan, which includes slowly discharging treated, radioactive water into the ocean.\n\nThe U.N. atomic energy agency says the initiative, first announced in 2021, meets international standards and will have negligible effects on the sea environment and people's health.\n\nThe discharge method has drawn criticism from fisheries in Japan and neighboring countries and caused demand for seafood to spike preemptively in the region.\n\nSince the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, contaminated water has been collected, treated and stored in tanks at the plant.

In an executive summary, U.N. leaders said that the Japanese government was responsible for creating the plan to dispose of the contaminated water in the ocean and that the world body doesn't necessarily endorse the idea.\n\n\"I would like to emphasize that the release of the treated water stored at Fukushima Daiichi Power Station is a national decision by the Government of Japan and that this report is neither a recommendation nor an endorsement of that policy,\" said Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nHead of UN agency visits Fukushima\n\nOn Wednesday, Grossi visited some of the key facilities that will release treated radioactive water into the sea.\n\n‚ÄúWhat is happening is not something exceptional, some strange plan that has been devised only to be applied here, and sold to you,‚Äù Grossi said in his opening remarks in Iwaki, about 25 miles south of the plant. ‚ÄúThis is, as certified by the IAEA, the general practice that is agreed by and observed in many, many places all over the world.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe are going to stay here with you for decades to come until the last drop of the water which is accumulated around the reactor has been safely discharged,\" he said.\n\nDemand for seafood increases ahead of planned radioactive water release\n\nEarlier this summer, some South Korean shoppers started buying sea salt and seafood in bulk to store at home ahead of Japan's planned release of contaminated water, Reuters reported.\n\nRetailers also started stockpiling in fear of a supply shortage in South Korea, Japan's closest neighbor.\n\n\"South Korea's fisheries authorities have vowed to ramp up efforts to monitor natural salt farms for any rise in radioactive substances and maintain a ban on seafood from the waters near Fukushima,\" Reuters reported in June.\n\nWhy does Japanese government want to discharge radioactive water into ocean?\n\nOther countries such as China, South Korea, the United States and France have disposed of radioactive water in the ocean in the past. The method calls for the contaminated water to be diluted and then released gradually.\n\nThe radioactive water from Fukushima will first be filtered to bring the level of contaminants below international standards. Then it will be diluted in seawater 100 to 1 before it's released in the ocean.\n\nThe water Japan plans to release into the sea contains cesium and other radioactive material. The government's plan says it will be filtered to bring it below international standards for those substances.\n\nBut the plan says the water cannot be filtered below international standards for tritium, which is inseparable from water, The Associated Press reported.\n\nJapan's fisheries oppose discharge of radioactive water\n\nWhile this weeks' report represents the U.N.'s final assessment of the plan, the agency said \"there will be continual monitoring of the water release and its impacts.\"\n\n\"The IAEA is committed to engaging with Japan on the discharge of ALPS treated water not only before, but also during, and after the treated water discharges occur,\" the report says.\n\nIn Japan, local outlets reported fishermen are distressed about what the water release will mean for their way of life.\n\n\"I'm extremely worried as I don't know to what extent the release of the treated water will affect my work and livelihood,\" Eitatsu Kikuchi, a fisherman in Soma, Fukushima Prefecture, told Japan Today.\n\n\"No matter how much we try, we cannot prevent the Fukushima brand from being tarnished,\" he told the outlet.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/06/americas/costa-rica-covid-vaccine-intl-cmd-latam/index.html", "title": "Costa Rica mandated Covid-19 vaccines for children.

But it quickly escalated to a multi-person fist-fight that shocked the nation.\n\nInside the St. Vincent de Paul Hospital in Costa Rica‚Äôs Heredia province, not far from the capital San Jose, the argument ‚Äì over the country‚Äôs Covid-19 vaccine mandate ‚Äì came to blows last week, leading to the arrests of seven people.\n\nBut this fight proved more consequential than for just the people involved: The incident forced authorities to temporarily close the hospital‚Äôs doors, marking a dark moment in the country‚Äôs fight against the pandemic and highlighting the debate around its mandatory vaccination policy.\n\nLast November, Costa Rica became the first country in the world to mandate Covid-19 vaccines for minors, with all children 5 and older required to get vaccinated, barring medical exemptions.\n\nMore than 91% of people between the ages of 12 to 19 have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, according to the latest government data, but vaccinations for younger children have stalled ‚Äì with just 12% of children 5 to 11 so far having received one dose.\n\nA survey published by the Pan-American Health Organization in October found that nearly 94% of the Costa Rican population considers it ‚Äúimportant that all people get vaccinated against Covid-19.‚Äù In the same survey, 89% of parents said they would vaccinate their children who are 12 or younger.\n\nAnd many appear to agree with the mandate.\n\nOne study by the University of Costa Rica‚Äôs School of Statistics found that 75% of respondents said they supported the vaccination mandate for people 18 and older, with support dropping along with age groups; 69% of people agreed with a vaccine mandate for 12-17-year-olds, while 59% were supportive of the measure for children between 5-12.\n\nStill, a small, yet vocal group of parents ‚Äì like the ones that encircled the hospital last week ‚Äì are opposing the measure, catapulting the debate around mandatory vaccines onto the floors of Congress.\n\nPeople take part in a demonstration against the Covid-19 vaccination mandate for children in San Jose, Costa Rica, in January. Ezequiel Becerra/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe attack in Heredia unfolded after a six-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital for a respiratory problem, according to the hospital‚Äôs director, Priscila Balmaceda Chaves. When the attending doctor learned the child was not vaccinated, he told the child‚Äôs father that he would need to do so. Under the mandate, a child can get vaccinated even if their parents do not consent, however that process is not instantaneous, according to public health expert Roman Macaya Hayes, who heads the Costa Rican Social Security Institute.\n\nAngered that his child might be vaccinated without his permission, the father ‚Äì along with six others ‚Äì went down to stop it, according to officials. That‚Äôs when the fist fight broke out.\n\nCongressional President Silvia Hern√°ndez S√°nchez called the group a ‚Äúmob, angered by foolishness,‚Äù whose violent actions ‚Äúput both staff and patients at risk,‚Äù with Costa Rica‚Äôs public security minister asking the courts to ‚Äúapply the full severity of the law.‚Äù\n\nHayes told CNN that protecting the health of a child is equivalent to preventing child abuse, as the result is the same: ensuring the wellbeing of minors.\n\nHe explained that mandatory vaccination is backed by legislation, including laws that support the ‚Äúconstitutional right to life and, therefore, health.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe collective good supersedes the rights of the individual,‚Äù Hayes said.\n\nNot all lawmakers agree ‚Äì although they, too, appear to be in the minority.\n\nOne of the most vocal of those objectors is independent lawmaker Erick Rodr√≠guez Steller, who has called the mandate ‚Äúnonsense,‚Äù saying that it leaves Costa Rica under a ‚Äúsanitary dictatorship.‚Äù\n\nWhile Rodr√≠guez says that he doesn‚Äôt condone the violence that took place at the Heredia hospital, he said that the father had every right to prevent his child from getting vaccinated.\n\nRodr√≠guez expressed his opposition to the mandate in congress last week, saying that ‚Äúthe state shouldn‚Äôt be in the business of deciding how we raise our children.‚Äù\n\nHe later told CNN that he has been vaccinated, that he believes in science and that he is not an ‚Äúanti-vaxxer‚Äù ‚Äì even if local media alleges the father of the boy at the center of the controversy is.\n\nRodr√≠guez said that he believes there has not been enough information around risks of vaccines for children ‚Äì and that he and others who are opposed to the mandate just want to find out the ‚Äútruth‚Äù about any potential risks.\n\nStudies around the world have concluded that the Covid-19 vaccines are safe for children, with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommending them for children ages 5 and older.\n\nAnd in Latin America, Cuba, Chile and Argentina have been running successful child vaccine campaigns for months.\n\nStill, governments around the world have largely shied away from mandatory vaccinations, opting instead for incentives to motivate people to get shots.\n\nEven in authoritarian states, including China ‚Äì where vaccines are approved for children from the age of 3 ‚Äì they are not mandatory. That tide could be turning in Europe, however. On Friday, Austria became the first European nation to impose a vaccine mandate on its adult population.\n\nSome say the mandates are testing the boundary between public health and civil liberties, adding to tensions between those who are vaccinated and those who are not.\n\nRodr√≠guez, the independent legislator, said he doesn‚Äôt fully rule out supporting a mandate, but that it must have the consensus of congress.\n\n‚ÄúWhen it comes to restricting rights and liberties, you have to go through the Legislative Assembly, and here, health authorities have ignored us,‚Äù he said.\n\nHayes insists the mandate is not about restricting liberties, but ensuring the public good, especially when there‚Äôs a vaccine that has been proven safe and effective around the world.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs keep alive the Costa Rican tradition of believing in vaccines, believing in science and believing in doctors who are treating patients with their best interest in mind, because these vaccines save lives,‚Äù he said.", "authors": ["Rafael Romo"], "publish_date": "2022/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/china/china-protests-loosen-restrictions-intl-hnk-mic/index.html", "title": "China Covid restrictions: Protesters win a partial victory as cities start ...", "text": "Editor‚Äôs Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN‚Äôs Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country‚Äôs rise and how it impacts the world.

And some residential compounds now allow infected residents with special needs to quarantine at home, instead of being sent to centralized quarantine.\n\n‚ÄúI feel like everyone‚Äôs hard work is paying off,‚Äù said a protester who took part in a demonstration in Beijing.\n\nChina‚Äôs top health official signaled a change in strategy on Wednesday, by declaring the country‚Äôs pandemic controls had entered a ‚Äúnew stage and mission.‚Äù Xi later shared his thoughts on the issue with the visiting European Council President, according to an EU official who said the Chinese leader had acknowledged people were frustrated and suggested China was open to relaxing its Covid rules.\n\nIt was an extraordinary contrast to Xi‚Äôs ringing endorsement of the ‚Äútenacious pursuit‚Äù of zero-Covid at the Communist Party Congress in late October ‚Äì back then, he made no mention of the public anger that had been simmering for months, or the soaring economic and social costs of the policy that he had personally backed.\n\nJust six weeks ago, Xi‚Äôs authority seemed all but unassailable. He secured a groundbreaking third term in power, moved politically more moderate leaders into early retirement, and stacked the new leadership with staunch loyalists ‚Äì including some of the most faithful enforcers of his zero-Covid strategy.\n\nThat image of unquestioned and absolute control was pierced late last month by an explosion of dissent from residents, migrant workers and university students who‚Äôd had enough.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'River of blood': Foxconn employee describes violent protests in China 03:26 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a worrying development for the party, in addition to Covid restrictions, many young protesters also directed their anger at Xi‚Äôs authoritarian policies, from ever-tightening censorship to all-encompassing ideological controls, which now dictate what they‚Äôre allowed to watch, read, listen to and buy in their private lives to an extent unseen in decades.\n\nSome demanded greater political freedoms, others decried dictatorship and life-long rule, but the boldest political defiance came from Shanghai, China‚Äôs largest city and financial hub, where crowds openly called for Xi to ‚Äústep down‚Äù for two consecutive nights.\n\nProtesters shout slogans against China's strict zero-Covid measures on November 28, 2022 in Beijing. Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile China‚Äôs security forces moved swiftly to snuff out the demonstrations, the growing calls for political change ‚Äì unheard of on such a scale since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests ‚Äì have likely pushed authorities to speed up the easing of restrictions.\n\nState media has carefully avoided all mention of the protests, instead framing the policy adjustment as following the science, a development noted by one Beijing resident in a widely circulated ‚Äì and later censored ‚Äì Weibo post: ‚ÄúWhen you talk to him about democracy, he finally talks to you about science.‚Äù\n\nHaving stoked pervasive public fear of catching and dying of Covid, Chinese state media is now citing months-old research on the comparative ‚Äúdecreased pathogenicity‚Äù of the Omicron variant. Some state media outlets also shared an interview with a medical expert who raised doubts about long Covid ‚Äì a sharp contrast to previous coverage playing up the long-term risks of contracting the virus.\n\nThe about-face in public messaging is not lost on many Chinese people critical of zero-Covid. Some shared juxtaposed screenshots of two reports from the state-run People‚Äôs Daily published five months apart ‚Äì one highlighting the severity of long Covid, and one with the headline: ‚ÄúAt present, there is no evidence showing long Covid exists.‚Äù\n\nDespite the partial relaxation, many restrictions remain in place ‚Äì and in some parts of the country, new lockdowns and travel restrictions are still being imposed.\n\n‚ÄúIt appears that moving away from zero-Covid is pretty much a decentralized process in China: while some localities are easing restrictions, some allegedly still cling to zero-Covid, and still others are waiting and watching,‚Äù wrote Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. ‚ÄúPolicy flip-flop is common.‚Äù\n\nIn some cities, the partial relaxation has caused confusion and chaos on the ground. In Beijing, public venues such as shopping malls and office buildings still require a 48-hour negative Covid test for entry. The abrupt removal of testing kiosks in the capital has also caused long lines at the remaining testing locations.\n\nStill, residents across major Chinese cities shared photos of testing booths being removed from the streets, celebrating what some saw as the ‚Äúbeginning of the end‚Äù to zero-Covid.\n\nOthers are in no mood for celebration, citing the livelihood ruined and lives lost due to the draconian lockdowns.\n\n‚ÄúThere will be no compensations, no apologies, no discovery of the truth, just moving on. What can lock us down can also easily unlock us. How terrifying is this capricious power, and when will it overturn your life again? I don‚Äôt celebrate, I just remember those brave friends with gratitude,‚Äù a Beijing resident posted on Weibo, in a reference to the protesters.\n\n‚ÄúFreedom does not fall from the sky.‚Äù", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/06/politics/solar-energy-china-investigation-climate/index.html", "title": "Solar energy projects are grinding to a halt in the US amid ...", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nThe solar energy industry has been thrown into a panic and projects are grinding to a halt after the Biden administration launched an investigation that some solar CEOs worry could tank the industry.\n\nThe Commerce Department launched the probe in March into whether four countries in Southeast Asia that supply about 80% of US solar panels and parts ‚Äì Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam ‚Äì are using components from China that should be subject to US tariffs.\n\nThe fallout within the industry has been significant.\n\nA survey in late April by the Solar Energy Industries Association, a non-profit trade association, found 318 solar projects in the US had already been delayed or canceled, and several CEOs told CNN they expect more to follow. Industry leaders fear the probe could also have a devastating impact on the solar workforce.\n\nThe Commerce Department has defended it as a transparent and necessary process, but several solar industry experts and executives told CNN it has also essentially frozen most solar imports into the US because of the threat of steep, retroactive tariffs.\n\n‚ÄúWith this administration and this much support, we‚Äôre in a position where we‚Äôre going to be laying off people in the renewables industry,‚Äù George Hershman, CEO of utility solar contractor SOLV Energy, told CNN. ‚ÄúWhile you say all those things we agree with, we‚Äôre getting crushed because we literally can‚Äôt buy a module today. It‚Äôs so frustrating.‚Äù\n\nThe investigation was launched after one small US-based company, Auxin Solar, filed a complaint in February. Auxin CEO Mamun Rashid told CNN that the complaint ‚Äúwas existential‚Äù for his company.\n\n‚ÄúWhen prices of finished panels from Southeast Asia come in below our bill of materials cost, American manufacturers cannot compete,‚Äù Rashid said, adding that ‚Äúif foreign producers are circumventing U.S. law and causing harm to U.S. producers like Auxin Solar, it needs to be addressed.‚Äù\n\nRashid told CNN it‚Äôs ‚Äúlamentable‚Äù that frustration is aimed at his company, rather than the ‚Äúforeign suppliers‚Äù that he says are circumventing US law. Rashid also noted that Auxin is ‚Äúhere and can quickly scale up to meet needs of utilities within 2 to 3 quarters if we have the purchase order today.‚Äù\n\nSolar industry leaders have been communicating with the Commerce Department and have also communicated their concerns about the probe to Biden‚Äôs top climate officials ‚Äì including McCarthy and US Climate Envoy John Kerry ‚Äì a person familiar with the conversations said.\n\n‚ÄúThe administration has been in touch with and is engaging with all kinds of solar stakeholders including the trade associations but also labor, communities, and NGOs,‚Äù a White House official told CNN.\n\n‚ÄòThe worst moment‚Äô\n\nThe Commerce probe comes on the heels of last year‚Äôs ban on solar panels and parts that were suspected of having links to forced labor in China‚Äôs Xinjiang Province.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security directed US Customs and Border Protection to issue a Withhold Release Order, which banned imports made by Chinese company Hoshine Silicon Industry Co., after the government alleged the company uses forced Uyghur labor.\n\n‚ÄúObviously, the industry absolutely needed to address any concerns about forced labor, but the implementation of that [order] was far from smooth,‚Äù Solar Energy Industries Association President Abigail Ross Hopper told CNN.\n\nAt ports around the country, CBP agents seized and detained any solar products they suspected had links to Hoshine, unless companies could prove they did not.\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection statistics provided to CNN note the agency detained 734 shipments valued at $246 million, which the agency said is just 1.86% of the total value of all solar imports into the United States. But Hershman said the order ultimately led to a chilling effect across the industry, where companies withheld shipments for fear of being caught in an overly broad net at US ports.\n\n‚ÄúIf you have materials detained, you don‚Äôt want to ship more,‚Äù Hershman said.\n\nElectricians with IBEW Local 3 install solar panels on top of the Terminal B garage at LaGuardia Airport in November 2021. Mary Altaffer/AP\n\nSolar CEOs and industry analysts told CNN that while the CBP order was eventually resolved with a good outcome for the industry, the impact of the Commerce investigation is like whiplash.\n\n‚ÄúSolar is a big mess right now,‚Äù said Marcelo Ortega, an analyst for Rystad. ‚ÄúThis seems to be the worst moment for this to happen.‚Äù\n\nThis year was supposed to be a banner year for US solar growth. Independent energy research firm Rystad estimated the US would add another 27 gigawatts of solar energy this year.\n\nNow ‚Äì between the Commerce Department probe, the border seizures, the high cost of solar components and no new legislation in Congress to grease the wheels for more renewable energy ‚Äì Rystad estimates the US might only add around 10 gigawatts in 2022.\n\nOrtega said the backslide threatens Biden‚Äôs own climate goal to slash planet-warming emissions in half by 2030. The US would have to install around 50 gigawatts of solar photovoltaic capacity each year from 2022 to 2030 to keep Biden‚Äôs goal on-track, according to Ortega‚Äôs analysis.\n\nRoss Hopper told CNN that the industry is looking for certainty from the markets and from governments, but that it‚Äôs getting none of that right now.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs certainly been this steady cadence of challenges that keep getting thrown our way right at these moments of opportunity,‚Äù Ross Hopper told CNN.\n\nCommerce defends the probe\n\nAt a recent hearing on Capitol Hill, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo told lawmakers that strict trade laws required her department to initiate and complete an investigation. The department is expected to issue a preliminary finding on the investigation by late August, but a final determination could take as long as January 2023, a Commerce Department official told CNN.\n\n‚ÄúMy hands are very tied here,‚Äù Raimondo said at the hearing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm required by statute to investigate a claim that companies operating in other countries are trying to circumvent the duties, and I‚Äôm required by statute to have a fulsome investigation.‚Äù\n\nThe 6 megawatt Stanton Solar Farm outside of Orlando, Florida.

A bipartisan group of 19 senators wrote to Biden this week asking for an expedited preliminary decision on the investigation.\n\nAnd at a recent hearing, Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat, pressed Raimondo on her ‚Äúvery serious concerns‚Äù about the investigation.\n\n‚ÄúThis will jeopardize tens of thousands of good-paying American solar jobs,‚Äù Rosen said. ‚ÄúIf we lose these jobs, they won‚Äôt come back.‚Äù\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb of Indiana also recently wrote to Raimondo expressing concern that the investigation could impact solar growth and jobs in their states.\n\nAlthough solar CEOs and industry analysts welcome the idea of a domestic solar supply chain, those who spoke with CNN said the Commerce Department investigation won‚Äôt be the catalyst ‚Äì the industry needs Congress to incentivize it.\n\n‚ÄúIf what we‚Äôre talking about is incentivizing domestic manufacturing, this is not the way to do it,‚Äù said Ben Catt, CEO of utility-scale solar company Pine Gate Renewables. ‚ÄúThis is going to have not just a months but years-long impact to the solar industry.

During this time they will be able to go outside but will be restricted from some places.\n\nArrivals will no longer need to provide a negative PCR test before boarding a plane. However, they will need to provide a negative rapid antigen test (RAT) 24 hours before they board.\n\nDuring the three-day monitoring period, people will be assigned an amber color under the city‚Äôs digital health code, which will prevent them from entering places such as bars or restaurants.\n\nThey will need to do PCR tests on days 2, 4 and 6 after arrival, and an RAT test every day for seven days after arrival.\n\nThe policy shift came after Japan announced that it will re-open its borders from October 11 and after Taiwan said it aims to scrap its mandatory quarantine on October 13 if the island has passed the peak of its latest Omicron BA-5 outbreak.\n\nQuestions about when the city would loosen restrictions have grown more pointed as two major international events, the Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament and a global banking conference, were slated for November and seen as a way to revive the beleaguered city, which has been rocked in recent years by pro-democracy protests and an ensuing crackdown on civil liberties by Beijing.\n\nWhile various governments brought in border controls following the outbreak of the pandemic, most have since rolled back the measures, including Singapore, which typically vies with Hong Kong to attract foreign business and talent.\n\nBut unlike other global hubs, Hong Kong‚Äôs Covid-19 policies have long been seen as closely tied to mainland China, where Beijing continues to maintain a stringent zero-Covid policy and border quarantines, with no sign of easing as stamping out infection remains a top priority.\n\nCalls for the international border controls to be loosened under the leadership of Lee‚Äôs predecessor Carrie Lam, who left office June 30, were stymied by a competing demand to open quarantine-free travel to the mainland ‚Äì a proposition that has yet gone unfulfilled.\n\nA public signal of Beijing‚Äôs support for Hong Kong‚Äôs new policy route came on September 20, when the deputy head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Huang Liuquan said the Hong Kong government had been coordinating its policies in line with its local situation and adjustments did not need to be ‚Äúoverinterpreted.‚Äù\n\nWhile the new policy for international arrivals in Hong Kong may not be a harbinger of imminent change in mainland policy, it is a mark of divergent situations on each side of the border.\n\nThough the city kept local cases to a minimum for the first two years of the pandemic, Hong Kong experienced an explosive outbreak of the highly infectious Omicron variant earlier this year and has not revived a zero-Covid stance since. Instead, the city has continued to clock between hundreds and thousands of daily cases. Officials records show over 1.7 million cases have been reported in the city of 7.4 million, though experts believe the real number is higher.\n\nIn mainland China, in contrast, the vast majority of the country has yet to be exposed to the virus ‚Äì placing its population at a deficit when it comes to natural immunity from infection, a concern for health officials there who fear the strain of a widescale outbreak on the health care system.\n\nHong Kong‚Äôs new measures comes more than 900 days after the city first enacted border restrictions in March 2020 and nearly two years after it mandated hotel quarantine for all international arrivals in December 2020. At its longest, the quarantine period stretched to 21 days. Travelers who tested positive during quarantine were moved to designated facilities, including, at times, government-run camps.\n\nThe program became increasingly controversial among the public after Covid-19 vaccines became widely available, local case numbers rose and places with similar systems like New Zealand and Australia opened their borders.\n\nThis summer a dearth of available hotel rooms and limited flights raised public anger as travelers risked being trapped outside the city until a free room opened up if their itinerary was disrupted, for example by catching Covid-19 or having a flight rescheduled.\n\nCertain restrictions have been eased in recent months. In May non-Hong Kong residents were permitted to enter the city from overseas for the first time in more than two years, while a scheme that saw some flights with Covid-positive passengers suspended was scrapped in July.\n\nEarlier this summer, Lee‚Äôs administration reduced quarantine from one week to three days, plus an additional four days of health monitoring, during which arrivals are not allowed to go to places including bars, gyms and restaurants.\n\nHotel quarantine and pre-flight testing requirements had been seen as a remaining significant hurdle to travel into the city, though questions remain over what role the new plan will play in reviving the city‚Äôs once vibrant tourism industry.", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy Kathleen Magramo", "Simone Mccarthy", "Kathleen Magramo"], "publish_date": "2022/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/23/us/miami-dade-school-sex-ed-textbooks/index.html", "title": "Florida school board rejects new sex ed textbooks | CNN", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nThe board of Florida‚Äôs largest school district has rejected new sexual education textbooks that it approved three months ago.\n\nThe 5-4 vote by the Miami-Dade County School Board on Wednesday leaves students without a sex ed curriculum.\n\nThe decision comes four months after the state passed a law banning certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom that critics call the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Say Gay‚Äù law.\n\nThe textbooks cover pregnancy prevention, understanding sexuality and sexually transmitted infections, drugs and alcohol, and relationships, according to descriptions in the book.\n\nIn April, the board approved middle school and high school versions of the Comprehensive Health Skills textbook.

Xu, who says the doctor told her to get married and have children instead, sued the hospital the following year arguing the decision was unfair.\n\nThe Chaoyang District People‚Äôs court ruled against her on July 22 this year, saying the hospital had been right to refuse the request ‚Äì dashing her hopes and igniting social media arguments over whether the laws surrounding assisted reproduction discriminate against single women.\n\nRules issued by China‚Äôs National Health Commission in the early 2000s allow single men to freeze their sperm, but block single women from freezing their eggs.\n\nMany people reacted angrily to the verdict against Xu on China‚Äôs Twitter-like platform Weibo.\n\n‚ÄúA single woman can‚Äôt freeze (her eggs) but a single man is allowed to freeze (his sperm)? What a double standard!‚Äù said one user.\n\nAnother said, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt women freeze their eggs? Why can men store their sperm? It is difficult for women to conceive after the age of 40.‚Äù\n\nHealth officials have defended the policy by claiming egg collection, as opposed to sperm collection, and giving birth at an older age involve health risks ‚Äì reasons the health commission cites as justification for the ban.\n\nWhile the usual process to extract sperm is relatively simple and rarely involves surgery, egg freezing requires hormone injections and an egg retrieval procedure that takes place under anesthesia.\n\nHowever, some experts in China have argued the procedure, which is widely practiced around the world, is no more dangerous for a single woman than it is a married one and question whether the risks cited in current regulations justify the ban.\n\nIn a 2015 peer-reviewed article, Sun Xiaoxi, deputy director of the Genetics & IVF Institute at Fudan University‚Äôs Obstetrics & Gynecology Hospital, said the risks associated with egg freezing were ‚Äúsmall probability events.‚Äù\n\nChina‚Äôs population problems\n\nThe case comes amid a growing demographic crisis that has seen authorities step up efforts to encourage couples to have more children ‚Äì including by scrapping China‚Äôs controversial one-child policy in 2015 and last year allowing families to have three children.\n\nThese efforts have met with limited success, highlighting gender inequality and economic pressures facing families in China instead.\n\nWhile the egg freezing ban may appear at odds with the Chinese government‚Äôs push to raise its birth rate, part of the authorities‚Äô reticence to allow the procedure for single women is that they see egg freezing as a way of delaying pregnancy rather than facilitating it.\n\nAn official notice last year from China‚Äôs National Health Commission listed several medical and ethical reasons why the ban should stay, including that it could give women false hope of delaying their reproduction plans.\n\nBut advocates have spoken out in favor of lifting the ban as an issue of women‚Äôs rights, amid a larger debate around gender equality that‚Äôs grown in China during recent years. Others question the idea that the technology would have a negative impact on birth rates.\n\nIn a March 2021 paper, Huang Wenzheng, a senior researcher specializing in demographic studies at the Center for China & Globalization think tank, argued that allowing egg freezing for unmarried women older than 35 could help boost the Chinese population.\n\n‚Äú(These women) might lose the chance of ever getting pregnant without access to this technology,‚Äù he wrote.\n\nXu, for one, will continue to fight for change.

Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe crackdown, which killed hundreds, if not thousands, of unarmed protesters, is shunned in classrooms and strictly censored in the media and online. Censors are particularly vigilant in the lead-up to its anniversary, swiftly scrubbing even the vaguest references ‚Äì from candle emojis to coded phrases like ‚ÄúMay 35‚Äù ‚Äì from the internet.\n\nAs a result, many young Chinese ‚Äì especially those born after the massacre ‚Äì have grown up with little knowledge of the tragedy.\n\nSo it is perhaps no surprise that many of Li‚Äôs mostly young fans were puzzled by the sudden suspension of his Friday show, during which he sold a wide range of snacks and drinks from cookies to sodas.\n\n‚ÄúWhat on earth happened to Li Jiaqi? All of a sudden his livestream is gone. Can anyone who knows about it tell us?‚Äù a user asked on Weibo, China‚Äôs Twitter-like platform.\n\nIt is possible that Li himself, born in 1992, was also unaware of the symbolism. Having made his name as the ‚ÄúLipstick King‚Äù after selling 15,000 lipsticks in just five minutes in 2018, Li had been careful to stay in the good books of authorities. As many of his peers have found out, a careless political mistake risks losing business sponsorships or worse.\n\nChinese influencer Li Jiaqi. Li Wenyou/ICHPL Imaginechina/Li Wenyou\n\nShortly after his livestream was cut, Li told his 50 million followers on Weibo that his team was fixing a ‚Äútechnical glitch‚Äù and asked them to ‚Äúwait for a moment.‚Äù Two hours later, he apologized in another post that the live broadcast could no longer resume that evening due to ‚Äúa failure of our internal equipment.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEverybody please go to bed early. We will bring you the products that have not been broadcast (tonight) in future livestreams,‚Äù he wrote.\n\nBut the promised livestreams never came. On Sunday, Li failed to show up for another scheduled show, further confounding and worrying fans.\n\nOn Monday, a search for Li‚Äôs name no longer returned relevant results on Taobao, the online shopping site where Li‚Äôs show was live streamed. He boasts 60 million followers on the site.\n\nCNN has reached out for comments from Mei One, Li‚Äôs agency; Unilever, the British multinational that owns Wall‚Äôs; and Alibaba, the Chinese tech giant that owns Taobao.\n\nOn Weibo, posts and comments linking the suspension of Li‚Äôs broadcast to the tank-shaped ice cream started to proliferate. Some fans said they found out about the sensitivity of the tank symbol by circumventing China‚Äôs Great Firewall of online censorship, alluding to the massacre as ‚Äúthat event.‚Äù The discussions happened in veiled terms under the watchful eyes of censors, and many of them disappeared soon after they were posted.\n\nAmong the posts that remained visible were those that vowed to ‚Äútrust our (Communist) Party and trust our state‚Äù despite learning about the crackdown. Others said they believed Li was framed by ‚Äúcapitalists‚Äù or ‚Äúforeign forces.‚Äù\n\nEric Liu, an analyst at China Digital Times, a US-based news website tracking censorship in China, said the Chinese government was caught in an awkward position ‚Äì if it censors Li‚Äôs name entirely, it risks drawing even more attention to the case. Therefore, Weibo had to deploy a large amount of human power to manually censor every post that mentions Li‚Äôs name, Liu said.\n\n‚ÄúThis is the Streisand effect,‚Äù he said, referring to the unintended consequence of drawing attention to information by trying to have it censored.\n\n‚ÄúCensorship is all about keeping the truth from the public. But if people don‚Äôt know about it, they are bound to keep making ‚Äòmistakes‚Äô like this,‚Äù he said.\n\nSimilar incidents have happened before.

But food prices rose at an even faster pace, increasing by 11.4% during that period, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nScorching heat and drought continue to bear down on the American West, forcing farmers in vital agriculture-producing states to fallow land, pull up orchards, reduce livestock herds, and slash expected yields.\n\n‚ÄúThe prolonged droughts that we‚Äôre seeing [present] some increased risk that inflation remains higher for a longer time,‚Äù said Charlie Dougherty, a Wells Fargo economist who recently co-authored a status report on the economic state of American agriculture.\n\nThe high heat and drought have only compounded the issues facing American farmers, including supply chain ripple effects from Russia‚Äôs war against Ukraine that have caused inputs such as fertilizer to surge in price; nationwide worker shortages; and inflation and high energy prices, the economists noted.\n\n‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôve put all that together, farmers and ranchers have experienced extraordinary cost pressures,‚Äù Dougherty said. ‚ÄúAnd those higher costs are being passed on to consumers.‚Äù The rise in food prices is one of the key factors fueling inflation, according to recent CPI data.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of fruits, tree nuts and vegetables are sourced from drought-stricken states such as California and Texas, the American Farm Bureau Federation noted in a recent market update.\n\nThe drought and its effects ‚Äúwill likely result in American consumers paying more for these goods and either partially relying on foreign supplies or shrinking the diversity of items they buy at the store,‚Äù according to the Farm Bureau. ‚ÄúDrought conditions in the US also risk global access to some items like almonds, since California produces 80% of the world‚Äôs supply.‚Äù\n\nWhile the majority of those specialty crops are holding up, one of the hardest-hit crops in California has been rice, according to Aaron Smith, UC Davis‚Äô DeLoach professor of agricultural economics.\n\nRice acres have dropped by 55% this year, Smith said, noting US Department of Agriculture data showing an increase in prevented-planting acres, or land intended for a crop but prevented by natural disaster or inadequate water.\n\nCalifornia, which is second to Arkansas in rice production among US states, generates about $900 million of rice annually, he said. California is a key producer and exporter of medium-grain rice, found in sushi and risotto dishes. While the acreage drop represents a big hit to US rice production, the effects could be mitigated by other sources, he said.\n\n‚ÄúIf you look in a global perspective, which is what drives the price of rice, California is not a very big producer relative to the whole world,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúThe local impact is very big; the global impact and the consumer impact for now ‚Äî not so big.‚Äù\n\nA worker walks along a dried-up field of sunflowers while extreme weather conditions, including record-breaking heat waves, are the latest sign of climate change in the western United States, where wildfires and severe drought have emerged as a growing threat, near Sacramento, California, U.S., August 18, 2022. Carlos Barria/Reuters\n\nThe globalized economy and trade serve as a buffer to an extent, said Josu√© Medell√≠n-Azuara, an associate professor of environmental engineering at UC Merced who studies climate change adaption and the economics of agricultural, environmental and urban water uses.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre in a situation of food insecurity at this point, but it‚Äôs really just a reminder that warmer temperatures can bring some more challenges to produce many of the agricultural commodities we traditionally see,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a recognition that the groundwater reserves won‚Äôt always be there to help us weather future droughts, if we don‚Äôt use those more sustainably.‚Äù\n\nWeather whiplash\n\nIn far western Minnesota, a few miles from the South Dakota border, Anne Schwagerl and her family run a 400-acre organic farm.\n\nLast year, Schwagerl and other farmers across the North Star State endured the worst drought seen in decades. Some of the yields were halved on her family‚Äôs farm, where they grow crops such as corn, soy beans, oats and rye.\n\nThis year brought the rain. By mid-June, about 75% of the state saw above-average levels of precipitation, according to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.\n\n‚ÄúWe had a really challenging fall harvest and then a wet winter, which was great,‚Äù Schwagerl said. ‚ÄúWe needed that rain, but then it kept coming, and we had a very wet late spring. So it was this whiplash feeling of knowing that this could change [at] the drop of a hat.‚Äù\n\nA soaked field of newly planted corn at Anne Schwagerl's Prairie Point Farm in western Minnesota after a heavy storm in the spring of 2022 dropped 3.5 inches of rain. The heavy rain came months after Schwagerl and other Minnesota farmers endured the worst drought in decades and exemplifies the \"whiplash\" nature of extreme weather, she said. Anne Schwagerl\n\nAnd in the past couple of years, the intensity of those weather events has only increased and relatively infrequent weather phenomena like derechos ‚Äî long-lasting and high-powered wind storms that can crush grain bins like they were soda cans ‚Äî have joined the vernacular, she said.\n\n‚Äú2019 was a historically wet year. All throughout the year, we couldn‚Äôt miss a rain for love or money,‚Äù she said. ‚Äú2020 was Covid, our first Covid year, where everything was locked down. And then 2021, we went through a once-in-a-generation drought.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt feels like you can‚Äôt use those words like ‚Äòonce-in-a-generation‚Äô anymore because they keep happening. Does that still have meaning?‚Äù she added.\n\nSchwagerl is feeling uneasy about what 2023 might bring in terms of input costs, commodity prices and weather.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre riding along on this endless roller coaster at the same time as everyone else,‚Äù she said.\n\nCompounding factors\n\nAriel Ortiz-Bobea, an applied economist at Cornell University working on agricultural and resources economics, is optimistic about the private and public sector investing in research and development and other mechanisms to improve productivity and conserve resources. He expressed concern about lesser-developed countries and the effect of global events such as the war in Ukraine.\n\n‚ÄúIf things get more politically hairy, those [drought] events become more painful,‚Äù he said.\n\nExtreme weather also can negatively affect companies‚Äô bottom lines, according to research from Paul Griffin, professor of management at UC Davis.\n\nGriffin‚Äôs research of heat effect found that every degree over 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius) translates into an annualized loss of sales of 0.63% and a profit margin decrease of 0.16%. Stock prices dropped by an average of 22 basis points in response to a heat spell, Griffin found.\n\nCorn crops that died due to extreme heat and drought during a heatwave in Austin, Texas, on Monday, July 11, 2022. Jordan Vonderhaar/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n‚ÄúThe implication there is that if sales are decreasing, then firms will have an incentive to raise prices,‚Äù he said.\n\nThe exact extent to which extreme heat, drought and, more broadly, climate change will play a role in prices and inflation is extremely difficult to estimate, Smith said.\n\nThere are far more costs baked in to the price of a product than what consumers pay at the grocery store ‚Äî including wages, materials, production, processing, transportation, distribution, retailing, and marketing, he said. Farmers and ranches receive an estimated 8 cents from every dollar spent on food at home and away from home, according to the Farm Bureau.\n\n‚ÄúAll those costs are much bigger pieces of the food pie than the actual value of the food that‚Äôs produced by the farmer,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo when we‚Äôre looking at food prices and worrying about things that might increase food prices, we probably should be paying more attention to those costs of processing and transportation and marketing rather than what‚Äôs happening on the farm.‚Äù\n\nRussia‚Äôs war in Ukraine helped fuel a sharp rise in oil prices, which filtered down through key inputs such as fuel and fertilizer; and it complicated already tangled supply chains, further raising costs for all the businesses that help bring farm products to the table.\n\nStill, the very prospect of more extreme weather could further sap away groundwater and limit the cultivation potential in the future, Smith said.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably going to mean, as we look forward, fewer acres of the different fruits and vegetables that are grown in California and that people around the country eat,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo that, inevitably, in the long run will raise prices ‚Äî maybe not this year, but they will go up.‚Äù", "authors": ["Alicia Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/14/weather/food-risk-bee-butterfly-pollinator-decline-climate-scn/index.html", "title": "One-third of the food we eat is at risk because the climate crisis is ...", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nBee populations are declining. More than half of the bat species in the United States are in severe decline or listed as endangered. And international scientists recently announced the monarch butterfly is perilously close to extinction.\n\nWhat these three creatures have in common is that they are all pollinators. Without them, fruits, vegetables and other plants wouldn‚Äôt be pollinated, and that‚Äôs a major problem for our food supply.\n\n‚ÄúOne out of every three bites of food that we eat‚Äù is directly connected to a pollinator, Ron Magill, the communications director and a wildlife expert at Zoo Miami, told CNN. Around 30% of the food that ends up on our tables gets there because of things like butterflies, bees and bats.\n\nLosing those critical populations could also mean losing some of our favorite foods.\n\nApples, melons, cranberries, pumpkins, squash, broccoli and almonds are among the foods most susceptible to the pollinator decline, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Bees, in particular, are responsible for pollinating around 90 commercially produced crops, the agency reports. Even tequila is at risk.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all so intricately connected, whether you‚Äôre eating the food that is directly pollinated or you‚Äôre eating something that depends on that pollinator,‚Äù Magill said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a domino effect.‚Äù\n\nIn other words, if you are eating fried chicken or pork chops, those chickens and pigs eat fruit, vegetables and other plants that depend on pollinators.\n\nA monarch butterfly. courtesy Ron Magill\n\nAnd the climate crisis has taken a toll on pollinators. While more intense and prolonged drought is the most obvious impact, a growing concern is the effect of extreme heat ‚Äì particularly on butterflies.\n\n‚ÄúBecause butterflies are some of the most sensitive insects to changes in temperature, they are considered the ‚Äòcanary in the coal mine‚Äô when it comes to climate change,‚Äù Magill said.\n\nWarmer temperatures cause plants to bloom sooner, which is out of sync with when the butterflies lay their eggs and metamorphose. This will mean the flowers they depend on for food will have already bloomed out, leaving little for the butterflies to feed on, which will in turn greatly impact their ability to reproduce and survive.\n\nIt snowballs into a cyclical problem where the butterflies can‚Äôt get the food they need to reproduce, nor can the plants get pollinated ‚Äì causing both to suffer greatly.\n\nBees tending a honeycomb. courtesy Ron Magill\n\nAlso, for butterflies like monarchs that are known for long migrations from the Northern US to Mexico ‚Äì food along their route may no longer be available at the time that the natural migration takes place.\n\nA UN report in 2019 found that a million species are at risk of extinction in the coming decades, as the climate crisis accelerates. Magill says we‚Äôre starting to see that play out in insect populations.\n\n‚ÄúOne million species in the next 50 years,‚Äù Magill said. ‚ÄúThat is catastrophic.‚Äù\n\nHuman impact on natural pollinators\n\nScientists at the the International Union for Conservation of Nature last month added the monarch butterfly ‚Äì one of the world‚Äôs most popular and recognizable insects ‚Äì to its red list of endangered species, noting that the destruction of its habitat and rising temperatures fueled by the climate crisis are increasingly threatening the species.\n\n‚ÄúClimate change has significantly impacted the migratory monarch butterfly and is a fast-growing threat; drought limits the growth of milkweed and increases the frequency of catastrophic wildfires, temperature extremes trigger earlier migrations before milkweed is available, while severe weather has killed millions of butterflies,‚Äù scientists reported.\n\nA monarch butterfly. courtesy Ron Magill\n\nHoneybees began to show an alarming decline in 2006. From April 2020 to April 2021, beekeepers in the US lost around 45% of their colonies, according to Auburn University‚Äôs College of Agriculture, which reports that the average acceptable turnover is around 20%.\n\nClimate change may be amplifying a deadly parasite in honeybee populations. Research has showed that those bee-killing parasites become more prevalent in warmer climates which means as temperatures continue to rise the parasites could flourish and become catastrophic for bees.\n\nSeveral countries and even some states in the US are already moving to help protect these crucial species. California is pushing to restrict bee-killing pesticides.\n\nMagill noted that while these declines are happening gradually, they will eventually be too great for ecosystems to overcome ‚Äì like a tipping point beyond which some species will be lost forever.\n\n‚ÄúYou know, what is the straw that is going to break the camel‚Äôs back when it comes to the balance of the environment?‚Äù Magill said.\n\nTequila at risk\n\nBats also play an irreplaceable role in food security. The USDA points to recent studies which estimate that bats eat enough pests to save more than $1 billion per year in crop damage and pesticide costs in the United States, mostly from the corn industry alone.\n\n‚ÄúAcross all agricultural production, consumption of insect pests by bats results in a savings of more than $3 billion per year,‚Äù according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nBats are also vital pollinators.\n\n‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt have tequila if you had no bats, because that‚Äôs the only thing that pollinates the agave plant that makes tequila,‚Äù Magill said.\n\nBats pollinate the agave plant, a base ingredient for tequila. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nFruit bats. courtesy Ron Magill\n\nBats are affected by the climate crisis in the same way butterflies and bees are.\n\n‚ÄúBats are also more susceptible to heat stress,‚Äù Magill said. ‚ÄúThere have been major die-offs of bats as a result of rising temperatures that led to death from heat stroke as bats have limited cooling mechanisms.‚Äù\n\nUnlike butterflies and bees, though, bats aren‚Äôt just a vital pollinator ‚Äì they are considered a major seed disperser and critical for our ecosystems, much like birds.\n\n‚ÄúThe seeds from the fruits that they eat germinate after going through their digestive system and then are deposited throughout their range to ‚Äòplant‚Äô future trees,‚Äù Magill said.\n\nHow you can help\n\nThis is a global problem which means fixes need to be on a global scale, but there are still ways individual people can help.\n\n‚ÄúPlant gardens with native wildlife, the native plants that are critical to the survival of these animals,‚Äù Magill said.\n\nPlants that are native will also require less care. If you plant a cactus in Louisiana, it‚Äôs not going to do well in the humid environment. Likewise, impatiens or begonias will not do well in the desert Southwest as they require a tremendous amount of water to flourish.\n\nAn atala butterfly. courtesy Ron Magill\n\nA new online database helps users in the UK find pollinator friendly plants for their gardens, and support biodiversity. Similar lists of native, pro-pollinator plants exist for the United States.\n\n‚ÄúWhen you plant native wildflowers, you‚Äôre planting a buffet for the wildlife that needs that to survive,‚Äù Magill says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the refueling stations for our pollinators.‚Äù\n\nMagill points to Lady Bird Johnson‚Äôs effort to beautify roadsides in the US. While her goal was nationwide, her efforts shone in Texas.\n\n‚ÄúShe did such a wonderful thing with wildflowers in Texas,‚Äù Magill says. ‚ÄúThere are times you can drive through Texas, and you can see wildflowers for as far as the eyes can see, and it‚Äôs such a beautiful sight, because she understood the value of that.‚Äù\n\nWhile other states are doing that along roadways as well, individual homeowners can also do the same.\n\n‚ÄúWe have beautiful plant life in our native areas where we live in this country. If we could focus more on that and start rebuilding what was naturally here, we can start bringing back those natural rhythms.‚Äù\n\nYou can also work to reduce your pesticide and chemical use around your home. Good alternatives include using organic products such as compost for soil health and adding beneficial insects like ladybugs, praying mantises, or even nematodes to keep pests away.", "authors": ["Allison Chinchar Jennifer Gray", "Allison Chinchar", "Jennifer Gray"], "publish_date": "2022/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/26/china/china-sichuan-power-crunch-climate-change-mic-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China's worst heat wave on record is crippling power supplies.

It has stretched over 70 days, sweeping through large swathes of the country and smashing temperature records at hundreds of weather stations.\n\nThe sheer size of China‚Äôs economy and population means any major disruption to its power supply can cause massive loss and suffering.\n\n‚ÄúThese so-called extreme weather events will have more impact on our lives and electricity supply,‚Äù said Li Shuo, climate adviser with Greenpeace in Beijing. ‚ÄúAnd perhaps we all need to reconsider whether these extreme events will become the new normal.‚Äù\n\nExperts say the Sichuan power crunch is an example that China‚Äôs energy system is far less robust than it needs to be to face the growing challenges from climate change.\n\nSome believe the industry is heading in the right direction toward reform, while others worry it will turn to building more coal-fired power plants to secure energy supply ‚Äì and risk undermining China‚Äôs pledges to reach peak carbon by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.\n\nHow did the power crunch happen?\n\nLocated along the upper reaches of the Yangtze, China‚Äôs longest and largest river, Sichuan is famous for its rich water resources and relies mostly on hydropower.\n\nAmid scorching temperatures and a prolonged drought, reservoirs across Sichuan are drying up ‚Äì crippling the hydropower stations that account for nearly 80% of the province‚Äôs power generation capacity.\n\nThis month, Sichuan has seen its hydroelectricity capacity plunge by 50%, according to the state grid. Meanwhile, the unrelenting heat wave has pushed power demand to unprecedented highs, as residents and businesses blast their air conditioning to stay cool.\n\nAn ariel view of the Baihetan hydropower station that straddles the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan in southwest China. Cao Mengyao/Xinhua/Getty Images/FILE\n\n‚ÄúChina‚Äôs electricity demand has been incredibly flat in the past, because so much of it has come from the industry, not from households or services. Now with air conditioning becoming more common, the demand is becoming higher,‚Äù said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Helsinki, Finland (CREA).\n\n‚ÄúAt the same time, rains are becoming more errant. Heavy rains and periods of drought make hydropower much less reliable as a source of available capacity during those peaks.‚Äù\n\nTo make matters worse, Sichuan is traditionally a huge exporter of power during the rainy season, sending about a third of its hydropower generation to provinces in eastern China, according to David Fishman, an analyst on Chinese energy at consultancy The Lantau Group.\n\nDespite its crippled power generation capacity, Sichuan must still honor its export contracts with other provinces, which Fishman said could ‚Äúbe really hard to get out of.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut even if they could, the generating facilities in Sichuan were built to export power to the east coast,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt really have great connectivity to the rest of the Sichuan grid. They were never intended to serve Sichuan power consumption needs.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòQuenching a thirst with poison‚Äô\n\nTo ease the energy crunch, Sichuan is firing up its coal power plants, raising concerns among environmentalists about the potential increase in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSichuan Guang‚Äôan Power Generation, the region‚Äôs biggest coal-fired power plant, has been operating at full capacity for 21 consecutive days. Its electricity generation for August is expected to jump 313% from a year earlier, the company said.\n\nThe province is also mining more coal. Sichuan Coal Industry Group, its largest coal miner, has more than doubled its thermal coal production since mid-August. And last week, Sichuan opened its first national coal reserve.\n\nNationwide, the daily consumption of coal at power plants was up 15% in the first two weeks of August compared with the same period last year, according to the National Development and Reform Commission.\n\nLast week, Chinese vice-premier Han Zheng said the government would step up support for coal plants to ensure stable power supply.\n\nWhile the jump in coal consumption is likely a temporary fix, Li, the Greenpeace adviser, feared the hydropower crisis could be used by coal interest groups to lobby for more coal plants.\n\n‚ÄúThere is a possibility that power shortages caused by future extreme weather events might become a new motivation for China to approve more (coal-fired power) projects,‚Äù he said.\n\nLast year, after a coal shortage caused a series of power outages across China, the government began to signal a renewed focus on ‚Äúenergy security.‚Äù By the last quarter of the year, new-approved coal capacity surged back, especially in state-owned enterprises, Greenpeace said in a report published last month.\n\nIn the first quarter of this year, provincial governments approved plans to add a total of 8.63 gigawatts of new coal power plants, nearly half the amount seen in all of 2021, according to the report.\n\n‚ÄúEnergy security has become a sort of code word for coal, rather than for reliable supply of energy,‚Äù the report said.\n\nYu Aiqun, China researcher at Global Energy Monitor, likened turning to coal ‚Äì the largest cause of global warming ‚Äì for energy security to ‚Äúquenching a thirst with poison.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúChina has an obsession with coal power ‚Äì there is a very strong sense of dependence. Whenever an energy problem occurs, it always tries to seek answer from coal power ‚Ä¶This is running in the opposite direction from its climate goals,‚Äù she said.\n\n‚ÄòBig challenge‚Äô\n\nChina‚Äôs response to its energy crisis will have an impact on the rest of the world. The country of 1.4 billion people is the world‚Äôs largest emitter of carbon dioxide, accounting for 27% of global emissions.\n\nBut some analysts say boosting coal capacity is only part of China‚Äôs answer to the much-needed energy reform.\n\nFollowing the power shortages last year, the Chinese government has taken important measures to increase the flexibility of pricing and the profitability of clean energy, said Myllyvirta with CREA.\n\n‚ÄúThe big challenge in China‚Äôs system is the grid is being operated in a very rigid way,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDifferent provinces aren‚Äôt sharing their capacity and using their capacity in an optimal way to to balance the loads within the region.‚Äù\n\nTherefore, the need to build more thermal power plants can be significantly reduced if China‚Äôs electricity grid can be managed more efficiently and flexibly, Myllyvirta said.\n\nApart form new coal power, China is also stepping up construction of renewable energy ‚Äì its installed solar and wind energy capacity now accounts for 35-40% of the global total.\n\nFishman, the energy consultant, said the new coal power plants are not necessarily going to be used; instead, they were built as backup for the fast expanding renewable energy sector ‚Äì in case it runs into problems, like the ongoing drought in Sichuan.\n\n‚ÄúCapacity doesn‚Äôt equal generation. The capacity being there creates a lot of optionality and flexibility for all these other (renewable energy sources) they‚Äôre building.‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFor now, I see the coal capacity additions, as for the most part, targeted at being able to support wind and solar.‚Äù\n\nFishman said China‚Äôs power system planners are aware of the challenges they face, and that the industry overall is moving ‚Äúin the right direction.‚Äù\n\nThe record heat wave and the power crunch in Sichuan highlight the need to reform the grid system, he said. ‚ÄúBecause without them, this would be an event that could happen every five or 10 years, and it would be crippling every five or 10 years ‚Äì or maybe even more frequently,‚Äù he said.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/18/business/heatwave-global-economy/index.html", "title": "Extreme heat is slamming the world's three biggest economies all at ...", "text": "London CNN Business ‚Äî\n\nEstimating just how catastrophic climate change will be for the global economy has historically proven challenging.

Boris Roessler/dpa/AP\n\nExtreme weather and an economic slowdown\n\nIt‚Äôs not just the Rhine. Around the world, rivers that support global growth ‚Äî the Yangtze, the Danube and the Colorado ‚Äî are drying up, impeding the movement of goods, messing with irrigation systems and making it harder for power plants and factories to stay cool.\n\nAt the same time, scorching heat is hampering transportation networks, straining power supply and hurting worker productivity.\n\n‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt be surprised by the heat wave events,‚Äù said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the London School of Economics‚Äô Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre exactly what we predicted and are part of a trend: more frequent, more intense, all over the world.‚Äù\n\nChina is facing its fiercest heat wave in six decades, with temperatures crossing 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in dozens of cities. Parts of California could see temperatures as high as 109 degrees Fahrenheit this week. Earlier this summer, temperatures topped 40 degrees Celsius in the United Kingdom for the first time ever.\n\nDry grass is seen in Greenwich Park, England.

Europe is at high risk of a recession as energy prices soar, stoked by Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. High inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve jeopardize growth in the United States. China is grappling with the consequences of harsh coronavirus lockdowns and a real estate crisis.\n\n‚ÄúAt present, we are at the most difficult point of economic stabilization,‚Äù Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said this week.\n\nSomething else to worry about\n\nExtreme weather could exacerbate ‚Äúexisting pinch points‚Äù along supply chains, a major reason inflation has been difficult to bring down, May of Oxford Economics said.\n\nChina‚Äôs Sichuan province, where factories have shuttered production this week, is a hub for makers of semiconductors and solar panels. The power rationing will hit factories belonging to some of the world‚Äôs biggest electronics companies, including Apple (AAPL) supplier Foxconn and Intel (INTC).\n\nThe province is also the epicenter of China‚Äôs lithium mining industry. The shutdown may push up the cost of the raw material, which is a key component in electric car batteries.\n\nThe neighboring city of Chongqing, which sits at the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing rivers, has also ordered factories to suspend operations for a week through next Wednesday to conserve electricity, state media The Paper reported.\n\nThe Yangtze riverbed is exposed due to drought on Aug. 17 in Chongqing, China.

Analysts at Nomura cut their 2022 projection for GDP growth to 2.8% on Thursday ‚Äî way below the government‚Äôs 5.5% target ‚Äî while Goldman Sachs trimmed its forecast to 3%.\n\nGermany‚Äôs shrinking Rhine, meanwhile, has dropped below a critical level, impeding the flow of vessels. The river is a crucial conduit for chemicals and grain as well as commodities ‚Äî including coal, which is in higher demand as the country races to fill storage facilities with natural gas ahead of the winter. Finding alternative forms of transit is difficult given labor shortages.\n\n‚ÄúIt is only a matter of time before plants in the chemical or steel industry are shut down, mineral oils and building materials fail to reach their destination, or large-volume and heavy transports can no longer be carried out,‚Äù Holger L√∂sch, deputy director of the Federation of German Industries, said in a statement this week.\n\nLow water levels along the Rhine shaved about 0.3 percentage points off Germany‚Äôs economic output in 2018, according to Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING. But in that instance, low water wasn‚Äôt a problem until late September. This time around, it could lower GDP by at least 0.5 percentage points in the second half of this year, he estimated.\n\nEconomic sentiment in Germany continued to dip in August, according to data released this week. Brzeski said the country ‚Äúwould need an economic miracle‚Äù to avoid falling into a recession in the coming months.\n\nA bathtub ring watermark at Hoover Dam/Lake Mead, the country's largest man-made water reservoir, formed by the dam on the Colorado River.

It‚Äôs also forcing farmers to destroy crops.\n\nNearly three quarters of US farmers say this year‚Äôs drought is hurting their harvest ‚Äî with significant crop and income loss, according to a survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation, an insurance company and lobbying group that represents agricultural interests.\n\nThe survey was conducted across 15 states from June 8 to July 20 in extreme drought regions from Texas to North Dakota to California, which makes up nearly half of the country‚Äôs agricultural production value. In California ‚Äî a state with high fruit and nut tree crops ‚Äî 50% of farmers said they had to remove trees and multiyear crops due to drought, which will affect future revenue.\n\nWithout significant investment in upgrading infrastructure, costs will only keep rising, Ward of the London School of Economics noted. And the impact may not be incremental.\n\n‚ÄúThere are signs these heat episodes are not just becoming slightly more intense and frequent over time.

But amid a prolonged megadrought that has depleted water resources across the Southwest, the need to save every drop has intensified in Southern Nevada.\n\nLas Vegas knows the stakes are high, and it isn‚Äôt gambling on Mother Nature to solve its water problems.\n\nInstead, the city is betting on extreme water-saving measures to keep the taps flowing. Here‚Äôs how it intends to win.\n\nBet 1: Banning mega-pools\n\nA home with a swimming pool abuts the desert on the edge of the Las Vegas Valley. John Locher/AP\n\nLas Vegans are no longer allowed to build giant swimming pools or spas at single-family homes.\n\nThe Southern Nevada Water Authority says there‚Äôs been a proliferation of giant pools ‚Äì some larger than 3,000 square feet ‚Äì in recent years. The new building code limits new pools to no more than 600 square feet ‚Äì a move the Las Vegas Valley Water District says will save more than 32 million gallons of water over the next decade. The average pool size in southern Nevada is 470 square feet.\n\nThe idea was to prevent people from building pools that were more like ‚Äúwater features‚Äù at some homes, rather than recreational swimming pools, said Bronson Mack, public outreach officer for the Water Authority, which manages water resources for 2.2 million people including Las Vegas.\n\n‚ÄúA lot of these more affluent homes, they‚Äôre not even occupied year-round,‚Äù Mack told CNN. ‚ÄúAnd yet they have all of this water in their backyard.‚Äù\n\nBet 2: Reclaiming all indoor water for reuse\n\nThe \"bathtub rings\" are seen around Lake Mead, a sign of how far the water level has dropped. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nMost of the Water Authority‚Äôs conservation efforts focus on outdoor water. But indoor water can be recycled.\n\n‚ÄúWater that we used indoors all gets reclaimed,‚Äù Mack said. ‚ÄúWe treat that water to clean water standards, then return it to Lake Mead, our primary water source. Every gallon that we return to Lake Mead allows us to take another gallon out of the lake without counting against our limited water allocation.‚Äù\n\nAccording to the Water Authority, only 10% of its water comes from local groundwater. The other 90% comes from the Colorado River‚Äôs Lake Mead, the largest man-made reservoir in the country, which continues to fall to record lows. In April, the Water Authority had to decommission one of the original intake valves in the lake because the water level had fallen so low.\n\nAnd in August, the federal government enacted a Tier 2 shortage, which will limit the amount of water southern Nevada can pull from Lake Mead beginning in January by about 8.1 billion gallons a year.\n\nYet, on the Las Vegas Strip, glasses of water may still be served to restaurant customers since all that water will be recycled.\n\n‚ÄúEven if you don‚Äôt drink that glass of water ‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre going to dump that down the drain, and all of that water gets reclaimed,‚Äù Mack said, noting this practice began in the 1950s. ‚ÄúThat dish is going to go through the dishwasher ‚Äì all of the dishwasher water gets reclaimed and recycled back to Lake Mead.‚Äù\n\nBet 3: Keeping the Vegas Strip water-savvy\n\nThe Bellagio fountain is an iconic feature of Las Vegas. It can lose up to 48 gallons of water per square foot per year due to evaporation alone. L.E. Baskow/AP\n\nAs for the Strip, the economic engine of southern Nevada, Mack said the region‚Äôs resort, casino and hotel sector is not as water-wasteful as it seems, despite its reputation for excess.\n\nMack said it only uses 5% of the community‚Äôs total water supply, while also making up its largest employment base, supporting some 40 million visitors a year.\n\nThere are also limitations on swimming pool size for the resorts based on the number of hotel rooms and guests they serve.\n\n‚ÄúWe could turn on every shower and every sink in every hotel room on the Las Vegas Strip, and it wouldn‚Äôt increase the amount of water we deplete from the Colorado River because all of that gets cycled back through our wastewater system, gets treated and returned to Lake Mead,‚Äù Mack explained.\n\nAs for the Las Vegas strip‚Äôs iconic fountains? They lose a lot of water to evaporation. According to the Water Authority, the fountain at the Bellagio is fed from a privately owned groundwater well and doesn‚Äôt use water from the Colorado River. But it estimates those outdoor water features can lose 48 gallons of water per square foot a year to evaporation ‚Äì in a place where every drop counts.\n\nThe canals in the Venetian Resort recirculate their water, which does come from Colorado River. However, since the water is used indoors it can be reclaimed, Mack said.\n\nAs the climate crisis intensifies and water resources decline, the Las Vegas Valley Water District is considering a ban on all new ornamental water features at resort hotels, unless the feature is completely indoors and supplied by a privately owned water source.\n\nBet 4: Tearing out ‚Äònonfunctional‚Äô grass\n\nLas Vegas has removed more than 200 million square feet of grass, incuding in residential front yards. Roger Kisby/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nGrass has been a major focus for conservation efforts in Las Vegas ‚Äì especially grass that tends to be ‚Äúnonfunctional,‚Äù or is merely ornamental, on medians, in front of commercial buildings and even in front yards.\n\nSince April, the Las Vegas Valley Water District has banned grass and spray-irrigation systems at all new properties. Schools, parks and cemeteries are exempt. Single-family homes built after 2003 are prohibited from having grass in front yards and limited on how much they can have in side and back yards.\n\n‚ÄúWe have removed more than 200 million square feet of grass from this valley, but there‚Äôs still about that much grass that remains,‚Äù Mack said.\n\nWhile getting rid of grass has been more widely embraced by homeowners, businesses have been slower to adapt. However, in 2021 the Nevada legislature passed a law that bans irrigating nonfunctional grass with water from the Colorado River.\n\nSNWA estimates the grass law will ultimately save 10% of its total water supply.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs more water than is consumed by the entire Las Vegas Strip,‚Äù Mack said, explaining that it takes 73 gallons of water per square foot every year to keep grass alive in the Mojave Desert. But drip-irrigated and drought-tolerant landscaping only requires 18 gallons per square foot a year.\n\nWatering grass ‚Äúis the least efficient way‚Äù we can use water, Mack said.\n\nBet 5: Strict irrigation schedules year-round\n\nThe Water Authority also has a rotating watering schedule based on the time of the year.\n\nAs of September 1, outdoor watering is limited to three assigned days a week for the fall. On November 1, the winter schedule drops to one day a week before going back to three days for the spring, beginning March 1.\n\nIn the summer months, watering is permitted six days a week starting May 1, but never during the hottest time of day ‚Äì between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. ‚Äì when the water is prone to evaporation in the desert heat.\n\nWatering is always scheduled by neighborhood and is never permitted on Sunday.\n\nBet 6: Identifying water wasters\n\nSince everyone in a community is on the same watering schedule, it makes it easy to identify the people and businesses flouting the rules.\n\nThe Water Authority has water waste investigators who will contact property owners, highlight the waste and give them a chance to fix the issue. If the problem isn‚Äôt addressed, the owners will be fined, starting at $80 and then doubling for every subsequent violation.\n\nMack said there‚Äôs still water waste happening daily, but the water authority has enforced these rules for about a decade.\n\n‚ÄúWe had to be early adopters of that kind of activity,‚Äù Mack said.\n\nBet 7: Taking advantage of Mother Nature\n\nPeople navigate the rainy walkways at the Fremont Street Experience in Las Vegas during a storm in late July. L.E. Baskow/AP\n\nWhen Mother Nature makes it rain, Las Vegas goes all in.\n\nThis summer, Las Vegas was hit with a couple of monsoonal rain storms that helped ease some of the region‚Äôs drought, but also left incredible damage in their wake. It only took a couple inches of rain for water to pour into casinos on the Strip.\n\nMuch of that storm water gets funneled into the Las Vegas Wash which flows out to Lake Mead. But even though it was a lot of water all at once, Lake Mead is huge, and it may only increase the lake level by fractions of an inch, Mack said.\n\nWhat‚Äôs most important when it does rain in the Las Vegas Valley, Mack explained, is getting customers to shut their irrigation off.\n\nDuring one week of extreme rain in August, the community turned off its irrigation systems and some of its air conditioning systems, which also use water.\n\n‚ÄúThat collectively saved about 250 million gallons of water,‚Äù Mack said. ‚ÄúSaving water is desert living and we are in the middle of the Mojave Desert. Our community has been a city in the desert and now we are finally becoming a desert city.‚Äù", "authors": ["Stephanie Elam"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/world/top-climate-weather-stories-2022/index.html", "title": "Devastating disasters and flickers of hope: These are the top climate ...", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nFrom a small island in Polynesia to the white-sand beaches of Florida, the planet experienced a dizzying number of climate and extreme weather disasters in 2022.\n\nBlistering summer heat broke records in drought-stricken China, threatening lives and food production.

Simon Proud/Uni Oxford, RALSpace NCEO/Japan Meteorological Agency\n\nWhen the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‚Äôapai volcano erupted in January, it sent tsunami waves around the world. The blast itself was so loud it was heard in Alaska ‚Äì roughly 6,000 miles away. The afternoon sky turned pitch black as heavy ash clouded Tonga‚Äôs capital and caused ‚Äúsignificant damage‚Äù along the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu.\n\nThe underwater volcanic eruption also injected a huge cloud of ash and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, more than 30 kilometers (around 19 miles) above sea level, according to data from NASA satellites.\n\nAt the time, experts said the event was likely not large enough to impact global climate.\n\nBut months later, scientists found that the eruption actually belched an enormous amount of water vapor into the Earth‚Äôs stratosphere ‚Äì enough to fill more than 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. The massive plume of water vapor will likely contribute to more global warming at ground-level for the next several years, NASA scientists reported.\n\n9. Rivers hit record lows\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Severe drought reveals incredible discovery at bottom of Mississippi river 00:45 - Source: CNN\n\nSearing temperatures, lack of rainfall and low snowpack pushed some of the world‚Äôs most vital rivers to new lows this year.\n\nNorthern Italy saw its worst drought in more than 70 years. The 400-mile River Po hit a record low due to an unusually dry winter and limited snowpack in the Alps, which feeds the river. The drought impacted millions of people who rely on the Po for their livelihood, and roughly 30% of the country‚Äôs food, which is produced along the river.\n\nAlso fed by winter snowpack in the Alps along with spring rains, Germany‚Äôs Rhine River dropped to ‚Äúexceptionally low‚Äù levels in some areas, disrupting shipping in the country‚Äôs most important inland water way. Months of little rainfall meant cargo ships began carrying lighter loads and transport costs soared.\n\nMeanwhile in the US, extreme drought spread into the central states and gauges along the Mississippi River and its tributaries plummeted. Barge traffic moved in fits and starts as officials dredged the river. The Mississippi River dropped so low that the Army Corps of Engineers was forced to build a 1,500-foot-wide levee to prevent Gulf-of-Mexico saltwater from pushing upstream.\n\n8.

Joe Manchin was influential in delaying the bill‚Äôs passage. Multiple White House and Biden administration officials for months had tried to convince the senator to support the bill over dinners in Paris and ziplining in West Virginia.\n\nAn analysis suggests the measures in the bill will reduce US carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030 and would put Biden well on his way to achieving his goal of slashing emissions in half by 2030.\n\n7.

A 1,000-year rainfall event is one that is so intense it‚Äôs only seen on average once every 1,000 years ‚Äì under normal circumstances. But extreme rainfall is becoming more common as the climate crisis pushes temperatures higher. Warmer air can hold more moisture, which loads the dice in favor of historic rainfall.\n\nDeadly flooding swept through Eastern Kentucky and around St. Louis in July after damaging, record-breaking rainfall in a short period of time.\n\nCalifornia‚Äôs Death Valley, after a yearslong dry spell, saw its rainiest day in recorded history.\n\nMeanwhile, down south, parts of Dallas, Texas, got an entire summer‚Äôs worth of rain in just 24 hours in August, prompting more than 350 high-water rescues.\n\n4. Europe‚Äôs deadly heat wave\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Wildfires threaten London during record-breaking heat wave 01:20 - Source: CNN\n\nEurope experienced its hottest summer on record in 2022 by a wide margin. While the heat kicked off early in France, Portugal and Spain, with the countries reaching record-warmth in May, the most significant heat came in mid-July, spreading across the UK and central Europe.\n\nThe UK, in particular, topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for the first time on record. Stephen Belcher, the UK Met Office‚Äôs chief scientist, said this would have been ‚Äúvirtually impossible‚Äù in an ‚Äúundisrupted climate.‚Äù\n\nThroughout western Europe, the heatwaves gravely increased wildfire risk, with one London fire official noting that the 40-degree day led to an ‚Äúunprecedented day in the history of the London Fire Brigade.‚Äù\n\n3. The West‚Äôs water crisis\n\nVideo Ad Feedback As water levels drop at this major lake, bodies begin to appear 03:19 - Source: CNN\n\nThe past few years have been a reality check for western states that heavily rely on the Colorado River for water and electricity. Plagued by decades of overuse and a climate change-fueled drought, the river that serves 40 million people in seven western states and Mexico is draining at an alarming rate.\n\nThe water levels in its two main reservoirs ‚Äì Lake Mead and Lake Powell ‚Äì have plunged rapidly, threatening drinking water supply and power generation. In late July, Lake Mead ‚Äì the country‚Äôs largest reservoir ‚Äì bottomed out and has only rebounded a few feet off record lows. Its rapidly plunging levels revealed human remains from the 1970s and a sunken vessel from World War II.\n\nThe federal government implemented its first-ever mandatory water cuts this year for states that draw from the Colorado River, and those cuts will be even deeper starting in January 2023.\n\n2.

Asif Hassan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFloods caused by record monsoon rain and melting glaciers in Pakistan‚Äôs northern mountain regions claimed the lives of more than 1,400 people this summer, with millions more affected by clean water and food shortages. More than a third of Pakistan was underwater, satellite images showed, and authorities warned it would take months for the flood waters to recede in the country‚Äôs hardest-hit areas.\n\nUN Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres said the Pakistani people are facing ‚Äúa monsoon on steroids,‚Äù referring to the role that the climate crisis had in supercharging the extreme rainfall. The hard-hit provinces Sindh and Balochistan saw rainfall more than 500% of average during the monsoon season.\n\nPakistan is responsible for less than 1% of the world‚Äôs planet-warming emissions, yet it is the eighth most vulnerable nation to the climate crisis, according to the Global Climate Risk Index.\n\n1. Hurricane Ian\n\nDestruction in the wake of Hurricane Ian on October 4 in Fort Myers Beach, Florida. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nHurricane Ian was a Category 4 storm when it made landfall in southwest Florida in late September and left a trail of destruction from the Caribbean to the Carolinas. Insured losses from Ian are expected to reach up to $65 billion, according to recent data from reinsurance company Swiss Re.\n\nThe storm first struck Cuba before undergoing rapid intensification from a tropical storm to a category 3 hurricane in just 24 hours ‚Äì something scientists told CNN is part of a trend for the most dangerous storms. That same week, Super Typhoon Noru in the Philippines grew from the equivalent of a category 1 hurricane to a category 5 overnight as residents around Manila slept, catching officials and residents unaware and unable to prepare.\n\nHurricane Ian‚Äôs size and intensity allowed it to build up a storm surge higher than any ever observed in Southwest Florida, devastating Fort Myers and Cape Coral. Ian killed more than 100 people, most by drowning.

And it outlines some painful truths about global warming we must confront, but so far have not.\n\nThe COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, along with recent advances in US climate policy, may give the impression the world is doing something about an existential crisis, and we‚Äôre taking it seriously. The truth is, global emissions continue to rise, and will continue to do so for at least the next several years, even as scientists warn fossil fuel use must be slashed immediately.\n\nIn the meantime, the report‚Äôs authors write, ‚Äúthe things Americans value most are at risk.‚Äù\n\nThe National Climate Assessment, which is a congressionally-mandated report the federal government releases every four or five years, summarizes all the latest science and research on climate change in the United States.

To do it, the US needs to reach ‚Äúnet-zero‚Äù carbon emissions by about 2050, which will require a total clean energy transformation, and will likely require technology to suck our previous planet-warming emissions back out of the atmosphere.\n\nFor the United States to reach net-zero by 2050, the country‚Äôs emissions need to fall by a whopping 6% per year.

Almonds are the seventh-most valuable crop in the United States, and are all grown in California, which also supplies 80% of the world‚Äôs production. It also represents the largest pollination service market for honeybees.\n\nAfter almonds service, beekeepers bring their honeybees to different locations across the United States, pollinating more than 90 other crops and making honey.\n\nAlmond prices are already reflecting expectations of a smaller crop. In March, prices soared 33% from February, marking the largest monthly increase since November 2014, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.\n\nOn an annual basis, almond prices jumped nearly 58% in March to post the biggest increase since 1995, it said.\n\nSaving bees:'Fully vaccinated queens': First vaccine for honeybees approved in US\n\nNo need to milk the cow:Which plant-based milk is best?

The act was passed in 2014 to help protect groundwater resources over the long term.\n\nWith reservoirs full, farmers didn‚Äôt have to irrigate and won‚Äôt have to pay additional fees for water to the Sustainable Groundwater Management board, he said.\n\nThe biggest winners? Wineries. Everyone‚Äôs predicting a good wine crop, Rubin said.\n\nBecause the rain came early while the vines were dormant, or not yet primed for growth, vines weren‚Äôt damaged, and the soil got refreshed.

An El Ni√±o is a warming of sea surface temperature in the eastern Pacific Ocean that can affect global weather and increase the risk of natural disasters, such as floods in some areas and droughts in others.\n\nHow strong a possible El Ni√±o could be remains unclear, NOAA said.\n\n‚ÄúThe main implication could be higher food prices and stresses in emerging market countries vulnerable to such a shock,‚Äù said Deutsche Bank economist Jim Reid.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Mark Stichert, the groundfish and shellfish fisheries management coordinator with the state‚Äôs fish and game department, said that more crab were being fished out of the oceans than could be naturally replaced.\n\n‚ÄúSo there were more removals from the population than there were inputs,‚Äù Stichert explained at Thursday‚Äôs meeting.\n\nBetween the surveys conducted in 2021 and 2022, he said, mature male snow crabs declined about 40%, with an estimated 45 million pounds left in the entire Bering Sea.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a scary number, just to be clear,‚Äù Stichert said.\n\nBut calling the Bering Sea crab population ‚Äúoverfished‚Äù ‚Äì a technical definition that triggers conservation measures ‚Äì says nothing about the cause of its collapse.\n\n‚ÄúWe call it overfishing because of the size level,‚Äù Michael Litzow, the Kodiak lab director for NOAA Fisheries, told CNN. ‚ÄúBut it wasn‚Äôt overfishing that caused the collapse, that much is clear.‚Äù\n\nLitzow says human-caused climate change is a significant factor in the crabs‚Äô alarming disappearance.\n\nSnow crabs are cold-water species and found overwhelmingly in areas where water temperatures are below 2 degrees Celsius, Litzow says. As oceans warm and sea ice disappears, the ocean around Alaska is becoming inhospitable for the species.\n\n‚ÄúThere have been a number of attribution studies that have looked at specific temperatures in the Bering Sea or Bering Sea ice cover in 2018, and in those attribution studies, they‚Äôve concluded that those temperatures and low-ice conditions in the Bering sea are a consequence of global warming,‚Äù Litzow said.\n\nTemperatures around the Arctic have warmed four times faster than the rest of the planet, scientists have reported. Climate change has triggered a rapid loss in sea ice in the Arctic region, particularly in Alaska‚Äôs Bering Sea, which in turn has amplified global warming.\n\n‚ÄúClosing the fisheries due to low abundance and continuing research are the primary efforts to restore the populations at this point,‚Äù Ethan Nichols, an assistant area management biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, told CNN.\n\nStichert also said that there might be some ‚Äúoptimism for the future‚Äù as a few, small juvenile snow crabs are starting to appear in the system. But it could be at least three to four more years before they hit maturity and contribute to the regrowth of the population.\n\n‚ÄúIt is a glimmer of optimism,‚Äù Litzow said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs better than not seeing them, for sure. We get a little bit warmer every year and that variability is higher in Arctic ecosystems and high latitude ecosystems, and so if we can get a cooler period that would be good news for snow crab.‚Äù", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/10/16"}]}

Over the past few quarters, Burger King has been playing catch up, and now the company is hoping a major investment in restaurants and advertising will help spark growth and propel it ahead of its peers.\n\nIn the next two years, Burger King, which is owned by Restaurant Brands International (QSR), is planning to invest $400 million in improving the brand ‚Äî $250 million will go toward updating restaurant tech, kitchens and remodeling, and $150 million to advertising and digital products. Franchisees will also invest in improving the brand.\n\nOne key part of that plan? Reminding customers of what Burger King is all about: The Whopper.\n\n‚ÄúWhat we really want to do in the short term is reintroduce America‚Äôs love affair with the Whopper,‚Äù Tom Curtis, President of Burger King North America, told CNN Business. The plan is to make sure workers are well trained in making the best possible Whopper, and that kitchens support consistency and ease of preparation.\n\nConsider the Whopper Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThe fast food giant is also going to lean in to advertising its signature burger.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve talked about it enough. I just don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve celebrated it enough,‚Äù Curtis said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm looking forward to putting it back in its rightful place as our lead act.‚Äù Through advertising, Burger King wants to remind customers that the Whopper is flame-grilled and customizable. But some other tweaks could be in store as well, Curtis said.\n\nThe brand is ‚Äúevaluating whether or not there are changes to the Whopper that could make it a better product,‚Äù he said. But the team also doesn‚Äôt want to risk messing with its best known offering. ‚Äú[We‚Äôre] a little bit in the camp of if it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it,‚Äù Curtis said.\n\nWhat went wrong\n\nDuring the pandemic, restaurants had to quickly adjust their business models to contend with disrupted supply chains, closed dining rooms and a spike in demand for delivery. Burger King didn‚Äôt adapt very well.\n\n‚ÄúOver the last few years during the pandemic and coming out of the pandemic ‚Ä¶ [Burger King US] didn‚Äôt do a great job of adjusting our business to the environment, ‚Äù RBI CEO Jose Cil told CNN Business. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt simplify.‚Äù\n\nIn the pandemic, many restaurants quickly slimmed down menus in order to simplify kitchen operations when delivery orders suddenly went through the roof. Workers scrambling to fill online orders could at least avoid complicated preparations.\n\nBut Burger King did the opposite.\n\n‚ÄúWe, in fact, complicated things,‚Äù Cil said, ‚Äúwe added menu items ‚Ä¶ that were more difficult and not necessarily intuitive and typical for us to serve.‚Äù\n\nSpecifically Cil is talking about the Ch‚ÄôKing, a hand-breaded chicken sandwich that the chain introduced last year. The product ‚Äúcreated a ton of bottlenecks operationally,‚Äù Cil said.\n\nThe issues set Burger King back as competitors advanced. In the second quarter of this year, sales at Burger King US restaurants open at least 13 months grew by just .4%. Sales at McDonald‚Äôs (MCD) US restaurants open at least 13 months jumped 3.7% in that period.\n\nBurger King recently retired the Ch‚ÄôKing, replacing it with the Royal Crispy Chicken sandwich.\n\nThe Ch‚ÄôKing ‚Äúwas a great product that was difficult or challenging for teams to execute on,‚Äù Curtis said. ‚ÄúThe best thing for the guest is great flavor and consistency. So our Royal Crispy Chicken, which we just launched, offers both.‚Äù\n\nAs Burger King continues to work on other menu innovations, it will have to balance ease of execution with items that excite customers, Curtis added.\n\nRemodels and rewards upgrades\n\nThe chain is planning to remodel hundreds of restaurants. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images/File\n\nTo help boost sales and restaurant traffic, Burger King is making other improvements, including making restaurants look more modern.\n\nThe chain plans to remodel about 800 restaurants over the next two years.\n\nThe idea is to have consistent branding, but with customized layouts that make sense for the environment, Curtis said. A Burger King in a city might be smaller, with a higher focus on digital ordering. In a rural town, it might have more seating.\n\nBurger King has already started updating its image. The brand changed its logo last year, switched packaging, uniforms and signage to the new look. A few years ago, it shared what remodeled restaurants might look like: triple-lane drive-thrus, burger pickup lockers and takeout counters.\n\nThe company also wants to make make it easier for customers to use the chain‚Äôs mobile app, revamp its rewards program by offering customized digital deals, and make delivery and to-go orders more convenient.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/09/17/5-chains-joining-starbucks-in-the-pumpkin-spice-craze/90223800/?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&utm_campaign=usatodaycommoney-topstories", "title": "5 Chains Joining Starbucks in the Pumpkin Spice Craze | The ...", "text": "Rick Munarriz\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nIt's been a dozen years since Starbucks made \"pumpkin spice\" part of our vernacular.

But that‚Äôs not entirely a good thing.\n\n‚ÄúOur cup is ubiquitous, and we love that,‚Äù said Michael Kobori, Starbucks chief sustainability officer. ‚ÄúBut it is also this ubiquitous symbol of a throwaway society.‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs because the cups are disposable. When they are thrown away, the cups end up in landfills or as litter in streets and waterways. Some might be recycled, but recycling is an imperfect option ‚Äî recyclable items still end up in landfills.\n\nThe best solution? ‚ÄúEliminating the disposable cup,‚Äù Kobori said. He called that option ‚Äúthe holy grail.‚Äù\n\nThe traditional Starbucks disposable cup. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nBy 2025, the company wants every customer to be able to either use their own mug easily or borrow a ceramic or reusable to-go mug from their local Starbucks. That could mean rolling out more borrow-a-mug programs that require a deposit.\n\nStarbucks is also planning, by the end of next year, to let customers use their own personal mugs at every Starbucks in the United States and Canada, even if they order ahead or use the drive-thru.\n\nThe goals don‚Äôt mean Starbucks will get rid of the paper and plastic cups. But they do want to make that option less attractive. That won‚Äôt be easy to do, as most Starbucks customers are used to that simple, single-use option. But the company has a plan.\n\nTesting out Borrow-A-Cup programs\n\nExamples of Starbucks' reusable cups. Courtesy Starbucks Coffee Company\n\nTo phase out disposables, Starbucks is considering a widespread borrow-a-cup program, in which customers pay a deposit for a durable cup that they take with them and drop back off after use.\n\nAmelia Landers, a vice president of product experience whose team is responsible for sustainable packaging at Starbucks, expects that this model will resonate more with customers compared to other sustainability efforts.\n\n‚ÄúI think that will take the lead,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe are testing a number of different [borrow-a-cup] programs around the globe,‚Äù including ‚Äú20 different iterations and in eight different markets.‚Äù\n\nIn Seattle, Starbucks tested a beta version of such a program last year.\n\n‚ÄúWe developed a new cup that had a very low environmental footprint, was lightweight polypropylene, ultimately recyclable and could replace 100 single-use disposable cups,‚Äù Landers explained.\n\nFor that test, customers paid a $1 deposit, and had to return the cup to a smart bin located in the store to get their dollar back. Customers also earned rewards for using the cup.\n\nKim Davis, who manages a store where the program was tested, said that customers were curious about the bin, and once baristas explained it to them, many were on board with the concept.\n\n‚ÄúThe excitement and engagement was really high among my customers and my [employees],‚Äù she said. For baristas, the process was straightforward enough ‚Äî they just used the reusable cup instead of a regular one to prepare drinks. A third-party company collected the dirty cups for cleaning, so baristas didn‚Äôt have to worry about that part of the process.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) is running similar pilot programs in Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe model is the most promising because it‚Äôs the easiest to integrate into customers‚Äô daily lives.\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to remember to bring your own reusable mug or, if you do, get stuck with a dirty cup for the rest of the day. And you don‚Äôt need to sit and sip your coffee at a Starbucks, something most people don‚Äôt have time for on a weekday morning.\n\nBut that model is still just being tested, so the company wants to encourage the use of reusable mugs in other ways.\n\nBringing back the personal cup\n\nStarbucks wants all customers to be able to use reusable mugs and glasses at its stores. Courtesy Starbucks Coffee Company\n\nEarly in the pandemic, when people feared that the coronavirus could spread easily on surfaces, Starbucks barred customers from bringing their own mugs. It has since brought back the option and is now trying out ways to make it more attractive.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre testing an incentive on the personal cup to go up from where it is today ‚Äî from 10 cents to 50 cents,‚Äù Landers said. ‚ÄúWe are also going to be testing a disposable cup fee.‚Äù She added that the chain is also experimenting with discounted prices for people who use a Starbucks-provided ceramic mug in stores.\n\nThat‚Äôs simple enough. But it gets a lot more complicated when customers bring their own cups to the drive-thru or when they order ahead through the Starbucks app.\n\nYears ago, ordering ahead or using a drive-thru might have been a rare enough occasion. But since the pandemic, more customers have been coming through the drive-thru or ordering ahead.\n\nDuring a February analyst call, Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri said that Starbucks‚Äô drive-thru windows and its mobile orders together account for about 70% of sales at US stores operated by the company.\n\nSo to achieve its zero-disposable-cups goal, Starbucks needs to figure out how to get reusables through a drive-thru, and make them available to customers who order ahead.\n\nTo that end, Starbucks has been testing different options at its innovation center.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got mock stores set up,‚Äù said Landers. ‚ÄúWe have different versions of the drive-thru layout.‚Äù\n\nCustomers can simply give their cups to baristas at the drive-thru window. But Starbucks is exploring ways to make the process smoother.\n\nOne option is to allow customers to drop off their cups at an earlier point in the drive-thru lane so that the drink is ready in a personal cup once they swing around to the window, Landers said. Another is for baristas to pre-make drinks when customers place their orders, and pour them into personal tumblers at the window or when they arrive at a store to pick up their order. Starbucks is also testing out cup-washing stations in stores.\n\nThe team is trying ‚Äúdifferent things, over and over again,‚Äù to figure out what might work, she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre right now in the middle of all of that work.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs crucial for Starbucks‚Äô mobile order and drive-thru experiences to be seamless. After just a few sluggish pickups, customers may take their business elsewhere.\n\nBut Starbucks also has to be careful not to put too much additional burden on employees, who already have to prepare complicated, customized orders at high speeds.\n\nThat‚Äôs especially important now. Workers across the country are considering unionization, going against the wishes of the company‚Äôs leadership.\n\nA Starbucks, in Buffalo, New York, was the first to vote to unionize in December. Employees at a handful of other stores have since made similar efforts and several Starbucks around the country are preparing for their own votes.\n\nIf the company‚Äôs initiative leads to the end of paper and plastic cups at Starbucks, it will be quite an achievement.\n\n‚ÄúWe know that even the most ardent of sustainability champion customers, they really don‚Äôt change their behavior all that easily,‚Äù Landers said. ‚ÄúEven though they really, really want to.‚Äù", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/retail/2021/09/08/caseys-new-chef-releases-new-breakfast-menu-ground-coffee-pizza-croissants-burritos-calzones/8242136002/", "title": "New Casey's breakfast offerings just the beginning of menu changes", "text": "For the first time, Casey's has a chef overseeing its menu ‚Äî and he's ready to release new breakfast items out into the world.\n\nThe Ankeny-based convenience store chain on Wednesday launched a new lineup of breakfast foods, including bacon and egg croissants, breakfast burritos and mini sausage and queso calzone-like handhelds. It also installed coffee machines that grind beans for each cup sold at its more than 2,300 stores across the Midwest.\n\nThe new breakfast menu is the first offering out of Casey's test kitchen under the direction of Michelle Wickham, vice president of prepared foods, who was hired in April of 2020. She's been in the restaurant business for more than 30 years, with past jobs at fast casual Mexican restaurant Qdoba, burger chain Red Robin and fast food corporation Yum! Brands.\n\nLast year, Wickham recruited Farrokh Larijani, a chef out of Denver, Colorado, who formerly worked on Red Robin's menu, and Hannah Su, a former quality assurance executive with Starbucks for more than two decades.\n\nMore:Casey's completes $580 million purchase of Nebraska-based Bucky's Convenience Stores\n\nLarijani said developing menu items for a convenience store comes with a different set of challenges than a traditional restaurant.\n\n\"The product needs to be convenient for the guest and in order to deliver that to the guest every time, it needs to be bulletproof for the team members to do that,\" Larijani said. \"At our footprint, 2,300 stores, the question is, 'How do we design it in here that it gets duplicated at every store level?'\n\n\"We‚Äôre really serious about our food program.\"\n\nThe highlight of the new menu, he said, is the breakfast calzone. The handheld item is created out of Casey's pizza dough, but Larijani said he didn't want to detract from the chain's famous breakfast pizza ‚Äî so he worked to make a new experience for customers.\n\n\"It'll lend itself to the lunch crowd later on as a Mediterranean handheld, or a roasted chicken, something with beef. You can introduce different sauces and glazes,\" Larijani said.\n\nThe test kitchen is original to Casey‚Äôs Store Support Center in Ankeny, pumping out the chain's latest prepared food items since Casey's first jumped into the pizza business in the 1980s. Casey's is now the fifth largest pizza chain business in the U.S., based on number of kitchens.\n\nWickham, Larijani and Su have been \"playing around\" in the test kitchen, hoping to capitalize on Casey's customers' loyalty to their pizza and other prepared items.\n\nAccording to Casey's annual financial report released in April, in the last three years the gas station and convenience store chain's nonfuel sales have accounted for 72% of the brand's net sales revenue.\n\nWickham said Wednesday's breakfast launch is just the start of Casey's expanding its menu items.\n\nMore:Miss the Iowa State Fair? Here‚Äôs your second chance to try one of the most surprising new foods.\n\n\"I think the products are good enough to have a stand-alone store,\" she said. \"We're working on things that are a year, year and a half away.\"\n\nKatie Petru, spokesperson for Casey's, said the breakfast menu is the chain's biggest new innovation and marketing launch, but declined to say how much it invested.\n\n‚ÄúWe really have this huge differentiator in fresh prepared food with kitchens in our stores,\" Petru said. \"Stores that don't sell fuel are things that are in our portfolio, so the food and the walk-up dining is really central. I think this just allows us to hit on all those cylinders at an even next level.\"\n\nIn the last three years, Casey's has only continued to see its prepared foods revenue grow. According to the company's financial report, \"prepared food items averaged approximately 61% (of the chain's gross margin) ‚Äî substantially higher than the impact of retail sales of fuel, which averaged approximately 11%.\"\n\nLast year, as the coronavirus pandemic restricted travel, the company's fuel sales were down $275 million, while food and grocery sales remained nearly consistent from pre-pandemic sales.\n\nMore:Market Wagon to expand central Iowans' options for fresh-from-the-farm food delivery\n\nWhile Petru said Casey's isn't necessarily focused on the rise of electric vehicles and the possibility of replacing fuel sales, increasing quality and freshness of the company's prepared foods is a priority.\n\n\"Food will always be a huge priority and differentiator for Casey's,\" Petru said. \"We would be doing this as planned, regardless of those external factors. This is for us to grow our business.\"\n\nHannah Rodriguez covers retail for the Register.

Arby's added exotic meats such as venison to its sandwich lineup. Burger King created the Lucky Charms milkshake and brought back its wacky Mac 'n Cheetos ‚Äî macaroni bits encrusted with a crunchy Cheetos coating ‚Äî this time in a Flamin' Hot flavor.\n\nThe weirder the gimmick, the better. Fast-food chains discovered during 2017 that no strange concoction was off limits. The goal didn't appear to be boosting sales as much as it did to create a social-media buzz and generate publicity, favorable or otherwise, in the hopes of standing out from the pack.\n\nMcDonald's, for instance, grabbed attention around its \"Frork,\" a fork in which the prongs are french fries.\n\nOne sensation was Starbucks' Unicorn Frappuccino, a pink drink with a taste that goes from sweet to sour. The drink, among others, planted Starbucks squarely in the outrageous foods game.\n\nFast-food chains blur the lines\n\nRestaurant chains are blurring the once fairly well-defined lines of their respective genres ‚Äî even as others encroach on them. If you can't grow market share ‚Äî people can only eat so much ‚Äî then the goal becomes to take it away from others by treading on their new turf.\n\nStarbucks, for instance, gave every indication that it is going to try to become a lunch hot spot, not just a place for morning coffee runs. It launched an expanded Mercato menu starting in April in greater Chicago and then Seattle. The lineup includes a Burrata & Basil Pesto Small Sandwich, a Za‚Äôatar Chicken & Lemon Tahini Salad and a Green Goddess Avocado Salad.\n\nMcDonald's ventured upmarket by introducing Signature Crafted Recipes sandwiches such as Pico Guacamole, Sweet BBQ Bacon and Maple Bacon Dijon. It also poked at Starbucks with hand-crafted McCafe drinks such as Caramel Macchiato and Americano.\n\nAmazon enters the supermarket wars\n\nWhen Amazon bought Whole Foods Market in August for $13.7 billion, the supermarket industry was rocked to its core.\n\nIt signaled that the online retail giant is making an even bigger push into Americans' daily lives, this time with stores. The grocery world already is dealing with competition from big-box stores such as Walmart, now the largest grocer in the U.S., and specialty markets such as Trader Joe's and Sprouts.\n\nNow it has to contend with a company with such deep coffers that it will be unfazed by the supermarket industry's notoriously slim profit margins and street-level skirmishing for consumers' grocery dollars. Amazon quickly lowered prices on select items at the Austin-based chain, long dubbed \"Whole Paycheck\" due to its traditionally hefty price tags.\n\nThat Whole Foods could attract such a huge suitor also means organic food has come into its own. Organic produce and packaged goods are now sold at most traditional supermarkets around the country. According to the Organic Trade Association, sales of organic food was a record $43 billion in 2016, an 8.4% increase over 2015.\n\nEatery chains gobble up each other\n\nThe restaurant industry is all about food, so it makes sense they're devouring each other, right?\n\nWith customer foot traffic in the quick-service sector stagnant in the year ending this past August, according to NPD Group's research, restaurant companies are looking to expand reach and shave overhead. Deals included:\n\n‚Ä¢Arby's Restaurant Group announced it will buy Buffalo Wild Wings.\n\n‚Ä¢JAB, the investment firm that controls Krispy Kreme, Keurig and Caribou Coffee, picked up Panera Bread. Panera, in turn, took over Au Bon Pain, which its soon-to-be-ex-CEO Ron Shaich co-founded.\n\n‚Ä¢Burger King and Tim Hortons owner Restaurant Brands International purchased Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen.\n\n‚Ä¢Fatburger's parent company, FAT Brands, staked out the Ponderosa Steakhouse.\n\n‚Ä¢Golden Gate Capital, the private equity firm that owns Red Lobster and California Pizza Kitchen, took over Bob Evans Restaurants.\n\nJava expands into bottles\n\nDunkin' Donuts followed Starbucks into supermarket aisles in February. McDonald's joined them in September with bottled versions of its McCafe Frappes.

The nuggets are made with white meat and KFC‚Äôs signature 11 herbs and spices, and they come in servings of eight, 12 or 36 pieces.\n\nKFC already offers a few different types of chicken, including popcorn nuggets, on its menu.

KFC\n\nGen Z, which includes those currently between the ages of 18 and 24, is an important demographic for restaurants.\n\n‚ÄúThe earlier you can engage with a consumer, the more potential you have for building loyalty and building frequency over the course of more years,‚Äù Robert Byrne, director of consumer and industry insights at the restaurant consulting firm Technomic, previously told CNN Business. It‚Äôs hard to develop loyalty ‚Äúonce somebody‚Äôs past that window,‚Äù he said.\n\nBut Gen Z is less interested in dining out than other generations were at their age, making it even more important for restaurants to try to grab their attention.\n\nCreating buzz and selling snacks\n\nAmong all consumer groups, competition in the fast food world is tight. One way for brands to stand out is to test new items and make changes to menus whenever possible, creating buzz along the way.\n\nEarlier this year, KFC offered a plant-based fried chicken nugget alternative for a limited time. That launch ‚Äúelevated the brand and boosted relevance,‚Äù David Gibbs, CEO of KFC‚Äôs parent company Yum Brands (YUM), said during a May call with analysts.\n\nThe new nuggets have another potential advantage: They‚Äôre perfect for snacking, a trend that‚Äôs seeing a comeback as consumers adapt to hybrid work or return to the office. Nuggets could be a way for KFC to remind customers that they sell food that can be eaten on the go.\n\nOther brands have also revamped their chicken lineups lately. Last year, Popeyes launched its own nuggets in an attempt to capitalize on the success of its blockbuster chicken sandwich.

Except for Wendy‚Äôs, which has square burgers.\n\nThe reason for the outlier four-sided shape can be traced back to Wendy‚Äôs founder Dave Thomas. In 1969, he opened the first Wendy‚Äôs in Columbus, Ohio, because he wasn‚Äôt satisfied with other options. To make it distinctive compared to Wendy‚Äôs competitors, he used fresh meat formed into a square.\n\nThe corners of Wendy‚Äôs burgers hang over the buns. That way, Thomas believed, customers would see the quality of the hamburger, according to the company‚Äôs history.\n\nThe company has long used the square patties in its marketing campaigns. For example, the restaurant chain often says ‚Äúcutting corners isn‚Äôt in Wendy‚Äôs DNA.‚Äù\n\nThere‚Äôs a practical reason for the square shape, too.\n\n‚ÄúWe can fit more square hamburgers on a single grill than round ones,‚Äù said John Li, vice president of culinary innovation at the Wendy‚Äôs Company, told CNN Business.\n\nWendy's has been using square patties since 1969. The Wendy's Company\n\nThe chain‚Äôs use of fresh meat rather than frozen has also helped its sales.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve built longstanding and trusted relationships with our partners to ensure we can deliver the iconic square fresh, never frozen, beef burgers our fans have come to expect and love,‚Äù Li said.\n\nCompetitors have taken notice, including McDonald‚Äôs in 2018, when it swapped out frozen beef for fresh beef in most of its quarter-pound burgers in the United States. In Japan, the chain is currently experimenting with square buns (the patties are still round) for a special promotion.\n\nWhite Castle also uses square patties ‚Äì an invention that actually predates Wendy‚Äôs. According to its history, the chain began in 1921 by selling square hamburgers that were easy to eat and called ‚ÄúSliders.‚Äù In 1954, White Castle added five holes to the patty so they could cook faster.\n\nWendy‚Äôs examined switching to round patties about a decade ago, because perfectly squared shapes looked processed to focus groups. However, a round burger would‚Äôve been antithetical to Thomas‚Äô vision. Instead, Wendy‚Äôs slightly tweaked the shape to a ‚Äúnatural square‚Äù with uneven edges.\n\nChanging its burgers too much could damage its reputation.\n\n‚ÄúThe square burger is part of the Wendy‚Äôs brand experience and has been used as a differentiator in the fast food category,‚Äù according to Marisa Mulvihill, partner and head of brand and activation at global consultancy firm Prophet. ‚ÄúChanging to round burgers requires leaving behind their inspirational story and their distinctive experience which will likely diminish some of Wendy‚Äôs brand relevance.‚Äù", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/07/business-food/coke-flavors/index.html", "title": "Why Coca-Cola doesn't want to tell you what's in those weird flavors ...", "text": "New York CNN Business ‚Äî\n\nCoca-Cola famously won‚Äôt tell you the recipe for Coke. It‚Äôs not about to tell you what‚Äôs in its new limited-time flavors, either.\n\nOver the past several months, Coca-Cola has rolled out a number of curious products: Coca-Cola Starlight, Byte and Dreamworld. For each of the limited-time flavors, the beverage company offered high-concept descriptions of an experience, rather than specific flavors. For Coke, the mystery is the point.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre engaging with people,‚Äù said Selman Careaga, global category president of Coca-Cola Trademark, which includes Coke drinks but not other Coca-Cola products like Fanta, Sprite or others. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre interacting with us, and they‚Äôre trying to guess what‚Äôs in it.‚Äù\n\nGetting people talking is an important marketing strategy for Coke, especially if it can spark interest among young consumers.\n\nRecently, Coca-Cola has been ‚Äúreally trying to encourage consumers to debate‚Äù over their products, noted Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest. When the company unveiled its new Coke Zero recipe, for example, it encouraged customers to decide whether it was the ‚Äúbest Coke ever.‚Äù And it‚Äôs been selling mystery Fanta flavors as part of its ‚ÄúWhat the Fanta?‚Äù campaign.\n\nStarlight is inspired by space. Billy F Blume Jr/Shutterstock\n\nConversations around product flavors put brands front-of-mind for consumers. Coca-Cola (KO) wants people who engage in these discussions, or see them online, to think about Coke when they walk into a store, noted Stanford. And it‚Äôs especially important for the beverage company to create chatter around its marquee brand, which it has prioritized after slashing underperforming brands.\n\nPlus, these products aren‚Äôt just out-there Coke flavors. Each comes with a dedicated online experience. Together, they‚Äôre designed to capture the attention of a coveted demographic: Gen Z.\n\nCotton Candy, Creamsicles or Bubblegum?\n\nInstead of a traditional flavor like ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù or ‚Äúcherry,‚Äù Coca-Cola provided each product with its own vague description, and let fans fill in the blanks.\n\nThe company described Starlight as having ‚Äúnotes reminiscent of stargazing around a campfire, as well as a cooling sensation that evokes the feeling of a cold journey to space.‚Äù Byte ‚Äúinvites you to explore what pixels might taste like,‚Äù and Dreamworld is somehow even more conceptual, promising consumers that they will ‚Äúexperience the familiar Coca-Cola taste now with a surprising and unexpected flavor from a dream world.‚Äù\n\nYouTubers reviewing the product groaned over the cheesy advertising, but still tried to puzzle out the taste, encouraging commenters to weigh in.\n\nGuesses were all over the map: Some thought that Starlight tastes like cotton candy, funnel cake or S‚Äômores. After trying Byte, some guessed blueberry or grapefruit. People said that Dreamworld tasted of mango, peach or orange. Or maybe cough syrup.\n\nSome brands roll out mystery flavors, but reward customers with a reveal. Mountain Dew has made a tradition of releasing a secret VooDew flavor, and eventually telling customers what it is. Coca-Cola‚Äôs Fanta flavors will be unveiled, as well.\n\nBut Starlight, Byte and Dreamworld‚Äôs flavors are staying in the vault, said Careaga.\n\n‚ÄúIn a way, [it‚Äôs] like our secret formula,‚Äù he said. And in this case, the flavors aren‚Äôt really the point.\n\nTargeting Gen Z\n\nCoca-Cola didn‚Äôt share sales figures for these products. But it is pleased with the results so far, said Careaga. Efforts like the mystery flavors have contributed to sales growth in Coke drinks overall, he said. Trademark Coke grew 7% in the second quarter.\n\nThe beverages were developed to fit into the broader themes of space, computing and dreams, respectively. But the flavors themselves? Not so important.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really not so much about the taste of the product, but really around the experiences that we create,‚Äù he said. Those experiences are often virtual, intending to capture a younger audience that spends lots of time online.\n\nEach of the limited-time flavors was launched among a slew of digital experiences. To name a few: Starlight‚Äôs can featured a QR code that granted customers access to a holographic Ava Max concert. Byte was launched in Fortnite, and Dreamworld customers could buy virtual merchandise for their online avatars.\n\nWhat is important, however, is that every Coke product tastes like a Coke.\n\n‚ÄúThe R&D team does a great job [of] developing these new flavors, which are Coca-Cola based, but then we kind of play a little bit with the taste.‚Äù Careaga said. ‚ÄúWithout a doubt, it‚Äôs a Coca-Cola product.‚Äù\n\nDeveloping new Coke flavors can be risky if they stray too far from the signature flavor, Stanford noted.\n\n‚ÄúWhen you create these formulas that could be hit or miss, you‚Äôve got to be very careful,‚Äù Stanford said. ‚ÄúThe longevity of the brand has been all about that very unique Coke taste,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúYou want to make sure you don‚Äôt undermine that long-term message.‚Äù", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}]}

That account also posted multiple videos from the incident at Barton Springs Road and South Lamar Boulevard, including one video showing two women hanging out of a car while it spins in the street. The account appears to have been promoting the event with an unspecified date for a few weeks.\n\nA review of multiple Instagram accounts shows that the coordinated meetup featured \"takeover\" groups from various cities across the state, including San Antonio and Houston. A post from a Texas account showed that a group of people met at the Buc-ee's in Temple about 6 p.m. before heading to Austin.\n\nAustin City Council Member Alison Alter said Sunday that she unknowingly drove up on the incident at Barton Springs Road and South Lamar Boulevard and was able to navigate around it.\n\nAlter called 911 to report what was happening and said she waited on hold for 28 minutes. Alter has been working in the past 18 months to increase the number of 911 operators and has since spoken to interim City Manager Jes√∫s Garza, who was appointed Wednesday, and other city officials about the need to address the issue immediately.\n\nAlter said the 911 staffing issue has persisted despite her demands for the city to better recruit and retain operators. She also pointed out that staffing at the call center is not related to the staffing size for sworn officers and is not addressed in the city's contract with the union because operators are typically civilians.\n\nDuke Whitman lives near South Lamar Boulevard and Barton Springs Road and witnessed the events Saturday night. He said tires screeching and engines revving aren't uncommon for the area, but he was drawn outside when it persisted.\n\nHe estimated a crowd of 250 people stood around while cars did doughnuts in the intersection. Watching with binoculars from his balcony, he saw multiple people in the crowd get hit by the cars doing doughnuts, he said.\n\n\"My concern is 30- to 40-minute (police) response time for something that is relatively large,\" Whitman said. \"It wouldn't take much for something like that to get way out of hand.\"\n\nThe event Saturday night is considered a \"sideshow,\" in which a group blocks off a public intersection and people perform vehicle stunts.

Police believe multiple shooters were involved and shell casings from multiple different weapon calibers were found at the scene.\n\nAlli said the incident in Clintonville is one of multiple similar events that have occurred in other parts of the city, and with the summer months approaching, officers are concerned about the possibility of similar events in the future.\n\n\"Those bullets go somewhere,\" Alli said. \"There could have been people killed.\"\n\nSteel said there have been four incidents so far in 2023 in which Columbus police officers have been shot at, including two in the past two weeks.\n\nIn addition to the April 29 shooting, in March, a man outside a bar on the city's Northeast Side shot at officers who responded to the area before being shot and wounded by officers. On Saturday morning, officers in the Short North were shot at during an ongoing gun battle. And earlier this year, an officer's personal vehicle was shot at while parked in a police substation parking lot.\n\n\"It's in the criminal mind that it's OK to shooting at a police officer and nothing will happen,\" Steel said. \"That's just not the case.\"\n\nAnyone with information about the Clintonville shooting is asked to call Central Ohio Crime Stoppers at 614-461-TIPS, use the free P3 Tips mobile application or provide information online at www.stopcrime.org.

He was found guilty in March 2023 in a closely watched case that comes with a potential life sentence.\n\nIn addition, Murdaugh, an attorney who has since been disbarred, has been charged with 99 financial crimes related to a wide-ranging scheme to bilk his law firm, clients and the government out of about $9.3 million, according to the state attorney general.\n\nSo what were the twists and turns that led to this point? Here‚Äôs a timeline of everything we know about the Murdaugh family saga:\n\n1920-2006\n\nOver three generations, a member of the Murdaugh family has served as the 14th Circuit Solicitor, which leads prosecutions for Allendale, Beaufort, Colleton, Hampton and Jasper counties in the southern part of South Carolina.\n\nRandolph Murdaugh Sr. was elected to the 14th Circuit Solicitor‚Äôs Office in 1920 and served in the position until his death in 1940.\n\nHis son, Randolph Murdaugh Jr., then took over the position and served until his retirement in 1986.\n\nMurdaugh Jr.‚Äôs son, Randolph Murdaugh III, was then elected to the role in 1987 and served through the end of 2005.\n\nMurdaugh III‚Äôs son, Alex Murdaugh, works as an attorney at the law firm Peters Murdaugh Parker Eltzroth & Detrick, known as PMPED.\n\nIn 2006, then-Gov. Mark Sanford appoints attorney Duffie Stone to serve as the 14th Circuit Solicitor, making him the first non-Murdaugh in the position. He has been elected to the position four times since, most recently in 2020, according to the solicitor‚Äôs website.\n\n2018\n\nGloria Satterfield, a longtime housekeeper for the Murdaugh family, dies in what is described as a ‚Äútrip and fall accident‚Äù at the Murdaugh home, according to attorney Eric Bland, who is representing her estate.\n\nAfter Satterfield‚Äôs death, a $500,000 wrongful death claim was filed against Alex Murdaugh on behalf of her estate, Bland said.\n\n2019\n\nPictures of Alex Murdaugh and his family.

The defendant could be seen slumped over in a chair ‚Äì their head resting on their right shoulder ‚Äì behind two defense lawyers.\n\nAnderson Lee Aldrich, 22, appears with public defenders via video at an advisement hearing. Jane Rosenberg/Reuters\n\nFormal charges are expected at the next court hearing, set for December 6, Colorado‚Äôs Fourth Judicial District Attorney Michael Allen said. Aldrich would be expected to appear then in person, he said, adding the date could change.\n\nPreliminary charges include five counts of first-degree murder and five counts of a bias-motivated crime ‚Äì elsewhere called a hate crime ‚Äì causing bodily injury, per El Paso County Court‚Äôs online docket.\n\nAnderson Lee Aldrich will remain held without bond following court appearance. El Paso County District Court\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be reviewing all of the evidence and making the appropriate filing decisions at the appropriate time,‚Äù Allen said.\n\nAhead of the hearing, attorneys for Aldrich submitted a court filing stating the suspect identifies as nonbinary. ‚ÄúThey use they-them pronouns, and for the purposes of all formal filings, will be addressed as Mx. Aldrich,‚Äù the court document noted.\n\nAsked after the hearing about the potential impact on the case of the defendant‚Äôs nonbinary distinction, Allen said: ‚ÄúTo us, his legal definition in this proceeding is the defendant,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúIt has no impact on the way that I prosecute this case.‚Äù\n\nThe prosecutor declined to comment on the motive for the crime or the investigation.\n\n‚ÄúI want them to know that we are going to be the voice for the victims in the courtroom and that we will be fighting alongside them during this entire process,‚Äù Allen said of the victims‚Äô families.\n\nThe public defender‚Äôs office is representing Aldrich and has declined all requests for comment, citing office policy.\n\nAs the investigation and legal process proceed, survivors and loved ones of those killed are processing the feelings of shock and grief after a fun night of drag performances and dancing turned violent at Club Q, a venue known as a safe space for the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe US has recorded more than 600 mass shootings so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which like CNN defines such incidents as those with at least four slain or injured, not including the shooter.\n\nDaniel Aston, Raymond Green Vance, Kelly Loving, Ashley Paugh and Derrick Rump were killed in the attack at Club Q ‚Äì some while working a Saturday night shift and others while enjoying the night‚Äôs events. At least 19 others were injured, most by gunshots, police have said.\n\nAldrich entered the nightclub just before midnight armed with an AR-style weapon and a handgun and immediately began shooting, police said.\n\n‚ÄúFrom the amount of shots that initially went off when he came into the club, I honestly thought it was multiple people shooting,‚Äù clubgoer Gil Rodriguez told CNN on Monday.\n\nThe suspect was quickly taken down and contained by two patrons until police arrived, which officials say likely prevented more people from being killed or injured.\n\nRichard Fierro, an Army veteran who was celebrating a birthday at the club with family and friends, tackled Aldrich to the ground and used the suspect‚Äôs handgun to hit them repeatedly, Fierro told CNN. Another person jumped in to help and pushed the rifle out of Aldrich‚Äôs reach, Fierro said.\n\nShortly after, Aldrich was taken into custody and hospitalized. On Tuesday, the suspect was transferred to the El Paso County Jail.\n\nWhile murder charges will offer the longest sentencing options, Allen said he expects more charges on top of those.\n\n‚ÄúColorado has biased-motivated crime statutes, which most people understand as hate crimes. We are definitely looking at that, based on the facts involved in this case,‚Äù Allen said. ‚ÄúAnd if there‚Äôs evidence to charge it, we‚Äôll absolutely charge those as well.‚Äù\n\nAdditional charges of menacing are also possible, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said.\n\n‚ÄúEvery single person who was there at Club Q is a victim of one crime or another,‚Äù Weiser told CNN on Tuesday.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really important that we‚Äôre able to honor the victims and to be able to call out this crime for what it really appears to be, which is a hate crime motivated by who people were,‚Äù he added.\n\nNew details emerge about the suspect\n\nAs authorities try to nail down a motive behind the shooting, new information has come to light about the suspect‚Äôs upbringing and questions have been raised about why previous charges against Aldrich were dropped.\n\nAldrich was born under the name Nicholas Brink and legally changed the name in 2015.\n\nThat same year, Aldrich experienced cyberbullying on a parody website that contains photos of Aldrich and uses offensive slurs to mock the then-teen‚Äôs weight and accuse Aldrich of engaging in illegal activity, according to an emerging portrait of the alleged shooter pieced together by CNN.\n\nThe page, which was first reported by the Washington Post, is still active.\n\nXavier Kraus, a neighbor of the accused shooter, said he and his girlfriend lived across the hall from Aldrich and their mother until September. Kraus said they mostly played video games together, often in Aldrich‚Äôs apartment.\n\nAldrich would occasionally express hateful attitudes toward people, Kraus recalled.\n\nKraus said he specifically remembered one time ‚ÄúAldrich vocalized verbally‚Äù that they ‚Äúdid not like or slash hated the gays. Using a derogatory term for them.‚Äù He added that many other ‚Äúoutbursts‚Äù were ‚Äúracial.‚Äù\n\nAldrich was ‚Äúnot someone I would have around my gay friends,‚Äù Kraus said. He said the alleged shooter never mentioned they were non-binary.\n\nAldrich was proud of the weapons they owned, according to Kraus. When Aldrich showed him a weapon one time, Kraus told them, ‚Äúguns like this scare me.‚Äù Kraus recalled Aldrich telling him, ‚Äú‚ÄòBro, it‚Äôs not the guns, it‚Äôs the people that you gotta be scared of,‚Äô and that conversation kinda sits with me.‚Äù\n\nAldrich‚Äôs mother told police her son threatened her with a bomb\n\nAccording to a relative, the suspect‚Äôs primary caretaker was his grandmother, who declined CNN‚Äôs request for an interview. Aldrich ended up under her supervision when their mother struggled with a string of arrests and related mental health evaluations, according to court records and an interview with a family member.\n\nLaura Voepel, Aldrich‚Äôs mother, called police last year and reported Aldrich had entered the Colorado Springs house she was renting a room in and threatened her with a homemade bomb.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 2021 video appears to show Colorado club shooting suspect ranting about police 01:52 - Source: CNN\n\nVideo obtained by CNN showed Aldrich apparently ranting about the police during the incident and challenging them to breach the home.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve got the f**king sh*theads outside, look at that, they‚Äôve got a bead on me,‚Äù Aldrich says on the video, pointing the camera at a window with blinds covering it. ‚ÄúYou see that right there? F**king sh*theads got their f**king rifles out.‚Äù\n\nLater in the video, Aldrich says, ‚ÄúIf they breach, I‚Äômma f**king blow it to holy hell.‚Äù\n\nThe video ends with Aldrich delivering what seems like a message to law enforcement outside: ‚ÄúSo, uh, go ahead and come on in, boys! Let‚Äôs f**king see it!‚Äù\n\nThe video does not actually show any officers outside the house, and it‚Äôs not clear from the video whether Aldrich had any weapons in the house.\n\nSeveral hours after the initial police call, the local sheriff department‚Äôs crisis negotiations unit was able to get Aldrich to leave the house.

The district attorney‚Äôs office did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n\nAldrich purchased the two weapons brought Saturday night to Club Q, law enforcement sources told CNN this week. But it‚Äôs not clear whether the AR-style rifle and handgun were purchased before or after the 2021 case.\n\nAldrich‚Äôs arrest in connection to the bomb threat would not have shown up in background checks because the case was never adjudicated, the charges were dropped and the records were sealed. It‚Äôs unclear what prompted the sealing of the records.\n\n‚ÄòWe‚Äôre a city in mourning,‚Äô mayor says\n\nWith the shooting happening just days before Thanksgiving, some families that were planning holiday gatherings are now reeling from the impact of the violence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback These are the five people who died in the Club Q shooting 02:28 - Source: CNN\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a city in mourning, but we‚Äôre a city in recovery,‚Äù Mayor John Suthers told CNN on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThe only message that we have to convey is that the actions of this lone individual: ‚Ä¶ Do not define our community.

She was a loving daughter, sister, partner ‚Ä¶ and she loved to travel, cook and host for her family and friends who she cared for deeply,‚Äù MacSween said.\n\n‚ÄúVittorio Panza was a very proud Italian immigrant who was a well-respected realtor for over 40 years and had a great passion for music. He was a husband, a father to three daughters, and a proud ‚ÄòNonno‚Äô to seven grandchildren.‚Äù\n\nThe Mancocks were also grandparents, MacSween said.\n\n‚ÄúRussell Manock was the most hardworking, caring, loving father and grandfather who cherished every moment he spent with his family. Trusted and loved by everyone who knew him, he was their family rock,‚Äù MacSween said.\n\nHelen Manock, who went by Lorraine, ‚Äúwas the most loving mother, grandmother, and sister.‚Äù\n\nMacSween said of Russell and Lorraine on behalf of their family, ‚Äúthey were devoted to each other and their family soulmates in life and now in heaven. The family is devastated by this unspeakable, tragic loss.‚Äù\n\nDada, MacSween said, was ‚Äúa great son and a brother. He spent half his life in Canada and Naveed always wanted to serve his community and help those in need.‚Äù\n\nCanada: More gun restrictions than US\n\nSunday‚Äôs killings came in the wake of fresh moves by Canada‚Äôs government to tighten gun control laws in the country, which has more gun regulation and far less gun violence than the US. Citizens may own firearms with a license; some must be registered.\n\nThis year, the government tightened restrictions further.\n\nIn October, regulations went into effect banning the sale, purchase or transfer of handguns within Canada. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had announced the changes in May. ‚ÄúWe have frozen the market for handguns in this country,‚Äù Trudeau said at a news conference in Surrey, British Columbia, attended by family members of gun violence victims and other advocates, Reuters reported.\n\n‚ÄúAs we see gun violence continue to rise ‚Ä¶ we have an obligation to take action,‚Äù Trudeau added. ‚ÄúToday our national handgun freeze is coming into force.‚Äù\n\nCanada‚Äôs gun homicide rate per 100,000 residents in 2019 was one-eighth of the US rate, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The country‚Äôs population is about 38 million, compared to the US population of about 332 million.\n\nCanada‚Äôs homicide rate rose for three years in a row starting in 2019, according to Statistics Canada, with 297 gun-related killings in 2021, the group said.\n\nThe US had more than 20,000 gun-related killings in 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n\nCanada‚Äôs deadliest mass killing was in May 2020, when 22 people were fatally shot or died in house fires set by a gunman in Nova Scotia. Less than two weeks later, Trudeau‚Äôs government banned more than 1,500 models and variants of assault-style weapons, making their use, sale or importation illegal.\n\nIn June 2022, a shootout outside a bank in British Columbia left six officers injured and two suspects dead, authorities said.\n\nThen in July, two people were killed and two injured in a series of shootings in Langley, near Vancouver in British Columbia, police said.\n\nEleven people died in a mass stabbing attack in September 2022 in Canada‚Äôs Saskatchewan province.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe Tavleen Tarrant Jay Croft", "Elizabeth Wolfe", "Tavleen Tarrant", "Jay Croft"], "publish_date": "2022/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/us/buffalo-mass-shooting-guns-suspect/index.html", "title": "How Payton Gendron legally obtained guns before the Buffalo mass ...", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nThe 18-year-old man accused of mass murder at a Buffalo supermarket legally obtained an AR-15 style rifle, believed to be the same weapon he described modifying in a lengthy, racist rant posted online before the attack.\n\nLaw enforcement officials told CNN on Tuesday there appear to have been no red flags that would have prevented the 18-year-old from obtaining the three guns said to be found in his possession ‚Äì the one used in the attack and two guns in his car. He had been evaluated for mental health concerns last year, officials said, but those didn‚Äôt rise to the level of legal concern.\n\n‚ÄúWhere were the red flags for him to be able to purchase these guns legally?‚Äù Erie County, New York, Sheriff John Garcia said. ‚ÄúBut in a case like this the gun dealer was able to sell these weapons to this individual because there was no red flags that came up.‚Äù\n\nPayton Gendron, in the lengthy document posted online, wrote that he bought the AR-15 style gun from a gun store in New York. Gendron had been taken to an emergency room for a mental health evaluation after an incident in high school where he mentioned ‚Äúmurder-suicide,‚Äù but was released without being involuntarily committed, according to law enforcement officials.\n\nInvoluntary commitment could have, if the system worked as designed, resulted in Gendron‚Äôs name being added to a list of people prohibited from purchasing guns.\n\nGendron‚Äôs attorney declined to comment. Gendron is due in court Thursday morning.\n\nGun store owners: He passed background checks\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the gun used was purchased legally in New York State.\n\nSpeaking to CNN‚Äôs Dana Bash on ‚ÄúState of the Union‚Äù on Sunday, Hochul said the weapon was an AR-15. She said it‚Äôs believed the high-capacity magazine was purchased outside of New York. It‚Äôs not clear from Hochul‚Äôs statement describing the weapon as an AR-15 that it is the same item as listed in Gendron‚Äôs document; police haven‚Äôt released details yet about the weapon or weapons that were used.\n\n‚ÄúThe gun was purchased in a gun store in New York State legally, an AR-15. But what has made this so lethal, and so devastating for this community, was the high-capacity magazine that would have had to have been purchased elsewhere, that‚Äôs not legal in the State of New York,‚Äù Hochul said.\n\nGendron wrote about buying and modifying an AR-15 style weapon. In New York, magazines can‚Äôt be larger than 10 rounds, and outside of shooting competitions, can‚Äôt have more than seven rounds in the rifle at any one time. The AR-style weapon Gendron described wasn‚Äôt sold with the 30-round magazines common for this type of rifle, when pictured for sale, is almost always pictured with 30-round magazines legal in much of America.\n\nHochul said it‚Äôs not clear where the gunman purchased the magazines used in the shooting. Gendron lived right over the state border from Pennsylvania where gun laws are more permissive. Gendron, in his writing, said he bought magazines at a flea market in New York ‚Äì which might have been illegal, depending on when he purchased them.\n\nGendron wrote that the AR-style rifle he bought, because of the lock on the magazine, was legal in New York, but then modified it to remove that lock. At least nine states and the District of Columbia have restrictions, ranging from owning magazines that carry more than 10 or 15 rounds, to banning the sale or purchase of those magazines.\n\nGendron wrote that he was able to remove the lock with a drill.\n\nGendron also wrote of two other weapons in the document: a Mossberg 500 shotgun and a Savage Axis XP rifle. At a press conference Monday, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said investigators knew of three weapons ‚Äì two located in his car and one Gendron was carrying. Investigators found a rifle and a shotgun in the car; CNN obtained a photo of those weapons. Gramaglia described the gun Gendron allegedly used as an AR-15.\n\nThe owner of Pennsylvania Guns and Ammo, a 10-minute drive across the state border from Gendron‚Äôs hometown of Conklin, New York, told CNN that Gendron legally purchased a shotgun from his store in December 2021. The owner said Gendron claimed he wanted the gun for target practice. He said Gendron was 18 at the time of the purchase and cleared all background checks at his store. He asked not to be identified.\n\nGendron wrote he acquired the AR-15-style firearm legally and modified it after the fact, an act undetectable to law enforcement or anyone else until the gun is recovered or until someone alerts them to the modification. Robert Donald, the owner of Vintage Firearms, where Gendron wrote he purchased an AR-style rifle, didn‚Äôt respond to CNN requests for comment.\n\nHowever, Donald told The New York Times that he sold a Bushmaster rifle to Gendron. Donald told the newspaper he was ‚Äúshocked‚Äù when federal investigators contacted him Saturday to inquire about Gendron.\n\n‚ÄúI knew nothing about it until I got the call from them. I couldn‚Äôt believe it,‚Äù he told the Times. ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt believe it. I don‚Äôt understand why an 18-year-old would even do this,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI know I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, but I feel terrible about it.‚Äù\n\nDonald told the Times he didn‚Äôt remember Gendron, and added that the background report didn‚Äôt show anything.\n\n‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt stand out ‚Äî because if he did, I would‚Äôve never sold him the gun,‚Äù Donald told the Times.\n\nSuspect was evaluated, not involuntarily committed\n\nGarcia, the Erie County sheriff, said the Buffalo shooting suspect was visited last year by New York State Police after he turned in a high school project about murder-suicides.\n\n‚ÄúThe state police arrived at his house at that point last year,‚Äù Garcia said. ‚ÄúHe stayed at a facility, I‚Äôm not sure if it was a hospital or a mental health facility, for a day and a half.‚Äù\n\nBeau Duffy, a spokesperson for the New York State Police, said that ‚Äútroopers transported the student to the hospital for a mental health evaluation.‚Äù He confirmed that it was an evaluation and not an involuntary commitment ‚Äì so it would not have prevented Gendron from purchasing a gun under federal law.\n\nNew York State Police officials also did not seek a ‚ÄúRed Flag‚Äù order of protection against Gendron after the incident, which could have been another way to prevent him from purchasing a gun. State police declined to comment on why they didn‚Äôt seek a red flag order. A law enforcement official told CNN ‚Äúthe threat was general in nature and did not target the school or anyone in particular, and did not specifically mention shooting or firearms.‚Äù\n\nThe state‚Äôs Red Flag law, also known as the Extreme Risk Protection Order law, was enacted in 2019 and is designed to prevent anyone who shows signs of being a threat to themselves or others from purchasing or possessing a firearm.\n\nAccording to New York state law, certain clinicians who determine that a patient is ‚Äúlikely to engage in conduct that would result in serious harm to self or others‚Äù are required to report that to a county health commissioner, who can report that to the state‚Äôs Division of Criminal Justice Services, which can block people from buying guns and revoke gun permits.\n\nFederal law prohibits someone involuntarily committed to a mental health institution from buying a gun. It does not cover someone in a mental institution ‚Äúfor observation.‚Äù A mental institution includes any mental health facility, hospital, or psychiatric ward of a general hospital.\n\nNew York has relatively strong laws concerning access to firearms by mentally ill people. Data from the FBI‚Äôs NICS background check database shows that as of December 2021, there were more than 860,000 people blocked from buying a gun due to adjudicated mental health in New York ‚Äì the third-highest total, after California and Pennsylvania.\n\nSocial media posts by Gendron claim the investigation into his threat of violence last year ended when he says he told investigators his writings were something he ‚Äústupidly‚Äù he had done. He was attending Susquehanna High School at the time, in Conklin, last June.\n\nIn a post, dated January 30, 2022, Gendron wrote ‚ÄúAnother bad experience was when I had to go to a hospital‚Äôs ER because I said the word‚Äôs ‚Äòmurder/suicide‚Äô to an online paper in economics class.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI got out of it because I stuck with the story that I was getting out of class and I just stupidly wrote that down. That is the reason I believe I am still able to purchase guns. It was not a joke, I wrote that down because that‚Äôs what I was planning to do,‚Äù according to the post.\n\nGendron also claims that his mental health evaluation lasted 15 minutes after he spent hours waiting in the emergency room.\n\nCNN has reached out to New York State Police about this account. Investigators have previously said Gendron‚Äôs threat was of a general nature and not specific enough to warrant further action.\n\nProsecutor reviewing ‚Äòall aspects‚Äô of school threat\n\nThe district attorney in Gendron‚Äôs hometown said he‚Äôs reviewing ‚Äúall aspects‚Äù of last year‚Äôs investigation into the school threat.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre even going back several years as far as what his behavior was at that point in time, his relationship with his family, his relationship with teachers and students at the school,‚Äù Broome County DA Michael Korchak told CNN. ‚ÄúSo everything is on the table right now based on this investigation.‚Äù\n\nKorchak said it‚Äôs ‚Äúhard to say‚Äù whether more should have been done in June 2021, when the suspect threatened to commit a murder-suicide at his high school.\n\n‚ÄúThe New York State Police were called and they went to the subjects‚Äô residence in Conklin and interviewed him and took him to Binghamton General Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation,‚Äù Korchak said. ‚ÄúSo there were no direct threats made to any student or teacher.‚Äù\n\nAccording to Korchak, the suspect was 17 at the time. He was treated, released, and cleared to go back to school after that.", "authors": ["Peter Nickeas Casey Tolan Virginia Langmaid", "Peter Nickeas", "Casey Tolan", "Virginia Langmaid"], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/16/us/police-shootings-outcomes-controversies/index.html", "title": "Police shootings: What happened after controversial cases | CNN", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nIt often feels like a matter of when it will happen again and not if. A routine traffic stop involving a Black person becomes deadly when one or more police officers fatally shoot at them. Families mourn the loss of a loved one and demand answers, simultaneously navigating the same criminal justice system that took them away. Days later, video is released, resulting in outrage from community members who take to the streets to protest, calling for justice.\n\nThe shooting of Jayland Walker last week is the latest high-profile police shooting of a Black person under scrutiny.\n\nOn Sunday, the Akron Police Department released 13 police body camera videos, which show Walker‚Äôs encounter with police officers following a traffic stop, including the moment he was fatally shot by eight police officers firing dozens of bullets at him, resulting in over 60 wounds, officials said.\n\nWalker‚Äôs family wants him to be remembered as a fun-loving young man who was full of life, said Robert Dejournett, a relative and the pastor of St. Ashworth Temple Church of God In Christ. He said the family hopes the shooting will lead to change.\n\n‚ÄúWe want to take that, and we want to use it for the benefit of systemic change,‚Äù Dejournett said. ‚ÄúWe want to be treated like human beings, you know, Black men, young men, they‚Äôre afraid when it comes to police ‚Äì that shouldn‚Äôt be.‚Äù\n\nThere were protests over Walker‚Äôs killing Sunday that started peacefully but turned violent after night fell, Akron Mayor Dan Horrigan said. He said there was ‚Äúsignificant property damage done to downtown Akron‚Äù and police said they arrested around 50 people after the group failed to disperse.\n\nWalker‚Äôs family had asked that any protests remain peaceful to honor his memory.\n\nDeAnna Hoskins, the Ohio-based president and CEO of national criminal justice reform nonprofit JustLeadershipUSA (JLUSA), said the scene of the video showing Walker‚Äôs encounter with police reminded her of a war zone given the number of shots fired, adding that this is another case of a Black man being shot and killed by police and being hunted as if he was an animal or property.\n\n‚ÄúTransparency of the videotape has allowed us to get to the bottom of stories or reports from the officers,‚Äù Hoskins said. ‚ÄúBut it also was a very traumatic experience for those who watch it as well. After a while you just you get exhausted of watching that.‚Äù\n\nWhile details of the case ‚Äì and the expected fallout ‚Äì are still unfolding, Walker‚Äôs death directs attention back on how a traffic stop can become fatal and revives years-long frustration with how police interact with Black people. Killings at the hands of law enforcement continue to leave families devastated and social justice advocates calling for substantive reform and policy changes.\n\nIn response to the video release, NAACP Legal Defense Fund president and director-counsel Janai S. Nelson said in a statement that Walker‚Äôs killing highlights how the country must reimagine police conduct surrounding traffic stops and how society thinks about public safety. Black drivers are disproportionately killed by law enforcement officers in traffic stops, he added.\n\n‚ÄúThe tragic killing of Jayland Walker once again underscores just how deeply dysfunctional and discriminatory America‚Äôs system of policing continues to be,‚Äù Nelson said. ‚ÄúAs we understand them, the facts and video footage in Mr. Walker‚Äôs death give us significant pause about the legality of the officers‚Äô conduct.‚Äù\n\nHere is a look at some of the most recent high-profile and controversial police shootings and the outcomes:\n\nJayland Walker, 25\n\nJayland Walker Family Photo\n\nWhen: June 27, 2022\n\nWhere: Akron, Ohio\n\nWhat happened: According to police, the events that led to the shooting began around 12:30 a.m., when police attempted to stop Walker, who was driving a silver Buick, for traffic and equipment violations.\n\nWalker fled the stop, according to a narrated video timeline of the incident police played at Sunday‚Äôs news conference, and officers began to chase after him.\n\nAbout 40 seconds after Walker drove away from police, ‚Äúa sound consistent with a gunshot can be heard on the body-worn cameras of the officers,‚Äù police said in the narrated video. Police also said ‚Äúa flash of light‚Äù could be seen on the driver‚Äôs side of the car at the time of the sound.\n\nAfter several minutes, body camera video shows that Walker‚Äôs vehicle slowed, and he exited the vehicle and ran. Several police officers got out of their patrol cars and chased him, and officers deployed Tasers in an effort to stop him, police said, but were unsuccessful.\n\nThe incident ended soon after when, according to a police timeline, Walker ‚Äústopped and quickly turned towards the officers,‚Äù and eight officers discharged their weapons on the unarmed man, firing dozens of bullets. At least one officer can be heard near the end of videos that were released shouting, ‚ÄúCease fire.‚Äù\n\nWhat‚Äôs next: The shooting remains under investigation by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations (BCI).\n\nThe eight officers who Akron Police Chief Stephen Mylett said were ‚Äúdirectly involved in the shooting‚Äù have all been placed on paid administrative leave, per department policy. According to information released by the city, seven of the officers are White and one is Black.\n\nA medical examiner‚Äôs report found Walker suffered at least 60 wounds as a result of the gunfire, Mylett said Sunday, though the medical examiner is still working to determine which are entrance wounds and which are exit wounds. The BCI will determine exactly how many times Walker was shot, Mylett said.\n\nThe officers are ‚Äúcooperating fully‚Äù with the investigation, the Akron police union said in a statement, adding it believes the investigation will determine the officers‚Äô use of force was justified.\n\nMylett said officers retrieved a shell casing near the scene of the attempted traffic stop that was ‚Äúconsistent with the firearm that Mr. Walker had in his vehicle. The BCI will determine whether or not that casing came from the gun or not.‚Äù\n\nThe Summit County Medical Examiner‚Äôs Office did not release the autopsy record to CNN but confirmed Walker‚Äôs death ‚Äúis ruled a homicide and is considered a ‚Äòconfidential law enforcement investigatory record.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nWalker died from multiple gunshot wounds to the face, abdomen and upper legs, CNN affiliate WEWS reported, citing findings by its media partner, the Akron Beacon Journal.\n\nA final autopsy report will be turned over to the BCI, and the report will be part of what the state attorney general‚Äôs office considers for presenting a case to a grand jury.\n\nPatrick Lyoya, 26\n\nPatrick Lyoya Attorney Ben Crump\n\nWhen: April 4, 2022\n\nWhere: Grand Rapids, Michigan\n\nWhat happened: The incident began just after 8 a.m. ET on April 4 when police say they pulled over a vehicle for improper registration. The driver, Lyoya, got out of the vehicle and at some point, ran, Grand Rapids Police said. Body camera footage showed the officer chasing and tackling Lyoya, resulting in a minutes-long struggle.\n\nThe officer attempted to tase Lyoya at least twice, according to the police chief, but failed to make contact as Lyoya put his hands on the Taser. At that point, the officer‚Äôs body camera was accidentally deactivated but cell phone video shows the fatal shot to the head, which can also be heard in video from a home surveillance camera.\n\nThe outcomes: About a week after the shooting, Grand Rapids police released several video clips showing Lyoya‚Äôs entire encounter with a White police officer after a traffic stop, including the moment the officer fatally shot the 26-year-old Black man. Protests erupted in Grand Rapids after the video was released, with several hundred people chanting, ‚ÄúJustice for Patrick.‚Äù\n\nIn early May, the Kent County medical examiner‚Äôs office released its autopsy results, showing that Lyoya died from a gunshot wound of the head. The county‚Äôs autopsy also found that Lyoya‚Äôs blood alcohol content was more than three times the legal limit. An autopsy performed by a pathologist hired by the Lyoya family confirmed the findings of the county medical examiner: that Lyoya died from a gunshot wound.\n\nChristopher Schurr ‚Äì the former officer who fired the fatal shot ‚Äì was charged with second-degree murder for the death of Lyoya on June 9 and subsequently fired by the Grand Rapids Police Department less than a week later. Schurr‚Äôs lawyer, Mark Dodge, said at arraignment last month that his client was ‚Äújustified in his use of force‚Äù and entered a not guilty plea on the count of second-degree murder. A judge set Schurr‚Äôs bond at $100,000 and put in place multiple conditions for his pretrial release, including that Schurr cannot purchase or possess guns or drink liquor or use drugs.\n\nAmir Locke, 22\n\nStudents walk out of school to demand justice for Amir Locke at Central High School in Saint Paul, Minnesota. MediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nWhen: February 2, 2022\n\nWhere: Minneapolis, Minnesota\n\nWhat happened: Minneapolis police were executing a no-knock search warrant linked to a homicide investigation in neighboring St. Paul, when a SWAT officer shot and killed Locke, who appeared to be asleep on a couch when officers came in. Locke wasn‚Äôt named in the warrant; Locke‚Äôs cousin was.\n\nCity officials didn‚Äôt release a lot of information in the days after an officer shot Locke, other than 14 seconds of video that they said showed Locke with the gun.\n\nThe video shows officers using a key to open the apartment‚Äôs door as officers shout, ‚ÄúPolice! Search warrant!‚Äù Other officers yelled, ‚ÄúHands! Hands! Hands!‚Äù and ‚ÄúGet on the f****ng ground!‚Äù as they approach Locke, who was sleeping on the couch and wrapped in blankets. One officer kicks the back of the couch, waking up Locke. He begins to sit up with his gun in his hand as three shots in the home can be heard by officers.\n\nThe outcomes: Mark Hanneman ‚Äì the Minneapolis SWAT officer responsible for the fatal shot ‚Äì was placed on administrative leave but returned to active duty on February 28. Last week, CNN reported prosecutors will not file any charges against Hanneman and any of the other officers involved in the shooting due to insufficient admissible evidence.\n\nFollowing Locke‚Äôs death, the Minneapolis mayor‚Äôs office announced the police department would be prohibited from executing no-knock search warrants starting April 8.\n\nDaunte Wright, 20\n\nDaunte Wright Family Photo/WCCO\n\nWhen: April 11, 2021\n\nWhere: Brooklyn Center, Minnesota\n\nWhat happened: The young father was pulled over by police for an expired tag and an illegal air freshener. During the stop, officers learned he had an outstanding warrant and attempted to arrest him, but Wright pulled away and tried to drive off.\n\nAs video of the incident shows, Officer Kim Potter yelled, ‚ÄúTaser‚Äù repeatedly before she shot Wright with her handgun. She then said, ‚ÄúHoly sh*t! I just shot him!‚Äù She added: ‚ÄúI grabbed the wrong f**king gun, and I shot him.‚Äù\n\nThe shooting led to days of unrest in suburban Brooklyn Center after a tumultuous year of coast-to-coast protests over police brutality and how officers interact with Black people.\n\nThe outcome: In December, Potter was found guilty of first and second-degree manslaughter in Wright‚Äôs death. CNN reported in February that she was sentenced to two years in prison, far less than the seven years and two months prosecutors requested.\n\nGeorge Floyd, 46\n\nGeorge Floyd Provided by Ben Crump\n\nWhen: May 25, 2020\n\nWhere: Minneapolis, Minnesota\n\nWhat happened: Minneapolis Police responded to a report of a ‚Äúforgery in progress‚Äù outside of a Cup Foods store where Floyd was accused of passing a counterfeit $20.\n\nOfficers approached Floyd‚Äôs car, yanked him from the vehicle, handcuffed him and began to struggle with him in front of a squad car. Video camera footage showed one officer ‚Äì in an effort to restrain Floyd ‚Äì knelt on his neck for over nine minutes. Floyd pleaded with officers to release him saying, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe,‚Äù and repeatedly calling out for his mother. After several minutes, he was unresponsive.\n\nThe outcomes: The Minnesota governor issued an executive order activating the national guard amidst the protests following Floyd‚Äôs death. Protests then spread nationwide in the summer of 2020 as #BlackLivesMatter resurged in popularity on social media.\n\nDerek Chauvin ‚Äì the officer who knelt on Floyd‚Äôs neck ‚Äì was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for killing Floyd. Chauvin faces 22 years in prison.\n\nIn February, three other officers were found guilty of violating Floyd‚Äôs civil rights. CNN reported Tuesday that they are set to stand trial in mid-June for their involvement in Floyd‚Äôs death. They have all pleaded not guilty.\n\nRonald Greene, 49\n\nRonald Greene Greene family attorney\n\nWhen: May 10, 2019\n\nWhere: Baton Rouge, Louisiana\n\nWhat happened: Louisiana State Police (LSP) engaged in a vehicle pursuit of Ronald Greene after attempting to pull him over for an unspecified traffic violation. LSP reported that the pursuit ended with Greene crashing his car into a tree.\n\nTwo years later, body camera footage of the incident was released that showed state troopers repeatedly tasing, beating and violently dragging Greene. The family has filed a lawsuit, accusing the agency of trying to cover up how Greene died. Greene‚Äôs family said they were initially told that he died in a car crash, but forensics examiners later eliminated the car crash as being a reason for his cause of death.\n\nThe autopsy, prepared by the Union Parish Coroner‚Äôs Office, states in its opinion section that lacerations of Greene‚Äôs head were ‚Äúinconsistent with motor vehicle collision injury and most consistent with multiple impacts from a blunt object.‚Äù\n\nWhat‚Äôs next: A special committee has been investigating Greene‚Äôs case since 2019. Last May, two of the state troopers involved in Greene‚Äôs death were reprimanded for their actions, specifically for violating body camera procedures.\n\nLast week, the local Louisiana district attorney with jurisdiction over the town where Greene died told state lawmakers he plans to convene a special grand jury and pursue criminal charges against the troopers involved in the Black motorist‚Äôs death.\n\nThere have been no arrests or indictments of any of the officers involved. Meanwhile, the former head of the LSP on Thursday failed to appear at an appeal hearing related to the case.\n\nBreonna Taylor, 26\n\nBreonna Taylor Courtesy Ben Crump\n\nWhen: March 13, 2020\n\nWhere: Louisville, Kentucky\n\nWhat happened: A Jefferson County circuit judge issued five search warrants in pursuit of Taylor‚Äôs ex-boyfriend, convicted of drug-related crimes.\n\nOne of those warrants was for Taylor‚Äôs apartment, and Louisville Metro Police Department executed it early on the morning on March 13. Police announced themselves and battered down the front door while Taylor and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were in bed. Thinking they were intruders, Walker fired one shot at officers with a gun he legally owned. Officers then responded with heavy fire, fatally shooting Taylor during the raid.\n\nThe outcomes: Protests erupted in Louisville shortly after Taylor‚Äôs death. The case started to gain more national attention following the murder of Floyd in Minneapolis. Her death ‚Äì along with Floyd‚Äôs ‚Äì sparked a racial reckoning in the US when demonstrators across the country demanded an end to discriminatory policing practices and inspired more conversations about police brutality against Black women.\n\nThe city of Louisville agreed to pay Taylor‚Äôs family a $12 million settlement for their wrongful death lawsuit, the highest settlement ever paid by the city, according to a spokeswoman from the Louisville mayor‚Äôs office.\n\nBrett Hankinson ‚Äì one of the officers involved in the raid ‚Äì was the only officer charged in connection with the shooting. He was acquitted on three counts of felony wanton endangerment in connection with the raid.\n\nDavid McAtee, 53\n\nDavid McAtee WestofNinth.com\n\nWhen: June 1, 2020\n\nWhere: Louisville, Kentucky\n\nWhat happened: During a protest following the death of Taylor and Floyd, Louisville police and the Kentucky National Guard were sent to disperse a large crowd of demonstrators around midnight in front of a BBQ stand McAtee owned. Officers began firing pepper balls into the crowd, one of which hit McAtee‚Äôs niece, McAtee‚Äôs nephew told CNN affiliate WAVE. Louisville Police released a video where McAtee appears to grab his niece and fire shots at officers. Louisville Police and the National Guard then took cover and fired back, killing McAtee, according to the former police chief.\n\nThe outcomes: One former police officer has been indicted for unreasonable force against an individual during the protest that lead to McAtee‚Äôs death. McAtee‚Äôs family also filed a wrongful death lawsuit against 10 LMPD officers and 10 members of the Kentucky National Guard, accusing them of assault and battery, excessive use of force and negligence among other charges.\n\nAtatiana Jefferson, 28\n\nAtatiana Jefferson Family Photo\n\nWhen: October 12, 2019\n\nWhere: Fort Worth, Texas\n\nWhat happened: Overnight on October 12, Fort Worth officers responded to a call from a concerned neighbor who noticed the front door was left open at Jefferson‚Äôs home.\n\nJefferson was babysitting her nephew for her sister, who was recovering from heart surgery, when two Fort Worth police officers arrived at the home without knocking. Police reports say Jefferson heard a noise outside, approached the window and pulled out her gun.

Here's what an ...", "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. ‚Äî A detailed investigative report written more than a month after Louisville Metro Police fatally shot Breonna Taylor in her apartment on March 13 provides the first comprehensive look at the narcotics case that brought officers to her door.\n\nThough police recovered no drugs or cash from the 26-year-old emergency room technician's apartment in Louisville's South End, the May 1 police report shows how officers linked Taylor to a narcotics investigation centered 10 miles away ‚Äì largely through evidence that has since been challenged.\n\nWhy police targeted Taylor's apartment for a \"no knock\" search warrant after midnight has been a key question in the case since her shooting became a national rallying cry for racial justice in May.\n\nAfter police used a battering ram to break open Taylor's front door, her boyfriend Kenneth Walker fired a single shot, which police said struck Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly in the femoral artery.\n\nMattingly, along with Detective Myles Cosgrove and now-fired Detective Brett Hankison, returned fire, killing Taylor. An attorney for Walker said Tuesday that a fellow officer more likely shot Mattingly than Walker.\n\nKenneth Walker:Lawyer for Breonna Taylor's boyfriend sues police, says he didn't shoot officer\n\n100 days of protests:Looking back at moments that have shaped the Breonna Taylor movement\n\nPolice had search warrant for Taylor's address\n\nMisinformation shared on social media suggested the officers showed up at the wrong house, but police had a search warrant signed by Circuit Judge Mary Shaw for Taylor's address and for her.\n\nThe eight-page LMPD report reinforces, however, that Taylor was not the main target of the narcotics investigation, which initially centered around other individuals accused of selling drugs.\n\nThe report's author was Detective Joshua Jaynes, who secured the March 12 warrant for Taylor's home and four suspected drug houses.\n\nThe report also shows that LMPD's new Place-Based Investigations Squad spent about 2¬Ω months conducting heavy surveillance.\n\nTaylor was linked to the suspects in that investigation, according to the report, because a car registered in her name stopped in early January at one of the properties being watched.\n\nMoreover, it states that Jamarcus Glover, a convicted drug dealer and Taylor's former boyfriend, picked up a package at her home Jan. 16 while police were watching him.\n\nThe report further says:\n\nIt was Mattingly, the officer who was shot at Taylor's apartment, who asked the postal service whether Glover was receiving packages at Taylor's apartment. Jaynes wrote in a March 12 sworn affidavit for a search warrant that he had verified that Glover was receiving packages at Taylor's home through a postal inspector (a Louisville postal inspector later told WDRB news that wasn't true).\n\nGlover listed Taylor's home as his address on a Chase bank account, and a search warrant for the account was executed on March 19, six days after her death.\n\ndays after her death. Glover listed Taylor's phone number as his when he filed a complaint against a police officer in February for towing his red Dodge Charger for a parking violation.\n\nJaynes is on administrative reassignment pending an investigation of \"how and why the search warrant was approved,\" interim Police Chief Robert Schroeder said in June.\n\nThe May 1 report was co-signed by Detective Kelly Goodlett, another Place-Based Investigations officer who also authored a controversial 39-page LMPD report written after Taylor's death that detailed her ties with Glover, the main suspect in the narcotics case.\n\nGlover told The Louisville Courier Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, in an Aug. 26 interview that Taylor had nothing to do with illicit drugs. He also denied that Taylor had been holding money for him, despite telling a caller that she was during a taped phone conversation March 13 at Metro Corrections.\n\nPolice suspected, according to the May report written by Jaynes, that Glover \"may be keeping narcotics and/or proceeds from the sale of narcotics at (Taylor's apartment) for safekeeping.\"\n\nA property seizure log completed after searching Taylor's apartment following the shooting listed no drugs or money.\n\nThe report also reflects that the investigation into suspected narcotics trafficking continued beyond the execution of search warrants and Taylor's death on March 13.\n\nUncut and unedited:Livestreamers have become a key cog in the Louisville protests\n\nInterest in 'epicenter' of drugs\n\nThe Place-Based Investigations Squad, a unit created in late December 2019 to focus on small areas \"ridden with violent crime,\" turned its attention first to an area between South 26th Street and West Broadway, including Elliott Avenue, according to Jaynes.\n\nDetectives gathered calls for service, incident reports and drug crime tips, learning that First Division officers had conducted narcotics searches in December 2019 on three residences.\n\nOfficer Charles Heller wrote in three Dec. 30 search warrant affidavits that a confidential informant had reported people selling crack cocaine from 2424 Elliott Ave. in the past 48 hours, and the driver of a vehicle stopped by police had reported people were also using 2605 W. Muhammad Ali Blvd. for the drug sales.\n\nThe warrants gave police authority to search Glover, along with Dominique Crenshaw, De'Marius Bowman and Cleve Knight.\n\nA judge whose signature isn't legible signed all three warrants and authorized police's \"no knock\" request.\n\nHeller wrote that it was important the warrants be \"no knock\" search warrants because \"it is common for drug traffickers to protect their drugs with guns\" and that the criminal history of known associates created a \"particularly dangerous situation.\"\n\n\"It was determined,\" Jaynes wrote, \"that the epicenter of the narcotics trafficking in the area was 2424 Elliott Ave.\"\n\nBreonna's Law:Rep. Attica Scott proposes banning no-knock search warrants across Kentucky\n\nFollowing that decision, officers kicked off weeks of surveillance: Installing a police camera, following vehicles and conducting pedestrian and traffic stops.\n\nIn the weeks before the search warrants were executed March 13, a confidential informant working with police went to Elliott Avenue and confirmed narcotics were being sold there, according to the investigative summary from Jaynes.\n\nWhy was Breonna Taylor part of the investigation?\n\nTaylor isn't referenced much in the report, but here's what police do say:\n\nOn Jan. 2, a pole camera installed at South 24th Street and Elliott Avenue captured footage of a white Chevrolet Impala registered to Taylor pull up in front of 2424 Elliott Ave. The camera footage showed Glover exiting from the passenger side.\n\nA red Dodge Charger that police say was used by both Glover and Adrian Walker, a co-defendant, made \"frequent trips\" between Elliott Avenue and Springfield Drive, where Taylor lived, according to \"physical and electronic surveillance,\" Jaynes wrote.\n\nOn Jan. 16, Glover was photographed by police entering Taylor's apartment and left with a \"suspected USPS package.\" He then drove to 2605 W. Muhammad Ali Blvd., which Jaynes described in the search warrant affidavit as a \"known drug house.\"\n\nGlover has since disputed some of that surveillance evidence.\n\nHe told The Courier Journal in an Aug. 26 interview he'd worried about deliveries to his house being stolen, and Taylor had agreed to have the items sent to her apartment instead.\n\n\"Nothing even been illegal there,\" he said. \"Getting shoes and clothes coming through the mail is not illegal. Nothing illegal at all.\"\n\nGlover also noted that LMPD had a surveillance camera outside of 2424 Elliott Ave., so he said police knew Taylor wasn't doing anything illegal when she came over.\n\n\"We're literally standing outside,\" Glover said. \"They had their camera. ‚Ä¶ They seen everything. No illegal activity. A hug is not illegal. ‚Ä¶ She's not bringing me no boxes, she's not bringing nothing.\"\n\nThe leaked LMPD report detailing the links between Taylor and Glover referenced recorded jail calls, including one made hours after her fatal police shooting, in which Glover tells his girlfriend Kiera Bradley that Taylor was holding $8,000 for him and she had been \"handling all my money.\"\n\nBradley told The Courier Journal in an Aug. 31 interview that she thought their heated conversation prompted Glover to say that.\n\n\"I think he was just saying that because he had a bond. I'm like, 'Where is your money?' I was upset. You can look at the calls, I was talking about my daughter. ... You know, it was an argument. I think that he was just like, she had all my money because he had a bond,\" Bradley said.\n\nNo evidence of Taylor holding money for Glover is included in Jaynes' May report, but it notes that a search warrant on Glover's Chase bank account, approved by a judge six days after Taylor's death, shows that Glover listed his residence as Taylor's apartment on Springfield Drive, Jaynes wrote.\n\n(The criminal discovery file for Glover's pending case includes a Chase Bank record obtained by police, apparently through a Feb. 6 grand jury subpoena, that lists Glover's address as Taylor's apartment on Springfield Drive.)\n\nRecords reviewed by The Courier Journal show police also had signed search warrants for phone numbers connected to Glover that would have allowed them to review information on calls and locations.\n\nBackground:Breonna Taylor was briefly alive after police shot her. But no one tried to treat her\n\nThe March 12 search warrant affidavits and May 1 report don't list any evidence obtained from that effort.\n\nHowever, one of the phone numbers tracked, documents show, was Taylor's.\n\nPolice sought a search warrant for her phone number Feb. 17, after Glover \"attempted to file a complaint\" three days earlier against an officer who had towed his Dodge Charger for a parking violation, Jaynes wrote. Glover provided a phone number registered to Taylor.\n\nThe warrant, signed and sealed Feb. 17 by Jefferson Circuit Judge Charles Cunningham, allowed police to access all text messages, call details, cell tower locations and detailed subscriber information \"that will be valuable to the investigation\" for a 30-day period.\n\nJaynes wrote that he \"has received information that Breonna Taylor may be the suspected girlfriend of Jamarcus Glover\" and \"it is not uncommon for drug traffickers to use phone numbers under different names to avoid detection from law enforcement.\"\n\nJaynes added the \"phone ping\" would allow police to look into Glover's \"criminal enterprise\" and potentially find \"other locations that will help the investigation\" because police had \"exhausted conventional means of surveillance.\"\n\nNothing indicates when police executed that warrant.\n\nOn Feb. 21, four days after obtaining the first warrant, Jaynes got an additional sealed search warrant for a Cingular Wireless phone number police believed belonged to Glover. That warrant also doesn't note when it was executed.\n\nThe discovery file for Glover's pending criminal case additionally includes a background check of Taylor dated May 18, more than two months after her death.\n\nWhat happened after Breonna Taylor's shooting?\n\nAfter March 13, detectives watched pedestrian and vehicle traffic through the pole camera at Elliott Avenue, which they said indicated narcotics trafficking continued.\n\n\"Although the traffic isn't as heavy as it was before, it is apparent that these individuals are still selling narcotics from this location,\" Jaynes wrote.\n\nOver the next few weeks, detectives conducted at least three traffic stops on vehicles leaving the Elliott Avenue home ‚Äì once for failing to wear seat belts and another for an improper turn ‚Äì and found drugs in the vehicles.\n\nOne of those traffic stops prompted Goodlett to write an April 8 note to the city‚Äôs public nuisance and Metro 311 email accounts, documenting the property‚Äôs latest infraction ‚Äì it's ‚Äústrike 3.\"\n\nCity documents show that Goodlett and the Place-Based Initiative officers had worked closely with city Codes and Regulations Department personnel for months to keep tabs on the Elliott Avenue house.\n\nOn Jan. 22, the property owner, Law Mar Inc. and Gerald Happle, received its first notice of criminal activity \"constituting a public nuisance.\"\n\nOn March 17, following the March 13 warrants, the property was formally deemed a public nuisance.\n\nRead this:What to know about the investigations into the police shooting of Breonna Taylor\n\nHapple called the next day to ask about donating the house.\n\nThe city gave Happle an order to vacate the home on April 13. By then, Happle already had given his renters notice to leave the home and signed an application to donate the house to the city.\n\nOn April 22, detectives executed another \"no knock\" search warrant on 2424 Elliott Ave. ‚Äì the third in five months.\n\nPolice found crack cocaine, suspected ecstasy or MDMA, marijuana and other drug paraphernalia, Jaynes wrote.\n\nThe same day, with the aid of the city's Codes and Regulations Department, police cleared and boarded up 2424 Elliott Ave.\n\nOn June 5 ‚Äì what would have been Taylor's 27th birthday ‚Äì Happle signed over the deed on the house.

He was arrested shortly before noon Thursday, about 15 hours after he talked with The Courier Journal, on an outstanding warrant.\n\nHis remarks came the day after The Courier Journal published a story on an internal police report written after Taylor's death that detailed the ties between her and Glover, including recorded phone calls Glover made from jail and police surveillance of Glover's car at Taylor's home.\n\nThe Courier Journal independently verified and reviewed the recorded jail phone calls, including a call on the day Taylor was fatally shot by police. In that call, Glover said Taylor was holding $8,000 for him and that she had been ‚Äúhandling all my money.‚Äù\n\nNeither money nor drugs were found at her apartment. Glover denied Wednesday night that Taylor had been holding money for him.\n\nEarlier:Report details why police decided to forcibly search Taylor's home\n\nMysterious packages at Taylor's apartment\n\nIn the March 12 affidavit requesting search warrants for Taylor's apartment and the house where Glover was allegedly selling drugs, LMPD Detective Joshua Jaynes wrote that Glover was seen leaving Taylor's apartment in January with a \"suspected USPS package in his right hand\" and then drove to a \"known drug house\" on Muhammad Ali Boulevard.\n\nJaynes wrote in the affidavit that he verified \"through a US Postal Inspector\" that Glover had been receiving packages at Taylor's address.\n\nA U.S. postal inspector in Louisville, however, has said police did not use his office to verify that Glover was receiving packages at Taylor's apartment. A different agency had asked in January to look into whether Taylor's home was receiving suspicious mail, the inspector told WDRB News, and the post office concluded it wasn't.\n\nLMPD interim Chief Robert Schroeder placed Jaynes on administrative reassignment in June until questions about the warrants can be answered.\n\nGlover said Wednesday there was nothing suspicious about that package or any other that he had sent to Taylor's home. He said he worried about deliveries to his house being stolen, and Taylor had agreed those items could be sent to her apartment instead.\n\n\"Nothing ever been illegal there,\" he said. \"Getting shoes and clothes coming through the mail is not illegal. Nothing illegal at all.\"\n\nTaylor is mentioned only one other time in the search warrant affidavit, when police say a vehicle belonging to her was seen outside Glover's alleged drug house in the Russell neighborhood.\n\nThe warrant application also says Glover listed her address as his, and that police confirmed that with \"multiple computer databases.\"\n\nFact check:Debunking 8 widely shared rumors in the Breonna Taylor shooting\n\nEarly morning forced entry leads to Taylor's death\n\nGlover was arrested the same night as Taylor‚Äôs death, which has become a national rallying cry against police brutality.\n\nLawyers for Taylor‚Äôs family have argued that police knew where Glover was and therefore had no need to bust down Taylor‚Äôs door just after 12:40 a.m. Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired a shot when the officers burst in, saying later he thought they were intruders.\n\nThree officers returned fire, striking Taylor five times and killing her in her hallway. The 26-year-old Black emergency room technician wasn't armed.\n\nProtesters have been in the streets for nearly 100 straight days, calling for Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron to prosecute Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly, Detective Myles Cosgrove and former Detective Brett Hankison for their roles in the shooting.\n\nHankison was terminated for firing indiscriminately into the apartment and adjoining units. Mattingly and Cosgrove are on administrative reassignment.\n\nLawyers representing Taylor's family have alleged in court records that her shooting is tied to a Louisville police department operation to clear out a block in western Louisville that was part of a major redevelopment effort.\n\nThey point to a new police squad ‚Äî the Place-Based Investigations unit ‚Äî as the engine behind the case, claiming Taylor was caught up in an investigation that was less about a drug house and more about speeding up the city's multimillion-dollar \"Vision Russell\" development plan.\n\nCity officials have dismissed that claim, arguing that the newly formed unit is a tool to fight violent crime at troublesome locations.\n\nBut records show that the unit‚Äôs officers repeatedly pursued Glover and his associates with search warrants and traffic stops.\n\nRelated:'Rogue' unit or targeted initiative? Why LMPD's new squad is causing a stir\n\nGlover says police cared about location\n\nGlover, a Mississippi native, said he once sold drugs to make ends meet, but on Wednesday, he denied being a current narcotics trafficker.\n\n\"I have been, but that's my past,\" he said. \"I'm not a part of it no more.\"\n\nCourt records indicate he has been arrested on drug charges three times since December 2019.\n\nGlover, a convicted felon, has been accumulating drug-related arrests since 2008, when he was sentenced to prison for selling cocaine in Montgomery County, Mississippi.\n\nKentucky court records show arrests dating to 2014 in multiple counties. He pleaded guilty to first-degree possession of a controlled substance in Warren County in 2015 and was sentenced to a year in jail, for instance.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to cocaine possession in Jefferson County and served 10 days in jail after a 2016 arrest, according to court records. He is facing multiple trafficking charges in Jefferson County and a drunken driving charge in Hardin County.\n\n\"I'm taking everything to trial, and I'm going to put everything on the line because (police) foul,\" Glover said. \"They got every excuse of why they done what they done, but none justifies murder. You can't justify it when (Breonna's) innocent.\"\n\nGlover said he was aware police were watching him once he returned to Kentucky in September 2019, and that detectives repeatedly pressured him about leaving the Elliott Avenue home months before the March 13 raid.\n\nWhen a homicide took place on the street last year, for instance, Glover said he provided detectives with information showing he wasn't in the area at the time. He said an officer told him any narcotics investigators would \"get up off\" his back if he left the neighborhood.\n\n\"They literally told me I needed to move,\" Glover said. \"They never said why they wanted me to move, but they told me I needed to move my activity elsewhere.\"\n\nThe new Place-Based Investigations Squad focused on a ‚Äúmicro-location‚Äù encompassing a few blocks of Elliott Avenue, as well as 26th Street and West Broadway, according to police.\n\nOfficials said it was selected because of high levels of violent crime and calls for service, calling it an added plus that Develop Louisville, the city‚Äôs real estate and community development agency, was working in the neighborhood with vacant and abandoned properties.\n\nBy late 2019, the Place-Based Investigations Squad had ‚Äúidentified multiple individuals suspected of dealing drugs out of one or more homes,‚Äù according to a timeline from the city.\n\nA code enforcement officer spoke to owner of the home at 2424 Elliot Ave., where Glover lived, on Feb. 17 and informed all five police officers in the investigative unit that the owner would ‚Äúdonate the property to Metro after evicting the tenant‚Äù if any further illegal activity occurred.\n\nFollowing the March 13 search at the Elliott Avenue home, conducted just minutes before officers broke down Taylor‚Äôs door, the city informed the owner the property had been deemed a public nuisance.\n\nOn June 5 ‚Äî what would have been Taylor‚Äôs 27th birthday ‚Äî the owner signed over the deed to the home to the city for $1.\n\nLMPD chief:Breonna Taylor raid was not attempt to take control of property\n\nGlover says Taylor was 'somebody I cared about'\n\nThe undated 39-page police report prepared after Taylor's death outlines calls Glover made while in custody.\n\nIn several recorded calls from Metro Corrections, Glover is heard either talking to or mentioning Taylor by name. During a March 13 call, for instance, he tells a girlfriend that Taylor was holding $8,000 for him and had been \"handling all my money.\"\n\nGlover said at one point, according to the recording, how he could \"walk in (Bre's) house and go directly to whatever it is no problem with it.\"\n\nNo money was found at Taylor's apartment after the March 13 raid, according to a property seizure log filled out by police.\n\nAsked about the calls Wednesday, Glover vehemently denied that he told the woman on the phone how he left any money at Taylor's apartment, even though the call was recorded.\n\n\"I don't care what they put on the media, I never said it was some money in Breonna's house on that phone,\" he said.\n\n\"My baby mama kept running her mouth and I'm on there saying, 'yeah' or 'nah' or (expletive) like that but I'm not on that (expletive) talking like that. ‚Ä¶ It wasn't no whole lot of me sitting there talking about nothing in Breonna's house.\"\n\nGlover said that on March 13, he had just come home when minutes later police raided his house at Elliott Avenue. He said learned Taylor had died while he was handcuffed outside after overhearing officers and 911 dispatchers screaming that gunshots had been fired at her apartment address.\n\nHe said he was confused about why police were at Taylor's residence, since she had no drugs or money at the apartment. When he asked officers why they were there, the police told him they didn't care about her shooting because \"the female dead anyway,\" he said.\n\nSee also:McConnell says he hasn't discussed the Taylor case with AG Cameron\n\nGlover told a similar story to someone in a jail call recorded March 13, after Taylor's death, explaining that he ‚Äúwas listening to the police ‚Äî they had the radio.‚Äù\n\nIn the call, he described that officers kicked in the door and were fired on. He didn't name Walker, Taylor's boyfriend, but said that ‚ÄúBre was in the hallway and (expletive) he ain‚Äôt even in front of her. (Expletive) she took all the bullets.\"\n\nIt‚Äôs not clear from the transcript whether Glover heard that on the police radio. Walker and Glover were in Metro Corrections at the same time.\n\nIn a recorded jail call March 13, Glover told a woman on the phone that he and Taylor ‚Äúain‚Äôt been around each other in over two months ‚Äî damn near two months.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI can literally show messages, though. Like, I ain‚Äôt have nothing going on with Bre no more,‚Äù he said.\n\nIn a different phone call on the same day, Glover said he was upset because ‚Äúat the end of the day, I know she didn‚Äôt ‚Äî she didn‚Äôt do nothing to deserve none of this (expletive) though.‚Äù\n\nIn another call, Glover said, ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt have no business looking for me at no Bre house.‚Äù\n\nThe undated Louisville police report leaked to The Courier Journal references a Jan. 3 jailhouse call in which Glover mentioned wanting to rest in Taylor's bed.\n\nGlover said in the interview Wednesday how he and Taylor dated for about 2¬Ω years before breaking up in 2018. He said they kept in contact mostly through text messages and social media.\n\nSince the shooting, Glover has regularly mentioned Taylor in Facebook posts on her birthday or other anniversaries. He described her as his best friend in a June 29 post, and in a Wednesday message he posted a picture of the two.\n\n\"I ain't folding on (this) s---,\" Glover said on the message. \"I never brought no drug around you or have you involved in nothing illegal.\"\n\nGlover said Taylor did not respond to his flirtatious suggestion in the jailhouse call but mentioned how she was stressed whenever Glover was around. She said she was \"always worried about\" him.\n\n\"At the end of the day this is somebody I cared about,\" Glover said in Wednesday's interview. \"This ain't somebody you can just brush it off that she's gone.\"\n\nReach Phillip M.

So again, my boy went to work in the bedroom with his guitar and the camera.

But the \"Soul Patrol\" proved a mighty engine and Hicks successfully parlayed his win into a platinum-selling self-titled debut album in 2006, a Broadway stint and tour (playing the Teen Angel in \"Grease\") and a modest residency in Las Vegas. ‚Äì Ruggieri\n\n15. Kris Allen (2009)\n\nSome were shocked when the innocuous Allen triumphed over the bold flamboyance of Adam Lambert during Season 8 of ‚ÄúIdol‚Äù ‚Äì not that it hindered Lambert‚Äôs future. But more than Allen‚Äôs couple of hits (‚ÄúNo Boundaries,‚Äù ‚ÄúLive Like We‚Äôre Dying‚Äù), his win ushered in the era of nondescript male singer-songwriters armed with guitars and crooked grins. ‚Äì Ruggieri\n\n14. Trent Harmon (2016)\n\nHarmon‚Äôs boyish face and soft-spoken demeanor masked a deceptively brawny set of pipes, which were put to best use on an enchanting cover of Sia‚Äôs ‚ÄúChandelier.‚Äù Harmon signed to Big Machine Records (Taylor Swift's former label) post-\"Idol,\" finding minor success on the country charts with singles \"Falling\" and \"There's a Girl.\" ‚Äì Ryan\n\n13. Just Sam (2020)\n\nA former subway busker, New York-bred Samantha Diaz stormed the (virtual) ‚ÄúIdol‚Äù stage with her unfiltered persona and pure singing talent. Her pandemic-season performance of Kelly Clarkson‚Äôs ‚ÄúStronger (What Doesn‚Äôt Kill You),\" as well as a stunning duet with Lauren Daigle on ‚ÄúYou Say‚Äù solidified her deserved victory. The realities of the record business derailed her post-show album release, but she‚Äôs recently independently released the songs ‚ÄúAfricando‚Äù and ‚ÄúChange.‚Äù ‚Äì Ruggieri\n\n12. Caleb Johnson (2014)\n\nJohnson was the typically staid competition‚Äôs closest answer to Whitesnake and AC/DC, with squalling vocals and head-banging dynamism that have made him a hit with the legacy rock crowd in the years since his victory, touring with Meat Loaf's Neverland Express and Trans-Siberian Orchestra. ‚Äì Ryan\n\n11. Iam Tongi (2023)\n\nThe Hawaiian-born 18-year-old captured hearts starting with his tear-inducing audition with James Blunt‚Äôs ‚ÄúMonsters,‚Äù which Tongi dedicated to his late father. His combination of a mellifluous voice and gentle, upbeat demeanor proved irresistible, but there is also no denying Tongi‚Äôs soul. His new single, the acoustic ballad ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Be Seeing You,‚Äù is a touching, honest debut. ‚Äì Ruggieri\n\n10. Phillip Phillips (2012)\n\nA soft-spoken guitar strummer who in his pre-‚ÄúIdol‚Äù life worked at his family‚Äôs pawn shop in Leesburg, Georgia, Phillips earned a significant bona fide: His coronation song, the Dave Matthews Band-esque ‚ÄúHome,‚Äù is the bestselling single in the show‚Äôs history, with more than 5 million sold. A spate of other hits (‚ÄúRaging Fire,‚Äù ‚ÄúGone, Gone, Gone‚Äù) preserved his momentum, and last month Phillips returned to the ‚ÄúIdol‚Äù stage for his 10th anniversary to play his new release, ‚ÄúLove Like That.‚Äù ‚Äì Ruggieri\n\n9. Maddie Poppe (2018)\n\nIn a competition that favors blue-eyed crooners and power belters, Poppe was a refreshingly sophisticated pick: a raspy-voiced folk artist who could make you smile singing Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Jungle Book‚Äù just as easily as she could rip your heart out with a Beach Boys cover. She‚Äôs one of the few recent ‚ÄúIdol‚Äù victors who you could legitimately call a ‚Äúsingular talent.‚Äù ‚Äì Ryan\n\n8. Scotty McCreery (2011)\n\nThe resident male country star to graduate from the ‚ÄúIdol‚Äù laboratory ‚Äì like Season 6 winner Jordin Sparks, at only 17 ‚Äì the North Carolina native with a molasses-hued voice that belies his unassuming demeanor remains a prominent chart presence a decade after his Season 10 win. ‚ÄúFive More Minutes,‚Äù ‚ÄúThis Is It‚Äù and ‚ÄúIn Between‚Äù are among his recent country chart-toppers, while ‚ÄúSame Truck,‚Äù his fifth studio album released last year, spawned the George Strait tribute tune, ‚ÄúDamn Strait.‚Äù ‚Äì Ruggieri\n\n7. Candice Glover (2013)\n\nWhether she was covering Ben E. King, Aretha Franklin, or The Cure (on tearful standout ‚ÄúLovesong‚Äù), the Beaufort, South Carolina, native brought unmatched vulnerability and powerhouse vocals to every single performance. Her recording career post-‚ÄúIdol,‚Äù too, is filled with stirring ballads that have been sadly ignored by radio. ‚Äì Ryan\n\n6. David Cook (2008)\n\nWith his pleasantly raspy voice and a knack for melody and unearthing lesser-known versions of hits to cover on the show (e.g., Whitesnake's \"Day Tripper,\" Chris Cornell's \"Billie Jean\"), the Season 7 winner ‚Äì over angelic David Archuleta ‚Äì skyrocketed to success. His victory song, the inspirational pop-rock anthem ‚ÄúThe Time of My Life,‚Äù and its follow-up, ‚ÄúLight On,‚Äù each sold more than a million copies and showcased his musical worldview (Collective Soul, Foo Fighters and the Goo Goo Dolls counted among his inspirations). In 2021, Cook‚Äôs music delved into his struggle with anxiety on the independently released EP, ‚ÄúThe Looking Glass.‚Äù ‚Äì Ruggieri\n\n5. Ruben Studdard (2003)\n\nStuddard‚Äôs smooth, velvety vocals were the perfect complement to runner-up Clay Aiken‚Äôs earnest pop theatrics, with standout performances of Stevie Wonder and Dionne Warwick classics, and a respectable career as a gospel/R&B hitmaker in years to follow. ‚Äì Ryan\n\n4. Jordin Sparks (2007)\n\nThe show‚Äôs youngest winner at 17 (by two months compared to McCreery), the sweet-smiling Sparks found immediate success a few months after her victory with a pair of Billboard top 10 hits: ‚ÄúTattoo‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo Air,‚Äù her duet with a pre-scandal Chris Brown. Broadway (‚ÄúIn the Heights‚Äù) and film (‚ÄúSparkle‚Äù) expanded Sparks‚Äô reach, but in recent years she‚Äôs concentrated more on motherhood with a few career moves ‚Äì the 2020 holiday album ‚ÄúCider & Hennessey,‚Äù her 2021 participation in ‚ÄúThe Masked Dancer‚Äù ‚Äì sprinkled in. ‚Äì Ruggieri\n\n3. Fantasia Barrino (2004)\n\nBarrino‚Äôs sultry, soulful rendition of George Gershwin‚Äôs ‚ÄúSummertime‚Äù might be the all-time greatest performance to ever hit the ‚ÄúIdol‚Äù stage. The R&B artist‚Äôs elastic vocals and deep well of emotion will continue to serve her well, as she reprises her role as Celie from the Broadway musical ‚ÄúThe Color Purple‚Äù for next year‚Äôs star-studded movie adaptation. ‚Äì Ryan\n\n2. Carrie Underwood (2005)\n\nIt feels like 100 lifetimes ago that a pouffy-haired Underwood blasted us off our couches with her rendition of Heart‚Äôs ‚ÄúAlone‚Äù during her Season 4 run to the top. And remember her small-town country-girl proclamation that she‚Äôd never been on an airplane prior to her ‚ÄúIdol‚Äù audition? Six massive headlining tours, an aerial-filled Las Vegas residency, a lot of leg bronzer and 65 million-plus album sales later (she‚Äôs the top-selling artist in the ‚ÄúIdol‚Äù franchise), Underwood has earned a few frequent flier rewards. ‚Äì Ruggieri\n\n1. Kelly Clarkson (2002)\n\nThere‚Äôs a reason Clarkson goes viral every other week with her adventurous and breathtaking ‚ÄúKellyoke‚Äù covers on the daytime talk show ‚ÄúThe Kelly Clarkson Show.‚Äù The Texas native is so effortlessly charming and in control of her instrument, with an outsized personality and even larger voice that bring all the ferocity and drama you want from a top 40 hit (of which she has nearly two dozen). Frankly, our lives would suck without Clarkson, who is the brightest star ‚ÄúIdol‚Äù has and will likely ever produce. ‚Äì Ryan\n\nMore news on your favorite Idols:\n\n'American Idol' shocker:Iam Tongi beats country crooners to win Season 21 in tense finale\n\nJennifer Hudson:The 'Idol' star on her biggest talk-show challenges, and how she 'Jennifer-ized' the 'Ellen' set\n\n'We're going to work it out':Kelly Clarkson gets candid about how her kids cope with her divorce\n\nCarrie Underwood:Idol star shares the 'super-selfish' moment in her new 'Denim & Rhinestones' tour\n\nSurprise!King Charles, Camilla crash Katy Perry, Lionel Richie message from Windsor", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2021/02/21/american-idol-esteros-casey-bishop-wows-luke-bryan-judges-sunday-audition-national-tv/6769540002/", "title": "American Idol: Estero's Casey Bishop wows Luke Bryan at Sunday ...", "text": "Luke Bryan‚Äôs calling it already.

I‚Äôm kinda intimidated.\n\n‚ÄúThe only places I sing are literally my bathroom. I put my song on, pick up my brush and then I just go for it, like in the mirror.

And ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äôs‚Äù judges predict great things for her future.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna enjoy watching you grow,‚Äù Richie said. ‚ÄúRight here in front of us. ‚Ä¶ The sky is the limit.‚Äù\n\nRelated coverage:Did Ben Allen make it to 'The Voice' finale?\n\nPerry ‚Äî a longtime idol of Bishop‚Äôs ‚Äî felt the same way.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really, really, really good,‚Äù Perry said. ‚ÄúAnd I love that nobody knows that you can sing besides you and couple of your friends and your hairbrush, probably.

He takes over the starting position following Perry Fisher, who is now at Maryland and was an All-Big Bend first-team offense selection. Fryar did play in all, but one game for Lincoln and leaned heavily on his running backs. Early on in the preseason, Fryar has immensely improved on his passing game and is throwing with speed and precision. Trojans head coach Jimmie Tyson has spoken about how impressed he is on the quarterback's improvement over the summer. In a program like Lincoln, that has a lot of eye on it from colleges, expect Fryar to see his recruitment rise big time. ‚Äî Jack Williams, Tallahassee Democrat\n\nBradenton-Sarasota\n\nMaddox Marchbank, Sarasota\n\nMarchbank is one of the area's most versatile players. The 6-foot-3, 270 pounder can play guard, defensive tackle and is the long snapper for the Sailors. Offered by Seton Hill University, Marchbank had seven sacks and 55 tackles (22 for a loss) last year on the defensive line. Sailors coach Brody Wiseman said, \"We see him as a collegiate talent on either side of the ball depending on the need of the teams recruiting him.\" Additionally, Marchbank is a Khol's 4-star rated long snapper. At the camp he displayed \"solid mechanics and scored on 9 of his 12 long snaps with an average snap time of .77 seconds,\" according to coaches there. ‚Äî Dennis Maffezzoli, Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nDaytona Beach\n\nAshton Bracewell, Flagler Palm Coast\n\nFlagler Palm Coast's senior linebacker ticks a lot of physical boxes ‚Äî he's 6-foot-4, 215 pounds and athletic in coverage as a converted safety. Bracewell had a hand in 55 tackles last season, adding three sacks, three pass breakups, two forced fumbles and an interception. He collected five verbal offers in the spring ‚Äî Akron, Eastern Kentucky, Florida Atlantic, Navy and Toledo. A fast start could increase his Division I opportunities, and improve his standing on the recruiting boards of those respective schools. ‚Äî Chris Boyle, Daytona Beach News-Journal\n\nFort Lauderdale\n\nKamari Moulton, Cardinal Gibbons\n\nThe Chiefs senior is very underrated. A legitimate 5-foot-11 190-pound balanced running back with speed and strength and only one Power 5 offer. But overcoming obstacles is nothing new to this young man. Kamari lost his mother to COVID-19 in the beginning the 2021 playoff run that ended with him powering an explosive Cardinal Gibbons offense to another state championship. He‚Äôs coming off a junior season with 1,075 rushing yards and 18 touchdowns, which earned him all-state honors. A huge senior campaign could result in Moulton grabbing his third state championship ring and finding himself a home at power 5 school. ‚Äî Quinten Lambert, Special to the USA Today Network\n\nFort Myers\n\nSpencer Yeager, Fort Myers\n\nThe 6-foot-2, 180-pound linebacker is a critical player coming back for Sam Sirianni Jr.'s defense. He led the team with 90 tackles last year along with a sack, two interceptions, and a fumble recovery. With the Green Wave looking to bounce back from a 5-4 season below their standards, Yeager could be a player who will get looks. And with the Greenies facing off against North Fort Myers, St. Thomas Aquinas and Dunbar in three of their first four games, Yeager will be facing off against some elite talent early on in the season. ‚Äî Dustin Levy, Fort Myers News-Press\n\nGainesville\n\nTyler Jefferson, Lake City Columbia\n\nAfter leading Hawthorne to the Class 1A state title game in 2021, Tyler Jefferson elected to reunite with Demetric Jackson at Lake City Columbia for his senior campaign. Jefferson played under Jackson at Fort White in his freshman and sophomore seasons, before Jackson took the head coaching job at Columbia. In terms of recruiting, Jefferson committed to Central Michigan after fielding offers from Florida Atlantic, Florida State, Kentucky and Maryland, among others. However, with the keys to the electric Columbia offense in his hands, don't be surprised if more Power 5 offers come rolling in for Jefferson. ‚Äî Ainslie Lee, The Gainesville Sun\n\nJacksonville\n\nDesirrio Riles, University Christian\n\nAt UC, they call him \"Oo,\" and this year, the 225-pound QB-turned-linebacker could be leaving opponents saying \"Ow.\" A three-year starter at quarterback for UC, Riles has bulked up significantly and intends to play this year in an all-purpose athlete role, primarily linebacker on defense and tight end on offense. Even while lining up at QB as a junior, he contributed on defense with 31 tackles, and now that he's dedicating more time to the defensive side of the ball, look for recruiters to take notice. Michigan and Boston College are among his offers since the start of spring practice. --Clayton Freeman, Florida Times-Union\n\nMiami\n\nCorey Washington, Miami Central\n\nWashington is one of the most explosive players in South Florida. Corey is 5‚Äô7 150-pounds, which is small for colleges to recruit him. But Corey is out on a mission to prove those recruiters wrong. In opinion of many coaches in Miami-Dade, Corey is the scariest player in the county. Last year, he had a whopping six return touchdowns along with 500-plus all-purpose yards. Corey has elite quickness that causes players to simply slip right off him and burst to get him inside the end zone frequently. This offseason, he excelled with national power 7v7 team Defcon. He was used primarily in the slot and at running back, where he put up massive numbers throughout the 7v7 season. With Miami Central graduating senior receivers, look for Corey to put up massive numbers at receiver and the return game. ‚Äî Quinten Lambert, Special to the USA Today Network\n\nNaples\n\nGuerschom Guerrier, Lely\n\nGuerrier, a running back for the Trojans, is one of the most highly-regarded players in the area by opposing coaches. The bruising running back went for 1,112 yards and 10 touchdowns last season and had five 100-plus yard games. Guerrier has the face the unfortunate reality of not being on a team that's used to winning, having just one winning season in the past five years. Consider Guerrier as one who has flown under the radar for years, with the potential for that to change this season. ‚Äì Alex Martin, Naples Daily News\n\nNortheast Florida\n\nT.J. Lawrence, Fleming Island\n\nOne year ago, Lawrence was lining up at tight end for Fleming Island, on his way to a season of three receptions for 44 yards. Now, he's added plenty of muscle (6-6, 285 pounds) and moved inside to offensive tackle. The result: Fast-increasing attention from college recruiters. During the spring, Lawrence picked up more than a dozen offers, including Georgia Tech and USF. If he demonstrates to recruiters that he's making the O-line adjustment smoothly, expect more offers to arrive in the coming months. --Clayton Freeman, Florida Times-Union\n\nNorthwest Florida\n\nJayce Brown, Choctawhatchee\n\nThe athletic ability was always there for Brown, but Choctaw's 0-8 campaign his sophomore year did the 6-foot, 170-pound wideout no favors. Come 2021, Jesse Winslette arrived under center and first-year head coach Frank Beasley committed to the vertical attack. The result was a 6-4 campaign and 30 receptions for 558 yards and eight touchdowns for Brown. Credit the breakthrough to his hands (zero drops in 2021), his post routes, his situational awareness when the ball's in the air. Simply put, the guy makes plays and is best on deep routes, as evidenced by his 18.6 yards per catch. Kansas State became the first Power 5 school to offer Brown this past June, just the first in what should be many high-profile offers. Winslette to Brown for 6. Get used to that. ‚Äî Seth Stringer, NWF Daily News\n\nOrlando\n\nAsaad Waseem, Ocoee\n\nThis is as deep a talent pool as Orlando has seen in a decade, so there was a plethora of choices. Ocoee already has two Power Five commits ‚Äî safety Zachary Tobe and edge rusher Calvin Smith, both of whom are planning to head to Illinois. Waseem, a newcomer to the program after stints at Wekiva and West Orange, already claims 18 Division I offers, but he is yet to take any official visits to date. The 6-foot, 170-pound slot receiver caught 36 passes for 463 yards, complementing Oklahoma signee Jayden Gibson last fall. ‚Äî Chris Boyle, Daytona Beach News-Journal\n\nPalm Beach\n\nJayden Parrish, Atlantic\n\nA defensive roster heavy with seniors and juniors limited Parrish's playing time last season, but a strong offseason signaled a breakout junior year was in the works. Atlantic's summer camp tour included stops at the campuses of Auburn and University of Alabama-Birmingham ‚Äì and two MVP awards for the 6-2, 210-pound Parrish after catching coaches' attention with his agility and quickness. This could also be Parrish's year to dominate at his second position, running back, now that the Eagles have graduated Corey Reddick and Omari Mitchell, who combined for 2,278 yards in 2021. ‚Äî Emilee Smarr, The Palm Beach Post\n\nPasco\n\nTayshaun Balmir, Pasco\n\nNot familiar with the name? You might want to be if you‚Äôre a Pasco County high school football fan. Balmir isn‚Äôt a name you‚Äôd recognized from the couple of seasons because he didn‚Äôt play at Pasco his sophomore and junior years. His six-carry, 178-yard performance in the spring against Wesley Chapel Cypress Creek, however, was an eye opener. He has legitimate track speed and is difficult to bring down in open space. Offers? He doesn‚Äôt have one, but a strong start could change that. ‚Äî Andy Villamarzo, Special to the USA Today Florida Network\n\nPensacola\n\nDemontrae Gaston, Pensacola Catholic\n\nThe Crusaders were dealt a bad hand when four-star sophomore Koby Howard suffered a broken tibia during a summer camp visit at Miami. With the standout wide receiver possibly out for the 2022 season, Gaston stands to see more touches as Catholic enters its second season in the spread. The 6-1, 200-pound junior wideout is coming off a year where he snatched 40 catches for 596 yards and two touchdowns. \"I think of him as more of an all-purpose receiver because he'll make you miss and he runs well, too. He's really going to be big for us,\" Crusaders head coach Matt Adams said. Gaston currently has offers from Georgia Tech and Bethune-Cookman. ‚Äî Patrick Bernadeau, Pensacola News Journal\n\nSt. Augustine\n\nArion Stith, Bartram Trail\n\nLast season saw a slew of breakout performers in St. Johns County, including Creekside offensive tackle Matt McCoy (Miami signee), Nease wide receiver Dom Henry (BYU) and Nease linebacker Ben Bogle (Southern Illinois). Perhaps the 6-foot-3, 240-pound Stith can follow suit. Bartram Trail's staff has high hopes for the interior rusher, a converted nose guard. \"He's really aggressive and quick. He's going to give opposing O-lineman fits,\" Bears head coach Darrell Sutherland said. ‚Äî Chris Boyle, St. Augustine Record\n\nSpace Coast\n\nCameron Mills, Viera\n\nMills has offers from a handful of Division I schools, including USF and Marshall. He recently added cornerback to his running back duties, and it is as a defender that he is being recruited. As he displays the skills and speed his 6-foot body possesses ‚Äì Mills sprints and high jumps in the spring ‚Äì his recruiting could shift into a higher gear. -- Brian McCallum, Florida Today\n\nTampa-St. Petersburg\n\nDL Antonio Henley\n\nIt isn‚Äôt like the Gaither defensive lineman is an unknown commodity at this point, but the sophomore‚Äôs stock could soar at the beginning of the season. Coming off a strong freshman campaign that saw Henley notch eight sacks and add 31 tackles, Henley is lightning-quick off the ball and uses his feet and leverage well at the point of attack. Not to mention Gaither head coach Kirk Karsen believes Henley is the best defensive tackle he‚Äôs seen in the area. That‚Äôs saying something. ‚Äî Andy Villamarzo, Special to the USA Today Network\n\nTreasure Coast\n\nRyland Hauser, Jensen Beach\n\nOne year ago, Hauser was far from a name that would be considered as a Division I prospect. Utilized on both sides of the ball for the Falcons, Hauser had good size but had yet to flourish in his career entering the offseason. After hard work to fill out into a frame that sits at 6-foot-5, 225 pounds, Hauser concentrated on becoming a dynamic threat as a hybrid tight end/receiver. After a summer of camps in which he displayed the ball skills and the speed colleges like at his height, Hauser first picked up an an offer from Warner University but made headlines locally in July when Mississippi State offered him. Hauser has since added an offer from North Alabama and is a prime candidate to add more offers with a quick start to the season for a Jensen Beach program that should be much improved from 2021. ‚Äî Bryan Cooney, TCPalm", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/economy/immigration-jobs/index.html", "title": "America needs immigrants to solve its labor shortage | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN ‚Äî\n\nImmigration has long been a political football in the United States. But If you‚Äôre wondering why America‚Äôs labor shortage persists nearly three years into the Covid pandemic, it‚Äôs in part because America doesn‚Äôt have enough immigrants.\n\nImmigrants are vital to the US economy and fill thousands of US jobs ‚Äì jobs many Americas don‚Äôt want to do. In 2020, the processing of legal immigrant worker visas stopped and only picked up towards the end of 2021.\n\nAnd by the end of last year there were close to 2 million fewer working-age immigrants in the United States than there would have been if pre-pandemic immigration continued unchanged, according to new research from the University of California, Davis.\n\n‚ÄúPart of the reason why there are so many vacancies and unfilled jobs in the US is that we are missing a whole lot of immigrants who regularly were coming before Covid,‚Äù said Giovanni Peri, the author of the UC Davis research and Director of the Global Migration Center.\n\nThe immigration debate has been reignited because of a surge at the US-Mexico Border. In March 2020, President Trump invoked Title 42 ‚Äì a law enacted during the pandemic to prevent the spread of Covid ‚Äì that has kept migrants and would-be asylum seekers out of the country.\n\nAsylum seekers are legally able to work in the United States while they await their asylum cases. During that waiting period, those seeking asylum can apply for work permits ‚Äî a process that usually takes 180 days before they are authorized.\n\nBut the decrease in legal immigration over the last two years has hurt American businesses. Especially in industries that require lower skilled labor: construction, agriculture, and hospitality.\n\n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt make up the losses unless we really change immigration laws and we allow more people every year to come in,‚Äù said Peri. ‚ÄúThe way in which we are catching up is that we are processing visas at the speed that it was done before Covid. So for a while there will be this gap.‚Äù\n\nThe lack of available workers has pushed wages higher ‚Äì fueling higher inflation. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that in addition to an aging workforce there is a lack of foreign labor contributing to labor shortages.\n\n‚ÄúThe combination of a plunge in net immigration and a surge in deaths during the pandemic probably accounts for about one-and-a-half million missing workers,‚Äù said Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve last month.\n\nThe ‚Äòbig impact‚Äô\n\nThe biggest impact comes to industries like construction, agriculture, and especially hospitality ‚Äì which are reliant on immigrant workers. Those types of industries had higher rates of unfilled jobs last year ‚Äì adding to existing labor shortages, according to UC Davis research. There are currently 10.3 million open jobs in the US ‚Äì 377,000 in construction and 1.6 million in hospitality. That number has been on the rise in recent months.\n\n‚ÄúThe hospitality [sector] was employing a very large number of immigrants, 30%- 40% of the labor force in that sector was foreign born. And so you‚Äôre missing a lot of them, and potentially that is a big impact,‚Äù said Peri.\n\nThe restaurant industry has borne the brunt of the downturn in immigration. Slower service, restaurants closed for lunch, higher prices ‚Äì are all a result of labor shortages. And the restaurant industry is on track to grow by 14% in the next decade ‚Äì while the US-born workforce is expected to grow by just 10%, according to the National Restaurant Association. There will be more restaurant jobs than the US workforce can fill. Sixty percent of restaurant operators are facing staffing shortages limiting their operating capacity, according to National Restaurant Association.\n\nBut a new piece of legislation, ‚ÄúThe Essential Workers for Economic Advancement Act,‚Äù was introduced in the House earlier this year. The law would create a new visa program for workers in industries like hospitality.\n\n‚ÄúImmigration reform is an economic necessity for the restaurant industry,‚Äù said Sean Kennedy, EVP of Public Affairs at the National Restaurant Association. ‚ÄúAllowing more legal immigration would be a win-win for employers in desperate need of employees and individuals seeking new opportunity.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSkilled‚Äù workers\n\nAbout 1 million of the 2 million potential immigrants who were lost during the pandemic were college educated, according to the UC Davis research. These workers would be considered ‚Äúhigh-skilled workers,‚Äù potentially coming to the US on H-1B specialty visas.\n\nThose high-skilled workers are job multipliers. For each high-skilled worker ‚Äì 2.5 additional jobs are created, according to a report by UC Berkeley.\n\n‚ÄúHigh skilled immigration is incredibly important,‚Äù said Adam Ozimek, chief economist at the Economic Innovation Group. ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt think of it as something that addresses short-term shortages ‚Äì although it can help ‚Äì but something that is really important for long run: innovation, productivity, growth, and health of the economy.‚Äù\n\nEarlier this month, the American Farm Bureau Federation, along with 350 other agricultural groups, called on the Senate to pass an agricultural reform bill already passed by the House to address the farm labor crisis. Skilled foreign farm workers are the backbone of US agriculture and are traditionally in the US on H-2A seasonal visas, which saw its highest ever utilization rate this year, according to the Farm Bureau. But many in agriculture says it‚Äôs not enough and they still can‚Äôt find workers.\n\n‚ÄúThe farm labor crisis is hindering production and contributing to food price inflation. We must address this workforce crisis threatening farms across the United States so our producers can continue to feed, clothe, and fuel our nation,‚Äù the letter to Senate leadership read.\n\nBut, according to the Department of Labor, 317,000 temporary H-2A jobs were certified last year, more than six times the number in 2005. But only 80% of those jobs certified resulted in a visa.", "authors": ["Vanessa Yurkevich"], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/high-school/football/2020/09/14/york-adams-2019-football-preview-breaking-down-division-iii-teams/5720998002/", "title": "York-Adams 2020 football preview: Breaking down Division III teams", "text": "It took a while for a clear favorite to emerge in YAIAA Division III last season.\n\nDefending District 3 Class 2A champ York Catholic struggled through a down season.

Can anyone else emerge as a sleeper contender in this condensed season?\n\nA few teams that have been bottom-feeders in recent years believe they will be much improved this fall.\n\nHere are last year's standings.\n\nDiv.

Talley (WR/DB); Ryan Hart (RB/S); Carter Laughman (TE/DE).\n\nThe breakdown: The Eagles have a new head coach for the first time since the 1990s, but the program doesn't plan to change much.\n\nNew top man John Livelsberger spent more than a decade as an assistant under Jon DeFoe, who stepped down following a school-record 21 years leading the program.\n\nLivelsberger said he's gotten consistent advice from DeFoe since being hired in February, especially on matters pertaining to playing during the pandemic. DeFoe remains the principal at Bermudian Springs.\n\n\"I don't need to rewrite the wheel. I know what success looks like,\" Livelsberger said. \"I don't have to start from scratch. Obviously, I'm going to have my own touch here and there to bring a little life back to it.\n\n\"Jon has been integral as a sounding board. He's been a great resource, not just on how to run the football program but how to navigate an unknown time.\"\n\nBermudian Springs was a pillar of consistent success under DeFoe, earning a 152-78 record during his 21 seasons. The Eagles have made the District 3 playoffs nine times in the past 10 years, except for a 5-5 season in 2015.\n\nStill, the Eagles haven't won a Division III title since 2014 and went 6-5 last season as injuries piled up on a young squad. They rebounded from a 1-2 start and beat York Catholic, but lost to rivals Delone Catholic and Littlestown.\n\nBut Bermudian brings back a lot of experience this year with eight returning starters, most of whom play on both sides of the ball.\n\nOffensively, 6-foot-3 Jay Martinez will return at quarterback after missing the second half of last season with an ankle injury. 5-foot-11, 205-pound wrecking ball Savauri Shelton (352 yards, three touchdowns) could be primed for a big year at fullback after having to finish last season at quarterback due to the team's injuries.\n\nThe Eagles will need players to emerge at tailback and receiver, but they do bring back three starting offensive lineman. All-star outside linebacker Matt Zelenski will also be counted on as a receiver.\n\nShelton, Zelenski and Jonah Martin will lead the defense at linebacker after all posting more than 50 tackles last season. The Eagles gave up just 19 points per game last season, fourth-best in the low-scoring division.\n\n\"These guys are leaders amongst each other but they aren't afraid to dog on each other a bit,\" Livelsberger said of seniors like Shelton and Martinez. \"That's the nice thing. These guys are friends, but they're also on each other to motivate each other because they know they depend on everyone for their success.\"\n\nInside the huddle\n\nHead coach: John Livelsberger (first season)\n\nLast season: 6-5\n\nOffense: Wing-T\n\nDefense: 4-4\n\nClassification: 3A\n\nLast YA division title: 2014\n\nLast District 3 appearance: 2019\n\nLast District 3 playoff win: 2018\n\nDistrict 3 titles: three (1998, 1993, 1992)\n\nBiglerville\n\nKey returnees: Kalen Sharrah (RB/LB, sr.); Jonathan Sanchez (G/DE, sr.); Sam Hurda (RB/LB, sr.); Zach Showers (QB/S, sr.); Darren Mickley (OL/DL, sr.).\n\nKey losses: Wyatt Fetters (OT); Josh Horner (QB); Colin Burke (RB/LB).\n\nThe breakdown: After a number of down years, the Canners believe this could be a breakout year under new head coach Brett Smyers.\n\nA 2009 Biglerville grad, Smyers takes over for Alex Ramos, who stepped down after 10 seasons to take a teaching job at Greencastle-Antrim. Smyers was on Biglerville's coaching staff the past few seasons.\n\n\"With the great group of seniors we have, I have some pretty high expectations,\" Smyers said. \"I feel like being in contention for that Division III title and making a playoff run, I think we have the ability to do that. If we get this offense together and execute at the level they're capable of, I don't see why we can't compete for that division title.\"\n\nBiglerville split the division championship with Hanover and won a playoff game in 2015, but the program has struggled since then, winning just six combined games the past four seasons. The Canners took small steps forward last season by going 3-7.\n\nSmyers noted that the 2015 team was made up of a strong senior class that suffered a 1-9 season its sophomore year before rebuilding. He hopes this year's team can do something similar.\n\n\"They were very selfless and were great leaders, and I have some of those similar attributes in this senior class as well,\" Smyers said. \"Kids that are willing to do things for the greater good of the team. Kids that have stuck it out the past three years. They've been through the downs and we're looking to find some upside.\"\n\nThe key for Biglerville will be how its competes against the division's big four of Bermudian, Delone Catholic, Littlestown and York Catholic. The Canners lost to those programs by an average score of 33-8 last season, only keeping the game to Bermudian (21-12) under a double-digit deficit.\n\nThe Canners do have a lot of talent in the backfield this season. Kalen Sharrah (809 yards, 14 touchdowns) and Sam Hurda (845 yards, eight touchdowns) were both Division III coaches all-stars at running back and linebacker last season. Senior safety Zach Showers will step in as the starting quarterback.\n\nThey'll also get a major boost from the addition of senior Josh Fulton, who transferred from Delone after an incredible junior season. The 5-foot-9, 220-pound Fulton ran for over 1,000 yards and 15 touchdowns and racked up 135 tackles in 12 games for the Squires. He was named a first-team linebacker in the entire YAIAA by GameTimePA, an impressive feat for a Division III player.\n\n\"We already have a lot of great backs, and being able to rotate and have depth will only help our cause,\" Smyers said of Fulton. \"He's just a great kid. Just his personality will fit well with our kids. He was raised and came up through our district, so he's friends with a lot of people on the team already.\"\n\nInside the huddle\n\nHead coach: Brett Smyers\n\nLast season: 3-7\n\nOffense: Power-I\n\nDefense: 4-4\n\nClassification: 3A\n\nLast YA division title: 2015\n\nLast District 3 appearance: 2015\n\nLast District 3 playoff win: 2015\n\nDistrict 3 titles: none\n\nDelone Catholic\n\nKey returnees: Tate Neiderer (RB/LB, sr.); Nick Groft (OL/DT, sr.); Michael O'Brien (LB/RB, sr.); Cory Heffner (CB/RB, sr.); Dylan Zimmerman (WR/DB, sr.).\n\nKey losses: Kevin Mowrey (QB); Joe Hernandez (RB/LB); Josh Fulton (RB/LB, transfer); Gabe Lee (WR/DB); Austin Staub (G/DT).\n\nThe breakdown: The Squires have been knocking on the door of a District 3 title for three years now.\n\n2017's 8-2 team came four points away from an undefeated record and missed out on a two-team playoff bracket in Class 2A.\n\n2018's squad was ridiculously dominant in 10 wins, but couldn't beat York Catholic in two attempts. They lost to the Irish in an overtime thriller in the District 3 title game.\n\nLast year's team rolled off eight straight wins after an 0-3 start, and nearly pulled off a miraculous comeback to force overtime against Upper Dauphin in the District 3 title game. The attempt fell a few plays short.\n\nNow, the Squires bump down to Class 1A, which only has a two-team playoff bracket. The drop down could also lead to success in the state playoffs, something the storied program has never experienced.\n\nOf course, that's not the main focus right now. The Squires are happy just to be on the field.\n\n\"It's almost indescribable the sheer happiness we saw the first night we got together this summer,\" head coach Corey Zortman said. \"Sometimes at a young age you don't appreciate the importance of sports to the high school experience.\"\n\nStill, Zortman said his team still has the same goals as always, even with the uncertainty that still hangs over the season. He complimented the leadership that his seniors have shown.\n\n\"Our kids have a good perspective, and they'll be happy playing for a league championship or just playing the games,\" Zortman said. \"But at the end of each season we want to win a league championship, qualify for districts and see what happens. All those goals are still there.\"\n\nBy the end of last season, Delone won games with a swarming defense that created turnovers and a rushing offense that racked up more than 250 yards per game on the ground. The Squires bring back seven starters on defense and six on offense but there are voids to fill.\n\nTop tailback and Division III Offensive Player of the Year Joe Hernandez (more than 1,800 all-purpose yards, 14 touchdowns) graduated and bulldozing fullback-linebacker Josh Fulton (more than 1,000 rushing yards, 15 scores) transferred to his home district Biglerville. Cerebral quarterback Kevin Mowrey (now playing for Division III Widener) also graduated after throwing for 1,100 yards, 10 scores and just three interceptions.\n\nLinebacker and reigning Division III Defensive Player of the Year Tate Neiderer will take a bigger role at running back after rushing for 657 yards and six scores last year. Fellow seniors Cory Heffner (wide receiver) and Michael O'Brien (guard) have switched positions and will contribute in the backfield.\n\nJunior Coltyn Keller will likely be the team's starting quarterback, though sophomore defensive back Ryder Noel could compete with him for playing time.\n\n\"Coltyn has the edge because of his age, but I really like both kids,\" Zortman said. \"I think either could play.\"\n\nSenior captain Nick Groft is the lone returner on an offensive line that Zortman said will average about 6-feet and 225 pounds. Others kids who will compete for starting spots are Collin Snyder, Elijah Staub, Trent Giraffa, Sam Scovitch and Ryan King.\n\nOther players to watch are corner-wideout Dylan Zimmerman, tight end-defensive end Wyatt Schussler and running back-linebacker Zack Fields.\n\nInside the huddle\n\nHead coach: Corey Zortman (37-17 in five seasons)\n\nLast season: 8-4\n\nOffense: Wing-T\n\nDefense: 4-2-5\n\nClassification: 1A\n\nLast YA division title: 2019\n\nLast District 3 appearance: 2019\n\nLast District 3 playoff win: 2019\n\nDistrict 3 titles: Eight (2012, 2007, 2003, 2000, 1999, 1994, 1990, 1989)\n\nFairfield\n\nKey returnees: Peyton Stadler (RB/LB, jr.); Jake Myers (QB/S, jr.); Jared Estes (G/DT, sr.); Nathan Mickley (K/P, sr.); Cody Valentine (RB/LB/DE, jr.); Nate Roberts (T/DE, sr.); Will Myers (LB/RB, jr.).\n\nKey losses: Garrett Stadler (RB/LB); Brent Hamilton (TE/S).\n\nThe breakdown: The YAIAA's smallest school has shown incredible resilience in recent years.\n\nThe Knights almost didn't field a varsity team two years ago before Jason Thurston stepped up and took the head coaching job in late July.\n\nThey had a number of games last season where they suited up less than 20 healthy players.\n\nThey had schedule changes and a game canceled during that stretch.\n\nSo while playing during a pandemic is certainly a different and new challenge, Fairfield is used to dealing with uncertainty.\n\n\"It's the same kind of thing. It's frustrating and disappointing but there's no use getting upset about it,\" Thurston said of adapting to a condensed schedule. \"We talk a lot about controlling what we can control, and there's a lot right now that we don't have control over.\n\n\"There was a point in the middle of last season when we had 16 healthy bodies. I asked the kids what they wanted to do, and they wanted to keep playing. They just want the opportunity to shine.\"\n\nIn early August, Thurston said the team expected to have 27 or 28 kids on the roster this season, a higher number than in recent years. He said he thought it was possible to get up to 30 by the start of the season.\n\nSenior Jared Estes said the challenge of convincing his classmates to come out for football is that many kids in the school have said they don't want to play for a losing program.\n\nHowever, there have been some positive signs. Fairfield only graduated three players after last season and had about 20 players regularly coming to voluntary workouts this summer, according to Thurston. He said those were the best numbers of his tenure.\n\n\"They always say we're losing, and the only thing I can say back to that is, 'The reason we're losing is you guys won't come out and help us,'\" Estes said. \"I just try to persuade them that it's a fun time, coach is really serious about what he's doing and it looks promising.\"\n\nAs a Class 1A program, Fairfield has played in three straight District 3 title games despite having losing records since the classification has just a handful of teams and a two-team bracket. That could be much more challenging this year with Delone and Steel-High dropping to 1A.\n\nStill, the Knights believe they will be improved this season with a good amount of experience back. Junior Peyton Stadler had close to 100 tackles last season and will also start at running back. Junior Jake Myers will start at quarterback after playing in seven games last season.\n\n\"I told them it's going to be a process, and it's going to take time,\" Thurston said of building up the program. \"They see for our program, this is going to be a year where we take big steps forward. I think they're humbled that we get that opportunity.\"\n\nInside the huddle\n\nHead coach: Jason Thurston (4-17 in two seasons at Fairfield, 14-38 career record)\n\nLast season: 2-9\n\nOffense: Wing-T\n\nDefense: 4-3\n\nClassification: 1A\n\nLast YA division title: none\n\nLast District 3 appearance: 2019\n\nLast District 3 playoff win: none\n\nDistrict 3 titles: none\n\nHanover\n\nKey returnees: Chase Roberts (QB, so.); Brady Noel (T/DT, jr.); Mason Smith (WR/DB, so.); Mitchell Brown (WR/CB, jr.); Beau Gebhart (TE/DE, sr.).\n\nLey losses: Andre Caban (WR/S); Aaron Eisenhart (G/MLB); Brett Noel (LB).\n\nThe breakdown: After taking some serious lumps last season, Hanover hopes to start building toward success this year with a young nucleus.\n\nThe Nighthawks also have a new coach.\n\nDefensive coordinator Wil Ryder takes over the top job for Brandon Bishop, a former offensive coordinator who resigned after just two seasons. Hanover went 4-16 during that stretch.\n\nA 2001 South Western grad who played for legendary Mustangs coach Don Seidenstricker, Rider hopes to bring relevance to a Nighthawks program that has struggled with participation numbers in recent years.\n\n\"The number of kids we have at the skill positions, we're pretty well loaded,\" Rider said. \"We have a lot of talent. We're putting some pieces together, and we have some weapons.\"\n\nRider said the team had between 23 and 27 players showing up to offseason voluntary workouts and should have more than 30 players on the roster this season, an improvement from last season.\n\nThe Nighthawks went 1-9 last season, with its lone win coming against York County Tech. They particularly struggled on defense (38 points per game allowed) and running the ball (46 yards per game on the ground).\n\nHowever, they were able to throw the ball with a couple of young players.\n\nQuarterback Chase Roberts was very impressive as a freshman, throwing for more than 1,700 yards, 12 touchdowns and eight interceptions. Already 6-foot tall and with a cannon arm, Roberts led the division in passing yards and touchdowns and was named a second-team all-star by the coaches.\n\nTop receiver Andre Caban graduated, but Mason Smith returns after catching 27 passes for more than 400 yards as a freshman last year. Junior Mitchell Brown and senior tight end Beau Gebhart could also be strong targets this season.\n\nThe key will be the team's blocking. Rider said the Nighthawks have low numbers on the offensive and defensive lines and will try some first-year players in those spots.\n\n\"The question is going to be: Can we keep Chase upright?,\" Rider said. \"We have some struggled on the line but we're making progress. Some young guys have been stepping up. We're going to see how they respond.\"\n\nRider was on the team's coaching staff in 2015 when the Nighthawks enjoyed a 9-2 season and split the Division III title with Biglerville. That team's success was fueled by outstanding senior quarterback Kyle Krout, who went on to play basketball at Messiah College.\n\nRider said he believes Roberts can be just as good as Krout if he continues to progress. He added that the coaching staff has added a few pieces that could push the offense to another level.\n\n\"He is capable of taking us really far and surpassing what Krout was able to do,\" Rider said. \"The one thing that really stood out last year, Chase would stand in there and know the defense was going to smack him in the face, and he kept going. There were times when I was legitimately concerned for his well-being, and he kept going. You don't see that a lot for a kid his age.\"\n\nInside the huddle\n\nHead coach: Wil Rider (first season)\n\nLast season: 1-9\n\nOffense: spread\n\nDefense: 4-4\n\nClassification: 3A\n\nLast YA division title: 2015\n\nLast District 3 appearance: 2015\n\nLast District 3 playoff win: 1995\n\nDistrict 3 titles: one (1985)\n\nLittlestown\n\nKey returnees: Jesse Hawk (RB/LB, sr.); Maxm Akins (LB, sr.); William Shoemaker (WR/DB, sr.); Dakota Kroft (OL/DT, sr.); Reese Huth (G/DL, sr.); Jeremy Gebhart (OT/DE, sr.); Bryce Redding (DE/T, jr.).\n\nKey losses: Wyatt Kramer (RB/LB); Zach Ressler (QB); Austin Grelli (C/DL); Dustyn Barker (WR/S/P); Memphis Stonesifer (RB/OLB); Brayden Staub (TE).\n\nThe breakdown: Mike Lippy is now the YAIAA's longest-tenured coach, but his team this year doesn't have the experience of past squads.\n\nAt YAIAA media day, Lippy said Littlestown has just three seniors who were starters last season. However, he said there are 12 seniors and 19 juniors on the roster who have the potential to be contributors this year.\n\nHe believes the program's young players have a lot of potential.\n\n\"We really feel there are a lot of juniors that are going to play a big part in our season this year,\" said Lippy, who is entering his 18th season leading the Bolts. \"I'm really looking forward to working with the kids who are coming up and looking forward to a season.\"\n\nLittlestown is coming off four straight playoff appearances and back-to-back 7-4 seasons. The Bolts were just 2-3 last season after getting shutout, 27-0, by Delone, but won five straight wins to make it back to the playoffs. They beat rivals York Catholic and Bermudian.\n\nThey featured a stingy defense (16 points allowed per game) and a balanced offense (197 yards on the ground, 96 through the air per game), but it's hard to know exactly what the Bolts will look like this year. Lippy declined to mention many players by name at media day, saying he wanted the team's players to earn the recognition.\n\nRunning back-linebackers Jesse Hall and Maxm Akins are senior leaders who were brought to media day by Lippy. William Shoemaker, Reese Huth, Dakota Kroft, Bryce Redding and Jeremy Gebhart were league coaches all-stars last season who are still on the roster. The bulk of the team's experience is on the line.\n\nShoemaker will be counted on at running back after rushing for 532 yards, picking up another 100 receiving and scoring six total touchdowns last year. The Bolts graduated most of the other players who produced at running back or receiver.\n\nThe Bolts will also need a new quarterback following the graduation of Zach Ressler. Lippy remained tight-lipped on the subject during media day, but said there's a competition between a few players.\n\n\"We don't have any information,\" Lippy said with a laugh in early August. \"I will say it's an open competition. For the longest time my philosophy was (to go with) that senior, and this year's been different with that. The boy that is a senior wants to earn that position, and we have a junior who's up-and-coming and it's going to be quite a competition.\n\n\"They have a great attitude about competing with each other.\"\n\nLippy was also asked if he saw a favorite in the division this year. His response was as expected.\n\n\"Nope,\" he said while remaining straight-faced. \"Anybody could win it this year. I think most of us have some kids coming back. We just hope that when Week 1 comes that we have a game, and the other stuff will fall into place.\"\n\nInside the huddle\n\nHead coach: Mike Lippy (128-63 in 17 seasons)\n\nLast season: 7-4\n\nOffense: no huddle\n\nDefense: 4-4 and 3-4\n\nClassification: 3A\n\nLast YA division title: 2017\n\nLast District 3 appearance: 2019\n\nLast District 3 playoff win: 2013\n\nDistrict 3 titles: Three (2004, 1989, 1984)\n\nYork Catholic\n\nKey returnees: Brennan Witman (WR/DB, sr.); Michael McBrairty (OL/DL, sr.); De'Kzeon Wyche (RB, sr.); Nicholas Andrasi (K, jr.); Landen Eckert (TE/LB, jr.); Levan McFadden (QB, so.).\n\nKey losses: Noah Kiel (TE/LB); Ben Moir (WR/DB); Mitch Galentine (QB, transfer); Cormac Sterling (RB/LB); Matt Burnside (S); Seamus Landis (OL/DL); Jabbar Sease (DB); Hunter Karpulk (OLB).\n\nThe breakdown: The Irish are coming off a down season and will be very young, but that doesn't mean expectations aren't high.\n\nHead coach Eric Depew sees big things for this year's group. He was candid when asked how he thinks his squad will compete against rivals Bermudian Springs, Delone Catholic and Littlestown.\n\n\"I think it will be us and then those three,\" Depew said. \"I've got us at the top.\n\n\"I think we can have some success this year. We're hungry and have a lot of energy. We've got all these underclassmen and they're going to keep getting better.\"\n\nYork Catholic entered last year with high expectations after winning at least a share of the previous three division titles. The Irish were coming off a 12-1 season and District 3 title.\n\nBut even with a senior-heavy squad, things didn't go as expected in 2019. The Irish started 0-2 against strong York Suburban and Trinity squads and went 0-3 against the aforementioned Division III rivals, finishing 5-5.\n\n\"I was a little shocked,\" Depew said of last season. \"That group was a part of those division championships, but some other teams were more physical than we were. I'm trying to teach that attitude this year.\"\n\nThe Irish bring back just three seniors this year, but Depew has high expectations for all of them. Michael McBrairty will anchor the offensive line. Star lacrosse player Brennan Witman could have a breakout year at receiver after dealing with injuries last season.\n\nThen there's running back De'Kzeon Wyche, who rushed for 886 yards and eight touchdowns on 117 carries last season after transferring from York County Tech. The 6-foot, 190-pound Wyche hopes to be a highly-recruited player with a strong senior season.\n\n\"He looks like a man amongst boys,\" Depew said of Wyche. \"He's got maturity, strength, speed, hunger. Just the eye of the tiger. It's gonna be fun.\"\n\nThe Irish have had strong defense the past few seasons (18 points per game allowed last season) and will look to continue that trend. Junior Landen Eckert and sophomore Nick Creisher will anchor that unit as linebackers.\n\nDepew also pointed to sophomore lineman Ryan Tully, junior running back Andrew Adams and junior fullback-linebacker Ryan Kerchner as players that could have breakout years.\n\nYork Catholic will also be young at quarterback following the transfer of Mitch Galentine back to his home district, Eastern York. The Irish will go with sophomore Levan McFadden, who got playing time in five games last season and threw for 354 yards, seven touchdowns and one interception.\n\nDepew had high praise for McFadden, comparing him to former York Catholic star dual-threat quarterback Hakeem Kinard, who went on to have a standout career as a defensive back for Division I St. Francis and earned some NFL tryouts.\n\n\"He's a Hakeem-type player,\" Depew said. \"He's going to do some big stuff. He's got the leadership and confidence in himself. He's very coachable, and he's got the arm and running threat.\"\n\nInside the huddle\n\nHead coach: Eric Depew (66-37 in nine seasons)\n\nLast season: 5-5\n\nOffense: spread\n\nDefense: 4-3\n\nClassification: 2A\n\nLast YA division title: 2018\n\nLast District 3 appearance: 2018\n\nLast District 3 playoff win: 2018\n\nDistrict 3 titles: Three (2018, 2016, 1982)\n\nYork County Tech\n\nKey returnees: Bishop Banks (OL/DT, sr.); Josh Peters (LB, sr.); Hermery Nieves (RB/LB, sr.); Hunter Sommer (RB/DB, sr.); Kolby Courtney (C/DT, sr.).\n\nKey losses: Ryan Gibson (QB); Luis Ortiz (OL/DL, sr.); James Wilmot (OL/DL); Logan Heilman (SE/DB, sr.); Michael Villalona (SE/DE, sr.).\n\nThe breakdown: Spartans coach Matt Glennon knows the wins haven't come for his team, but he does think there has been progress since he came back to the program last season.\n\nHe believes there has been a change in the culture at York Tech.\n\n\"I don't want to categorize it as despair, but the kids got used to a certain culture and expectation,\" Glennon said. \"We've tried to change the expectation the last two yeas. Just little things like character and commitment.\"\n\nThe Spartans haven't won a game since 2016 and will enter this season on a 30-game losing streak. They lost games by an average score of 42-8 last season.\n\nGlennon, who previously served as the team's coach from 2013 to 2014, knows the Spartans search for a win is the \"elephant in the room.\" Still, he's proud of how his team competed last season.\n\n\"We were 0-10 last year and we had no issues at practice. Kids showed up every day,\" Glennon said. \"In the games, never had an issue where kids quit. They were outmatched a lot, but they were picking each other up. It's neat to see the kids progress.\n\n\"We believe if we deal with the character, discipline and commitment, it will eventually translate to wins.\"\n\nGlennon said he would estimate the Spartans have 35 to 40 kids on the roster. He said he was pleased that around 25 to 30 kids routinely showed up to voluntary workouts.\n\nYork County Tech will once again run the triple option on offense, which Glennon hopes will be difficult for other teams to game-plan for.\n\nThe team's top returning player is defensive tackle Bishop Banks, who was named a first-team Division III all-star by league coaches last season. Fullback Hermery Nieves rushed for 409 yards and three touchdowns last season despite suffering a season-ending injury in Week 4 last season.\n\nGlennon said juniors Ja'mar Johnson and Cam Harpine will compete for time at quarterback.\n\nSenior center Kolby Courtney praised his new head coach for instilling a new attitude in the team's players since last season.\n\n\"When coach Glennon came in, he raised the morale up a lot,\" Courtney said. \"All the players seem a lot happier and actually want to go out and play.\"\n\nInside the huddle\n\nHead coach: Matt Glennon (0-10 in one season in current stint, 4-16 during previous two-year stint)\n\nLast season: 0-10\n\nOffense: triple option\n\nDefense: 4-3\n\nClassification: 6A\n\nLast YA division title: 1976\n\nLast District 3 appearance: none\n\nLast District 3 playoff win: none\n\nDistrict 3 titles: none\n\nMatt Allibone is a sports reporter for GameTimePA.

York Catholic and Delone Catholic went undefeated through eight weeks and clashed for the division and District 3 Class 2A title (the Irish won both). Bermudian Springs reached the District 3 Class 3A championship game, and Littlestown made the playoffs.\n\nIt remains to be seen if any teams can challenge those four usual contenders this year.\n\nHere's a look at last year's standings.\n\nDiv.

Then there's Kolt Byers, who proved to be one of the best athletes in the state after earning a gold medal in the high jump during the track and field season.\n\nByers, who also earned state medals in two other track and field events, is guaranteed to be a weapon for the Eagles wherever he plays this year. Last season, he scored four touchdowns and kicked 35 extra points for Bermudian.\n\nOtherwise, it will be up to young players on the team to step up, particularly at the skill positions.\n\n\"The biggest story for us is what new faces are going to come along,\" DeFoe said.\n\nExpectations: DeFoe is entering his third decade coaching high school football. He has been with the same coaching staff for at least 10 years.\n\nThat \"consistency and cohesion\" is important to Bermudian's success, DeFoe said.\n\nAlways in the conversation, Bermudian Springs earning its first league title since 2014 is among the team's goals.\n\nDeFoe stated that there are two to three sophomores on the team who get the opportunity to showcase their talent this season.\n\n\"I think we're going to need something out of them,\" he said.\n\nDespite the transition year, Bermudian Springs is expected to contend among the top teams in Division III ‚Äî York Catholic, Delone Catholic and Littlestown ‚Äî who also parted with excellent senior classes.\n\nThe longstanding belief in how the Eagles operate will not change in Year 21 for DeFoe\n\n\"Just plugging along, another year,\" DeFoe said.\n\nInside the huddle\n\nHead coach: Jon DeFoe (139-73 in 20 seasons) (OC)\n\nStaff: Chris King (DC), John Livelsberger, Dave McCollum, Drew Reinecker\n\nOffense: Wing-T\n\nDefense: 4-4\n\nClassification: 3A\n\nLast YA division title: 2014\n\nLast District 3 appearance: 2018\n\nLast District 3 playoff win: 2018\n\nDistrict 3 titles: three (1998, 1993, 1992)\n\nBermudian Springs 2019 schedule\n\n8/23 @ New Oxford\n\n8/30 @ Boiling Springs\n\n9/6 vs. Shippensburg\n\n9/13 vs. Hanover\n\n9/20 @ Fairfield\n\n9/27 vs. York Catholic\n\n10/4 @ Delone Catholic\n\n10/11 vs. York Tech\n\n10/18 @ Littlestown\n\n10/25 vs. Biglerville\n\n2018 results\n\n8/24 vs. New Oxford W, 28-22\n\n8/31 vs. Boiling Springs W, 27-12\n\n9/7 vs. @ Shippensburg L, 37-17\n\n9/14 @ Hanover W, 41-0\n\n9/21 vs. Fairfield W, 34-6\n\n9/28 @ York Catholic L, 10-7\n\n10/5 vs. Delone Catholic L, 17-7\n\n10/13 @ York Tech W, 54-0\n\n10/19 vs. Littlestown W, 28-19\n\n10/26 @ Biglerville W, 33-7\n\nDistrict 3 playoffs\n\n11/2 @ Annville-Cleona W, 14-7\n\n11/9 @ Lancaster Catholic W, 20-10\n\n11/17 vs. Middletown L, 42-20\n\nBiglerville\n\nKey returnees: Cage Althoff (QB, sr.);

They worked well together, but it's his turn to be the guy.\"\n\nZortman stated that there isn't much of a difference between the two. If they race, they would probably tie, and Mowrey might have a slightly stronger arm.\n\n\"I'm going to miss having (Brady) around, but I think I am ready to take the energy of this opportunity that I have to be quarterback this year,\" Mowrey said.\n\nThe Squires' schedule presents an interesting challenge as many of the top teams they played on the road last season will be coming to McSherrystown in 2019.\n\n\"I think it‚Äôs a great opportunity for these guys to not only play quality teams but play them in your own place for your rivalry games,\" Zortman said.\n\nExpectations: Zortman views athleticism as Delone's greatest strength this year.\n\nIt was an apparent asset last year in the Squires' excellent running back committee, which rushed for more than 3,400 yards last season. Zortman doesn't expect the position to miss a beat.\n\nSenior Joe Hernandez returns as the most seasoned member of the group after rushing for 473 yards and 10 touchdowns in 2018.\n\nHernandez will be joined by senior Colin Gebhart and juniors Tate Neiderer and Josh Fulton in the backfield.\n\n\"I think that group of guys is capable of repeating some of the success we had last year.\"\n\nNeiderer and Fulton will also be looked at as a potentially strong tandem for the Squires at inside linebacker. The Squire defense gave up 11.9 points per game last season.\n\nDelone is ready to put last year behind them, while also wanting to build off the success with a new group of leaders ready to take over.\n\n\"It gives you something to strive for,\" Zortman said. \"It gives you something to kind of hang your hat on, so to speak. I think these guys are anxious and eager for their opportunity this year.\"\n\nInside the huddle\n\nHead coach: Corey Zortman (29-13 in four seasons) (OC)\n\nStaff: Dave Staub (DC), Barry Zortman, Colby Zortman, Steve McMaster, Brian Arentz, Mark Leonard, Brian Wildasin, Austin Noel, Dusty Lehr\n\nOffense: Wing-T\n\nDefense: 4-2-5\n\nClassification: 3A\n\nLast YA division title: 2009\n\nLast District 3 appearance: 2018\n\nLast District 3 playoff win: 2018\n\nDistrict 3 titles: Eight (2012, 2007, 2003, 2000, 1999, 1994, 1990, 1989)\n\nDelone Catholic 2019 schedule\n\n8/23 vs. Trinity\n\n8/30 @ York Suburban\n\n9/6 vs. Steel-High\n\n9/14 @ York Tech\n\n9/20 vs. Littlestown\n\n9/27 @ Biglerville\n\n10/4 vs. Bermudian Springs\n\n10/11 @ Fairifield\n\n10/18 vs. York Catholic\n\n2018 results\n\n8/24 @ Trinity W, 47-7\n\n8/31 vs. York Suburban W, 62-0\n\n9/7 @ Steel-High W, 54-19\n\n9/14 vs. York Tech W, 55-0\n\n9/21 @ Littlestown W, 27-7\n\n9/28 vs. Biglerville W, 56-0\n\n10/5 @ Bermudian W, 17-7\n\n10/12 vs. Fairfield W, 57-3\n\n10/19 @ York Catholic L, 35-7\n\n10/26 vs. Hanover W, 58-14\n\nDistrict 3 playoffs\n\n11/3 vs. Upper Dauphin W, 48-23\n\nTitle game: 11/9 vs. York Catholic L, 28-21 (2OT)\n\nFairfield\n\nKey returnees: Garrett Stadler (RB/LB, sr.); Brent Hamilton (TE/S, sr.); Peyton Stadler (RB/LB, so.)\n\nKey losses: Zach Koons (QB); Joey Quealy (WR/DB); Ethan Favorite (RB/LB); Nic Wheeler (WR/DB).\n\nThe challenge: Fairfield was close to disbanding the football program last season and wound up competing in the District 3 Class 1A championship game.\n\nIt took just a pair of wins for the Knights to make it there with only three teams in Class 1A. Still, head coach Jason Thurston is looking to bolster the young program going forward.\n\nConditioning will be crucial this summer given Fairfield's numbers. Thurston felt the team lost close games because of fatigue last season.\n\n\"Staying healthy is going to be key,\" he said.\n\nThurston also noted the team is \"extremely undersized\" in the trenches.\n\nThe team has three young guys in the running to replace quarterback Zach Koons, who graduated last year. Sophomore Jake Myers got some experience under center during the 2018 season.\n\n\"I don‚Äôt want to say he‚Äôs the starter, but he‚Äôs been getting most of the reps all summer,\" Thurston said of Myers.\n\nMyers is recovering from a hairline fracture to his arm after a four-wheeler accident.\n\nFairfield will be a younger team than most in the division this year, but it's a problem they had to solve last year as well.\n\n\"At most schools you don‚Äôt have freshman playing varsity football unless they‚Äôre exceptionally talented,\" Thurston said. \"We don‚Äôt have that luxury, so our kids have to grow up fast.\"\n\nExpectations: Fortunately for Fairfield, many young players coming back already had substantial playing time last year.\n\n\"We‚Äôve got some sophomores who were thrown into the fire as freshmen last year, and hopefully that will pay off for us,\" Thurston said.\n\nSenior running back Garrett Stadler led the Knights in receiving yards last year. His younger brother, sophomore Peyton Stadler, also got significant playing time at linebacker and fullback.\n\n\"(Peyton)‚Äôs got a tremendous work ethic,\" Thurston said. \"He‚Äôs gifted athletically. He‚Äôs extremely tall for his age. He‚Äôs got a nice, solid frame.\"\n\nFairfield would like to get to the district championship game again, but Thurston said that goal is \"off in the distance.\" Right now, the team is focused on one game at a time, even though they might not be favored in most.\n\n\"We know we‚Äôre going to be the underdog in most games, but we like a good underdog story, and why not try to come up with an upset here and there?\" senior Brent Hamilton said.\n\nInside the huddle\n\nHead coach: Jason Thurston (2-8 in one season at Fairfield, 12-29 career record)(OC/DC)\n\nStaff: Jacob Johnson, Chris Alpaugh, George Bell, Butch Hess, Thomas Bollinger, David Joy, Chris Bunty, Jeff Anders\n\nOffense: Wing-T\n\nDefense: 4-3\n\nClassification: 1A\n\nLast YA division title: none\n\nLast District 3 appearance: 2017\n\nLast District 3 playoff win: none\n\nDistrict 3 titles: none\n\nFairfield 2019 schedule\n\n8/23 vs. Penns Valley\n\n8/30 vs. Bishop Carroll\n\n9/6 vs. James Buchanan\n\n9/13 @ Biglerville\n\n9/20 vs. Bermudian Springs\n\n9/27 @ Hanover\n\n10/4 @ York Catholic\n\n10/11 vs. Delone Catholic\n\n10/19 @ York Tech\n\n10/25 vs. Littlestown\n\n2018 results\n\n8/24 Penns Valley L, 49-6\n\n8/31 @ St. Joseph's Academy (canceled)\n\n9/7 @ James Buchanan W, 31-23\n\n9/14 vs. Biglerville L, 22-21\n\n9/21 @ Bermudian Springs L, 34-6\n\n9/28 vs. Hanover L, 27-21\n\n10/5 vs. York Catholic L, 41-10\n\n10/12 @ Delone Catholic L, 35-7\n\n10/19 vs. York Tech W, 47-16\n\n10/26 @ Littlestown L, 47-0\n\nDistrict 3 Class 1A title game\n\n11/2 vs. Halifax @Camp Hill L, 37-6\n\nHanover\n\nKey returnees: Andre Caban (WR/S, sr.);

Both teams made the district playoffs last season but fell out of the division race, which came down to the Catholic schools.\n\nLittlestown will be returning Wyatt Kramer, who missed his entire junior season after tearing his ACL in a 7-on-7 last summer.\n\nAfter a 12-month rehab, Kramer, a running back and linebacker, is back and viewed as one of the leaders on the Bolts. Kramer received the second-most carries on the team as a sophomore.\n\n\"I give him a lot of respect for handling that because, in high school football, to lose one of your years is freaking devastating,\" Lippy said.\n\nFor now, Littlestown is focused on the little things that will help to build cohesiveness.\n\n\"You can‚Äôt look down to Week 8, 9, all that,\" Lippy said. \"We‚Äôve got to take care of business every day. We‚Äôve got to get better every day.\"\n\nInside the huddle\n\nHead coach: Mike Lippy (121-59 in 16 seasons)\n\nStaff: Corey Bittle (DC), Joe Bowman, Wes Chrismer, Todd Gantz, Steve Lane, T.J.

Galentine entered last season as the starter before missing four games because of a team decision. He reentered the lineup as a change-of-pace dual threat toward the end of the regular season.\n\nThe line could be more of a work in progress. Michael McBrairty is the one player to start throughout last season, while a few others returnees got playing time.\n\n\"That's where we really have to focus on,\" head coach Eric Depew said. \"We have the guys to do it. It's just a matter of getting them reps together. The one thing they're lacking is camaraderie as a unit.\"\n\nIt also won't be easy for York Catholic to remain as good defensively as it was last season, though the Irish should still be strong. York Catholic gave up an incredible average of 9.4 points per game during its 12-0 start.\n\nAnother challenge for the Irish is one other teams in York County rarely think about: Taking the next step in the state playoffs.\n\nIn the first round last year, York Catholic played well early on against the eventual state champs, an insanely-loaded Southern Columbia squad. The Irish eventually lost 56-23.\n\n\"We need Southern Columbia to graduate some people,\" Depew said tongue-in-cheek. \"If we went (to the other side of the bracket) we probably win one or two state games. We just got a bad draw.\"\n\nExpectations: Depew said he doesn't like to stress going undefeated with his players. Still, he has a message for anyone who thinks York Catholic might take a step back.\n\n\"We're ready,\" he said. \"Don't think that we lost anything. I expect everything to be on the right track.\"\n\nDepew said the Irish have a plethora of skill positions players ready to contribute. Witman's brother, Brennan, is a junior who should contribute as a receiver or running back. Moir and tight end Noah Kiel (19 catches for 303 yards) will be bigger threats in the passing game.\n\nDe'Kzeon Wyche, a transfer who rushed for 926 yards for York County Tech last season, will add another dimension to the backfield.\n\nThe Irish just need to put the pieces together.\n\nInside the huddle\n\nHead coach: Eric Depew (61-32 in eight seasons)\n\nStaff: Matt Sentz (OC), Brad Hayek (DC), Andrew Downing, Doug Mills, Adam Setnz\n\nOffense: spread\n\nDefense: 4-3\n\nClassification: 3A\n\nLast YA division title: 2018\n\nLast District 3 appearance: 2018\n\nLast District 3 playoff win: 2018\n\nDistrict 3 titles: Three (2018, 2016, 1982)\n\nYork Catholic 2019 schedule\n\n8/23 vs. York Suburban\n\n8/30 vs. Trinity\n\n9/6 vs. Susquehannock\n\n9/13 @ Littlestown\n\n9/20 vs. Biglerville\n\n9/27 @ Bermudian Springs\n\n10/4 vs. Fairfield\n\n10/11 @ Hanover\n\n10/18 @ Delone Catholic\n\n10/26 @ York Tech\n\n2018 results\n\n8/24 @ York Suburban W, 21-14\n\n8/31 @ Trinity W, 19-3\n\n9/7 @ Susquehannock W, 24-3\n\n9/14 vs. Littlestown W, 22-19\n\n9/21 @ Biglerville W, 38-0\n\n9/28 vs. Bermudian Springs W, 10-7\n\n10/5 @ Fairfield W, 41-10\n\n10/12 vs. Hanover W, 55-21\n\n10/19 vs. Delone Catholic W, 35-7\n\n10/26 vs. York Tech W, 54-8\n\nDistrict 3 playoffs\n\n11/2 vs. Steel-High W, 21-0\n\nTitle game: 11/9 vs. Delone W, 28-21 (2OT)\n\nState playoffs\n\n11/23 vs. Southern Columbia L, 56-23\n\nYork County Tech\n\nKey returnees: Ryan Gibson (QB, sr.); Luis Ortiz (OL/DL, sr.); James Wilmot (OL/DL, sr.); Josh Peters (LB, jr.); Hermery Nieves (RB/LB, jr.); Logan Heilman (SE/DB, sr.); Michael Villalona (SE/DE, sr.); Dazshaun Celony-Johnson (SE/DB, jr.); Hunter Sommer (RB/DB, jr.)\n\nKey losses: Terence Romey (WR/DB), De'Kzeon Wyche (RB, transfer)\n\nThe challenge: The Spartans have traditionally struggled, but the past two seasons have been particularly difficult.\n\nYork County Tech hasn't won a game since a promising four-win campaign in 2016. The Spartans lost contests by an average of 48-6 last season. Head coach Charlie Troxell retired from coaching and teaching last year.\n\nThe program has once again turned to familiar face in former coach Matt Glennon, who previously led the Spartans from 2013 to 2014. A West York grad, Glennon served as an assistant for the Bulldogs last season.\n\n\"I focused a lot on wins and losses as a younger coach and kinda lost sight of the process and the relationships,\" Glennon said. \"I truly believe as a teacher and a coach, if you teach small things to the kids as building blocks, the end result will take care of itself. If they follow the rules and structures, we'll have some success.\"\n\nWithout a feeder program, Tech has traditionally struggled to draw large numbers and develop cohesiveness. Glennon said the team expects to have 35 players on its roster, with a core group of 20 having trained throughout the summer.\n\nThe Spartans are also learning a new offense, moving from the spread to the triple option. Glennon hopes the system, which is often used by undersized teams, will take some rivals by surprise once the Spartans get up to speed with it.\n\n\"I don't think any other team runs it around here,\" Glennon said. \"When we play that team, they have to plan for something different. But I think it's a dynamic offense. It's based on your athletes and it's very regimented and structured.\"\n\nThe Spartans also need to replace their top playmaker from last year, with 900-yard running back De'Kzeon Wyche now at York Catholic.\n\nExpectations: York Tech hasn't had a winning season since 1983 when it went 5-4-1. Turning around the program isn't easy and won't happen immediately.\n\nOf course, getting a win would be a great start. The team's seniors, who were freshmen during a respectable 4-6 campaign in 2016, are hoping to start there.\n\n\"If we could get a win that would be awesome and great for the program next year,\" senior lineman Luis Ortiz said. \"But if we can't, we're still going to push (the younger players) and drive them that they can do it.\"\n\nAdded Glennon: \"That's obviously the goal. We're not going to talk too much about it. But obviously as coaches and players we want to win some games. It'll be nice to break that ceiling.\"\n\nInside the huddle\n\nHead coach: Matt Glennon (first season in current stint, 4-16 during previous two-year stint) (OC)\n\nStaff: Steve Kline (DC), Mark Gibson, Stephuan Montouth, Colin Greenawalt, Mike Dowling, Justin Jayne\n\nOffense: triple option\n\nDefense: 4-3\n\nClassification: 6A\n\nLast YA division title: 1976\n\nLast District 3 appearance: none\n\nLast District 3 playoff win: none\n\nDistrict 3 titles: none\n\nYork County Tech 2019 schedule\n\n8/23 @ James Buchanan\n\n8/31 vs. West Perry\n\n9/7 vs. Schuylkill Valley\n\n9/14 vs. Delone Catholic\n\n9/20 @ Hanover\n\n9/27 @ Littlestown\n\n10/5 vs. Biglerville\n\n10/11 @ Bermudian Springs\n\n10/19 vs. Fairfield\n\n10/26 vs. York Catholic\n\n11/1 @ Kennard-Dale (exhibition)\n\n2018 results\n\n8/24 @ James Buchanan L, 32-9\n\n8/31 @ West Perry L, 65-5\n\n9/7 @ Schuylkill Valley L, 47-6\n\n9/14 @ Delone Catholic L, 55-0\n\n9/22 vs. Hanover L, 44-12\n\n9/29 vs. Littlestown L, 62-0\n\n10/5 @ Biglerville L, 28-0\n\n10/13 vs. Bermudian Springs L, 54-0\n\n10/26 @ Fairfield L, 47-16\n\n10/26 @ York Catholic L, 49-8\n\n11/3 vs. Kennard-Dale (exhibition) L, 44-0", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/23/investing/irs-delays-threshold-increase-for-business-transactions/index.html", "title": "IRS delays rule change for people who get paid on Venmo, Etsy ...", "text": "New York CNN ‚Äî\n\nAnyone getting paid for their goods and services through apps like Venmo, PayPal or CashApp, or platforms like Etsy and Airbnb, just got a reprieve from the IRS.\n\nFollowing concerns expressed by the tax community, the electronic transactions industry and some lawmakers, the IRS said Friday it would delay by one year the implementation of a rule change that would have resulted in a virtual paper chase of tax forms going out by January 31, 2023, to anyone using such apps for their business transactions.\n\nThe rule change requires third-party payment platforms to issue a 1099-K to the IRS and the app user for business transaction payments if they add up to more than $600 over the course of the year. A business transaction that is taxable is defined as a payment for a good or service, including tips.\n\nIt used to be those platforms only had to issue you a 1099-K if you engaged in more than 200 business transactions for which you received total payments of more than $20,000 in a year.\n\n‚ÄúThe IRS and Treasury heard a number of concerns regarding the timeline of implementation of these changes under the American Rescue Plan,‚Äù said Acting IRS Commissioner Doug O‚ÄôDonnell. ‚ÄúTo help smooth the transition and ensure clarity for taxpayers, tax professionals and industry, the IRS will delay implementation of the 1099-K changes. The additional time will help reduce confusion during the upcoming 2023 tax filing season and provide more time for taxpayers to prepare and understand the new reporting requirements.‚Äù\n\nIndeed, the increase in 1099-Ks issued early next year for people‚Äôs 2022 tax returns was expected to be, in a word, ‚Äúginormous,‚Äù according to Wendy Walker, who chairs the information reporting subgroup on the Internal Revenue Service Advisory Council.\n\nWalker works as a solution principal for Sovos, which helps more than 30,000 business clients with tax compliance, including the issuance of all types of 1099s, of which there are at least 16 different varieties.\n\nSome businesses that only had to issue a couple thousand 1099-Ks under the prior rules were looking at a couple hundred thousand, she noted. ‚ÄúOur clients ‚Ä¶ have reported enormous increases in their potential filing obligations as result of the threshold change,‚Äù Walker said.\n\nMeanwhile, those receiving 1099-Ks for the first time will have to figure out what portion of the amount reported on the form is actually taxable versus what portion represents payments that may be deductible business expenses, such as a fee paid to the payment platform or a credit issued to the business, Walker said.\n\n‚ÄúPeople are just not going to understand how to take that gross amount and then work off the deductions to get to their taxable amount.‚Äù\n\nWelcome news to companies having to issue tax forms\n\nThe move was welcomed by those representing third-party payment platforms.\n\n‚ÄúGiven the potential confusion the reporting requirement would cause, we applaud the delay, ‚Äù said Scott Talbott, spokesman for the Electronic Transactions Association. ‚ÄúThe $600 reporting requirement is not worth the problems it would cause. ETA will keep working to increase the threshold to a realistic amount.‚Äù\n\nHow does ETA define realistic? A threshold that falls between $10,000 and $20,000, Talbott said. ‚ÄúETA supports a reporting threshold that ties into regular businesses and not consumers occasionally selling a handbag or a bike online.‚Äù\n\nWhat the new rule doesn‚Äôt do\n\nThe new rule doesn‚Äôt impose any additional taxes on anyone. Nor does it change your obligation as a taxpayer to always report to the IRS all of your taxable income from your business activities.\n\nBut the 1099-K reporting will make it harder for someone to evade the taxes they owe by underreporting their business income.\n\nThe rule also does not apply to personal transactions you conduct on an electronic payment platform. For example, if a friend sends you money through Venmo to help pay for a dinner out or your mother sends you some spending money.\n\nLastly, the 1099-K reporting rule does not apply to any transactions made through Zelle. That‚Äôs because Zelle is a payments clearinghouse that connects the payer‚Äôs bank account directly to the receiver‚Äôs bank account. ‚ÄúZelle facilitates messaging between financial institutions, but does not hold accounts or handle settlement of funds,‚Äù the company said in a statement earlier this year.\n\nBut the IRS may still get reporting on at least some of your business transactions on Zelle, Walker said.\n\nIf there is a business-to-business payment over the Zelle network, the business that makes the payment must provide the receiving business and the IRS with either a 1099-NEC for non-employee compensation or a 1099-MISC for other expenses, she explained.\n\nLike the 1099-K, those other forms also provide information to the IRS that will make it harder for businesses to understate their income in a tax year.", "authors": ["Jeanne Sahadi"], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/preps/2019/12/22/all-big-bend-cross-country-fsu-getting-runners-year-caitlin-wilkey-jay-brown/2659346001/", "title": "All-Big Bend cross country: FSU getting Runners of the Year Caitlin ...", "text": "Five wins this cross country season was almost a foregone conclusion for Maclay senior Jay Brown. It was the complete opposite for Chiles senior Caitlin Wilkey.\n\nThough each found their way path to season-long success in different ways, they share a couple unique traits.\n\nTheir dogged competitiveness and work ethic materialized quickly and didn‚Äôt let up, leading to area-leading times, district titles, and third-place state finishes.\n\nBrown is the All-Big Bend Runner of the Year for the second straight season, while Wilkey ascends to the mantle of Runner of the Year won in previous years by teammates she emulated this season.\n\nContinuing their united resume, both will graduate and become Florida State runners with skill sets ranging from middle distance on the track to longer racing in the woods.\n\nFEATURED:Maclay's Brown, Chiles' Wilkey add more wins to senior cross-country seasons\n\n‚ÄúWhen I think back on it, it was long in the moment, but the past three, four seasons in track, cross country, and baseball went by super fast,‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just excited for the next level.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt feels really great to get this honor after watching my two teammates get it the previous two years,‚Äù Wilkey said about current Mississippi State runner Ana Wallace and current Florida runner Emily Culley. ‚ÄúRunner of the Year is a really big deal and I‚Äôm really excited about it.‚Äù\n\nBrown entered with huge expectations. He was the front-runner to win a Class 1A state title and only backed up those early projections with in-season results. As mentioned, he won five times, but he also ran sub-16:00 eight times this season after doing it just once last year.\n\nHe peaked with a 15:14 result at the prestigious Great American Cross Country Festival in North Carolina, took fourth at the FSU Invitational elite race a week later, and headed into the postseason ready to go for gold.\n\nThat didn‚Äôt materialize in the state race, but he was still 15 seconds faster than the third-place result he had as a junior. And now the double gold state champion from track season is angling to finish his senior year back on top.\n\n2019 STATE TRACK:Maclay double gold winner Brown among area's top performances\n\n2019 STATE XC ROUNDUP:Maclay, Leon celebrate high team, individual finishes\n\n‚ÄúThe season as a whole wasn‚Äôt disappointing, it was just that one race that threw me off,‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúBut knowing I have track to back it up is super helpful. It fuels me to keep going and get better. I know I‚Äôm not at the top until I do more than I‚Äôve done.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not always a good thing to keep winning because you forget what losing was like, and you have no reason to win, you‚Äôre just doing it. This tells me I need to work a little harder than I did or do something else. There‚Äôs always room for change and to get better.‚Äù\n\nWilkey, by contrast, had never won a cross country race until this season. But an offseason dedicated to fitness, the same way Culley and Wallace transformed themselves before dominating senior seasons, upped Wilkey to a whole other level.\n\nShe won the first four races she competed in, heading into the FSU Invitational. There she broke 18:00 for the first time, running 17:54 to finish sixth in the girls elite race.\n\nFSU INVITATIONAL:Cross country runners Churchill, Wilkey, Brown finish high in pre-state elite races\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know what to expect this season,‚Äù Wilkey said. ‚ÄúI knew I‚Äôd trained hard over the summer and had a good track season to set me up for some good success. I knew it would be a good season, I just didn‚Äôt know what to expect. But after the first two races, I knew it could be something special ‚Äì get some good times and win some races.\n\n‚ÄúThe culture has definitely made an impact on my career and set the bar really high. It‚Äôs made me set goals higher than I thought I could make, and I‚Äôve reached them. I never thought I‚Äôd be here freshman year, so I‚Äôm really happy.‚Äù\n\nIt got even better after that.\n\nWinning a district title and taking second at region, Wilkey headed back to Apalachee Regional Park and posted a 17:45 run at state to finish third as the Timberwolves finished state runner-up.\n\nIt was the third-best area time ever, trailing only Wallace and former Chiles great Lily Williams, and her state run was one second faster than Wallace's when she won a state title. Wilkey's four years yielded two state titles and two state runner-ups.\n\nSTATE XC:Chiles' girls cross country team captures Class 4A runner-up trophy at FHSAA state meet\n\nWATCH:Chiles XC runner Caitlin Wilkey takes 3rd at state as Timberwolves get runner-up\n\n‚ÄúCaitlin is so sweet, but she was tired of being in people‚Äôs shadows,‚Äù Timberwolves coach Mike Phillips said. ‚ÄúFor her to only trail Lily and Ana in Chiles‚Äô history is unbelievable.\n\n‚ÄúShe‚Äôs No. 2 in the 800, No. 3 in cross country, up there in the mile, and she hasn‚Äôt really embraced the two-mile, but clearly she‚Äôd be a great two-miler. She‚Äôs going to have an amazing track season and step over a lot of people again. She has the potential to be from top to bottom, the best overall. That‚Äôs saying a lot.‚Äù\n\nFlorida State is the recipient of our area‚Äôs greatness.\n\nBrown will get to join up with the Seminoles and some close friends. Gabriel Curtis, who won the state title ahead of Brown last year while running for Mount Dora Christian, is there, as is former Chiles star Connor Phillips, who dueled head-to-head with Brown all last season.\n\n‚ÄúGoing to FSU was a back-up plan in the beginning of my junior year, and I didn‚Äôt decide I wanted to go to FSU until two weeks before state (my senior year),‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúIt was just right timing. I had intentions of getting out of Tallahassee, going to the west coast or a super big school. I realized FSU had everything I wanted in Tallahassee. It‚Äôs the perfect place.‚Äù\n\nBrown hopes to head into FSU with a couple more gold medals under his belt while lowering his track times.\n\nWilkey intends to do the same, and her and teammate Alyson Churchill, who will also run for the ‚ÄôNoles, will lead a super tough Timberwolves track contingent.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a dream to run for the home team,‚Äù Wilkey said. ‚ÄúI was willing to look at other options, and I did, but I felt like FSU was the best school and fit for me. It had the most to offer running and academically. I was really impressed.\n\n‚ÄúChiles has just meant so much to me. Every year has been different but special. I have great memories with every single dynamic. I have really good memories from high school, so hopefully there will be good memories in college.‚Äù\n\nChiles‚Äô Phillips, Leon‚Äôs Wills honored as Coaches of the Year\n\nEveryone knew historically what Chiles had done in previous season and that it would be vying for a third consecutive state title while moving up a class to Class 4A.\n\nBut the scoring was basically Wilkey and Churchill and the hope that others would materialize to aid the scoring.\n\nIn the end, Chiles finished as Class 4A state runner-up, but it came as seniors Megan Churchill and Emily Molen emerged to become first-team All-Big Bend runners for the first time, and the Timberwolves saw three sophomores and an unknown senior yield unexpected results to acquire another state trophy.\n\nFor his efforts building that achievement, third-year Chiles coach Mike Phillips has been named the 2019 All-Big Bend Coach of the Year in girls cross country.\n\n‚ÄúIf anyone was really paying attention to our changes, I don‚Äôt think anyone would have given us a chance to get to second with only two known entities,‚Äù Phillips said. ‚ÄúBut we got a lot out of some young girls and some seniors were more consistent than they have been. They were replacing girls on back-to-back state championship teams, so I‚Äôm definitely proud of how those girls stepped up.\n\n‚ÄúLast year, I knew it would be a really special team going in. This year, I thought we had a chance but everything would have to fall into place. I didn‚Äôt know what we were getting into going to 4A, but I knew we had two really good girls and then it was just a matter of whether other girls would step up, and they did. It was gratifying to get those girls to buy into the hard work needed to be in that starting role.‚Äù\n\nFor the first time since 2012, veteran Leon coach Andrew Willis the boys All-Big Bend Coach of the Year.\n\nIt hasn‚Äôt been a total dry spell since then, but the runner-up seasons just happened to come at times when Chiles‚Äô boys won it all.\n\nBut prior years were rough, and Leon even saw its 10-year state appearance streak end.\n\nThat wasn‚Äôt the case this year. Led by sophomore Jackson Yarbrough, freshman Jake Rogers, and senior Bryson Gonzalez ‚Äì all first-team runners this season ‚Äì the Lions not only beat Chiles head-to-head several times, but they won district and regional titles before finishing third in Class 3A.\n\nPOSTSEASON:Resurgent Leon boys and girls cross country teams win District 1-3A titles\n\nMORE:Maclay cross country wins two regional titles; Leon's boys, Chiles' girls grab firsts\n\n‚ÄúIt re-energizes you and provides a little more purpose,‚Äù Wills said. ‚ÄúIf they want it, you want it. And it‚Äôs our job to make them want it, too. It‚Äôs just more fun when you‚Äôre competitive.

When a Journal Sentinel reporter tweeted that the selection of Fackrell made it unlikely Neal would return, Neal responded emphatically: 'You're 100% right.'\n\nThough Neal later backpedaled from his remark ‚Äî he used the word 'sarcasm' in subsequent tweets and alluded to playing games with the media ‚Äî the Packers seem to have a different interpretation. Director of player personnel Eliot Wolf spoke to the media Saturday afternoon and said, quite simply, that Neal had 'moved on' from the team.\n\n'I think it's a priority,' Wolf said in response to a question about adding size to the defense. 'Obviously with B.J. (Raji) retiring, we lost some guys up front, and Mike Neal's moved on so it just looks like something that we addressed as need, and we've been able to fill it so far. Couple more picks to go.'\n\nLater in the afternoon, Thompson held a news conference to offer his thoughts on the draft overall. When asked if the Packers intended to proceed without Neal on the roster, Thompson quickly backtracked from Wolf's comment.\n\n'I wouldn't characterize it like that,' Thompson said. 'There's a lot of different things that can happen during the course of an off-season that would change things. So I wouldn't be strong enough to say that.'\n\nWithout Neal, the Packers have six outside linebackers on the roster: Clay Matthews, Julius Peppers, Nick Perry, Jayrone Elliott, Lerentee McCray and Fackrell.\n\nWest-side connection: Sam Seale has been mining the West Coast for gridiron gems since 1995, but this draft may have been his best cache yet.\n\nThe Packers longtime scout who loves his sun and his 7-iron while living in San Diego clearly didn't spend too much time on the golf courses this last year, because he filled Green Bay's 2016 draft class with players hailing from UCLA, California and Stanford.\n\nThe former two-way player (receiver and defensive back) for the old Los Angeles Raiders goes way back to the Ron Wolf era with this team, and his opinion carries a lot of weight now with Thompson and the Packers front office.\n\n'I love Sam. I've known him forever, he worked for my dad. He really works hard,' said Wolf. 'He knows the players, knows his area, and he's not afraid to give his opinion. He's not afraid to stand up and say, 'Ted, I hate this guy.' He's a good guy to work with.'\n\nThe Packers never make scouts available to the media ‚Äî except on draft weekend. And Seale said Saturday that while he once may have had higher aspirations in this business, he's very content at this stage in his life and career. He's made the most of his role.\n\n'Ron Wolf told me he didn't bring me in here to be a yes guy,' said Seale. 'And another thing he told me, this isn't a science. You're going to be wrong. Just don't be wrong all the time. It's a hit and miss thing. You never know about a kid.'\n\nFrom Thompson's perspective, he said he had to trust and validate the opinions of his scouts and his trust in Seale is obvious.\n\n'You have to give those guys enough space and enough rope to blossom as people, and not only people but scouts. If you don't, if you're just going to ignore what they say and go your own way and go with what you're thinking all the time, then you're going to squelch their ability to do great things themselves,' said Thompson.\n\n'Sam and I have worked together for a long time. It means a lot to work with a guy for that long.'\n\nTED THOMPSON'S PICKS\n\nTotal: 111 Offense: 58 Defense: 52 Specialists: 1\n\nPOSITION-BY-POSITION\n\nQuarterbacks (6): Aaron Rodgers (2005-1), Ingle Martin (2006-5a), Brian Brohm (2008-2b), Matt Flynn (2008-7a), B.J.

You‚Äôd be wrong. But you wouldn‚Äôt be alone in coming to that mistaken conclusion, because the system behind food label dates is an absolute mess.\n\nThere‚Äôs no national standard for how those dates should be determined, or how they must be described. Instead, there‚Äôs a patchwork system ‚Äî a hodgepodge of state laws, best practices and general guidelines.\n\n‚ÄúIt is a complete Wild West,‚Äù said Dana Gunders, executive director of ReFed, a nonprofit trying to end food waste. And yet, ‚Äúmany consumers really believe that they are being told to throw the food out, or that even when they don‚Äôt make that choice, that they‚Äôre sort of breaking some rule,‚Äù she said.\n\nFor food makers, sell-by dates actually are more about protecting the brand than safety concerns, explained Andy Harig, vice president of sustainability, tax and trade at FMI, a food industry association.\n\nThe sell-by date, often referred to as the expiration date, is the company‚Äôs estimate of when a food item will taste best, its optimal date. ‚ÄúYou want people to eat and enjoy the product when it‚Äôs at its peak, because that‚Äôs going to increase their enjoyment, [and] encourage them to buy it again,‚Äù he said.\n\nConfused about what food label dates mean? You're not alone. Wang Ying/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nThe main consequence of this unclear labeling? Food waste. Lots of it.\n\n‚ÄúConsumer uncertainty about the meaning of the dates ‚Ä¶ is believed to contribute to about 20 percent of food waste in the home,‚Äù the Food and Drug Administration wrote in a 2019 post.\n\nWasted food often ends up in landfills, making it a major contributor to climate change. By some estimates, food loss and waste makes up 8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nWasting food also means wasting money, which many consumers can‚Äôt afford, especially now as grocery prices soar. And food that is thrown out is diverted from food banks, where it is desperately needed.\n\nThough many companies put dates on their products, baby formula is the only food that is required to have use-by dates in the United States, said Meredith Carothers, a food safety expert with the USDA‚Äôs Food Safety and Inspection Service.\n\nCompanies choose dates based on when they think an item tastes best. But FSIS has its own safety recommendations. Many canned goods can last on shelves for anywhere between one and five years, according to the agency, if properly stored. Under the right conditions, packages of rice and dried pasta can last about two years. The FDA offers food storage tips and guidelines on its website.\n\nBut the rules are wildly different for many perishables.\n\nWhile consuming shelf-stable items after a ‚Äúbest if used by date,‚Äù is likely fine, fresh meat and poultry could go bad even before the date on the label. That‚Äôs because store refrigerators tend to be colder than our home fridges, explained Carothers.\n\nOnce consumers take meat and poultry home, they should follow home-storage rules, she said. The FSIS instructs people to cook or freeze some meats within two days of bringing them home from the store.\n\nHow we got here\n\nManufacturers began printing sell-by information on products in the early 20th century. At first, the date was written in code: Retail employees had to match each code to a date using a key, but to customers the codes were incomprehensible.\n\nIn the 1970s, grocery shoppers clamored for more information about the quality of food on supermarket shelves. Under pressure from activists, including the distribution of pamphlets deciphering sell-by codes, food makers began to put dates on their labels.\n\nAt first, this ‚Äúopen dating‚Äù tactic appeared to be working.\n\nIn February 1973, The New York Times ran an article headlined ‚ÄúFood Dating is Found to Please Customers and Reduce Losses.‚Äù The piece pointed to a study conducted by the USDA and the Consumer Research Institute, a group backed by food manufacturers, which concluded that open dating had slashed by half the number of consumer complaints of purchasing stale or spoiled food.\n\nFood manufactures started sharing sell-by dates with consumers about 50 years ago. Bebeto Matthews/AP\n\nBut by the end of the decade, those examining the system were less convinced of its merits.\n\nA 1979 study by the now-defunct Office of Technology Assessment noted that open dating may not have been the right way to quell consumer fears.\n\n‚ÄúThere is little evidence to support or to negate the contention that there is a direct relationship between open shelf-life dating and the actual freshness of food,‚Äù the study found.\n\nThere‚Äôs no way to ‚Äúaccurately determine dates for various products, no consensus on which type of date or dates ‚Ä¶ to use for which product, or even which products to date at all, and no real guidelines as to how to display the date,‚Äù the report‚Äôs authors wrote.\n\nDecades later, we‚Äôre still in the same boat. ‚Äú‚Äã‚ÄãThere are no uniform or universally accepted descriptions used on food labels for open dating in the United States,‚Äù according to the USDA‚Äôs current guidance.\n\nThe FDA said that manufacturers can‚Äôt place false or misleading information on labels, but that ‚Äúthey are not required to obtain agency approval of the voluntary quality-based date labels they use or specify how they arrived at the date they‚Äôve applied.‚Äù Carothers, from the FSIS, reiterated that dates can be applied as long as they don‚Äôt mislead customers and comply with the service‚Äôs labeling regulations.\n\nWhere we go next: The sniff test\n\nTo avoid food waste, some advocates encourage people to rely on their senses when determining whether certain foods are safe to eat.\n\nThe British retailer Morrisons said early this year that it is removing ‚Äúsell by‚Äù dates from some of its branded milk, switching instead to ‚Äúbest before‚Äù dates and encouraging customers to decide whether to discard the product based on how it looks and smells.\n\nMorrisons offered these guidelines to consumers: if it looks curdled or smells sour, ditch it. If it looks and smells okay, you can consume it even after the date.\n\nMorrisons said this year that it is eliminating dates from its branded milks in some markets. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n‚ÄúWhen food is decayed past the point where we‚Äôd want to eat it, our defenses work very well,‚Äù said ReFed‚Äôs Gunders. ‚ÄúIf food doesn‚Äôt look good, if it doesn‚Äôt smell good, if it doesn‚Äôt taste good, if it‚Äôs slimy ‚Ä¶ then absolutely, we should not eat that food.‚Äù\n\nIn general, Gunders recommended that those who are concerned about food safety remain strict about consuming food before the sell-by date if it has a ‚Äúhigher potential to carry listeria.‚Äù One way to identify those items? They‚Äôre the foods that pregnant women are told to stay away from, she said.\n\nAnother way to prevent confusion, experts say, is to regulate the language used to describe these dates.\n\n‚ÄúBest by‚Äù versus ‚ÄúUse by‚Äù\n\nThe Food Date Labeling Act of 2021, introduced in December of last year, wants manufacturers to use ‚Äúuse by,‚Äù or ‚Äúbest if used by‚Äù only before dates on labels. The bill is the latest in a series of legislative efforts to make a national labeling standard.\n\nHere‚Äôs the logic: Companies that decide to put a date on labels have to make clear to consumers whether the item is potentially unsafe after that date, or if it just tastes a little off. If it‚Äôs a safety issue, they have to use ‚Äúuse by.‚Äù If it‚Äôs about food quality, ‚Äúbest if used by‚Äù is the way to go.\n\nGunders and agencies like the FDA and USDA point to this label harmonization as a good solution. Many companies have already made the transition.\n\nDel Monte, which sells canned fruits and vegetables among other products, uses ‚Äúbest if used by.‚Äù In an email, the company explained that the dates ‚Äúare a guideline.‚Äù Dole, which has dates on its packaged salads, also uses the ‚Äúbest if used by‚Äù label.\n\nEven if the bill becomes law and all companies make the same changes, there will still be a missing piece of the puzzle: Alerting consumers to the shift and what it means.\n\nAfter all, consumers who pick up an item today won‚Äôt necessarily know that ‚Äúuse by‚Äù is distinct from ‚Äúbest if used by,‚Äù or if either of those are different from something like ‚Äúenjoy by,‚Äù or ‚Äúsell by.‚Äù\n\nTo make the dates clearer to the public, there needs to be a ‚Äúconsistent and engaged effort to help consumers think through this,‚Äù said FMI‚Äôs Harig. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs going to take some work to figure it out.‚Äù", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/15/politics/classified-information-what-matters/index.html", "title": "The number of people with Top Secret clearance will shock you ...", "text": "A version of this story appears in CNN‚Äôs What Matters newsletter.

Jon Elswick/AP\n\nThere are other questions, of course. Did he take the material because he thought they were ‚Äúcool,‚Äù like some kind of trophy? Or did he see some advantage in having them, The New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman wondered during an appearance on CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúNew Day‚Äù on Monday.\n\nWere the documents related to Roger Stone‚Äôs pardon by Trump somehow key evidence? What is behind the appearance of material on the ‚ÄúPresident of France‚Äù in the receipt for what was taken?\n\nThe imagination runs wild in the absence of facts.\n\nTrump has now demanded the documents be returned, even though presidential papers, under US law, are not his property.\n\nThe most tantalizing detail is that 11 sets of documents were classified.\n\nIt‚Äôs shining a light on the system of classification by which the government hides information from its people in the name of everyone‚Äôs national security.\n\nMore than a million people have Top Secret clearance\n\nIt‚Äôs actually a very large universe of people with access to Top Secret data.\n\nThe Director of National Intelligence publishes what is described as an annual report, ‚ÄúSecurity Clearance Determinations,‚Äù although the most recent one I could find was from 2017.\n\nIn it, more than 2.8 million people are described as having security clearance as of October 2017 ‚Äì more than 1.6 million have access to either Confidential or Secret information and nearly 1.2 million are described as having access to Top Secret information.\n\nThere are additional people who have security clearance but don‚Äôt currently have access to information. This includes civilian employees, contractors and members of the military.\n\nAgencies control their own classified data. They are supposed to declassify it\n\nThat doesn‚Äôt mean more than 1 million people have access to whatever Top Secret documents were lying around Mar-a-Lago. Each agency that deals in classification has its own system and is supposed to be involved in declassifying its own documents.\n\nTrump‚Äôs defenders have argued he had put in place an order to declassify any documents he took from the Oval Office to the residence during his time in the White House, although professionals have said this claim can‚Äôt be true.\n\n‚ÄúThe idea that the president can declassify documents simply by moving them from one physical location to another is nonsense on so many levels,‚Äù said Shawn Turner, a CNN analyst and former director of communication for US National Intelligence, during a Monday appearance on ‚ÄúInside Politics.‚Äù\n\nThere‚Äôs an official process\n\nTurner said the process for declassification must include signoff from the agency that classified the information in the first place in order to protect the intelligence-gathering process, its sources and methods.\n\nPresidents have periodically used executive orders to update the official system by which classified information is declassified.\n\nMost recently, then-President Barack Obama put in place Executive Order 13526 in 2009. That‚Äôs still the official policy since neither Trump nor President Joe Biden updated it.\n\nThe government might soon change the process\n\nBiden started a review of how classified data is handled earlier this summer. Here‚Äôs an exhaustive Congressional Research Service report on the declassification process.\n\nBiden‚Äôs review will reexamine the three general levels of classification.\n\nLevels of classification\n\nCNN‚Äôs Katie Lobosco wrote a very good primer on classified data last week. Here‚Äôs her description of the three levels of classification:\n\nTop Secret ‚Äì This is the highest level of classification. Information is classified as Top Secret if it ‚Äúreasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security,‚Äù according to a 2009 executive order that describes the classification system.\n\nA subset of Top Secret documents known as SCI, or sensitive compartmented information, is reserved for certain information derived from intelligence sources. Access to an SCI document can be even further restricted to a smaller group of people with specific security clearances.\n\nSome of the materials recovered from Trump‚Äôs Florida home were marked as Top Secret SCI.\n\nSecret ‚Äì Information is classified as Secret if the information is deemed to be able to cause ‚Äúserious damage‚Äù to national security if revealed.\n\nConfidential ‚Äì Confidential is the least sensitive level of classification, applied to information that is reasonably expected to cause ‚Äúdamage‚Äù to national security if disclosed.\n\nWhat kinds of things are Top Secret?\n\nThe former CIA officer David Priess, who is now publisher of the website Lawfare, said on ‚ÄúNew Day‚Äù that no matter the specific classification, it‚Äôs information the government has an interest in not being made public.\n\nIt could be intelligence gathered on the North Korean nuclear program or Russian military operations, for example.\n\nLeaks can be disastrous or deadly\n\nThe government often gets this type of information by asking people to risk their lives or using technology it doesn‚Äôt want adversaries to know about.\n\nTalking about it on Monday morning, Priess became emotional.\n\n‚ÄúExposing this information put people‚Äôs lives at risk,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a joke. We know people who have died serving their country this way.‚Äù\n\nWhat took so long?\n\nThe larger question than what‚Äôs classified, Priess argued, is why, if the government knew the documents were at Mar-a-Lago, it took investigators so long to go get them.\n\nIn order for a president to declassify anything, he argued, there still needs to be a paper trail so everyone knows something is declassified.\n\n‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre not marked declassified and other documents with the same information aren‚Äôt also declassified, did it really happen? If there‚Äôs no record of it, how do you even know?‚Äù\n\nWe may not know more for a very long time\n\nThe problem now may be that imaginations will run wild about what is in the documents.\n\nIt could be a very long time before American voters have any idea what this was all really about.\n\n‚ÄúTechnically we won‚Äôt see any further action on this case on the legal docket unless and until DOJ brings criminal charges against any person,‚Äù said CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig, also on ‚ÄúNew Day.‚Äù\n\nRELATED: DOJ opposes making public details in Mar-a-Lago search warrant‚Äôs probable cause affidavit\n\nAlready there is some speculation that rather than pursue charges, the government was simply trying to secure the data.\n\nClassified information can stay that way for years and years ‚Äì between 10 and 25, according to the declassification guidelines signed by Obama.\n\nThe standard is that if something no longer needs to be classified, it should be declassified. And if it needs to be classified past that 25-year period, it can be.\n\nLook at the Top Secret documents of yore\n\nThe FBI, CIA and State Department all have online reading rooms of previously classified data released through the Freedom of Information Act. None of it is very recent stuff.\n\nThe case of Trump‚Äôs Mar-a-Lago documents seems special, however, and there are already bipartisan calls from Sens. Mark Warner and Marco Rubio ‚Äì the top elected officials on the Senate Intelligence Committee ‚Äì to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and Attorney General Merrick Garland asking for more information about what was taken by the FBI.\n\nExamples of prosecutions\n\nProsecutions for mishandling of classified data can involve high-profile figures.\n\nFor example, retired general and former CIA Director David Petraeus gave classified information to his mistress, who was writing a book about him. He ultimately pleaded guilty, paid a $100,000 fine and got two years of probation.\n\nWhat data did he mishandle? From CNN‚Äôs report at the time: During his time as commander in Afghanistan, Petraeus kept personal notes including classified information in eight 5-by-8 inch black notebooks. The classified information (included) identity of covert officers, war strategy, notes from diplomatic and national security meetings and security code words.\n\nOther figures are not as familiar ‚Äì like Asia Janay Lavarello, a civilian Defense Department employee working in the US Embassy in Manila, who took classified documents to her hotel room and her house while she was working on a thesis project. She got three months in prison.", "authors": ["Zachary B. Wolf"], "publish_date": "2022/08/15"}]}

Asked to rate the severity of six specific mental health concerns, Americans put the opioid epidemic near the top, with more than two-thirds of people identifying it as a crisis rather than merely a problem. More than half identified mental health issues among children and teenagers as a crisis, as well as severe mental illness in adults.\n\nThe survey captured the perceptions of a nationally representative sample of about 2,000 adults over the summer ‚Äì 2¬Ω years into the Covid-19 pandemic and amid ongoing public health threats including racism and gun violence.\n\nThe broad concern is well-founded, rooted in both personal experience and national trends.\n\n‚ÄúThe Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated numerous social stressors that we know can increase the risk of both substance use and mental illness,‚Äù said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nData from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that drug overdose deaths reached record levels in 2021 and suicide rates were back near a record high after two years of decline. And in 2020, mental health-related visits to emergency rooms jumped 31% among adolescents ages 12 to 17.\n\nAccording to the CNN and KFF poll, about half of adults say they have had a severe mental health crisis in their family, including in-person treatment for family members who were a threat to themselves or others, or family members who engaged in self-harming behaviors.\n\nMore than 1 in 5 adults describe their own mental health as only ‚Äúfair‚Äù or ‚Äúpoor,‚Äù including extra-large shares of adults under the age of 30, adults who identify as LGBT and those with an annual income of less than $40,000. A third of all adults said they felt anxious always or often over the course of the past year, including more than half of LGBT adults and those under 30. About 1 in 5 adults said they were often or always depressed or lonely over the past year, too.\n\nMajor sources of stress for a third or more of adults include personal finances and current and political events. About 1 in 4 adults also identified personal relationships and work, respectively, as major sources of stress.\n\nAccording to the new survey, about 1 in 5 adults received mental health services in the past year. Earlier data published by the CDC supports that finding and shows that mental health treatment became more common over the course of the pandemic: Nearly 22% of adults got mental health treatment in 2021, up from about 19% in 2019.\n\n‚ÄúPerhaps one of the only benefits of the pandemic and the shift that our country has been going through is the increase in our willingness to acknowledge and talk about when we might be struggling or in need of support,‚Äù said Sarah Brummett, director of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention‚Äôs executive committee.\n\n‚ÄúPeople are more willing to roll up their sleeves and talk about it and support folks. And I think that‚Äôs progress.‚Äù\n\nDespite increased willingness and commonly shared stressors among the public, most adults who have only fair or poor mental health said they don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking to loved ones about it ‚Äì some to maintain privacy and some to avoid the shame and stigma attached to mental health issues.\n\nBut the vast majority ‚Äì more than 4 out of 5 ‚Äì of those surveyed say individuals and families should play a major role in addressing mental health problems in the US, equal to the share who say the same of health care providers.\n\nExperts say there is an opportunity to broaden perceptions about how mental health is part of overall physical health and how to respond to mental health crises.\n\n‚ÄúNot everyone‚Äôs a cardiologist, but a lot of people are trained in CPR,‚Äù said Justin Baker, a psychologist and assistant professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. ‚ÄúIf we only rely on the mental health force, we‚Äôre going to keep going around in circles and never actually get anywhere. I think we see this as all of our problems.‚Äù\n\nNonetheless, the groups most likely to say they need mental health care in the US are also less likely to say they can get it.\n\nNearly 6 out of 10 adults who say their mental health is only fair or poor say they have not been able to get needed care, as well as about half of adults younger than 30 and LGBT adults.\n\nFor those who have gone without help, the most common reasons cited were being too busy or unable to take time off work, being unable to afford the cost, and being afraid or embarrassed to seek care, according to the CNN and KFF survey.\n\nIn his first State of the Union address, President Joe Biden outlined a multipronged strategy to address the country‚Äôs mental health crisis, including goals to integrate mental health into primary care, investing in the work force and new approaches to programs that provide care.\n\n‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get all Americans the mental health services they need, more people they can turn to for help and full parity between physical and mental health care,‚Äù he said in his address in March.\n\nAccording to the poll, most Americans see those issues as significant problems. A majority, 55%, say it‚Äôs a big problem that there aren‚Äôt enough mental health care providers, about three-quarters say that insurers not covering mental health the way they do physical health is a significant concern, and 80% say the same about the cost of mental health care.\n\nThrough the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration has invested $5 billion in mental health and substance use programs through the US Department of Health and Human Services, with billions more proposed in future budgets.\n\nOne significant shift came this summer, with the transition of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to a three-digit dialing code: 988. Early data suggests success, with calls jumping 45% in the first month compared with the same time a year before.\n\nBut according to the new survey, there is still work to be done.\n\nThe vast majority of adults (85%) say they would be at least somewhat likely to call the hotline if they or a loved one were experiencing a mental health crisis ‚Äì and it‚Äôs a good alternative to 911, which about a quarter of adults, especially Black and LGBT adults, say would do more harm than good in a mental health crisis situation.\n\nIt also has potential to help Hispanic people and those who are uninsured, who are more likely than average to say they don‚Äôt know who to call if there is a mental health crisis and would not know where to find services.\n\nYet more than half of adults in the new poll say they have heard ‚Äúnothing at all‚Äù about the new 988 hotline.\n\n‚ÄúThis can be a preventable public health issue, and we all have a role to play,‚Äù Brummett said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe fieldwork for the CNN/KFF Mental Health Survey was conducted by SSRS on July 28 through August 9 among a random national sample of 2,004 adults.

But it‚Äôs much worse in certain areas: In Rhode Island, for example, beds are 99% full.\n\nSeasonal respiratory viruses fill children‚Äôs hospitals every year, but the number of beds that are full now is well above the average.\n\nOver the past couple years, only about two-thirds of pediatric beds have typically been in use ‚Äì and that includes the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a CNN analysis of data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nDriving much of the current need for beds at children‚Äôs hospitals is a spike in cases of RSV, which are 60% higher than at 2021‚Äôs peak. The early start to the flu season and an increase in other respiratory viruses are compounding the need for care, on top of all the usual demands like kids with broken bones or asthma attacks.\n\nChildren‚Äôs National Hospital in Washington, DC, warned last week that ‚Äúthis surge in illness is exacerbated by the national healthcare workforce shortages.‚Äù A child with a life-threatening emergency will not wait, the statement said, but ‚Äúfamilies who come to us with non-urgent issues will experience long waits to be seen.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe wait times in county emergency departments and children‚Äôs hospitals are stretching to longer they‚Äôve ever been,‚Äù said Dr. Meghan Bernier, medical director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\n\nComplicating the issue is that the staff shortage problem isn‚Äôt new and won‚Äôt be solved quickly. US hospitals have been dealing with it for years.\n\nMissing nurses the most\n\nThe country needs more doctors and technicians, as shortages are growing in both areas, experts say ‚Äì but the lack of nurses may be the biggest gap that needs to be filled.\n\nA 2022 analysis found that the total count of nurses in the US decreased by more than 100,000 from 2020 to 2021, the largest drop observed over the past four decades. Many who left were under the age of 35, and most worked at hospitals.\n\nIt‚Äôs a particular problem for children‚Äôs hospitals.\n\n‚ÄúThe pediatric ICU specialty ‚Ä¶ is highly specialized and a difficult to recruit role in hospitals today,‚Äù Katie Boston-Leary, director of nursing programs at the American Nurses Association, told CNN in an email.\n\nWhen new staffers come in, it costs more to train them. Everyone who works with children needs an additional layer of training beyond what they would get in standard nursing school. That narrows the pool of people eligible to work in these hospitals, too.\n\nThere‚Äôs also a serious problem with turnover. Nurse turnover is up 50% across the country since 2019, according to Mark Wietecha, CEO of the Children‚Äôs Hospital Association.\n\n‚ÄúSome of our nurses became (traveling nurses); some retired early; some were poached by our adult hospital colleagues,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe lost people, and costs are way up.‚Äù\n\nThis high demand means hospitals have to pay more to retain and hire nurses. And working with children is labor intensive, taking up more of staffers‚Äô time.\n\nTemporary tents to create additional capacity can help in the short term, but the country will probably see some of the same surge capacity problems with RSV next year and the year after that, Wietecha says. He thinks it will take a government effort to fix the problem.\n\n‚ÄúWe know that there‚Äôs a train coming down the tracks. The government has been responsive at a level, but why don‚Äôt we have a road map for pediatric surge?‚Äù\n\nFull children‚Äôs hospitals are just one example of a larger problem, Boston-Leary said.\n\n‚ÄúWe have a nurse staffing crisis, and we need a whole-of-government response to address this public health crisis,‚Äù she said.\n\nLulla said his hospital in Rhode Island is ‚Äúaggressively recruiting‚Äù to increase staff where it can, but it is competing with other hospitals, home health organizations, nursing homes and doctor‚Äôs offices that are also short-staffed.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing the best that we can to try to use the resources that we have,‚Äù he said.\n\nLonger waits and more mistakes\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated staff shortages across the health care industry, with people forced out by burnout, trauma and exhaustion, according to research from HHS. But even before 2020, stress and burnout were ‚Äúalready significant problems.‚Äù\n\nDuring the pandemic, many staffers who weren‚Äôt dealing directly with Covid-19 were furloughed or saw their hours cut because so many people weren‚Äôt going to medical appointments or having elective surgeries, particularly during lockdowns. Some of that staff never returned.\n\nA lack of staff doesn‚Äôt just mean long wait times to get a hospital bed. It can threaten patient safety, said Dr. Marcus Schabacker, president and CEO of ECRI, an independent nonprofit focused on health-care safety and technology.\n\nStaffing shortages top the institute‚Äôs list of patient safety concerns for 2022.\n\n‚ÄúThe higher the work volume, the higher the stress level, the more likely we‚Äôre going to make a mistake,‚Äù Schabacker said.\n\nHospitals have tried to put systems in place to catch potential mistakes, ‚Äúbut these redundant systems are stretched too,‚Äù he said.\n\nWith pediatric patients, a small mistake could quickly become catastrophic.\n\n‚ÄúThe margin of error in peds is just smaller, right? So their systems are much more fragile,‚Äù Schabacker said. ‚ÄúWhen we talk about medication, their systems, their body system, organ system, just has much less margin for error.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄòA self-perpetuating shortage‚Äô\n\nMany of the experienced nurses working now probably won‚Äôt be in the near future. Nearly 20% of RNs are 65 or older, the largest age group in the profession, according to the National Nursing Workforce Study.\n\nA 2019 survey from the US Registered Nurse Workforce Report Card and Shortage Forecast projected that a shortage of registered nurses would spread across the country through 2030.\n\nNursing colleges are not expanding capacity to meet the increased demand as the US population ages and are unlikely to grow enough to replace retiring nurses. In 2019, more than 80,000 qualified applicants were turned away, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.\n\nOne reason is a lack of instructors. Faculty members are aging out, studies show, and although it requires an advanced degree, teaching often pays less than working as a nurse.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a self-perpetuating shortage in some ways where, if you don‚Äôt have enough nurses to be working the wards, you don‚Äôt have capacity for them to be training the next round of nurses,‚Äù said Katherine Baicker, an expert on the economic analysis of health policy and dean of the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. ‚ÄúAnd in a world where you‚Äôre not actually expanding the supply, you end up with a sort of beggar-thy-neighbor competition for these scarce professionals.‚Äù\n\nBaicker thinks technological advances could help.

Beginning June 1, her health insurer, UnitedHealthcare, will require doctors and patients to get authorization before common procedures including some colonoscopies and scopes of the throat, stomach and digestive tract.\n\n‚ÄúIf I have to wait one, two or three weeks, that can land me in the hospital and the emergency room and that‚Äôs costly to me,‚Äù said Harrison, who works as a nurse at Baltimore-area hospital. ‚ÄúI have a job. I'm a mother. I can't take (time) off and go to the emergency room just to get a scope so my doctor can see if I need to be on a certain type of medication to help me through my flare.‚Äù\n\nDoctors specializing in digestive issues are writing letters, pressuring executives and posting on social media in a campaign to halt the new policy being implemented by UnitedHealthcare, one of the nation‚Äôs largest health insurers.\n\nThe controversy is the latest example of how doctors and medical organizations are fighting insurers' efforts to implement \"prior authorizations,\" which require an insurer's consent before they agree to pay for certain prescriptions, medical services or treatments.\n\nHealth insurers say these reviews are needed to limit unnecessary medical services, reduce potential harms and make sure consumers don't pay for care they don't need.\n\nBut doctor groups say these policies delay care, harm patients and create unnecessary paperwork that contribute to higher administrative costs. Patients might choose to skip care or be forced to pick up a larger share of their health spending, they argue.\n\nUnitedHealthcare: Reviews needed\n\nUnitedHealthcare's new policy for 26.7 million members with private insurance coverage will require doctors get authorization before doing endoscopy procedures used to diagnose diseases in the esophagus, stomach or colon. Endoscopy procedures involve inserting a flexible tube with a light and camera that allows them to see the digestive system.\n\nConsumers won't need authorization to get once-a-decade screening colonoscopies recommended for adults over 45 to check for colon cancer. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers must cover preventive care assigned and ‚ÄúA‚Äù or ‚ÄúB‚Äù grade by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent advisory panel that evaluates medical tests, treatments and services. The task force assigned an ‚ÄúA‚Äù grade to screening colonoscopies for adults ages 50 to 75 and a ‚ÄúB‚Äù grade for ages 45 to 49.\n\nBut other colonoscopies to diagnose symptoms or monitor for changes in patients such as Harrison will need to be approved.\n\nIn a statement provided to USA TODAY, UnitedHealthcare said prior authorizations are needed to make sure common scopes are safe, affordable and effective for their customers.\n\nAccording to UnitedHealthcare:\n\nThe average out-of-pocket cost for surveillance colonoscopies or scopes of the throat or stomach is $944 for their private insurance plans.\n\nSome of the insurer's customers experience side effects or complications from endoscopy procedures. Every year, these complications result in nearly 2,500 hospital stays and nearly 6,000 emergency room visits within a month of these procedures, according the insurer.\n\n‚ÄúWe are asking health care professionals to follow the guidelines and evidence-based practices developed by their own gastroenterology medical societies to help ensure our members have timely access to safe and clinically appropriate care,‚Äù UnitedHealthcare said in an emailed statement. ‚ÄúThe physicians who will be most affected by this new policy are those who are not already following these evidence-based practices, which again, were developed by gastroenterology-related medical societies.‚Äù\n\nPrivate insurance plans typically require consumers to pay a portion of a medical bill, through cost-sharing requirements such as copayments or deductibles, which is the amount someone must pay before coverage kicks in. Many insurance plans also require consumers to pay coinsurance, or a percentage of their medical bill, until they reach out-of-pocket limits. So the more a doctor or surgery center charges, the more consumers typically pay.\n\nUnitedHealthcare cited medical studies that reported overuse of scopes have exposed patients to unnecessary risks and costs. One study in the American Journal of Gastroenterology assessed nearly 115,000 patients with or without Barrett's esophagus, a condition in which the lining of the esophagus is damaged by acid reflux and can turn cancerous. The study found patients without the condition received surveillance endoscopies, and some without precancerous cells were reexamined too soon, the study reported.\n\nA small 2022 study found slightly less than half of 532 surveillance colonoscopies complied with 2020 guideline from the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, which includes three specialist groups that developed colon cancer screening recommendations. Doctors were particularly slow to adapt to updated recommendations for low-risk cases, the study found.\n\nDavid Allen, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry group representing private insurers, said prior authorizations are necessary to ensure safe, effective and affordable care.\n\n‚ÄúIndependent studies show, and doctors agree, that differences in how care is provided to patients can lead to inappropriate, unnecessary and more costly medical treatments that can harm patients,\" Allen said. \"Prior authorization helps save money for patients and consumers and protects the safe care of patients.\"\n\n'Trying to save money ... on the backs of patients'\n\nThree specialist groups ‚àí American College of Gastroenterology, American Gastroenterological Association and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ‚àí and dozens of doctors, hospitals and patient groups have sent letters urging the insurer to reconsider the policy.\n\nIn one letter endorsed by an alliance of 170 doctors, medical societies, patient groups and hospitals, the organization said the policy is \"flawed and misguided\" and will prevent or delay the diagnosis of colon cancer, the deadliest cancer among men under 50 and third deadliest for women under 50.\n\nAlthough screening colonoscopies are allowed, doctors warn of a chilling effect for patients who need follow-up colonoscopies if polyps are found, cancerous tissue removed or concerning symptoms surface.\n\nWhile other insurers have prior authorization on endoscopies, the three specialist groups argue UnitedHealthcare's \"broad-stroke exclusionary approach will disproportionally impact our specialty and patients.\"\n\nDr. Paul Berggreen, a Phoenix gastroenterologist, said UnitedHealthcare-insured patients will inevitably be frustrated because most colonoscopies are surveillance or diagnostic ‚àí two categories that will now require prior authorization.\n\nWhen doctors remove polyps following a screening colonoscopy, Berggreen said they typically ask the patient to return in three to five years. But he fears some patients will skip or delay such recommended procedures, or the insurer will deny authorization.\n\n\"They're trying to save money for UnitedHealthcare, and they're doing it on the backs of patients who are getting advice from their physicians who are following accepted guidelines,\" Berggreen said.\n\nDr. Paul Brown, a Louisville gastroenterologist, said the policy will result in delayed diagnosis or missed cancers of the stomach, throat and colon. He worries patients will get a false sense of security if doctors delay scheduling care while seeking the insurer's approval.\n\n\"They sometimes misinterpret that as we think it's OK to delay and then they may delay it further or forget about,\" Brown said. \"Then that becomes a missed diagnosis, which is even a greater problem.\"\n\n1 in 3 doctor groups hire staff to process prior authorizations\n\nThe battle over health insurance companies implementing prior authorizations extends beyond digestive and colon cancers.\n\nThe typical medical practice completes 45 prior authorizations for each doctor per week, according to an American Medical Association survey of physicians. That translates to 14 hours of administrative work per week, according to the AMA. More than 1 in 3 medical practices hire staff to work exclusively on prior authorizations.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found 13% of prior authorization requests rejected by private Medicare Advantage plans would have been allowed under traditional, government-run Medicare's criteria. These private Medicare plans also denied 18% of claims that met Medicare's coverage rules.\n\nAmid doctor and patient complaints about prior authorizations, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed new prior authorization standards beginning January 2026 for private Medicare and Medicaid plans.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the health policy nonprofit KFF, the proposed rule would require insurers to do the following on prior authorizations:\n\nUse a standard computerized interface for submitting a request.\n\nShorten the time frame for deciding a request.\n\nPublicly report statistics each year.\n\nWhile the proposed rule could bring more scrutiny to prior authorizations on publicly funded health insurance plans and add some requirements to Affordable Care Act marketplace plans, there's less oversight on private insurance plans, said Kaye Pestaina, a vice president and co-director of KFF's program on patient and consumer protections.\n\nFor private health insurance plans, \"there's no regulation of when you can use prior authorization,\" Pestaina said. \"For the most part, plans make those decisions and they don't have to show why.\"\n\nKen Alltucker is on Twitter at @kalltucker, or can be emailed at alltuck@usatoday.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/politics/spending-bill-congress-omnibus/index.html", "title": "Here's what's in the $1.7 trillion federal omnibus spending law | CNN ...", "text": "Editor‚Äôs Note: This story originally ran December 20.

And the legislation contains several major Medicaid provisions, particularly one that could disenroll up to 19 million people from the nation‚Äôs health insurance program for low-income Americans.\n\nHowever, the law, which runs more than 4,000 pages, left out several measures that some lawmakers had fought to include. An expansion of the child tax credit, as well as multiple other corporate and individual tax breaks, did not make it into the final bill. Neither did legislation to allow cannabis companies to bank their cash reserves ‚Äì known as the Safe Banking Act ‚Äì or a bill to help Afghan evacuees in the US gain lawful permanent residency. And the spending package did not include a White House request for roughly $10 billion in additional funding for Covid-19 response.\n\nThe spending law, which will keep the government operating through September, the end of the fiscal year, is the product of lengthy negotiations between top congressional Democrats and Republicans.\n\nCongress originally passed a continuing resolution on September 30 to temporarily fund the government in fiscal year 2023, which began October 1.\n\nHere‚Äôs what‚Äôs in the law:\n\nMore aid for Ukraine: The spending law provides roughly $45 billion to help support Ukraine‚Äôs efforts to defend itself against Russia‚Äôs attack.\n\nAbout $9 billion of the funding will go to Ukraine‚Äôs military to pay for a variety of things including training, weapons, logistics support and salaries. Nearly $12 billion will be used to replenish US stocks of equipment sent to Ukraine through presidential drawdown authority.\n\nAlso, the law provides $13 billion for economic support to the Ukrainian government. Other funds address humanitarian and infrastructure needs, as well as support European Command operations.\n\nEmergency disaster assistance: The law provides more than $38 billion in emergency funding to help Americans in the west and southeast affected by recent natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding and wildfires. It will aid farmers, provide economic development assistance for communities, repair and reconstruct federal facilities and direct money to the Federal Emergency Management Agency‚Äôs Disaster Relief Fund, among other initiatives.\n\nOverhaul of the electoral vote-counting law: A provision in the legislation aims at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election, the first legislative response to the US Capitol insurrection and then-President Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign to stay in power despite his loss in 2020.\n\nThe changes overhaul the 1887 Electoral Count Act, which Trump tried to use to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe legislation clarifies the vice president‚Äôs role while overseeing the certification of the electoral result to be completely ceremonial. It also creates a set of stipulations designed to make it harder for there to be any confusion over the accurate slate of electors from each state.\n\nFunding for January 6 attack prosecutions: The law provides $2.6 billion for US Attorneys, which includes funding efforts ‚Äúto further support prosecutions related to the January 6 attack on the Capitol and domestic terrorism cases,‚Äù according to a fact sheet from the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe package also gives $11.3 billion to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including for efforts to investigate extremist violence and domestic terrorism.\n\nThe funding measures are part of nearly $39 billion for the Justice Department.\n\nRetirement savings enhancements: The law contains new retirement rules that could make it easier for Americans to accumulate retirement savings ‚Äì and less costly to withdraw them. Among other things, the provisions will allow penalty-free withdrawals for some emergency expenses, let employers offer matching retirement contributions for a worker‚Äôs student loan payments and increase how much older workers may save in employer retirement plans.\n\nTikTok ban from federal devices: The legislation bans TikTok, the Chinese-owned short-form video app, from federal government devices.\n\nSome lawmakers have raised bipartisan concerns that China‚Äôs national security laws could force TikTok ‚Äì or its parent, ByteDance ‚Äì to hand over the personal data of its US users. Recently, a wave of states led by Republican governors have introduced state-level restrictions on the use of TikTok on government-owned devices.\n\nProtections for pregnant workers: The law provides pregnant workers with workplace accommodations ‚Äì such as additional bathroom breaks, stools or relief from heavy lifting duties ‚Äì needed for healthy pregnancies. It will prevent them from being forced to take leave or losing their jobs, as well as bar employers from denying employment opportunities to women based on their need for reasonable accommodations due to childbirth or related medical conditions. Also, another provision in the package guarantees workplace accommodations ‚Äì particularly time to pump ‚Äì for more nursing workers.\n\nChanges to Medicaid and other health care programs: The law phases out the requirement that prevented states from disenrolling Medicaid recipients as long as the national public health emergency was in effect in exchange for an enhanced federal match. This continuous coverage measure was enacted as part of a Covid-19 relief package passed in March 2020 and has led to a record 90 million Medicaid enrollees, many of whom may no longer meet the income requirements to qualify.\n\nUnder the law, states will be able to start evaluating Medicaid enrollees‚Äô eligibility and terminating their coverage as of April 1. The redetermination process will take place over at least 12 months. Also, the enhanced federal Medicaid funding will phase down through December 31, 2023, though the states will have to meet certain conditions during that period.\n\nUp to 19 million people could lose their Medicaid benefits, according to estimates, though many would be eligible for other coverage.\n\nAlso, under a provision in the law, Medicaid and the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, will offer 12 months of continuous coverage for children. This will allow the 40 million children on Medicaid and CHIP to have uninterrupted access to health care throughout the year.\n\nIn addition, the law makes permanent the option for states to offer 12 months of postpartum coverage for low-income mothers through Medicaid, rather than just 60 days. More than two dozen states, plus the District of Columbia, have implemented the measure, which was available on a temporary basis through the American Rescue Plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Another seven states are planning to implement the option.\n\nPlus, the package provides more money for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. The funds are intended to speed the development of new therapies, diagnostics and preventive measures, beef up public health activities and strengthen the nation‚Äôs biosecurity by accelerating development of medical countermeasures for pandemic threats and fortifying stockpiles and supply chains for drugs, masks and other supplies.\n\nIncreased support for the military and veterans: The package funds a 4.6% pay raise for troops and a 22.4% increase in support for Veteran Administration medical care, which provides health services for 7.3 million veterans.\n\nIt includes nearly $53 billion to address higher inflation and $2.7 billion ‚Äì a 25% increase ‚Äì to support critical services and housing assistance for veterans and their families.\n\nThe law also allocates $5 billion for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, which provides additional funding to implement the landmark PACT Act that expands eligibility for health care services and benefits to veterans with conditions related to toxic exposure during their service.\n\nBeefing up nutrition assistance: The legislation establishes a permanent nationwide Summer EBT program, starting in the summer of 2024, according to Share Our Strength, an anti-hunger advocacy group. It will provide families whose children are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals with a $40 grocery benefit per child per month, indexed to inflation.\n\nIt also changes the rules governing summer meals programs in rural areas. Children will be able to take home or receive delivery of up to 10 days‚Äô worth of meals, rather than have to consume the food at a specific site and time.\n\nThe law also helps families who have had their food stamp benefits stolen since October 1 through what‚Äôs known as ‚ÄúSNAP skimming.‚Äù It provides them with retroactive federal reimbursement of the funds, which criminals steal by attaching devices to point-of-sale machines or PIN pads to get card numbers and other information from electronic benefits transfer cards.\n\nHigher maximum Pell grant awards: The law increases the maximum Pell grant award by $500 to $7,395 for the coming school year. This marks the largest boost since the 2009-2010 school year. About 7 million students, many from lower-income families, receive Pell grants every year to help them afford college.\n\nHelp to pay utility bills: The package provides $5 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Combined with the $1 billion contained in the earlier continuing resolution, this is the largest regular appropriation for the program, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. Home heating and cooling costs ‚Äì and the applications for federal aid in paying the bills ‚Äì have soared this year.\n\nAdditional funding for the US Capitol Police: The law provides an additional $132 million for the Capitol Police for a total of nearly $735 million. It will allow the department to hire up to 137 sworn officers and 123 support and civilian personnel, bringing the force to a projected level of 2,126 sworn officers and 567 civilians.\n\nIt also gives $2 million to provide off-campus security for lawmakers in response to evolving and growing threats.\n\nMore money for child care: The legislation provides $8 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, a 30% increase in funding. The grant gives financial assistance to low-income families to afford child care.\n\nAlso, Head Start will receive nearly $12 billion, an 8.6% boost. The program helps young children from low-income families prepare for school.\n\nMore resources for children‚Äôs mental health and for substance abuse: The law provides more funds to increase access to mental health services for children and schools. It also will invest more money to address the opioid epidemic and substance use disorder.\n\nInvestments in homelessness prevention and affordable housing: The legislation provides $3.6 billion for homeless assistance grants, a 13% increase. It will serve more than 1 million people experiencing homelessness.\n\nThe package also funnels nearly $6.4 billion to the Community Development Block Grant formula program and related local economic and community development projects that benefit low- and moderate income areas and people, an increase of almost $1.6 billion.\n\nPlus, it provides $1.5 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which will lead to the construction of nearly 10,000 new rental and homebuyer units and maintain the record investment from the last fiscal year.\n\nMore support for the environment: The package provides an additional $576 million for the Environmental Protection Agency, bringing its funding up to $10.1 billion. It increases support for enforcement and compliance, as well as clean air, water and toxic chemical programs, after years of flat funding.\n\nIt also boosts funding for the National Park Service by 6.4%, restoring 500 of the 3,000 staff positions lost over the past decade. This is intended to help the agency handle substantial increases in visitation.\n\nPlus, the legislation provides an additional 14% in funding for wildland firefighting.\n\nWhat‚Äôs not in the law\n\nEnhanced child tax credit: A coalition of Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates pushed hard to extend at least one provision of the enhanced child tax credit, which was in effect last year thanks to the Democrats‚Äô $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Their priority was to make the credit more refundable so more of the lowest-income families can qualify. Nearly 19 million kids won‚Äôt receive the full $2,000 benefit this year because their parents earn too little, according to a Tax Policy Center estimate.\n\nNew cannabis banking rules: Lawmakers considered including a provision in the spending bill that would make it easier for licensed cannabis businesses to accept credit cards ‚Äì but it was left out of the legislation. Known as the Safe Banking Act, which previously passed the House, the provision would prohibit federal regulators from taking punitive measures against banks for providing services to legitimate cannabis businesses.\n\nEven though 47 states have legalized some form of marijuana, cannabis remains illegal on the federal level. That means financial institutions providing banking services to cannabis businesses are subject to criminal prosecution ‚Äì leaving many legal growers and sellers locked out of the banking system.\n\nCovid-19 response: Lawmakers did not include a White House request for an additional $10 billion in funding for Covid-19, which would have been aimed at continued access to and development of vaccines and therapeutics, among other things. Earlier in the year, the Biden administration unsuccessfully pushed for $22.5 billion in extra funds.\n\nFBI headquarters: There was also no final resolution on where the new FBI headquarters will be located, a major point of contention as lawmakers from Maryland ‚Äì namely House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ‚Äì pushed to bring the law enforcement agency into their state. In a deal worked through by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the General Services Administration would be required to conduct ‚Äúseparate and detailed consultations‚Äù with Maryland and Virginia representatives about potential sites in each of the states, according to a Senate Democratic aide.\n\nAfghan Adjustment Act: Also not included in the spending bill was the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would have helped Afghan allies who run the risk of deportation from the US. It would have given those evacuees a pathway to lawful permanent residency before their temporary status, known as humanitarian parole, expires in 2023. Many congressional Republicans raised concerns about vetting and other issues, but the legislation‚Äôs supporters, including former US military leaders, argued those worries have been addressed.\n\nLegislation to extend and expand Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who worked with the US during the war there and want to come to America is included in the spending bill.", "authors": ["Tami Luhby Katie Lobosco", "Tami Luhby", "Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/10/health/rsv-deaths-study/index.html", "title": "RSV responsible for 1 in 50 child deaths under age 5, study ...", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nA new study estimates that 1 in 50 deaths of otherwise healthy children under age 5 around the world is due to a common virus that‚Äôs currently surging in the US: respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. And in high-income countries, 1 in 56 babies who are born on time and are healthy will be hospitalized with RSV in the first year of life, according to the researchers‚Äô estimates.\n\nThe virus is known to be especially dangerous for premature and medically fragile babies, but it causes a ‚Äúsubstantial burden of disease in infants worldwide,‚Äù wrote the authors of the study, published Thursday in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine.\n\nOther research has examined the number of children with pre-existing conditions who are hospitalized with RSV, but the new study is one of the first to look at the numbers in otherwise healthy kids.\n\n‚ÄúThis is the lowest-risk baby who is being hospitalized for this, so really, numbers are really much higher than I think some people would have guessed,‚Äù said study co-author Dr. Louis Bont, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Wilhelmina Children‚Äôs Hospital at University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands. Bont is also the founding chairman of the ReSViNET foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to reducing the global burden of RSV infection.\n\nThe estimates are based on a study that looked at the number of RSV cases in 9,154 infants born between July 2017 and April 2020 who were followed for the first year of life. The babies received care at health centers across Europe.\n\nAbout 1 in 1,000 children in the study were put in an intensive care unit to get help breathing from a mechanical ventilator. This care is vital: In parts of the world where there is a lack of hospital care, the risk of death is significant.\n\n‚ÄúThe vast majority of deaths with RSV occur in developing countries,‚Äù Bont said. ‚ÄúIn the developed world, mortality is really rare, and if it happens, it‚Äôs virtually only in those who have severe comorbidities. But in most places in the world, there is no intensive care unit.‚Äù\n\nGlobally, RSV is the second leading cause of death during the first year of a child‚Äôs life, after malaria. Between 100,000 and 200,000 babies die from the virus every year, Bont said.\n\nThere are fewer RSV deaths in high-income countries, but the virus still causes substantial morbidity, and even hospitalization can have serious effects, said Dr. Kristina Deeter, chair of pediatrics at the University of Nevada, Reno and a specialty medical officer for pediatric critical care at Pediatrix Medical Group.\n\n‚ÄúWhether that is just traumatic psychosocial, emotional issues after hospitalization or even having more vulnerable lungs ‚Äì you can develop asthma later on, for instance, if you‚Äôve had a really severe infection at a young age ‚Äì it can damage your lungs permanently,‚Äù said Deeter, who was not involved in the new study. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still an important virus in our world and something that we really focus on. It‚Äôs kind of the bread and butter of a pediatric ICU.‚Äù\n\nHealth-care providers know that November through March is the traditional ‚Äúviral season,‚Äù and they must plan accordingly for RSV and other respiratory problems.\n\nDr. Nicholas Holmes, senior vice president and chief operating officer at Rady Children‚Äôs Hospital in San Diego, said officials there are always sure to have enough respiratory therapists and physicians to manage the influx of cases.\n\nEven then, at the largest pediatric hospital on the West Coast, officials have had to get creative to keep up with the patient load, Holmes said.\n\n‚ÄúOne thing that we just recently implemented to help is that we have many clinicians who are licensed nurses or therapists, or physicians like myself, who are in nonclinical roles in the organization. So we are engaging those licensed staff back in to help support and bridging that gap to support our nurses, physicians who are in direct line of patient care,‚Äù Holmes said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Holmes said, through the hospital‚Äôs Helping Hands program, he spent an hour and a half in the emergency department rather than doing his usual work. He checked on families and patients, handing out blankets and fruit pops. It gave him a chance to watch for problems and alert nurses if a child was getting sicker and needed medical attention right away.\n\n‚ÄúThis allows the nursing team in the triage area to really focus on the sickest of the sick kids,‚Äù Holmes said.\n\nAlthough there is no specific treatment for RSV in healthy babies, recent developments around vaccines and therapies mean help could be on the way for busy hospitals.\n\nThere is only one monoclonal antibody treatment for patients who have pre-existing conditions or who were born prematurely. It‚Äôs been available since 1998 and has made a significant difference, Deeter said.\n\n‚ÄúOnce premature babies started to receive that, the numbers drastically dropped,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt is incredibly rare at this point for us to put a baby on a ventilator for RSV. This tiny, fragile group is so well-protected by those injections; however, we still have thousands of babies coming in who didn‚Äôt receive those injections who still need supportive care, and often, they‚Äôre managed without a respiratory support system.‚Äù\n\nThere are things parents of infants can do to prevent RSV, said Dr. Priya Soni, an assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Cedars Sinai Medical Center. They‚Äôre the simple behaviors everyone is familiar with from the Covid-19 pandemic: Thoroughly wash your hands, stay home if you‚Äôre sick, and keep surfaces clean.\n\n‚ÄúThe virus is a little more hardy on hard surfaces, so really cleaning those surfaces and hand-washing goes a long way with RSV, as well as limiting the child‚Äôs exposure to infected respiratory secretions and droplets overall,‚Äù said Soni, who wasn‚Äôt involved in the new research.\n\nThe study‚Äôs findings about the number of children who get RSV in the first months of life show how important it will be to have an immunization strategy for pregnant women, she said.\n\n‚ÄúWhatever we could do to close that gap for those young infants that are within the first six months of life, that may be really really prone to that RSV infection, will help,‚Äù Soni said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn the US, four RSV vaccines may be nearing review by the FDA. Globally, more than a dozen are going through trials. A preventive treatment for lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV got the go-ahead from the European Commission last week.\n\nThese developments can be game-changers, experts say.\n\n‚ÄúEvery pediatrician that I know has always been working very, very hard during Christmastime. We are always swamped with RSV patients every year,‚Äù Bont said. ‚ÄúThis or next year could be the last time that we actually see that, because it could really prevent the bulk of severe infection.‚Äù", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/health/melatonin-overuse-wellness/index.html", "title": "Using melatonin for sleep is on the rise, study says, despite potential ...", "text": "Editor‚Äôs Note: Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN ‚Äî\n\nMore and more adults are taking over-the-counter melatonin to get to sleep, and some may be using it at dangerously high levels, a study has found.\n\nThe overall use among the US adult population is still ‚Äúrelatively low,‚Äù but the study does ‚Äúdocument a significant many-fold increase in melatonin use in the past few years,‚Äù said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School. She was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study, published in the medical journal JAMA, found that by 2018 Americans were taking more than twice the amount of melatonin than a decade earlier.\n\nMelatonin has been linked to headaches, dizziness, nausea, stomach cramps, drowsiness, confusion or disorientation, irritability and mild anxiety, depression and tremors as well as abnormally low blood pressure. It can also interact with common medications and trigger allergies.\n\nWhile short-term use for people with jet lag, shift workers and those who have trouble falling asleep appears to be safe, long-term safety is unknown, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n‚ÄúIn an associational study we found that older adults who reported frequent use ‚Äî every night or most nights ‚Äî of a sleep aid (over the counter or prescription) had a higher risk of incident dementia and early mortality,‚Äù Robbins said.\n\nHowever, researchers could not determine which type of sleep aid ‚Äî over-the-counter medications, such as melatonin, or prescription medications ‚Äî was responsible for the findings.\n\nMelatonin‚Äôs side effects\n\nSince 2006, a small but growing subset of adults are taking amounts of melatonin that far exceed the dosage of 5 milligrams a day typically used as a short-term treatment, the study found.\n\nHowever, pills for sale may contain levels of melatonin much higher than what is advertised on the label. Unlike drugs and food, melatonin is not fully regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, so there are no federal requirements that companies test pills to ensure they contain the amount of advertised melatonin.\n\nPeople are using twice as much melatonin as they did a decade ago, sometimes at dangerously high levels. Shutterstock\n\n‚ÄúPrevious research has found that that melatonin content in these unregulated, commercially available melatonin supplements ranged from ‚Äî 83% to +478% of the labeled content,‚Äù said Robbins, who coauthored the book ‚ÄúSleep for Success! Everything You Must Know About Sleep But are Too Tired to Ask.‚Äù\n\nNor are there any requirements that companies test their products for harmful hidden additives in melatonin supplements sold in stores and online. Previous studies also found 26% of the melatonin supplements contained serotonin, ‚Äúa hormone that can have harmful effects even at relatively low levels,‚Äù according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\n\n‚ÄúWe cannot be certain of the purity of melatonin that is available over the counter,‚Äù Robbins said.\n\nTaking too much serotonin by combining medications such as antidepressants, migraine medications and melatonin can lead to a serious drug reaction. Mild symptoms include shivering and diarrhea, while a more severe reaction can lead to muscle rigidity, fever, seizures and even death if not treated.\n\nIs it bad to take melatonin every night?\n\nBecause it is purchased over the counter, experts say many people view melatonin as an herbal supplement or vitamin. In reality, melatonin is a hormone made by the pineal gland, located deep within the brain, and released into the bloodstream to regulate the body‚Äôs sleep cycles.\n\n‚ÄúThere is a view that if it‚Äôs natural, then it can‚Äôt hurt,‚Äù Robbins told CNN in an earlier interview on the impact of melatonin on children. ‚ÄúThe truth is, we just really don‚Äôt know the implications of melatonin in the longer term, for adults or kids.‚Äù\n\nAnother reality: Studies have found that while using melatonin can be helpful in inducing sleep if used correctly ‚Äî taking it at least two hours before bed ‚Äî but the actual benefit is small.\n\n‚ÄúWhen adults took melatonin, it decreased the amount of time it took them to fall asleep by four to eight minutes,‚Äù Dr. Cora Collette Breuner, a professor in the department of pediatrics at Seattle Children‚Äôs Hospital at the University of Washington, told CNN in 2021.\n\n‚ÄúSo for someone who takes hours to fall asleep, probably the better thing for them to do is turn off their screens, or get 20 to 40 minutes of exercise each day, or don‚Äôt drink any caffeinated products at all,‚Äù Breuner said.\n\n‚ÄúThese are all sleep hygiene tools that work, but people are very reticent to do them. They rather just take a pill, right?‚Äù\n\nTraining your brain to sleep\n\nThere are other proven sleep tips that work just as well, if not better than sleeping aids, experts say. The body begins secreting melatonin at dark. What do we do in our modern culture? Use artificial light to keep us awake, often long past the body‚Äôs normal bedtime.\n\nResearch has found that the body will slow or stop melatonin production if exposed to light, including the blue light from our smartphones, laptops and the like.\n\n‚ÄúAny LED spectrum light source may further suppress melatonin levels,‚Äù said Dr. Vsevolod Polotsky, who directs sleep basic research in the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in an earlier CNN interview.\n\nSo ban those devices at least an hour before you want to fall asleep. Like to read yourself to sleep? That‚Äôs fine, experts say, just read in a dim light from a book or use an e-reader in night mode.\n\n‚ÄúDigital light will suppress the circadian drive,‚Äù Polotsky said, while a ‚Äúdim reading light will not.‚Äù\n\nOther tips include keeping your bedroom temperature at cooler temperatures ‚Äî about 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 20 degrees Celsius). We sleep better if we‚Äôre a bit chilly, experts say.\n\nSet up a bedtime ritual by taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book or listening to soothing music. Or you can try deep breathing, yoga, meditation or light stretches. Go to bed and get up at the same time each day, even on weekends or your days off, experts say. The body likes routine.\n\nIf your doctor does prescribe melatonin to help with jet lag or other minor sleep issues, keep the use ‚Äúshort term,‚Äù Robbins said.\n\nIf you are planning to use melatonin for a short-term sleep aid, try to purchase pharmaceutical grade melatonin, she advised.

Hospitalizations among seniors are nearing the peak from the Delta surge and rising fast.\n\nAnd the age gap has never been wider. Since October, the Covid-19 hospitalization rate among seniors has been at least four times higher than average. Even during the first winter surge in 2020, when Covid-19 took a devastating sweep through nursing homes, there was never more than a three-fold difference.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, a positive Covid-19 test for a senior has carried an extra heavy weight. Only about 13% of all reported cases in the US have been among people 65 and older, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But about half of all hospitalizations and three-quarters of all deaths have been in this age group.\n\nThe Covid-19 hospitalization rate for seniors has generally risen and fallen in line with broader trends, reaching a record high last winter during the Omicron surge and dropping significantly in the summer. But compared with other age groups, hospitalization rates have consistently been higher among the 65 and older population.\n\nDr. Eric Topol, a physician and professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research, has dubbed the rise happening now the ‚Äúsenior wave.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúRight now we have an immunity wall built up against the Omicron family ‚Äì between shots and prior infections and combinations thereof ‚Äì that seems to be keeping younger folks in pretty good stead. But the immune systems of people of advanced age are not as strong,‚Äù Topol said.\n\nYounger adults who are immunocompromised are also likely experiencing disproportionately severe effects of the latest wave, he said, but there isn‚Äôt sufficient data to understand trends in that population as well.\n\nNew variants that are more immune evasive and relatively low utilization of treatments like Paxlovid may have played a role in the rising hospitalization rate among seniors, Topol said.\n\nBut ‚Äúthe main culprit is booster deficiency‚Äù with rates that are ‚Äúwoefully inadequate,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt all points to waning immunity. If more seniors had their booster, the effect would be minimal.‚Äù\n\nVaccines help, and boosters still work\n\nStewart said that she‚Äôs eased back on personal mitigation measures, but still keeps an eye on Covid-19 trends. She‚Äôs found a balance between caution and contentment that she says works for her ‚Äì but getting her vaccines is really what helps her feel safest.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm paying attention to the fact that it‚Äôs picking up, so I‚Äôm a little bit more careful than I was, say, six weeks ago,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWith the pickup, I haven‚Äôt reverted to how I was handling it a couple of years ago, but I‚Äôm more aware of who I‚Äôm around and maybe wearing my mask a little bit more than I used to.‚Äù\n\nA home test was negative for Covid-19 and confirmed by another test at a health care provider‚Äôs drive through, which brought some relief, she said. But even if it was positive, knowing she was vaccinated and boosted gave her reassurance.\n\n‚ÄúThat was the whole idea of being so proactive with all these vaccines. There was a very good chance that yeah, you might get sick, but you wouldn‚Äôt get as sick as someone who didn‚Äôt get all their shots and there was a really good chance you wouldn‚Äôt end up in the hospital,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo that really gave me a sense of security in some ways that even if I did get it, it wouldn‚Äôt be really bad.‚Äù\n\nBut most seniors are not as well protected as Stewart.\n\nJust about a third of the 65 and older population has gotten an updated booster shot, according to CDC data ‚Äì a number that‚Äôs concerningly low to public health experts.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very, very concerning,‚Äù said Dr. Preeti Malani, a physician at University of Michigan Health who specializes in infectious disease and geriatric medicine.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a sizable number of people who actually got previous boosters who have not gotten this one and I worry that there‚Äôs confusion, there‚Äôs misinformation. So to seniors ‚Äì and to everyone ‚Äì I say: if you have not been boosted, go get boosted.‚Äù\n\nA recent survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 60% of seniors were worried about a rise in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations this winter ‚Äì a far larger share than average.\n\nMore than 40% were worried that they would get seriously sick themselves, but nearly as many said that they don‚Äôt have plans to get the updated booster any time soon. In fact, nearly a quarter of seniors say they don‚Äôt have any plans to get it at all, or will only get it if it‚Äôs required.\n\nA community-minded approach to protect the most vulnerable\n\nVaccines ‚Äì including the updated booster ‚Äì continue to prove to be effective at preventing severe disease. But booster uptake among seniors, while low, is much higher than it is for other age groups. Less than 10% of adults under 50 and less than 5% of children have gotten their updated booster, CDC data shows.\n\nStill, experts say the gap in vaccination rates isn‚Äôt enough to explain the large and growing gap in hospitalization rates.\n\n‚ÄúThe truth is that, really, anyone can get this,‚Äù Malani said. ‚ÄúBut the older you are, the more likely you are to have severe symptoms, the more likely you are to be hospitalized, and the more likely you are to die.‚Äù\n\nEMTs transfer and deliver patients in the busy ambulance bay at UMass Memorial Medical Center.

Instead, family, friends and the broader community are often the ones bringing Covid-19 to seniors ‚Äì who are more likely to suffer more severe consequences.\n\n‚ÄúSeniors are the most at risk, but we bring it to them,‚Äù Malani said. ‚ÄúA thing unique to older adults is that many of them are grandparents and many of them provide childcare for their grandchildren. So they sometimes get infected from their grandkids, who may also be going to school or daycare.‚Äù\n\nMany older adults live in congregate settings like nursing homes, which also present unique risks, she said.\n\nBut the point remains that seniors, while more vulnerable to severe outcomes, are not the main drivers of spread in the population.\n\nA government watchdog report published earlier this month found that outbreaks in nursing homes were ‚Äústrongly associated with community spread.‚Äù\n\nAnd nursing homes are particularly vulnerable again this winter. Weekly cases among residents have already surpassed all prior surges except the initial winter wave and the Omicron wave, and they continue to rise. But just 47% of residents and 22% of staff are ‚Äúup to date‚Äù with vaccines, according to data from the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n‚ÄúWe all would have hoped that we would have a vaccine that prevents transmission. We don‚Äôt have a vaccine that does that, but it does reduce transmission and it does reduce severe outcomes,‚Äù said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.\n\nFor that reason alone, seniors who interact with other seniors should get vaccinated to help minimize severe outcomes, she said.\n\n‚ÄúBut really, any individuals that come in contact with high-risk groups need to be the primary focus for getting vaccinated,‚Äù she said.\n\nThe way forward isn‚Äôt all or nothing\n\nStewart plans to host her family for Christmas again this year, for the first time since the pandemic started.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre careful about who we interact with. There isn‚Äôt any undue risk that we felt in gathering with family. That‚Äôs kind of our safe group,‚Äù she said.\n\nShe and her husband also get together with small groups of friends that they trust are also vaccinated and similarly cautious, but they still plan to stay away from baseball games ‚Äì even though it‚Äôs one of their favorite pastimes.\n\n‚ÄúWe love going to baseball games. We‚Äôre real fans, and we‚Äôre very supportive of our team, but there‚Äôs a lot of risk there. We take the ferry over and on that ride over, you‚Äôre riding very closely with a lot of other people. And going to the ballpark, again, we‚Äôre very close to a lot of unknown people,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too risky still.‚Äù\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMalani, the infectious disease specialist, said she recently spoke with a friend who seemed to be seeking permission to gather with family this holiday season.

Experts say this shift ‚Äì along with retail pharmacy closures ‚Äì can hinder access to prescriptions, especially for low-income patients.\n\n\"It becomes a vacuum where you have patients who can't get the services they used to get,\" said Cheryl Wisseh, an assistant professor of pharmacy at the University of California, Irvine. \"It's affecting older adults, those of low socioeconomic status and racial and ethnic minorities the most.\"\n\nRising drug prices:Is prescription copay assistance contributing to rising drug prices?\n\nMark Cuban:Billionaire Mavericks owner Mark Cuban opens online pharmacy offering prescription drugs\n\nWhy are pharmacies cutting hours?\n\nReduced operating hours at pharmacies can be more than just an inconvenience, according to Dima Qato, an associate professor of pharmacy at the University of Southern California.\n\n‚ÄúIt's kind of akin to a pharmacy closing for some people,\" she said. \"A pharmacy is no good just to consumers that can only go to the pharmacy after five or six if it suddenly shortens its hours.\"\n\nWalgreens and Rite Aid told USA TODAY that they have adjusted hours due to staffing issues. CVS Pharmacy spokesperson Amy Thibault said the company is not experiencing any widespread staffing issues or hours changes.\n\nPharmacies post-Roe:Walgreens, CVS pharmacists are withholding medications for people post-Roe\n\nStaffing challenges are also hitting mom-and-pop pharmacies, according to the National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents more than 19,000 independent pharmacies.\n\nAn Augustreport from the association found more than three-quarters of roughly 360 surveyed independent pharmacy owners and managers say they have a hard time filling open positions, resulting in higher payroll costs and longer wait times for patients.\n\nThe number of pharmacists employed by pharmacies and drug stores dropped 6% between 2019 and 2021, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau forecasts about 13,600 job openings for pharmacists each year on average over the next decade.\n\n‚ÄúThere are multiple stories about pharmacists just getting overwhelmed. The stress level and burnout is high,‚Äù Qato said. ‚ÄúSo pharmacists leave, and stores have to shorten\" their hours.\n\nA lack of pay raises could also play a role. Compensation for pharmacists fell nearly 5% in 2021 after adjusting for inflation, according to the New York Times.\n\nHow many pharmacies are closing?\n\nCustomers are also facing mass store closures among some of the largest pharmacy chains in the nation.\n\nCVS said it is on track to close 300 stores in 2022, chipping away at a goal to shutter 900 stores over the next three years. Rite Aid spokesperson Catherine Carter said the chain is also reducing its retail footprint and has closed more than 150 stores across 17 states since late 2021.\n\nIn 2019, Walgreens announced plans to close 200 stores but declined to share additional numbers.\n\nSpokespeople for the companies told USA TODAY they take many factors into consideration when shuttering stores, such as customer buying habits and local market dynamics.\n\nAs for independent pharmacies, data from the National Community Pharmacists Association shows their numbers have remained relatively flat between 2020 and 2021.\n\nDoug Hoey, the association's CEO, said business from the coronavirus pandemic and the closure of surrounding chain pharmacies helped keep numbers stable, but he worries this is a short-term trend.\n\n‚ÄúI'm concerned that without the help from the COVID vaccinations that everyone needed, these pharmacies that were able to tough it out for another year or two might not be able to continue,‚Äù Hoey said.\n\nResearch shows location plays a significant role in closures.\n\nThe number of independently-owned retail pharmacies in metropolitan areas increased by 28% between 2003 and 2021 but declined by 16% in noncore rural areas, according to the federally-funded Rural Health Research Centers.\n\nQato said closures are especially concerning if they lead to pharmacy deserts ‚Äì areas that lack access to a nearby pharmacy. That could lead to issues with access to medications and other health services and worsen health disparities.\n\nA 2019 report published in the peer-reviewed Jama Internal Medicine found pharmacy closures between 2009 and 2015 disproportionately affected independent pharmacies and low-income neighborhoods where residents are more likely to use public health insurance. Another study from USC looking at the 30 most populous U.S. cities between 2007 and 2015 found Black and Latino neighborhoods had fewer pharmacies than white or diverse neighborhoods.\n\n\"For Medicaid and Medicare, reimbursement rates for pharmacies per prescription are lower than private insurance,\" Qato said. \"It makes it hard for any pharmacy that serves more publicly-insured populations to stay open because the profit margins are slimmer in those neighborhoods.\"\n\nWhy are pharmacies closing?\n\nExperts say a number of factors are leading to pharmacy closures, including a period of intense competition that continues to pressure prescription profits and pharmacies' focus on expanding digital services.\n\n\"This is not easy to paint with a broad brush by citing one cause,\" said Kathleen Bashur, spokesperson for the National Association of Chain Drug Stores. \"It is important to keep in mind that retail businesses of all sizes and formats, and across industries, are adapting to changing consumer expectations and to a very, very broad and complex array of dynamics.\"\n\nWalgreens spokesperson Marty Maloney said the company is focusing on creating ‚Äúthe right network of stores in the right locations,‚Äù while CVS‚Äôs Thibault said its closures are based on ‚Äúchanges in population, consumer buying patterns and future health needs.‚Äù Carter said the Rite Aid closures are meant to reduce costs and improve profitability.\n\nAs for independent pharmacy closures, the pharmacists association points to slim margins on prescription drugs dictated by pharmacy benefit managers.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers ‚Äì the middlemen between pharmacies, drug manufacturers and health insurers ‚Äì help set the rates pharmacies are paid to fill prescriptions, also called reimbursement rates.\n\nThe top three benefits managers (CVS Health‚Äôs CVS Caremark; Cigna's Express Scripts; and UnitedHealth Group‚Äôs OptumRX) control about 80% of the market, according to data from independent market research firm Health Industries Research Companies.\n\n\"Because those three have such a large market share, they're able to dictate prices and payments to the pharmacies,\" Hoey said. \"And it's often a very low payment to the pharmacies. That's leading to the closures.\"\n\nBashur said pharmacies of all types are in \"serious need\" of reform to address pharmacy benefit manager tactics that are \"manipulating the pharmaceutical marketplace in a way that inflicts consequences on patients and on the pharmacies that serve them.\"\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission in June launched an inquiry into the pharmacy benefit manager industry, and Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Maria Cantwell of Washington introduced legislation in May that would give the FTC the power to increase drug pricing transparency and hold benefit managers accountable for \"unfair and deceptive practices.\"\n\n\"Prescription drugs are frequently sold at breakeven or loss,\" said Don Downing, a clinical professor at the University of Washington pharmacy school. \"That is not a business model that allows community pharmacies to sustain staffing or even being able to keep their doors open.\"\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents benefit managers, argues that the independent pharmacy market is stable and says benefit managers lower prescription drug costs and increase access.\n\nThe trade group's website says benefit managers administer prescription drug plans for more than 266 million Americans and save payers and patients an average of $962 per person per year.\n\nSpokesperson Greg‚Äã Lopes pointed to data that shows the number of independent retail pharmacies in the U.S. has grown over the last 10 years, based on a Quest Analytics analysis of National Council for Prescription Drug Programs pharmacy data.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers ‚Äúabsolutely recognize the value of independent pharmacies to patients and better health outcomes,‚Äù Lopes said in a statement. ‚Äú(The stability in this market) allows PBMs to partner with independent pharmacies to achieve our shared objective of increasing access to affordable medications, helping patients stay on their prescribed medications, and work together to maintain stability and growth in the independent pharmacy market.‚Äù\n\nYou can follow USA TODAY reporter Bailey Schulz on Twitter @bailey_schulz and subscribe to our free Daily Money newsletter here for personal finance tips and business news every Monday through Friday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2020/04/04/coronavirus-crime-rates-drop-and-domestic-violence-spikes/2939120001/", "title": "Coronavirus: Crime rates drop, and domestic violence spikes", "text": "Kenny Jacoby, Mike Stucka and Kristine Phillips\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCrime rates plunged in cities and counties across the U.S. over the second half of March as the coronavirus pandemic drove millions of residents to stay inside their homes.\n\nPolice logged dramatically fewer calls for service, crime incidents and arrests in the last two weeks of March than each of the previous six weeks, a USA TODAY analysis of crime data published by 53 law enforcement agencies in two dozen states found. The analysis is among the largest studies measuring the impact of the coronavirus on crime and policing.\n\nMassive drops in traffic and person stops ‚Äì as much as 92% in some jurisdictions ‚Äì helped drive sharp declines in drug offenses and DUIs. Thefts and residential burglaries decreased with fewer stores open and homes unoccupied, and some agencies logged fewer assaults and robberies. Bookings into each of nearly two dozen county jails monitored by the news organization fell by at least a quarter since February.\n\nAt the same time, calls for domestic disturbances and violence surged by 10% to 30% among many police agencies that contributed data. Several also saw increases in public nuisance complaints such as loud noise from parties. The Baltimore Police Department, for example, received 362 loud-music complaints in the last two weeks of March, nearly matching its total for all of February.\n\nThe trends reflect both a purposeful reduction in police activity and officer-initiated stops and the effect of stay-at-home orders that have closed huge swaths of Main Street and pushed people into their homes and out of traditional crime hot spots, such as bars, clubs and social events.\n\nThe U.S. confirmed its first coronavirus case Jan. 20 and its first death by the end of February. But it wasn‚Äôt until March 13 that President Donald Trump declared a national emergency and normal life in America ground to a halt.\n\nThe study compared weekly totals between Feb. 2 and March 28. Reporters analyzed daily calls for service and incident data published by 30 local police and sheriff‚Äôs agencies that range from those covering big cities like Dallas to small communities like St. John, Indiana. Analysis of arrests drew from inmate logs at nearly two dozen county jails in six states, which local USA TODAY Network newspapers already track daily.\n\nMany police departments say they are intentionally arresting fewer people to avoid the potential spread of the coronavirus in jails. Police in Delray Beach, Florida, are reducing proactive policing, such as drug busts. In nearby Gainesville, Florida, officers are increasingly issuing summons instead of making arrests for minor offenses, Police chief inspector Jorge Campos said.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that we‚Äôre not enforcing (the law),‚Äù Campos said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that we‚Äôre finding alternative ways of dealing with the issue rather than make physical arrests.‚Äù\n\nOverall, calls for service fell by at least 12% and incidents by at least 21% at most of the police agencies. The county jails after March 15 booked arrestees at half the rate as before.\n\nIn Montgomery County, Maryland, for example, crime rates plummeted after Gov. Larry Hogan shut down all bars, restaurants, gyms, movie theaters and large gatherings by executive order March 16. He has since issued a mandatory statewide stay-at-home order as positive cases in the state topped 1,000. By Friday, they exceeded 2,300, according to the CDC.\n\nNationally, coronavirus cases topped 239,000 and deaths surpassed 5,400, the CDC reported Friday.\n\nThe Montgomery County Police Department, just outside Washington, D.C., recorded 13% fewer call dispatches and more than a third fewer criminal incidents in the last two weeks of March compared with the previous six weeks.\n\nThe agency also has limited officers‚Äô interaction with the public ‚Äì they‚Äôre no longer making traffic stops unless absolutely necessary ‚Äì and they‚Äôre issuing citations for minor offenses to avoid arrests, said Montgomery County Police Department Chief Marcus Jones.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre kind of refocusing our commitment and trying to make sure our officers are safe,‚Äù Jones said, adding that two of the department‚Äôs 1,300 officers have tested positive for the coronavirus and a few others have had to self-quarantine.\n\nBut cases of domestic violence there spiked, even as most other crimes declined, Jones said. Data show Montgomery County police saw a 21% increase in such calls over the past two weeks, an average of 39 a day.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something we unfortunately expected knowing that people are going to be quarantined in their homes,‚Äù Jones said.\n\nOther agencies are experiencing similar trends.\n\nDetroit received 769 domestic violence calls over the past two weeks of March, a 9% spike from weeks prior. Tucson, Arizona, police recorded 292 domestic violence incidents, also up 9%. In Santa Rosa, California, which has been under shelter-in-place orders since March 17, city police saw domestic disturbance calls jump from 42 a week to 51.\n\nIn county jails, arrests on domestic-violence charges stayed relatively steady even as total inmate bookings fell by about half, data shows.\n\nOne of the fastest jail-booking declines occurred in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, where on Friday the 185th coronavirus infection was announced in the community of about 100,000 people. The Lafourche Parish Correctional Complex is now booking about as many people a week as it booked a day in February. It has eliminated in-person visitations.\n\nOfficers in Florida‚Äôs Volusia County, home to Daytona Beach, had charged about 25 people a week with driving under the influence before mid-March. It dropped to just 6 afterward.\n\nThe agency‚Äôs booking of senior citizens also fell during the same time period ‚Äì from a dozen a week to just two in the last two weeks of March. Senior citizens are among those most at risk for serious complications resulting from the coronavirus.\n\nThose trends are reflected nationwide. In the counties reviewed by USA TODAY, the average week included about 300 DUI bookings. Now, it‚Äôs at about 100. Senior citizens arrests are about a sixth of what they were in February.\n\nSeveral police departments also recorded significant drops in drug, narcotics and alcohol crimes ‚Äì some of the most common ways people land in jail in America, according to FBI data. Such incidents over the second half of March fell 76% in Denver; 87% in Providence, Rhode Island; and 45% in Seattle, the epicenter of the nation‚Äôs first major coronavirus outbreak, data shows.\n\nDrug charges often result from traffic stops, Jones said. But such stops have ground to a near halt in some regions across the country in the past two weeks. In Cincinnati, police logged an average of 384 traffic stops a week before mid-March but 39 a day after ‚Äì a 90% drop. In Santa Monica, California, traffic stops fell from 182 a week to 14. They fell 79% in Baltimore and 46% in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\n\nIn many regions, the traffic-stop declines dovetailed with fewer DUI incidents, which likely tanked after bars closed, Seattle police spokesman Patrick Michaud said. Police in Virginia Beach, Montgomery County and Seattle each recorded fewer than half as many DUIs in the second half of March compared with previous weeks on average.\n\n‚ÄúThere are just less crimes of opportunity when the opportunity all but disappears because everyone is spending time indoors,‚Äù said Michaud, adding that residential burglaries also have decreased in Seattle in recent weeks.\n\nBut as Americans transition to life at home, some also appear to be struggling with thin walls and noisy neighbors.\n\nIn addition to Baltimore, Virginia Beach police received 249 public nuisance and loud-party complaints since mid-March, an 87% increase from previous weeks. General noise disturbance calls to Cincinnati police rose from 109 a week to 154. Fargo, North Dakota, police received 36 disturbance and loud-party complaints, up from 26 on average in previous weeks.\n\nContributing: Hannah Winston, USA TODAY NETWORK", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/19/coronavirus-reader-questions-death-age-flu-symptoms-food-timeline/2863776001/", "title": "Coronavirus questions: Rent relief, unemployment, virus on surfaces", "text": "As the coronavirus pandemic continues to shut down daily life across the globe, thousands of our readers across the nation have asked us questions about COVID-19.\n\nAnd we're answering them.\n\nFor basic facts about the virus ‚Äì what it is, how it spreads and where it's located ‚Äì you can get caught up by reading our in-depth explainer here.

Ask us by filling out the form you can find here.\n\nCan UV radiation from the sun kill the virus?\n\n‚Äì Charlie from Dade City, Florida\n\nExperts have advised against using concentrated UV light to prevent or treat the coronavirus and do not recommend going in the sunlight to kill the virus. Only levels of concentration of UV light much higher than what is found in sunlight can kill viruses, the experts note, and the levels that are able to kill viruses can cause irritation to human skin and should be avoided.\n\nNeither sunlight or UV light is listed as a preventative measure on the websites of the World Health Organization or the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFact check:Sunlight does not kill the new coronavirus\n\nMy primary income is from rentals. If my tenants are unable to pay their rent, what kind of relief is available to me?\n\n‚Äì Vicki from Santa Rosa, California\n\nTrump in March signed the largest economic stimulus package in U.S. history. The stimulus provides forbearance on mortgage payments for up to a year but just for federally-backed loans. Some states and banks are also issuing relief for other types of mortgages. Once forbearance ends, borrowers would have to work out a repayment plan or loan modification with the mortgage servicer, the National Housing Law Project says.\n\nStill, several states are granting moratoriums to renters but not owners, potentially forcing owners to pay their mortgage, utilities, taxes and other costs even though they have less rental income.\n\nIs it true that everyone who is on unemployment due to COVID-19 will receive an additional $600 a week as part of the stimulus package?\n\n‚Äì Hannah from Canton, Ohio\n\nThe stimulus package expands unemployment insurance benefits. If you've lost your job because of the outbreak, you will see your weekly state insurance benefits ‚Äì which average about $400 ‚Äì increased by $600 for four months. And if you are still unemployed after state benefits end, you could get an additional 13 weeks of help.\n\nWhat are the results so far with the tests of the Z-Pak and malaria med, hydroxychloroquine?\n\n‚Äì Pat from Alexandria, Virginia\n\nThere are no approved therapies or drugs to treat COVID-19. Anecdotal reports suggest that a known anti-malarial (hydroxychloroquine) combined with a common antibiotic (azithromycin, sold as Zithromax and Z-Pak) may offer some benefit in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nA very small study in France of just a couple dozen patients found some evidence that the combination was effective in fighting COVID-19. A subsequent study of 80 patients in France found clinical improvement in all but one. Studies in China have suggested similar results.\n\nResearchers have warned that the drugs can have risky side effects and could cause subtle heart changes and increase a person's risk of developing arrhythmia.\n\nClinical trials of the drug combination began in New York on March 24, and the FDA on March 29 granted emergency use of hydroxychloroquine by hospitals. Several other clinical trials are in the works, according to ClinicalTrials.gov. But it's still too early to say whether the drugs are effective.\n\nHow many people have recovered from the virus?\n\n‚Äì Stephanie from Mt Pleasant, South Carolina\n\nMore than 191,000 people worldwide have recovered from the virus as of Wednesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Most of the recoveries have been in China, followed by Spain, Germany, Italy and Iran.\n\nOf the more than 203,000 confirmed cases in the U.S., more than 8,000 have recovered.\n\nWill families who receive food stamps be eligible for the stimulus check?\n\n‚Äì Renda from Miami, Florida\n\nYes, families who receive food stamps are eligible to receive a stimulus check! The $2 trillion stimulus plan includes one-time payments of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child, $367 billion for small businesses, $500 billion for loans to larger industries, $100 billion for hospitals and the health care system, and $600 more per week in unemployment benefits for those out of work.\n\nHere's how you can calculate the amount of stimulus money your household can expect.\n\nIs the virus a DNA molecule protected by a thin layer of fat that will disintegrate if that fat layer is removed outside your body?\n\n‚Äì Rita in Las Vegas, Nevada\n\nSARS-CoV-2 particles are spherical bundles of genetic material (RNA) surrounded by a fatty outer layer (lipids) with proteins called spikes protruding from the surface. These spikes latch onto receptor proteins on human cells in the lungs and other tissues and change the structure of those human cells, allowing the viral genes to enter the host cell to be copied, producing more viruses.\n\nViruses need a host to \"survive,\" and the fat layer breaks down when it is out on its own in the environment. Preliminary researc\n\nh suggests that the virus is stable outside the body for different periods of time, depending on the climate and surface. You can \"kill\" the virus using soap, extreme heat and ultraviolet light, and each attacks a different part of this virus structure. Soap breaks up the fatty outer layer. Heat breaks up the protein spikes. And UV light breaks up the genes inside.\n\nHas anyone with preexisting conditions gotten the coronavirus and survived?\n\n‚Äì Dee from Arlington, Texas\n\nYes, many people have. While the risk for serious disease and death from COVID-19 is higher in people who are older or who have certain preexisting conditions, thousands have survived.\n\nData from the CDC published Tuesday found that, as of March 28, the U.S. reported 2,692 patients who had one or more underlying health conditions. Of those patients, 173 died. This limited data suggests that thousands of people who have one or more underlying health conditions have not died.\n\nMoreover, a February WHO study of more than 70,000 coronavirus patients in China found that people with preexisting conditions had higher fatality rates than those without preexisting conditions: 13.2% for those with cardiovascular disease, 9.2% for diabetes, 8.4% for hypertension, 8.0% for chronic respiratory disease, and 7.6% for cancer. However, those figures suggest that large percentages of people with preexisting conditions survived.\n\nCan coronavirus be transmitted through secondhand smoke?\n\n‚Äì David from Columbus, Georgia\n\n\"It‚Äôs not the main mode of transmission. There's probably some component of airborne, but I don‚Äôt think secondhand smoke would be a compounding factor,\" said Tania Elliott, clinical instructor of infectious diseases at NYU Langone.\n\nIf the smoke irritates your lungs and causes you to cough, that poses a greater risk of transmission since the virus is thought to mainly spread through respiratory droplets when someone coughs or sneezes, Elliot said.\n\nSmokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 as the act of smoking means that fingers and possibly dirty cigarettes are in contact with lips, according to the WHO. Smokers may also already have lung disease or reduced lung capacity which would greatly increase risk of serious illness, the WHO says.\n\nWhile data is still evolving about how long the virus may remain alive, a recent study found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air.\n\nIs cross-country road travel advisable to destinations outside of COVID-19 'hot spots'?\n\n‚Äì Roland from Albuquerque, New Mexico\n\nThe White House is asking Americans to stay home as much as possible to slow the spread of the virus, and some states and local governments have issued \"stay home\" and \"shelter-in-place\" orders.\n\n\"I don‚Äôt think now‚Äôs the time to do it,\" Elliott said. \"If you have a house somewhere else, that's fine. But I wouldn‚Äôt recommend being in hotels or crowded public settings. If you want take a road trip and go camping, there's risk associated with that.\"\n\nCan you catch the virus from people who've died?\n\n‚Äì Nikki from Albany, Georgia\n\nThe main way the virus is thought to spread is through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and this is not a concern after death, according to the CDC. But people should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19, the CDC says.\n\nThere is no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19, the CDC says. Kissing, washing and shrouding should be avoided before, during and after the body has been prepared, if possible. But holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing may pose less of a risk, the CDC says.\n\nWhat is the value of testing for the coronavirus if there is currently no treatment?\n\n‚Äì Linda from Brevard County, Florida\n\nThere is value to getting tested because there are many reasons why someone would seek medical care for their symptoms, and ruling out the coronavirus is helpful in seeking other causes, said Jason Christie, chief of pulmonary medicine at Penn Medicine.\n\n\"The biggest problem is we don‚Äôt have a quick and reliable test right now. Without that, we have to be smart and ration the testing to those people that need them most. So don‚Äôt go out and get tested right now unless you‚Äôre sick,\" Christie said.\n\nTesting also helps health officials figure out how prevalent and contagious a virus is.\n\nIs it safe to get groceries during senior shopping hour?\n\n‚Äì Pamela from Wellsville, Pennsylvania\n\nAcknowledging that older adults and persons with underlying health conditions are more susceptible to COVID-19, a growing number of stores are dedicating time or opening earlier for senior shoppers and other at-risk groups.\n\nBut Elliott says she doesn't advise it. \"That gives a false sense of security,\" she said. \"By encouraging older people with chronic diseases to go out at a dedicated time, you're still exposing them to a bunch of other people, and if one person in that crowd is infected, then the virus will spread.\"\n\nElliott said she'd rather see stores limiting the number of people who can enter during a given time period so that there are fewer people in the store. She also encourages healthy people to do the shopping.\n\nCan the virus be transmitted through the mail? Should I stop sending greeting cards?\n\n‚Äì Pam from Seven Lakes, North Carolina\n\nThe chances of transmission through your mail is very low, Elliott says. \"Parts of the virus can fall on surfaces and survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours. But you have to have pretty good conditions for that to happen. So the likelihood would be very small, even with no precautions,\" she said.\n\nElliott advises people to put their mail down on a plastic plate instead of directly on a counter top or table, to use a letter opener, and to wash hands thoroughly after touching the mail.\n\nResearch on how long a virus may live on surfaces is evolving. The CDC has said there is likely very low risk of transmission of COVID-19 from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks \"because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces.\"\n\nA recent study found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. But a subsequent report from the CDC found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks.\n\nAre plastic grocery bags considered the plastic that you have to wait hours to touch?\n\n‚Äì Elizabeth from Greenfield, Indiana\n\nYou should take precaution with any containers, Elliott says. \"The plastic grocery bags I‚Äôd throw out right away, wash your hands and then clean your food. Chances (of infection) are low,\" she said. \"But better yet, bring your own bags! It‚Äôs better for the environment anyway.\"\n\nThey keep saying stay isolated for two weeks. But what happens after the two weeks?\n\n‚Äì Al from Topeka, Kansas\n\nOfficials suggest self-quarantining for two weeks if you've had exposure to somebody with the virus and might be infected. It's a way to monitor if symptoms develop and, at the same time, avoid any possible spread to others. Since the incubation period for the virus is up to 14 days, you're \"cleared\" for the virus after two weeks, Elliott said.\n\nAfter that, you still need to practice social distancing.\n\nIs it advantageous for a younger healthy person to get the coronavirus to build immunity to it?\n\n‚Äì Danny from Sundance, Wyoming\n\nNo, for several reasons, says Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\nWhile a protective antibody is generated in those who are infected, scientists are not yet sure whether that immunity will last for a short period of time, for years or for life. Some say the possibility of reinfection is very likely.\n\nMoreover, a new federal health report says Americans of all ages have faced serious health complications amid the outbreak. Data from the CDC show that among the roughly 12% of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. known to need hospitalizations, about 1 in 5 were among people ages 20 to 44. Anywhere from 14% to 21% of adults ages 20 to 44 with COVID-19 have been hospitalized, the CDC data estimates. Two to 4% of cases led to ICU admissions, and less than 1% were fatal.\n\nFinally, it's important to avoid getting and spreading the virus. While the young may not be the most at risk, they're carrying the disease to those who are more vulnerable, such as older people and those with underlying conditions. Dr. Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, on Wednesday urged \"the millennial generation\" to take special precautions. \"You have the potential to spread it,\" she said.\n\nDoes getting pneumonia shots given to elderly people help if you get this virus?\n\n‚Äì Linda from Hendersonville, Tennessee\n\nVaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization. The vaccines simply guard against those specific bacterial infections.\n\nThe COVID-19 virus can, in fact, cause pneumonia, but the vaccines cannot prevent this pneumonia.\n\nI see people in my neighborhood out running, riding bikes and walking their dogs. Is that OK?\n\n‚Äì Patti from Carmel, Indiana\n\nYes, that's OK! Just be sure to maintain distance from other people. The CDC recommends a distance of about 6 feet. Even in states and counties where residents are being asked to stay home or \"shelter in place,\" it's still fine to go for a run, hike or do other outdoor activities, as long as proper social distancing is observed.\n\nJust don't be like Chicago, where city officials closed trails and parks after crowds of hundreds of people were seen congregating along the city‚Äôs lakefront.\n\nRemember: The White House recommends that you should avoid social gatherings involving more than 10 people, as well as all non-essential travel, shopping trips and social visits.\n\nSocial distancing:Why it's so important to stopping the spread of coronavirus\n\nAre there any projections to estimate the spread of COVID-19 and a timeline of its passing?\n\n‚Äì Dennis from Las Vegas\n\nYes, there are many projections, but scientists say they all hinge on how people behave. That's why it's essential to social distance and do what you can to prevent spread.\n\nA conservative USA TODAY analysis based on data from the American Hospital Association, U.S. Census, CDC and WHO estimates that 23.8 million Americans could contract COVID-19, leaving almost six seriously ill patients for every existing hospital bed. Another analysis finds that America‚Äôs trajectory of community spread is trending toward Italy‚Äôs, where circumstances are dire.\n\nOne researcher at the Global Center for Health Security estimated last month that as many as 96 million Americans could be infected. The U.S. population on March 27 is estimated at 329 million.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security estimated that 38 million Americans will need medical care for COVID-19. The CDC's worst-case-scenario is that about 160 million to 210 million Americans will be infected by December. Under this forecast, 21 million people would need hospitalization and 200,000 to 1.7 million could die by the end of the year.\n\nOutside the U.S., leaked British documents projected that a coronavirus outbreak could rage until spring 2021. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said 60% to 70% of her country's population could eventually become infected.\n\nUSA TODAY analysis:America's coronavirus 'curve' may be at its most dangerous point\n\nIs it safe to get carry-out food?\n\n‚Äì Debby from Omena, Michigan\n\nThe CDC and WHO have not issued formal guidance on carry-out food.\n\nWhile the CDC says that there is no evidence to support transmission associated with food, a person may get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own face. The virus can, for example, survive on cardboard up to 24 hours, according to a recent study.\n\nThe issue of carry-out food also raises concerns about the risk couriers are facing by interacting with customers during their shifts. That's why some companies are now offering \"contactless\" delivery options that help people maintain social distancing by allowing couriers to ring the doorbell and leave the package outside.\n\nStudy finds:Coronavirus can live in the air for hours and on surfaces for days\n\nHow soon after exposure can you test positive?\n\n‚Äì Pam from Easton, Maryland\n\nThere's no specific data on this question yet, according to Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic‚Äôs Vaccine Research Group. However, we do know that someone infected with the virus may begin showing symptoms anywhere between one and 14 days after catching the virus, most commonly around five days, according to the WHO.\n\n\"The peak viral shedding occurs during the first five days after the onset of symptoms. My guess is that within a few days of being exposed, these patients are beginning to shed virus,\" Poland said.\n\nA recent report from the CDC studying an outbreak at a care home in Washington State found that among 23 residents who tested positive for the virus, 13 were asymptomatic. Within a week, 10 of those 13 developed symptoms, with onset at 3 days.\n\nDo the symptoms for COVID-19 come together or can you have separate symptoms showing up at different times?\n\n‚Äì Carlos from Los Angeles\n\nThe most common symptoms are fever, tiredness and dry cough, according to the WHO. Shortness of breath is also among the most common symptoms, according to the CDC. In most cases where symptoms present, those symptoms come together, Hotez said.\n\n\"Usually it presents with fever and cough, or fever, cough, and shortness of breath,\" he said. \"It might present with one of those symptoms first, but then it rapidly progresses to the others.\"\n\nSome patients also have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. Some people do not have symptoms at all.\n\nA New York neurosurgeon is warning people against looking out for fever as the first tell-tale symptom of the virus. His symptoms began with a little bit of congestion and only later progressed to a fever, body aches and chills.\n\nMore on testing:Coronavirus test swabs aren't your standard Q-tips, and they're running out as testing ramps up\n\nHow do you actually die from the coronavirus? What happens?\n\n‚Äì Catherine from Carson City, Nevada\n\nIn some cases, the virus ultimately damages tiny air sacs in the lungs, restricting oxygen to the bloodstream and depriving other major organs ‚Äì including the liver, kidney and brain ‚Äì of oxygen.\n\nSevere cases of coronavirus:Some result in brain damage, inability to walk\n\nIn a small number of severe cases, that can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which requires a patient be placed on a ventilator to supply oxygen. However, if too much of the lung is damaged and not enough oxygen is supplied to the rest of the body, respiratory failure could lead to organ failure and death.\n\nHere's what that looks like inside the body.\n\nWhat is the age range of U.S. deaths from COVID-19?\n\n‚Äì Becky from Bentonville, Arkansas\n\nIn the U.S., ages range from an infant less than one year old to people in their 90s, according to state and local health departments.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health said Saturday that an infant coronavirus patient younger than one year old in Chicago had died. An investigation was underway to determine the cause of death. \"There has never before been a death associated with COVID-19 in an infant,\" department Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said.\n\nThis week health officials also reported that a 17-year-old teen in New Orleans died after contracting the virus. And a 2-month-old in Nashville who tested positive for the virus could be the youngest patient in the nation, officials say.\n\nHowever, this range is not conclusive because health officials have not released the specific ages of several other patients, and new deaths are being reported each day.\n\nIf a person is sick with the coronavirus and gets tested for the flu, would the flu test be positive?\n\n‚Äì Antonio from Patchogue, New York\n\nNo, the presence of the coronavirus would not turn a flu test positive. However, it's possible to have both the coronavirus and the flu at the same time. In that case, the flu test would be positive.\n\nThe opposite is also true: Presence of the flu would not result in a positive coronavirus test. It's important to note that, even if someone tests negative for the coronavirus, they still may be infected with the coronavirus.\n\nI was told I should be tested if I could not easily inhale a large breath and hold it for at least 10 seconds. Is this good advice?\n\n‚ÄìTed from Scottsdale, Arizona\n\nNo. While shortness of breath is among the most common symptoms of the virus, according to the CDC, that diagnosis does not necessarily involve holding a large breath for 10 seconds. Medically known as dyspnea, shortness of breath is often described as \"an intense tightening in the chest, air hunger, difficulty breathing, breathlessness or a feeling of suffocation,\" according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nIf you think you may be sick, call your doctor and follow CDC guidance.\n\nCan masks be reused by an infected person or used only once?\n\n‚Äì Debra from Dayton, Ohio\n\nThe longer a mask is used and the more damp it becomes, the less effective it is, Poland said. \"But it is definitely better than the alternative of no mask!\"\n\nContributing: Molly Stellino, Adrianna Rodriguez, Dalvin Brown, Marco della Cava, Jayme Fraser and Matt Wynn\n\nFollow Grace Hauck on Twitter @grace_hauck", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/19"}]}

She manages Chasing Bugs, a platform that promotes appreciation and stewardship of insects and spiders. The opinions in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN ‚Äî\n\nIf you live in the eastern United States and have been besieged by infestations of spotted lanternflies, your misery is almost over: With the weather getting cooler, adult lanternflies will gradually die off and disappear entirely before winter. But relief is likely to be temporary, as a new brood of the highly invasive insects is set to emerge in the spring.\n\nIf you‚Äôve been lucky enough so far not to have seen swarms of lanternflies in your neighborhood, it may only be a matter of time. Female lanternflies are already laying their eggs, which will overwinter on trees and on hard surfaces. Given that each egg mass contains 30-50 eggs, we could be looking at large armies of the insects again beginning in May.\n\nDanae Wolfe Courtesy Danae Wolfe\n\nThere will probably be thousands fewer lanternflies than there might have been, given that untold numbers have been hunted and stomped to death in recent months. But to be perfectly honest, all of the squashing barely put a dent in the lanternfly population. To slow its inexorable spread across the United States, we will need a more strategic approach.\n\nResearch published in June predicted that, without more aggressive preventative management, the spotted lanternfly has a high probability of reaching California within the next decade, which could prove devastating to the state‚Äôs wine industry. Some Pennsylvania vineyards have already seen 90% of their harvest destroyed in recent years. Wine producers in Virginia and New York are bracing for similar devastation.\n\nNative to Asia, the spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) was first found in the United States in 2014 in a stand of tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima) in Berks County, Pennsylvania. Experts believe the insect made its way here after hitchhiking on a shipment of stone from China a few years earlier. Since then, populations of the pest have spread to well over a dozen eastern states.\n\nAfter overwintering, spotted lanternfly eggs hatch in the spring, giving way to small nymphs that are black with white spots. As they grow, the nymphs turn red while retaining black and white spots, eventually maturing into colorful, winged adults. To some, the insect resembles a moth, but spotted lanternfly is a true bug ‚Äì with piercing, sucking mouthparts that help it feed on plants, which can cause wilting and dieback of host plants and a decline in crop yield and quality. To make matters worse, spotted lanternflies secrete a sugary substance called honeydew as they feed, which aids in the growth of black sooty mold and may attract additional pests which can further damage trees.\n\nBut killing lanternflies one by one, while emotionally satisfying for some, might not be enough to rid us of the pests. More effective containment methods are being explored in the interlude before their re-emergence in the spring.\n\nOne eradication method involves limiting the spotted lanternfly‚Äôs access to its favorite vegetation. The insect has been observed feeding on over 100 plant species worldwide, but its meal of choice is the tree of heaven, an aggressive, invasive tree that hails from lanternflies‚Äô native regions in Asia and is helping the insects spread by providing them a ubiquitous food source.\n\nThe tree of heaven was brought to the United States in the 1700s as a fast-growing exotic shade tree. Known for its ability to thrive in even the harshest environments, it inspired Betty Smith‚Äôs classic 1943 novel, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, as a symbol of endurance. And endure, it has: The qualities that made the tree desirable centuries ago have made it nearly impossible to eradicate today.\n\nResearchers are studying the effectiveness of controlling tree of heaven populations through fungal pathogens, which may help limit the insect‚Äôs westward spread. Targeting tree of heaven with insecticides may also help reduce lanternfly populations. When done correctly, this ‚Äútrap tree‚Äù method can be effective at killing adult lanternflies before they lay their eggs.\n\nSince little else feeds on tree of heaven, the risk to non-target organisms is minimal. Experts warn, however, that insecticides must be applied at the right time of year to be most effective.\n\nOther research involves the use of parasitoid wasps which can attack spotted lanternflies in their egg or nymph stages, before the pest reproduce. But since these parasitoids are not native to the US either, more research is needed to ascertain if they could also become problematic.\n\nMother Nature is also lending a hand in a small way at keeping the numbers of this pest in check: Indiscriminate predators like praying mantises, birds, bats, frogs, and snakes have been observed feeding on the lanternfly, providing some hope that nature will one day be able to provide its own checks and balances.\n\nA field technician holds a spotted lanternfly Friday at a farm in Pennsylvania. Lauren A. Little/MediaNews Group/Reading Eagle via Getty Images\n\nUnfortunately, it takes time to restore balance after the introduction of a new species. Predator-prey relationships are usually a product of evolution, developing over many hundreds or thousands of years making it difficult for nature to quickly adapt. Predators simply haven‚Äôt developed a taste yet, for the lanternfly.\n\nSo, are the campaigns to squash the bug helping at all? In a word, yes. Every little bit helps: Adult and nymph lanternflies should be swiftly killed when spotted. But exercise care before coming down hard with the boot ‚Äì naturalists are finding that people have inadvertently been killing a variety of other insects having mistaken them for lanternflies, including moths and other beneficial bugs. Take time to learn how to properly identify the pest.\n\nA more effective measure than killing individual adults is keeping an eye out for and disposing of lanternfly eggs. During the fall months, adult females lay gray egg masses. These masses resemble splotches of mud or plaster on hard flat surfaces like trees, though spotted lanternflies will lay eggs on other surfaces like buildings, playground equipment, and cars.\n\nIf found, spotted lanternfly egg masses should be scraped from surfaces into a plastic bag and filled with rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer. When traveling, especially to an area with a known infestation, be sure to check family members and pets, vehicles, and camping and other outdoor gear before leaving.\n\nWrapping trees with sticky bands to capture nymphs as they emerge can also be an effective control measure, but some experts oppose this idea noting that sticky bands indiscriminately capture and injure all sorts of other wildlife including birds, bats, and beneficial insects.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion‚Äôs newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWhile individual action won‚Äôt completely eradicate the spotted lanternfly, it can help curb its spread, giving researchers ‚Äì and nature ‚Äì time to catch up. And individual action might grow into collective action, eliciting a legislative response or corporate initiatives: Both will be needed to better monitor international trade and commerce and provide better checks on imported and exported goods, which could help identify and suppress future infestations.\n\nIt seems likely that our collective future will include some number of spotted lanternflies in it. But with these efforts at control and management, it might be possible to curb the bug‚Äôs worst impacts.", "authors": ["Danae Wolfe"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2021/09/14/spotted-lanternfly-indiana-how-to-prevent/8317704002/", "title": "Spotted lanternflies found in Indiana. Here's what to do.", "text": "A dangerous invasive pest has infiltrated Indiana from the east, making the Hoosier state a front line for stopping the infestation from spreading further.\n\nThe Spotted lanternfly was found in a 90-acre wooded lot in southeastern Indiana in July, marking the westernmost known infestation of a pest known for decimating vineyards, destroying fruit trees and dismantling hardwood forest ecosystems.\n\nNo one knows exactly how it got there, but experts say it is essential to move quickly to address the issue before the insects spread further west. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources is hard at work in collaboration with other researchers and the property landowners to get the issue under control, but it could take years, said the state's lead entomologist Megan Abraham.\n\nInvasive plants:What happens if you don't remove these invasive plants lurking in your Indiana yard\n\n\"We have concerns of this insect changing the biodiversity in the understory of all of our hardwood forests,\" said Abraham, director of the DNR's Division of Entomology and Plant Pathology. \"The longer we can hold off of these invasives spreading, the better off we all are.\"\n\nHere's what you need to know about the spread of the Spotted lanternfly, how it could impact Indiana, and what's being done to stop it.\n\nWhat is a Spotted lanternfly?\n\nWith wide, black- and white-spotted wings and mismatching patterns overlaying a shock of candy-red, the Spotted lanternfly doesn't look much like it belongs among the woods of Indiana.\n\nThat's because it doesn't. The insect is actually native to China.\n\nSpotted lanternflies were first found in the U.S. in Pennsylvania in 2014. No one's sure how it got there, Abraham said, but some suspect some specimens may have traveled as eggs on goods being shipped from Asia.\n\nAt first, officials in Pennsylvania thought they had contained the infestation, but the creatures escaped and have now been found in 10 states.\n\nHow did the infestation get to Indiana?\n\nLike trainhoppers, scientists believe Spotted lanternflies are sneaking from state to state on freight trains.\n\nThe insects feed on certain trees such as fruit trees, ornamental trees and tree-of-heaven, the latter of which happens to frequent railway corridors.\n\nSpotted lanternfly eggs are extremely hard to find. The insect lays eggs \"in just about anything you can think of,\" Abraham said, and covers them up so the area will often just look like a smear of mud. This means humans are often spreading this insect without knowing it, on shipping containers, railroad cars and firewood.\n\nKnowing this, DNR researchers have been looking for signs of the Spotted lanternfly near Indiana's railways and highways for years, Abraham said. But it wasn't until they received an email from a homeowner inquiring about a strange red bug he'd seen on his property that they knew they'd found it.\n\nThe infestation is in a 90-acre woodlot in Vevay, Indiana, in Switzerland County. The lot is jointly owned by a couple of homeowners that don't use it often, Abraham said, and it appears as though the insects have been living, breeding and feeding there for at least a few years.\n\nThe pests have also been found in Cleveland, Ohio, as well as in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nInvasive plants:This deadly invasive weed is moving into Indiana's parks, flower beds and backyard gardens\n\nWhat makes a Spotted lanternfly dangerous?\n\nThe snazzy Spotted lanternfly feeds on the sap from trees such as fruit trees and hardwoods, and when they do so, they swarm it.\n\nThe bugs also act as congregate feeders, Abraham said, meaning they feed in large groups at once. Losing this many resources can weaken the tree and mean it may struggle to survive the winter months.\n\nIn doing so, the insects also produce a sticky and highly sugary waste product called \"honeydew.\" This substance attracts mold, bees and other insects that kill understory plants as well.\n\n\"This is an insect that can have a dramatic effect on a woodlot, just by lazily feeding and staying in the same place for a long amount of time,\" Abraham said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture warns that several plants are at risk from the Spotted lanternfly, including: almonds, apples, apricots, cherries, grapes, hops, nectarines, peaches, plums and maple, oak, pine, poplar, sycamore, walnut and willow trees.\n\nBut one of the biggest commodities at threat from Spotted lanternfly infestations are actually vineyards, Abraham said. When the bug feeds on vines, it actually changes the pH of its grapes and makes them unusable. In addition to Indiana vineyards that could be affected, researchers fear that the lanternflies could riddle the west coast wine industry if they were allowed to spread.\n\nA point of concern in staunching this spread is that there are a few RV parks just outside of the woodlot hosting Indiana's infestation, Abraham said. If the invasion isn't contained, lanternflies could hitchhike out of state on these RVs when they travel.\n\nWhat's being done to contain the infestation?\n\nThe DNR has treated the infested woodlot with pesticides multiple times since the Spotted lanternflies were found in July.\n\nTo do so, officials use backpack sprayers to spray the pesticide on the bark of the tree, where the chemical then penetrates to the inside of the tree. Any Spotted lanternflies that feed on that tree then also consume the pesticide and die.\n\nDNR officials are specifically spraying tree-of-heaven, one of the Spotted lanternfly's favorite snacks. In some areas, they're killing off smaller seedlings of this tree in hopes of creating a \"trap tree.\" The lanternfly, without the option of other trees to feed, would settle on the trap tree only to be poisoned by the pesticides within it.\n\nBradford pears:Bradford pear trees are highly invasive. This is why they aren't banned in Indiana.\n\nSo far, the DNR has sprayed about 160 trees in the area, and has plans to return and spray more this week. The chemicals are not expected to affect groundwater or surrounding homes and businesses in any way.\n\n\"It's going to be an area that we're going to have to treat for a few years,\" Abraham said, \"but hopefully we'll be able to stop it from spreading.\"\n\nA major source of help has been working with colleagues in Pennsylvania, where the first known infestation began and where researchers have already been working to contain the Spotted lanternfly for seven years. The state of Pennsylvania has offered to send treatment trucks, chemicals, equipment and staff members to Indiana's site and help DNR staff.\n\n\"We're very lucky that we've got partners like this,\" Abraham said. \"It just shows how important everybody feels that this pest is stopped.\"\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nIndiana's infestation was discovered when one person reached out to the DNR, so Abraham asks that if you see something that looks unusual in your backyard, tell the department!\n\nReport Spotted lanternfly sightings to Abraham's team through email at DEPP@dnr.IN.gov or call them at 866-NO EXOTIC, or 866-663-9684.\n\nFall is one of the best times of the year to spot a lanternfly because they've reached their adult size and are especially easy to see.\n\nThe USDA suggests checking your outdoor items for lanternfly egg masses and inspecting your trees and plants for signs of the insect, especially at dusk and night when they tend to feed. If you frequently travel in and out of state, it may also be helpful to be careful about inspecting the items you bring and whatever might be on them, such as mud.\n\n\"This insect obviously found its way to a non-heavily trafficked area in the middle of nowhere in Indiana, so that means it can find its way anywhere,\" Abraham said. \"We really have to be conscious of what we are moving and where we're moving it, and what might be on it when we do move it.\"\n\nContact IndyStar reporter London Gibson at 317-419-1912 or lbgibson@gannett.com.

The state will collect data from 21 monitors installed in late April around downtown Juneau, the Juneau Empire reports. The devices use lasers to measure particulate and report online in near-real time. They will remain in place through October. Fine particulate is tiny particles that can be inhaled and at high levels can cause health problems including respiratory illness, aggravated asthma, heart attacks and premature death. In the Fairbanks North Star Borough, where people burn wood as an alternative to expensive fuel oil, fine particulate is a perennial winter problem.\n\nArizona\n\nGrand Canyon National Park: Scenic State Route 67 will reopen Wednesday in time for the summer season of hikers, backpackers, and tourists visiting the remote North Rim of the Grand Canyon. The area closes from mid-October through mid-May each year because of heavy snowfall, more than 9 feet during an average winter, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation. When the national park lodge, campground, visitor center and restaurants reopen toward the end of spring, so does SR 67, the winding 31-mile road lined by pines and aspens that connects Jacobs Lake to the Kaibab Plateau. Only about 10% of Grand Canyon visitors go to the North Rim, but enthusiasts willing to make the extra travel are rewarded with a more intimate experience, says Grand Canyon National Park spokesperson Kris Fister.\n\nArkansas\n\nPonca: For the fourth year in a row, the Buffalo National River will host a free concert by band National Park Radio, on June 15 at Steel Creek Campground.

The agency‚Äôs initial target date was December 2020, but that was delayed by a year in 2017 as officials increased the budget to $1.75 billion. The Los Angeles Times reports Sunday that the latest delay comes as the contractor grapples with labor shortages. The project requires nearly 4 miles of excavation for two tunnels and three subway stations. The twin tunnels are designed to connect three lines into two mega-routes that will allow passengers to ride long distances without changing trains.\n\nColorado\n\nBreckenridge: A huge wooden troll has found a new home in this ski town. The Summit Daily reports that the troll has been relocated to a spot behind an ice arena in the south end of Breckenridge. The troll‚Äôs creator, Danish artist Thomas Dambo, visited the location Friday to affix a heart-shaped stone to the troll‚Äôs wooden body. It was originally assembled beside a trail last summer for a festival, but it was so popular with visitors that nearby homeowners complained about the crowds. It was taken down in November. The troll, named Isak Heartstone, stands 15 feet high. The site is not open to the public yet. The town is building a trail and surrounding amenities, which are expected to open by early June.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont has signed legislation that could lead to the production of industrial hemp in the state. The Democrat says the new law will provide farmers an opportunity to ‚Äúbolster their profits with hemp.‚Äù He says it will also attract veteran and first-time farmers to a new and growing market. The legislation passed both the state House of Representatives and Senate by unanimous votes. Under the new law, the Connecticut Department of Agriculture is required to establish a pilot program for growing or cultivating industrial hemp. The federal government recently allowed states to grow, use or sell the product, which proponents say has thousands of uses. Connecticut‚Äôs regulations will ultimately need federal approval.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state House is set to vote on a bill that largely prohibits retailers from providing single-use carryout plastic bags to customers. The bill slated for a vote Tuesday is aimed at cutting down on the amount of plastic bags cluttering landfills, littering roadways and clogging stormwater systems. The bill applies to stores with more than 7,000 square feet of sales space and chain stores with three or more locations having at least 3,000 square feet of sales space. Restaurants are excluded from the bag ban, which also allows exceptions for bags used to wrap meat, fish, flowers or plants or that contain unwrapped food items. You could also still carry a goldfish home from a pet store or your laundry from the dry cleaners in plastic bags.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The nation‚Äôs capital has the highest use of drugs in the entire country, according to a new report from the personal finance website Wallethub, WUSA-TV reports. The district scored a 59.95 on a 100-point scale by Wallethub‚Äôs metrics, ranking as No. 1 for the highest use of drugs and addiction. According to the findings of the report, the District of Columbia also ranked in the top five for highest use of drugs by adults and teenagers. In order to determine which states have the biggest drug problems, WalletHub compared the 50 states and D.C. in three categories: drug use and addiction, law enforcement, and drug health issues and rehab.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A quiet South Beach neighborhood has become a battleground between preservationists and homeowners who want more freedom over their properties. Residents of leafy Palm View are divided over a push to repeal the area‚Äôs historic designation, which protects the neighborhood‚Äôs Mediterranean Revival homes and low-rise apartment buildings from demolition. But it also limits property owners‚Äô ability to build more resilient structures, and residents say flooding in the area is getting worse. South Florida is expected to see 1 to 2 feet of sea level rise by 2060, according to a projection from the Southeast Florida Climate Compact. In Palm View, some residents say being able to build newer, more resilient structures has become increasingly important. The neighborhood borders the Collins Canal.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A group of students from Spelman and Morehouse colleges who‚Äôve been studying Michelle Obama‚Äôs memoir, ‚ÄúBecoming,‚Äù had a surprise visitor to discuss the work ‚Äì the former first lady herself. Obama came to Spelman to talk with the students Saturday about the best-selling book ahead of her sold-out appearance Saturday night at State Farm Arena in downtown Atlanta. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports Obama encouraged the 18 students to have faith in themselves, saying she learned through her eight years in the White House and elsewhere that she is as smart and capable as the well-educated and famous leaders she encountered.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. lawmakers representing the state want a large-scale study conducted on the impact sunscreen chemicals have on humans and coral reefs around the world. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono, along with Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., last week introduced the Oxybenzone and Octinoxate Impact Study Act of 2019, which would require the Environmental Protection Agency to study the impacts of the chemicals on human and the environment. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard also introduced the act along with the Reef Safe Act of 2019 that would require the Food and Drug Administration to develop standards for the ‚ÄúReef Safe‚Äù designation in over-the-counter sunscreens. Last year, Hawaii enacted a law banning the sale or distribution of over-the-counter sunscreens containing oxybenzone and octinoxate.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two city parks are being renamed to honor Native Americans from the local past. Idaho Press reports the Boise City Council voted unanimously on the name changes last week. Now Quarry View Park will be renamed Eagle Rock Park, and Castle Rock Reserve will be renamed Chief Eagle Eye Reserve. The council also voted unanimously on a resolution that reasserts the city‚Äôs directives to honor contributing contributions to the area by indigenous people. Eagle Rock is the traditional name of a balancing rock above Quarry View Park, and it‚Äôs a significant site for tribes in what is now Treasure Valley. Eagle Eye was chief of a band of 70 Weiser Shoshone who moved to the mountains of Idaho secretly in 1878 instead of relocating to a reservation.\n\nIllinois\n\nUrbana: The University of Illinois is planning to name its Micro and Nanotechnology Lab after an engineering visionary who created the first practical LED. Professor emeritus Nick Holonyak Jr., a UI engineering alumnus, found a new alloy in 1962 that would emit light in the red segment of the visible spectrum. Energy-saving LEDs, or light-emitting diodes, are now universal and used in everything from flashlights and electronics to spacecraft. UI trustees will vote this week on whether to name the UI Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory in Holonyak‚Äôs honor, the News-Gazette reports. UI College of Engineering officials say very few graduates in UI‚Äôs 152-year history have had as much influence as the Franklin County native.\n\nIndiana\n\nPorter: Indiana Dunes National Park says visitors can reserve campsites, beginning Wednesday. In past years, all 66 sites at Dunewood campground were available on a first-come, first-served basis. Under the new system, 34 sites can be reserved up to six months in advance. The remaining 32 sites will remain first-come, first-served. The price is $25 per night. The campground is open April through October. An online reservation system goes live at 9 a.m. CDT Wednesday. For more information, contact the park‚Äôs information desk at (219) 395-1882, or visit its website. The park covers 15,000 acres along the southern shore of Lake Michigan in northwestern Indiana.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Officials say a dog disease that can be passed to humans has been confirmed in the state. The state veterinarian, Dr. Jeff Kaisand, says several cases of canine brucellosis have been confirmed at a commercial breeding facility for small dogs in Marion County. The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship says it is notifying people who have custody of the exposed dogs. Both the animals and the facilities are quarantined while the dogs undergo testing. Signs of the disease in a dog include infertility, spontaneous abortions and stillbirths. State health officials say symptoms for humans include fever, sweats, headache, joint pain and weakness. The department says the threat to most pet owners is very low. Dog breeders and veterinary staff may be at higher risk.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: Nurse practitioners are fighting to get rid of the state requirement that they get permission to work from a physician. KCUR-FM reports Kansas is one of the few states that still make advanced practice nurses sign contracts with doctors. Physicians argue the contracts are to protect patients by ensuring that nurses collaborate with their more educated colleagues. But nurses are fighting back against the contracts, which they say limit patient options and can even give doctors a cut of their earnings for little to no work. A bill seeking to drop the collaborative contract requirement died in a legislative maneuver this year. But nurse practitioners hope to try again, offering to make new nurse practitioners work a few years before dropping their contracts with doctors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: In the past three years, the state has made great strides toward addressing food insecurity in distressed rural communities ‚Äì and it‚Äôs become a model for other states looking to try new solutions. Earlier this year, Kentucky hosted the first-ever Summit on Rural Child Hunger, organized by the national No Kid Hungry campaign. The state was selected in part because of its Hunger Initiative, launched by Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles in 2016. Since it began, the initiative has donated more than 150 refrigerated coolers and freezers to dozens of food pantries statewide; created an economic incentive for summer meal programs, encouraging the purchase of more fruits and vegetables from local farmers; and advocated for the continued funding of the Farm to Food Banks Trust Fund, which awards grants to eligible nonprofit organizations that provide food to low-income Kentuckians.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A federal judge has conditionally dismissed a lawsuit that claimed three ailing death row inmates in the state were being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment through high heat indexes. The Advocate reports attorneys for the inmates and the state Department of Corrections jointly requested to dismiss the 2013 civil rights lawsuit. U.S. District Judge Brian Jackson ruled in 2016 that cell heat indexes exceeding 88 degrees constitute cruel and unusual punishment, but the ruling was overturned because it defined a maximum heat index. The conditional dismissal requires Louisiana to remain in ‚Äúsubstantial compliance‚Äù with an agreement it signed last year. That agreement requires the inmates to have daily showers, individual ice containers and fans, water faucets in their cells and other cooling techniques.\n\nMaine\n\nSaint George: A state agency has been awarded $1 million to help acquire an island in the state‚Äôs midcoast area for conservation. The U.S. Department of the Interior‚Äôs National Coastal Wetland Conservation Grants program is making the money available to help preserve Clark Island in the Saint George area. Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree says the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife will work with Maine Coast Heritage Trust on the conservation project. Pingree says the money will be used to buy 168 acres of Clark Island. The acres abut an existing 250-acre state conservation easement in Saint George. Pingree says the preservation of the site will protect habitat for birds and allow for recreational opportunities.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan signed a first-in-the-nation measure Monday to make it easier for people without health insurance to find out if they qualify for low-cost insurance after they file their taxes. The new law will create a box for people to check on state income tax returns. If it‚Äôs checked, the state‚Äôs health care exchange will see if the person qualifies for Medicaid, based on information in the tax return, and those who are eligible will be enrolled automatically. The exchange will reach out to people who qualify for private coverage. Hogan, a Republican, highlighted bipartisan work in the Democrat-controlled General Assembly on other health-related measures he signed Monday. One of them raises the smoking age from 18 to 21 and includes vaping in the definition of tobacco products.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A proposed $2 billion wind farm planned for federal waters off Martha‚Äôs Vineyard has been awarded a key permit by a state board responsible for reviewing proposed large energy facilities. The Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board last week approved requests filed by Vineyard Wind for the construction and operation of the 84-turbine, 800-megawatt wind farm about 14 miles south of Martha‚Äôs Vineyard off the Massachusetts Coast. Project officials call the permit approval a significant milestone toward the wind farm‚Äôs construction. In February the project also received a key approval from Rhode Island regulators after the state‚Äôs Coastal Resources Management Council determined the project is consistent with state policies.\n\nMichigan\n\nDearborn: An exhibition at the Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation in suburban Detroit is offering a glimpse into the world of ‚ÄúStar Trek.‚Äù Titled ‚ÄúStar Trek: Exploring New Worlds,‚Äù the exhibition runs through Sept. 2 at the museum in Dearborn. It offers a look at more than 100 artifacts and props from the original TV series and its spinoffs. It also explores its enduring impact on culture, from arts and technology to fashion and literature. The traveling exhibition from Seattle‚Äôs Museum of Pop Culture includes a tricorder, communicator and phaser from the original series. It also features artifacts from the ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù films and original set pieces, including a navigation console and costumes. The exhibition is a collaboration involving CBS Consumer Products, which manages licensing and merchandizing for the network.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBrainerd: A University of Minnesota study links the decline of walleye in Mille Lacs Lake to a loss of habitat resulting from clearer water. Minnesota Public Radio reports the study was published in the journal Ecosphere. Lead author Gretchen Hansen says researchers used 30 years of data on the lake‚Äôs water clarity and temperature to estimate how walleye habitat has changed. Walleye prefer low light and cooler water. But in recent decades, Mille Lacs‚Äô water clarity has increased, most likely due to septic system improvements around the lake and the invasion of zebra mussels. Hansen says that has reduced walleye habitat. The study suggests that altering annual harvest levels based on changing water clarity and temperature could help sustain the walleye population. State officials currently base limits on the estimated number of fish in the lake.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: A local chef has won a major culinary award after five previous nominations. The James Beard Foundation last week named Vishwesh Bhatt of Snackbar in Oxford as its 2019 winner for best chef in the foundation‚Äôs South region. Bhatt tells The Oxford Eagle winning was ‚Äújust an incredible feeling.‚Äù He‚Äôs thanking Oxford restauranteur John Currence, whose City Grocery Restaurant Group owns Snackbar, City Grocery and other restaurants in Oxford. Bhatt also attributes his success to the restaurant‚Äôs staff. Bhatt has been the lead chef at Snackbar since it opened in 2009.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A popular animal at the St. Louis Zoo is celebrating a milestone birthday: Merah the Sumatran orangutan is 50 years old. Merah reached the half-century mark Monday. She was born May 13, 1969, at a zoo in the Netherlands. She came to St. Louis in 1992. Merah is a five-time mother, the grandmother of two and great-grandmother of one. The zoo says that when Merah gave birth to Ginger in 2014 at age 45, she became the oldest Sumatran orangutan in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums Orangutan Species Survival Plan to give birth and rear her offspring. Sumatran, Bornean and Tapanuli orangutan species are classified as critically endangered due to habitat loss. The zoo says fewer than 125,000 orangutans remain in the wild.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A vintage plane restored by volunteers has lifted off for the first time in nearly 20 years. The Missoulian reports that the 75-year-old Dakota DC-3 known as Miss Montana flew over Missoula on a test flight Sunday. It was the first time it was airborne since arriving in 2001. Volunteers have been working hard to get the former firefighting plane ready to travel to France for the 75th anniversary of D-Day. Miss Montana is scheduled to participate in a re-enactment of the invasion, including dropping jumpers from Montana. A send-off gala Saturday night raised money to cover its fuel costs.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Landowners are seeking new solutions for a phenomenon millions of years old. Tons of sand, sediment and silt ‚Äì some in dunes as high as 10 feet ‚Äì have been scattered across the eastern half to two-thirds of the state by flooding in March. In some areas, washed-out cornstalks are 3 to 4 feet deep. Tree limbs are in piles, and topsoil has been washed away. ‚ÄúWe have a mountain of sand piled up,‚Äù Valley farmer Ryan Ueberrhein told the Omaha World-Herald. Sediment from Nebraska‚Äôs rivers and streams has been deposited on nearby flooded land for millions of years. Now U.S. Department of Agriculture officials, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Extension specialists and extension educators are trying to figure out what to do with it. They‚Äôre racing against the clock because farmers need to plant, and ranchers need grass pastures to graze their cattle.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: Dozens of volunteers in the state‚Äôs northeast plan to return to an 80-year-old youth camp site next month to begin a $1 million rebuilding effort in the wake of an explosive wildfire. Elko Lions Club members who‚Äôve launched a fundraising drive for Camp Lamoille hope to reopen it next year in the rugged Ruby Mountains, where the camp was established by the Boy Scouts of America southeast of Elko in 1939. Ten of the 16 buildings were lost in the fire last fall, including the historic lodge, six A-frame cabins and three storage units. So far, the Lions Club has raised about $343,000 of the estimated total cost of rebuilding through fundraisers, insurance proceeds, and other individual and corporate donations.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The schedule is set for a weeklong celebration of the Statehouse‚Äôs bicentennial. While various events have been held in recent years, the formal celebration starts Sunday, June 2, with an opening ceremony, re-enactments of the first Statehouse session in 1819 and tours of the building. On Monday, there will be special roundtable discussions featuring former governors and executive councilors. Tuesday‚Äôs schedule features the state Supreme Court hearing oral arguments in Representative‚Äôs Hall and an event highlighting the history of the Statehouse press corps. Wednesday is devoted to the state‚Äôs cultural heritage and arts, while Thursday will be Homecoming Day for former lawmakers. A ‚ÄúNew Hampshire Made‚Äù street market Friday and closing ceremonies Saturday round out the celebrations the first week in June.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPalmyra: The sighting of an invasive spotted lanternfly at Palmyra Cove in Burlington County has brought attention from the state and U.S. agriculture departments. After one of the insects was spotted in November, the U.S. Department of Agriculture followed up with an inspection, finding and removing a spotted lanterfly egg mass on a perimeter trail, says Kristina Merola, director of natural sciences and park manager at Palmyra Cove. This month, as the insects‚Äô hatching season approaches, crews from the NJDA began working in Palmyra Cove, the vast labyrinth of wetlands and woodlands beneath the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge. They‚Äôre marking Ailanthus trees, which are a crucial host for the spotted lanterfly species. State crews are then treating the trees with herbicide, Merola says. The intruding bugs pose a threat to entire agricultural industries.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: School districts have become increasingly reliant on substitutes as they contend with a growing number vacant teaching positions in the state. Districts needing to fill vacancies have turned to hiring substitute teachers, particularly long-term substitutes. Some of those substitutes have spent years in a classroom as temporary educators. School district leaders say it‚Äôs a necessary step as they deal with hundreds of vacant positions across the state. Still, they express concerns about the challenges that come with hiring substitute teachers who typically are not certified and do not build lesson plans or meet with parents. A New Mexico State University report says the state had about 740 vacant teaching positions last year, more than double the 300 vacancies reported in 2017.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Lady Liberty is ready to reveal the biggest upgrade to her island home since she first raised her torch in 1886. More than two years after breaking ground, and funded by a $100 million public campaign, the new Statue of Liberty Museum opens Thursday. The 26,000-square-foot museum, loaded with historic relics and interactive exhibits, rises uphill from the central pedestrian mall on Liberty Island, which receives some 4.5 million visitors annually. Built on the New Jersey-facing side of the island, terraced steps, made of the same Stony Creek granite used to build the statue base, lead to a 14,000-square-foot green roof, seeded with native grasses. From there, visitors can enjoy panoramic views of the Upper Bay between New York and New Jersey and, of course, Lady Liberty herself.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The Carolina Hurricanes have been rolling at home ever since their newly acquired grunter named Hamilton started hogging the corner. Not defenseman Dougie Hamilton ‚Äì Hamilton the pig. The 90-pound Juliana potbelly who catches games from behind the boards in a personalized wagon has shown plenty of chops during his three-week run as the team‚Äôs unofficial good-luck charm. In the land of pulled pork barbecue, this pig pulls for the Hurricanes. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like this little internet sensation that caught on,‚Äù says his owner, Raleigh real estate broker Kyle Eckenrode. ‚ÄúPeople just love it when we bring him out. It‚Äôs really crazy to watch it all unfold.‚Äù The Hurricanes can‚Äôt argue with the results: Ever since Hamilton began hanging out, the players haven‚Äôt lost with their prized pig in the building.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Capitol will soon welcome its visitors with a new public entrance. The Bismarck Tribune reports that state lawmakers have approved $2 million to remodel the Capitol building‚Äôs only public entrance before the next legislative session in January 2021. The entrance is accessed through a tunnel that‚Äôs long been closed to vehicle traffic. Sen. Ray Holmberg says the tunnel would cause winter winds and extreme cold to seep into the Capitol‚Äôs ground floor. The state‚Äôs facilities management director, John Boyle, says the plan calls for enclosing the tunnel and converting drive lanes into sidewalks with landscaping. Boyle says the remodel would also improve handicapped accessibility. Boyle says the changes will make it an ‚Äúeasier, user-friendly experience for people coming to the Capitol.‚Äù\n\nOhio\n\nNew Concord: The John and Annie Glenn Museum will be dedicated as a site on the National Register of Historic Places this month in the late astronaut‚Äôs hometown of New Concord. The museum, which was John Glenn‚Äôs boyhood home, will be dedicated in a ceremony Sunday in the Muskingum County village roughly 70 miles east of Columbus. The Glenns‚Äô daughter, Lyn, will help dedicate the property. The former U.S. senator was born in Cambridge and moved to New Concord with his family in 1923. He was the first American to orbit the Earth and served 24 years as a Democrat in the Senate. The museum has also been designated an Ohio historic site and is on the National Park Service‚Äôs Register of Historic Places.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state investigator says cattle rustling is on the rise. The lead agent for the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture‚Äôs criminal investigation unit tells The Journal Record that the number of cattle reported stolen through March has already surpassed all of 2018. That comes to 1,210 stolen in the first three months of the year compared to 975 in 2018. Investigator Jerry Flowers says the state often works with federal agencies. In a recent case, that has included the FBI and the Bureau of Indian Affairs because the stolen cattle was on property north of El Reno that is under the jurisdiction of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribal Nations.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The sergeant at arms of the state Senate had a new regular duty in recent days: searching the Capitol for Republican senators who have been staying away and brought the legislative body‚Äôs business to a halt. The tactic by the minority party is rare in Oregon but has been used throughout history, sometimes creating comical scenes. In Washington three decades ago, U.S. Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., was carried feet-first into the Senate chamber after Democrats ordered the arrest of Republican senators who were denying a quorum. The Oregon standoff ended on its fifth day Monday. It had been caused by GOP senators‚Äô anger at a bill that raises taxes on some businesses to fund education. After the Senate finally convened Monday afternoon, it passed the measure. To get the Republicans to return, Democrats, who hold a supermajority, agreed not to advance a measure requiring vaccinations for children to attend public schools. They also agreed to drop gun-control legislation.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: For 20 years, visitors to Eastern State Penitentiary got a glimpse of how Al Capone may have lived while incarcerated there in 1929. But a new installation at the former prison, now a historic museum, reveals something new ‚Äì that Capone had a cellmate. Capone‚Äôs solo cell was for decades based on a newspaper account in the Public Ledger that described a ‚Äúbeautiful rug of soft colors,‚Äù refined wood furniture, ‚Äútasteful paintings‚Äù and a cabinet-style radio that played waltzes. The exact cell to house America‚Äôs most famous gangster, in what was once the world‚Äôs most famous prison, remains a guess. As part of ongoing preservation, the history museum ‚Äúmoved‚Äù Capone one cell over, giving the bootlegger a more historically accurate exhibit that finds him in less fancy digs, which he shares with a cellmate. The original cell on exhibit is left empty. Visitors can tour both spaces.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Lawmakers are considering a bill to waive state college application fees for veterans. Democratic state Sen. Walter Felag introduced the measure, which passed the Senate Wednesday and was referred to the House Committee on Veterans‚Äô Affairs. It would authorize state higher education institutions to waive application and transcript fees for veterans. It states that the Rhode Island Council on Postsecondary Education should encourage the presidents of the Community College of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College and University of Rhode Island to do so. Felag says it‚Äôs just one way to express gratitude for veterans‚Äô service to the country and make their lives easier after they return home.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A program to prevent former inmates from returning to prison has launched in the Lowcountry. WCIV-TV reports Project Evolution Inc. kicked off Friday. The program helps teach former inmates basic technology and job skills and also helps them build resumes and train for job interviews. The program begin in 2015 in Washington, D.C. Founder Barbara Magwood says she‚Äôs helped about 200 former inmates readjust to life without bars and to stay out of jail. South Carolina Department of Corrections data from 2015 shows 22.3% of inmates return to jail within three years. Magwood says through encouragement, the program is able to show ex-inmates that there‚Äôs hope after prison. Elder Walter Jackson, pastor of Greater Refuge Temple in Charleston, says his church is providing program volunteers to facilitate skills training.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSpearfish: A study shows that the population of a bird listed as a threatened species in the state is stable in the Spearfish and Whitewood creek watersheds but not expanding. American dippers can be found throughout the West, but the Black Hills is the farthest east the species is located, and that population also is genetically different from others. The Black Hills Pioneer reports Bird Conservancy of the Rockies biologist Nancy Drilling last year surveyed the Bear Butte, Elk, Box Elder, French and Rapid creeks. She says the results are similar to what was found in the early 2000s. The American dipper has been listed as threatened in South Dakota since 1996. The state wants a self-sustaining population in a third watershed before the bird is removed from the list.\n\nTennessee\n\nPigeon Forge: Dollywood has expanded with a newly opened land inspired by the magic of nature. Wildwood Grove, the largest expansion yet of Dolly Parton‚Äôs amusement park, opened its gates to guests for the first time Friday. The $37 million area has 11 themed attractions and sits adjacent to the Pigeon Forge theme park‚Äôs Timber Canyon area. Wildwood Grove features trees and plants native to East Tennessee. The new land‚Äôs story also connects to the area and features a young girl who discovers and touches the Wildwood Tree, and it opens her eyes and mind to everything around her. Wildwood Grove‚Äôs 11 themed attractions range from a new roller coaster to a restaurant with Southwestern cuisine. Butterflies, dragonflies, frogs and fireflies factor heavily into the imagery of the rides and decor.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: The Texas Historical Commission has approved $150,000 to help with the ‚Äústabilization and ultimate reuse‚Äù of a historic 1914 courthouse. The commission awarded Nueces County funding for the project through a National Park Service grant, according to a release from the commission. The $12.3 million grant is meant to help historic properties in areas affected by Hurricane Harvey. Nueces County leaders have long grappled with how to save the historic building that sits in downtown Corpus Christi. In March, commissioners voted to reject an offer from the Ed Rachal Foundation to purchase the building and the property on which it sits.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Federal officials and environmentalists are joining efforts to boost protection for a rare poppy that is only found in southern Utah. The Spectrum & Daily News reports that the U.S. forest Service, Utah Valley University and The Nature Conservancy are examining how to manage the dwarf bear-poppy or bearclaw poppy, which has been on the decline for the past 40 years. The flower was first put on the federally endangered species list in 1979. Experts say it can only blossom in specific geological conditions. Those conditions, which include gypsum soil, can be found in the St. George area. The Nature Conservancy established the 800-acre White Dome Nature Preserve that protects most of the habitat occupied by the poppy. Researchers have been using a drone to study the flowers.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state has joined a handful of counterparts in renaming Columbus Day to honor Native Americans. Republican Gov. Phil Scott signed a bill May 6 recognizing the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Day. A half-dozen states and several cities have made the change. Native American tribes and others say celebrating Italian explorer Christopher Columbus ignores the effect that the European arrival in the Americas had on the native peoples. They suffered violence, disease, enslavement, racism and exploitation at the hands of the settlers. Vermont‚Äôs law states that ‚ÄúVermont was founded and built upon lands whose original inhabitants were Abenaki people and honors them and their ancestors.‚Äù\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: A new walking and bicycle trail connecting Chincoteague and Assateague islands will be named after former longtime Mayor Jack Tarr. The trail will connect downtown Chincoteague with the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge on Assateague. The Chincoteague Town Council voted last week to name the new trail network the ‚ÄúJohn H. Tarr Bay to the Beach Trail.‚Äù Councilman Eddie Lewis suggested naming the trail after Tarr, and Councilwoman Ellen Richardson recommended ‚ÄúBay to the Beach.‚Äù Lewis made a motion combining the two ideas, which was seconded by Denise Bowden and approved unanimously. Earlier this year, the town solicited ideas for naming the trail via the town‚Äôs website and Facebook page. More than 40 potential names were submitted for consideration.\n\nWashington\n\nWestport: A big rebound in the sea lion population along the West Coast in recent years has created a constant battle to wrangle the protected animals. They‚Äôre smart and fun to watch from a safe distance ‚Äì but also noisy, smelly and proving to be a headache for some coastal marinas. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a free zoo, kind of; just don‚Äôt pet ‚Äôem!‚Äù said Dennis Craig of Olympia as he watched a pier at Westport Marina nearly sink under the weight of dozens of burly bulls jostling and snoozing in the sun. The flip side of these flippered fish fiends can be seen in the mounting bill to the marina, including the cost of busted docks, broken electric stanchions and lost business. ‚ÄúNearly all of our net revenue was used to repair damage caused by sea lions this year,‚Äù Westport Marina business manager Molly Bold said in an email.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A West Virginia University researcher is seeking funding to study whether using fentanyl testing strips changes the behavior of drug users, The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. Fentanyl is a powerful opioid increasingly involved in drug-related deaths. Some harm reduction programs use the strips to warn drug users of the presence of fentanyl in other illicit substances. Dr. Judith Feinberg, a professor at the WVU School of Medicine, told the paper people might be safer knowing there is fentanyl in their drugs. But people could also use the strips to seek out dangerous drug doses. Feinberg and researcher Jon Zibbel are asking the National Institute on Drug Abuse to fund the research. They plan to study harm reduction programs at Milan Puskar Health Right, in Morgantown, and a program in North Carolina.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: More people are dying in Wisconsin, but the state‚Äôs growing elderly population is living longer. Those are two findings of the annual death report from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. The latest report released Monday looks at deaths in 2017. It found that deaths were up 15% compared with a decade ago. But the death rate for people age 65 and older decreased by 10% over 10 years. The top three causes of death in 2017 were heart disease, cancer and unintentional injury. Overall, the rates of death from cancer and heart disease both declined. But deaths from falls were up 3%, and poisonings were up 13%. Poisoning accounts for 30% of all unintentional injuries, second only to falls at 42%.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: A noisy geyser in Yellowstone National Park has roared back to life after three years of quiet. Ledge Geyser is one of the biggest in Yellowstone‚Äôs Norris Geyser Basin. The Billings Gazette reports the geyser shoots hot water at an angle up to 125 feet high and a distance of 220 feet. Yellowstone geologist Jeff Hungerford says Ledge Geyser is noisy because its water and steam must pass through a narrow opening in the ground. Yellowstone has 1,300 thermal features and 500 geysers, more than anywhere else on Earth. Some geysers such as Old Faithful are predictable, but most, like Ledge Geyser, erupt erratically.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/13/el-paso-memorial-hogs-helicopter-trees-troops-news-around-states/40597251/", "title": "El Paso memorial, hogs by helicopter, trees for troops: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state‚Äôs tourism agency has been honored for its work promoting civil rights travel in 14 U.S. states. The office was presented with an award recognizing its marketing campaign for the U.S. Civil Rights Trail during an industry trade show in London last week. The trail promotes museums, churches and other African American landmarks across the South. Promotional materials include video interviews with civil rights participants from the 1960s and photos of landmarks. Alabama oversaw the project in partnership with the Atlanta-based TravelSouth USA and the National Park Service. The trail includes sites from Kansas to Delaware, including all of the Deep South. The state won an award for best regional destination.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Warm temperatures and an abundance of food are keeping bears out of their dens in south-central Alaska. KTVA-TV reports the Alaska Department of Fish and Game is warning people to be aware of bears that have not begun to hibernate. Anchorage area biologist Dave Battle says the department has received regular reports of sightings of both brown and black bears. Battle says most black bears enter dens by October, but brown bears are sometimes still up in November. Battle says denning is a response to both cold weather and food availability, but it‚Äôs not cold enough, and bears still have food available. Battle says bears are trying to pack in every calorie they can.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Arizona Sikh Community has donated 550 trees to low-income Phoenix neighborhoods. Local Sikh leaders gathered Sunday with Mayor Kate Gallego and other officials for a tree dedication ceremony. Planting of elm, Arizona ash and other drought-resistant trees has already started in some downtown neighborhoods. The gift worth about $68,000 is part of a worldwide observance of the anniversary of Sikh religion founder Guru Nanak‚Äôs birth in 1469. There were similar tree-planting campaigns in countries including Germany, Canada and Myanmar earlier this year. More trees are especially welcome in Phoenix, which suffers from an urban heat island effect that raises already high temperatures in areas covered by heat-retaining asphalt and concrete. Phoenix has planted thousands of trees in recent years in hopes of offsetting the effects.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff: Mold contamination is so high at an election office that officials are considering moving. Jefferson County Election Commissioner Stuart Soffer says air quality technicians found an election room with small mold spores measuring 73,300 particles per cubic foot, exceeding the acceptable levels of 2,500 particles per cubic foot. Technicians found large mold spores measuring 16,800 particles per cubic foot; the acceptable level is 200 particles per cubic foot. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the mold is a health hazard and puts 150 voting machines at risk. Soffer said the county could be liable if it knowingly exposed people to mold. Mold can cause a stuffy nose, coughing or wheezing. Technicians recommended a $1,500 dehumidifier. County Judge Gerald Robinson, the CEO for the county government, says he‚Äôs exploring alternative buildings.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The head of a commuter train system apologized to a black rider who was detained and cited by police for eating a breakfast sandwich on a train platform after an outcry from people who assailed enforcement of a no-food rule as racist. More than two dozen people staged an ‚Äúeat-in‚Äù at a Bay Area Rapid Transit station over the weekend, and others continue to protest the Nov. 4 encounter, which ended with a 31-year-old man, who was headed to work, in handcuffs and unable to leave until he had told BART police his name. BART officials said Monday that an independent auditor is investigating. Eating is not allowed in paid portions of stations to maintain cleanliness, but it shouldn‚Äôt be used to prevent people from getting to work on time, they said. Steve Foster says he knew eating was not allowed on trains but did not realize it was banned on platforms.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A state law banning the sale and transfer of large-capacity gun magazines has not stopped the sale and transfer of magazines that hold more than 15 rounds of ammunition. An undercover investigation by 9Wants to Know found examples of gun stores in Colorado either ignoring the law altogether or finding a loophole to get around the law. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs shocking to see that people are doing this,‚Äù said state Sen. Rhonda Fields, D-Aurora. In 2013, a Democrat-controlled Legislature passed four comprehensive bills dealing with guns, including the bill sponsored by Fields banning magazines that hold more than 15 bullets. The bill, signed into law by then-Gov. John Hickenlooper, banned the sale, transfer and possession of a large-capacity magazine as of July 1, 2013.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterford: Environmental groups are planning to remove a 1970s dam that has blocked alewife herring from returning from the ocean to freshwater spawning grounds. The Day reports a recently announced $187,000 grant from the Long Island Sound Futures Fund will help pay for the removal of the dam in Alewife Cove along the Waterford-New London line. The grant was awarded to the Connecticut Fund for the Environment and Save the Sound, which are working on the project with the Alewife Cove Conservancy. The groups will be required to provide $128,000 in matching funds. The groups say the project will restore 3 miles of a migratory corridor that benefits alewife as well as sea lamprey and American eel. A timeline for the project has not been announced.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The Central YMCA downtown will end its housing program for the homeless next spring, cutting 41 guaranteed beds in the city and potentially relocating dozens of men. The beds are reserved for the chronically homeless, a group advocates consider to be the most vulnerable among homeless adults and the most challenging to help. Those who qualify can stay indefinitely. Their rooms are paid for by a $264,000 federal grant that the YMCA of Delaware this year declined to apply to renew. The current grant lasts until May. The YMCA and Housing Alliance Delaware, the nonprofit that coordinates shelter placements statewide, is finding ways for the current residents to stay in their rooms with other funding such as vouchers, to move toward paying rent like the YMCA‚Äôs other tenants or to be relocated to other housing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Authorities say a man was walking his 4-month-old pit bull when he was robbed of the puppy at gunpoint. News outlets report the dog named ‚ÄúL.A.‚Äù was stolen Saturday. A D.C. police statement says the man and L.A. were walking that afternoon when a vehicle slowed next to them, and the driver asked about buying L.A. The man refused, and the driver followed the pair. It says the driver then stopped the car and got out with a passenger, who pulled a handgun and told L.A.‚Äôs owner that ‚Äúit‚Äôs our dog now.‚Äù The driver grabbed L.A. and fled in a burgundy Kia Forte. L.A. was wearing a blue collar at the time. A $1,000 is offered for information leading to an arrest.\n\nFlorida\n\nInverness: Controversy over a county commission blocking a library system from having a digital subscription to the New York Times has spilled over into the local tourism realm. The Citrus County Chronicle reports that people are canceling trips to Citrus County, and the repercussions are being felt as far abroad as London. John Pricher, director of the Citrus County Visitors Bureau, said as of Wednesday afternoon he‚Äôs received 10 anonymous and signed emails from tourists who all oppose county commissioners‚Äô actions. In late October, commissioners discussed whether to buy the digital subscription but didn‚Äôt make a final decision. On Nov. 19, Citrus County Commissioners will decide whether to take the advice of library officials and spend $2,700 annually for a digital subscription to the paper.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Enrollment at the state‚Äôs public colleges and universities is rising again, led by its largest schools. The University System of Georgia reported Tuesday that total enrollment rose 1.5% in fall 2019 from fall 2018. More than 333,000 students are enrolled across the state‚Äôs 26 institutions. Among those schools, 11 showed growth, and 15 showed declines. The fastest-growing institution, proportionally, was Georgia Tech, where enrollment went up nearly 12% to 36,000. The Atlanta‚Äôs school 3,800-student gain made up more than three-quarters of all student gains statewide. Other schools showing large gains were Kennesaw State University, Middle Georgia State University and Georgia Gwinnett College. Atlanta Metropolitan State College saw enrollment drop the most, falling 16% to 1,844.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A public health study says Native Hawaiians experience fewer years of good health compared with other ethnic groups in the state. The study by University of Hawaii researchers published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Public Health found Native Hawaiians have 14 fewer years of healthy life than other groups. The study based on a self-reported survey calculates the number of healthy years among the state‚Äôs indigenous people and those with white, Filipino, Japanese and Chinese heritages. The study finds Native Hawaiians have 62.2 years of healthy life expectancy, compared with 75.9 years for Chinese, 74.8 for Japanese, 73.3 for Filipinos, and 72.1 years for white Hawaii residents. The authors say the analysis provides a more complete estimate of population health than life expectancy studies.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal officials have released a final plan for five open-pit phosphate mines and reclamation work in eastern Idaho proposed by J.R. Simplot Co. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service released the jointly prepared final environmental impact statement Friday for the Dairy Syncline Mine Project about 14 miles east of Soda Springs. The five mines, disposal areas, tailing ponds and other mine workings would cover about 4.3 square miles. The two federal agencies are taking comments before making decisions. The area contains one of the nation‚Äôs most abundant deposits of phosphate ore that‚Äôs turned into fertilizer needed by farmers to grow food. The area also contains more than a dozen federal Superfund sites needing cleanup from past phosphate mining activities.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is giving a legal aid group $30,000 to educate farmworkers about and to do research on pesticides. The EPA said in a statement that the money going to Legal Aid Chicago will, among other things, help it survey corn-detasseling workers and fruit harvesters in Illinois on their knowledge of pesticide use. It says the goal is to improve the health of migrant farmworkers. Legal Aid Chicago says the state Department of Agriculture has received a record number of nearly 1,000 complaints in 2019 on alleged misuse of pesticides. It says that‚Äôs 10 times recent averages and illustrates the need for better education. The money going to Legal Aid Chicago is part of a series of grants nationwide for groups working on similar measures.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is bringing an exhibition exploring the opioid crisis to its official museum early next year. The Indiana State Museum says ‚ÄúFix: Heartbreak and Hope Inside our Opioid Crisis‚Äù aims to remove the shame and isolation surrounding opioid addiction. It will feature displays on the biology behind addiction, the history of health crises in America, and personal stories from addicts and their families. The Indiana Business Journal reports more than 1,700 people in Indiana died from drug overdoses in 2017. Most of those deaths were linked to opioid abuse. The exhibit will feature multimedia displays, hands-on installations and interactive artwork. One display will allow a visitor to enter a giant brain and watch how substance abuse affects it. The 7,000-square-foot exhibit will run for a year starting Feb. 1.\n\nIowa\n\nFort Madison: A monument marking a battlefield where 23 soldiers died has been installed in Fort Madison. The granite monument put in place last week includes a history of the military post on one side and the soldiers‚Äô names on another side. Andy Andrews of the North Lee County Historical Society and Friends of the Old Fort says the $14,000 cost was underwritten by donations through Friends of Old Fort Madison. A flagpole will be installed nearby. The Fort Madison Daily Democrat reports that Fort Madison, originally known as Fort Bellevue, was built by the U.S. Army in 1808 and abandoned in 1813. It was the location of the only War of 1812 battle west of the Mississippi.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A cold front that froze much of the state set at least six records for low temperatures. The National Weather Service reports Wichita, Salina, Russell, Dodge City, Garden City and Medicine Lodge set low temperature records early Tuesday. The lowest temperature was in Garden City, which dropped to minus 1, breaking the record of 7 set in 2018. The highest temperature of the six cities was 8 in Wichita, which breaking the former record of 9. Wichita, Salina, Dodge City and Medicine Lodge broke records set in 1911. Much of Kansas experienced below-freezing temperatures after an arctic air mass moved from the Rocky Mountains to northern New England on Monday, with forecasters saying much of the affected region would see record-breaking cold temperatures Tuesday.\n\nKentucky\n\nLand Between the Lakes National Recreation Area: The war on feral hogs at Land Between the Lakes has escalated, with plans announced this week to shoot them on sight from helicopters. The winter campaign to eradicate feral hogs at the site also includes bait trapping and euthanasia, managed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the U.S. Forest Service. Feral hogs are non-native and threaten visitor safety, cultural sites, and native plant and wildlife species, Land Between the Lakes officials say. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service began assisting the Forest Service with trapping in 2014 with success but not at a rate that keeps up with the hogs‚Äô rapid growth. Feral hogs can have two litters per year averaging five-10 piglets. Those offspring can give birth to a new generation in less than a year, according to a release.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state‚Äôs social services agency says 893 children in foster care were adopted over the past year. The Department of Children and Family Services says that‚Äôs the second-highest number of adoptions from foster care in a single year in state history, falling just below last year‚Äôs record of 912. The latest numbers are from the federal budget year that ran from Oct. 1, 2018, through Sept. 30. The department says the 893 children were adopted into 661 families. Of those families, 27% adopted more than one child, including 164 families who adopted siblings. First lady Donna Edwards hosted an adoption celebration with the families Thursday at the governor‚Äôs mansion.\n\nMaine\n\nBucksport: A company that intends to create a salmon farm at a former mill site is altering the plan to avoid a 19th-century farm identified during an archaeological survey. Arthur Spiess from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission said Whole Oceans will change the planned locations of an auxiliary building and an access road in Bucksport. He told the Bangor Daily News that the historical significance of the farmstead ‚Äúis undetermined.‚Äù Whole Oceans plans to start building the $180 million salmon farm next spring. It‚Äôll be located on the former site of a paper mill. Spiess declined to identify the contractor who performed the archaeological survey or release the contractor‚Äôs report, saying the exact location of historical sites, which the report identifies, is confidential under state law.\n\nMaryland\n\nWestover: Officials gathered over the weekend to celebrate Somerset County‚Äôs new technical high school that allows students to explore a whole host of career fields in a brand-new, state-of-the-art facility. Somerset County Technical High School opened its doors to students in September, but officials from the county, state legislators and Congressman Andy Harris‚Äô office gathered Saturday for a ribbon-cutting ceremony and to tour the facility, according to a press release. The new $42 million building serves about 400 students from grades 8-12 and teaches them about a number of career fields including automotive technology, biomedical scienes, information technology and more, the release says. The funds for the building were provided by the state and loans from the federal government. The building is also eco-friendly and energy efficient, including a ‚Äúvegetated roof‚Äù in some areas to provide insulation.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Medical marijuana products are set to become exempt from the state‚Äôs four-month vaping materials ban. Suffolk Superior Court Judge Douglas Wilkins ruled a week ago that marijuana cultivated for medical use must be exempted from Republican Gov. Charlie Baker‚Äôs ban starting Tuesday. Wilkins ruled that the ban can‚Äôt apply to marijuana card holders seeking to purchase cannabis vaping products. He said the ban as written undermines the state‚Äôs medical marijuana law. Officials said patients will be able to resume making purchases at noon Tuesday. A group representing medical marijuana patients argued that only the state Cannabis Control Commission can regulate marijuana products. Baker issued the emergency ban in September in response to lung illnesses attributed to use of e-cigarette products.\n\nMichigan\n\nEast Lansing: A new Michigan State University exhibit is built around a 20th-century guidebook that a generation of black motorists used during the segregation era to find places where they could safely sleep, eat, shop or find services while traveling. The exhibit for ‚ÄúThe Negro Motorists‚Äô Green Book‚Äù runs at the East Lansing school until the end of November. It will also introduce the guide‚Äôs creator, Victor H. Green. Green‚Äôs book listed 86 black-friendly Detroit businesses and five in Lansing from 1936 to 1966. The exhibit presents before-and-after pictures of the businesses, showing how they looked 50 to 80 years ago and today. The historical display follows the 2018 release of ‚ÄúGreen Book,‚Äù an Oscar-winning film highlighting the guide that African Americans consulted when traveling in the South during the Jim Crow era.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: After completing coursework for her hectic senior year, statistics major Emilia Janik has an additional responsibility: sorting through multiple data sets to determine what more than 30,000 students at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities care most about on campus. As the solo research and data coordinator for the Minnesota Student Association, it is Janik‚Äôs job to work with student government to create surveys for the student body every semester. Usually, the work is completed by more than one person, but Janik is a one-woman show. The survey results help discover the issues students want to see changed or advocated for at the University, the Minnesota Daily reports. The latest survey, which MSA says is its best yet, received more than 3,000 responses on questions about grocery stores, off-campus living, environmental justice issues and freedom of speech, among others.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: The University of Mississippi says a lecture by a conservative journalist is back on after initially being canceled. The Oxford Eagle reports Daily Wire contributor Elisha Krauss will speak in the university‚Äôs student union Wednesday. The talk was originally set to be inside the Overby Center for Southern Journalism and Politics, but Krauss said she was told by a professor that a policy mandated no ideological groups could host speakers there. The event is hosted by the school‚Äôs Young Americans for Freedom chapter, a conservative youth activism organization. Krauss tweeted about the cancellation last week. Hours later, the university responded on Twitter saying the decision to cancel was made by two individuals and wasn‚Äôt authorized by the administration. The school rescheduled it and affirmed its commitment to free speech.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A 12-year-old girl has died from injuries suffered last month when a St. Louis County patrol vehicle struck her. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports Akeelah ‚ÄúKe Ke‚Äù Jackson had been in critical condition since she was hit Oct. 14 while crossing a street in Jennings. Her family‚Äôs attorney, Robert Merlin, says she died about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday at St. Louis Children‚Äôs Hospital. County Police Sgt. Benjamin Granda has said the officer told police he was trying to get closer to a suspicious car to make a traffic stop and wasn‚Äôt using lights and sirens. The patrol vehicle reached a top speed of 59 mph on a stretch of road with a limit of 30 mph, although the exact speed at the time of impact wasn‚Äôt known.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Park officials in the state have closed public comment on a road management plan intended to help officials better handle increased visitation. The Flathead Beacon reports Glacier National Park officials will begin weighing comments as they attempt to mitigate crowds and congestion on Going-to-the-Sun Road. Park officials say the alpine highway plan was released in September after receiving more than 3 million visitors this year. Officials say the plan suggests expanding the shuttle service, implementing a partial parking permit system, improving and adding trails and bathrooms, and extending visitor hours in some locations. Some comments say the plan omits determining a carrying capacity for the Sun Road, raising concerns about the long-term solutions to crowding. A former park official says a plan limiting use would be a better-suited first step.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is planning construction of a reflection area for its Veterans‚Äô Tribute project. The university said in a news release Monday that the area will run from the steps of the Military and Naval Science Building to the Coliseum. The $3.75 million project is part of an upgrade of the mall just east of Memorial Stadium. The fundraising goal through the University of Nebraska Foundation is $4.5 million, which will cover construction and create an endowment for maintenance. Words on steps in the reconfigured space will honor career moments and personal sacrifices of veterans. The tentative design will embody the concept of glass panels featured in the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial in Washington, D.C. Construction is tentatively scheduled to begin in spring 2020.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Federal land managers have withdrawn more than 500 square miles of public land from a swath of eastern Nevada where oil and gas drilling leases go to auction this week after a judge blocked the Trump administration‚Äôs attempt to ease protection of sage grouse habitat. The acreage pulled from Tuesday‚Äôs scheduled sale covers more than half the lease area the Bureau of Land Management originally planned to auction. It roughly corresponds to priority habitat designated in a 2015 federal sage grouse plan completed under President Barack Obama for Nevada and northeastern California. The Trump land-use plans finalized in March had removed the most protective habitat designations across millions of acres. A federal judge temporarily blocked the rules last month because they could allow activity likely to harm the struggling bird species in seven Western states.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: A bridge has been replaced and rededicated to a World War II submarine crew member who died when the vessel sank in August 1944. George Laderbush, of Portsmouth, was a torpedoman‚Äôs mate about the USS Flier when it sank after striking a Japanese mine. Seascoastonline.com reports the Woodbury Avenue bridge over the Route 1 Bypass in the city was originally dedicated to Laderbush when it was built in 1949. But the plaque wasn‚Äôt in a prominent location. The bridge was closed two years ago and was replaced. The plaque was removed and refurbished and is being featured in a more visible area. Laderbush‚Äôs niece and nephew, Marga Coulp and George Laderbush, were guests of honor at the Veteran‚Äôs Day bridge rededication.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: Police say a convertible traveling at high speed went airborne and crashed into the second floor of a commercial building, killing both of the car‚Äôs occupants. Toms River police say the red Porsche Boxster went out of control just after 6:30 a.m. Sunday. The car hit the center median, struck an embankment and went airborne into the building. Police said two Toms River men, 22-year-old Braden DeMartin and 23-year-old Daniel Foley, were deceased when emergency responders arrived at the scene. Police said the structure, which was unoccupied at the time, had been deemed unsafe by a building inspector. Sgt. Vincent Padalino said the building, which is across from Hooper Avenue Elementary School, houses four businesses, including a counseling service and a real estate company.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Clara Pueblo: Federal officials say a tribe will see an increase in federal disaster aid as it continues to recover from flooding that occurred several years ago. A significant portion of Santa Clara Pueblo‚Äôs watershed was wiped out by wildfire in 2011 and the flooding that followed. President Donald Trump recently authorized an increase in the level of funding for public projects undertaken as a result of flooding that occurred during the summer of 2012. Under the disaster declaration issued for the state in August 2012, the federal share for public assistance was 75% of total eligible costs. Trump‚Äôs order increases that to 90% for the pueblo. The tribe is in the midst of rehabilitating the Santa Clara Creek and surrounding areas by building erosion-control structures and replanting.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state‚Äôs court system says it plans to expand the gender options on jury documents in an effort to be more inclusive of people who do not identify as male or female. State court spokesman Lucian Chalfen says the system aims to have the updated juror information card set for distribution by early January. Chalfen says the new categories will include female, male, transgender, nonbinary, intersex and other. He says the cards, which tell people when they must attend jury duty, only have male and female gender options right now. The court system is also changing up its juror questionnaire.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Education officials had to warn parents not to use Google to search for two schools because the results included explicit images. The News & Observer of Raleigh reports searches for Four Oaks Middle School and South Johnston High School over the weekend returned an ‚Äúexplicit image‚Äù in the top results. The newspaper described the image as ‚Äúgraphic and overtly sexual.‚Äù A search of the two websites Monday showed the offending images appear to have been removed. Johnston County Schools said it was working with the schools, law enforcement and Google to get the images taken down, and it asked faculty and staff to help remove the image by reporting it as inappropriate to Google.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: A break-in at a sorority house at the University of North Dakota has some students on edge. Police are looking for a man who broke into the Gamma Phi Beta house early Monday and took pictures of a woman who was sleeping. Senior Matthew Ely tells KVLY-TV the crime is ‚Äúkind of weird, kind of scary‚Äù because it‚Äôs something that doesn‚Äôt happen very often on campus. Chloe Shelton, a freshman and sorority member, says she always walks with a group of people, especially at night. University administrators sent an alert to students after the crime occurred.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Tree farmers are joining forces with the state to send a little holiday cheer to the troops overseas. The Ohio Department of Agriculture and the Ohio Christmas Tree Association are partnering on an effort that will ship more than 100 Christmas trees to military members stationed overseas. Growers will donate the trees, and state inspectors will make sure they are free of pests and disease. Both groups will work with volunteers Tuesday to wrap, load and ship the trees at the Ohio Department of Agriculture in Columbus. Each shipment will also include decorations provided by schoolchildren, churches and veterans‚Äô groups.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group working to reduce the state‚Äôs prison population is launching a new initiative petition that could lead to the release of hundreds more inmates. A group of business, political and religious leaders filed the constitutional ballot initiative Tuesday. The proposal would prohibit prosecutors from using previous felony convictions to enhance sentences in nonviolent cases. It would also allow people who already had such sentence enhancements to petition the courts for relief. Once its petition is finalized, the group will have 90 days to gather nearly 178,000 signatures from registered voters to place the proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot. The same group launched a successful initiative in 2016 that reduced criminal penalties and ultimately helped lead to the release of hundreds of inmates from prison last week.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A Portland State University study found tiny pieces of plastic in the vast majority of razor clams and oysters sampled along the state‚Äôs coast. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports up to 700,000 of the microscopic fibers are shed by yoga pants, fleeces and other active outerwear made of synthetic textiles during a wash. These fibers are in the wastewater from laundry machines that eventually winds up in the ocean. Some of the tiny plastic fibers could also come from derelict fishing gear. The study‚Äôs authors collected and sampled shellfish from 15 sites from Clatsop in the north to Gold Beach near the California border. Of the roughly 300 shellfish studied, all but two contained at least some microplastics. There was an average of 11 pieces of microplastic in each specimen.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The family of a sick inmate who died inside a rural jail two years ago claims guards and medical professionals ignored and even ridiculed his distress but documented his agony. A federal lawsuit filed Friday by the mother of 40-year-old Shawn Kitchen blames Clinton County, jail officials and medical staff for mishandling what began as a urinary tract infection and led to a fatal kidney infection. The lawsuit claims Kitchen exhibited symptoms shortly after being jailed for an alleged probation violation and within three days was seen crying in his cell and unable to stand without assistance. It accuses medical and jail staff of responding to his complaints by putting him in a restraint chair and solitary confinement.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Brown University has announced plans to double the number of veterans it enrolls by changing admissions policies, increasing financial support and bolstering recruitment. The Ivy League university announced in a press release on Veterans Day that standardized test scores will be optional for veterans in the admissions process. The release indicates changes in financial aid will eliminate ‚Äúall out-of-pocket costs‚Äù for undergraduate tuition and fees for veterans. ‚ÄúWe owe an immense debt of gratitude to our veterans,‚Äù university President Christina Paxson says. The Providence Journal reports there are currently 21 undergraduate veterans at the school, out of about 7,000 undergraduates.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nClemson: Clemson University and WYFF 4 Greenville are partnering to create an on-campus satellite news bureau. The bureau gives Clemson students the chance to work alongside industry professionals. ‚ÄúOur students will have the opportunity to work alongside WYFF journalists in the bureau on campus and gain tremendous professional experiences doing that,‚Äù says Clemson University Department of Communications Chair Joseph Mazer. The bureau, housed at Hendrix Student Center next to the Student Media offices and studio, was unveiled Tuesday. WYFF 4 news director Bruce Barkley says the Clemson bureau won‚Äôt be a main fixture during the station‚Äôs newscasts but will be used by reporters and crew members while on assignment in the Clemson area. WYFF 4 sports reporters will be able to use the office as a home base during major sporting events.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Visiting and camping in the state‚Äôs parks will be a little more costly after legislators gave a proposed fee increase the final OK on Monday. The legislative Rules Review Committee agreed the process was complete for implementing the increased park entrance and camping fees, which was the final step for the proposal that began in September. Sen. Lance Russell, R-Hot Springs, was the sole opposition in the 5-1 vote. Beginning Jan. 1, an annual state park pass will cost $36, and a daily pass will cost $8. Prime campsites will cost $26, preferred campsites will cost $23, and modern campsites will cost $20. A new statewide $15 fee will begin for all non-electric, tent-only campsites. A seven-day motorcycle pass to Custer State Park will cost $20. Currently, an annual park pass costs $30, and a daily pass is $6, while the seven-day Custer motorcycle pass is $10, and campsites start at $17 for a modern campsite.\n\nTennessee\n\nLynchburg: The distillery that produces Jack Daniel‚Äôs whiskey is once again teaming up with a military support group to help service members and their families get home for the holidays. For the ninth year, the distillery is working with the Armed Services YMCA for the ‚ÄúOperation Ride Home‚Äù campaign. It provides financial assistance to active-duty junior-enlisted military members and their families to travel home during the holidays. Distillery officials say that since the campaign began, about 7,230 service members and their relatives have been assisted. Jack Daniel‚Äôs says it has again donated $100,000 to kick off the campaign. Military members have been able to travel to all 50 states thanks to the program.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The makeshift memorial formed after the Aug. 3 mass shooting was completely removed Tuesday in anticipation of the reopening of the Cielo Vista Walmart. City officials say some materials will be preserved for historical purposes. A permanent memorial for the 22 killed in the shooting is being built by Walmart in the south end of the store. Construction crews could be seen building the memorial Tuesday morning. Some materials have been moved to a smaller memorial in Ponder Park. Staff from the El Paso Museum of Art, El Paso Museum of History and the Public Art Program, along with Zaragoza Rotary volunteers, began selecting items from the memorial Tuesday to take to Ponder Park. Erica Marin, a registrar at the El Paso Museum of History, says they selected a mix of items, from handmade ones like a string of paper cranes and wooden stars to religious items like rosaries and memorial wreaths.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: City officials have bought more than 100 new hybrid sedans for the police department, but some have criticized the vehicle‚Äôs size. KUTV-TV reports some officers from the Salt Lake City Police Department have warned city leaders that the Ford Fusion Responder hybrid sedan is too small for use by officers or people they have in custody. Officers say the vehicle is a liability, citing concerns with safety in the event of a collision and lack of all-wheel drive in wintry conditions. City leaders say replacing police cruisers with hybrid models is more sustainable. Officers say the cars could still be used in other areas, but it doesn‚Äôt solve the patrol car problem. Officers say some cars are more than a decade old and have thousands of miles.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state auditor says numerous questionable choices were made in the administration of the state‚Äôs remote worker program aimed at attracting new residents by paying them to move to the Green Mountain state. In a report released Tuesday, Auditor Doug Hoffer wrote that the program‚Äôs cost-effectiveness cannot be determined because it‚Äôs not known for certain if the grantees moved to Vermont because of the program. He also says the program has serious structural flaws by requiring applicants to prove their Vermont residency before applying. Hoffer writes that ‚Äúspending taxpayer funds on programs of questionable value is bad enough,‚Äù and the problem is made worse by not spending that money ‚Äúon programs with demonstrable and quantifiable long-term benefits.‚Äù\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An army of Confederate monuments dots the state‚Äôs landscape, but some of those statues could soon start coming down after Election Day gave Democrats control of the General Assembly for the first time in decades. Members of the new legislative majority say they plan to revive proposals to make it easier to remove the public displays honoring Civil War soldiers and generals in a state that was home to two Confederate capitals. Previous attempts to do so were quickly dispatched in the Republican-controlled General Assembly, in votes largely along party lines. Del.-elect Sally Hudson, a Democrat whose district includes Charlottesville, says she plans to reintroduce legislation her predecessor, David Toscano, sponsored, giving cities and counties the ability to remove Confederate monuments. Local governments are currently hamstrung by a 1904 state law.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A new federal lawsuit aims to kill plans for building one of the world‚Äôs biggest methanol refineries along the Columbia River. Plans for the $2 billion refinery, shipping terminal and pipeline project in Kalama, Washington, are already stalled after a state board required further environmental review. Now conservation groups including Columbia Riverkeeper are suing in U.S. District Court in Tacoma. They said Tuesday that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not consider the huge amount of greenhouse gases the project would emit or the effect on endangered orcas. The refinery would turn fracked gas from Canada into methanol, which would be shipped to China to make plastics. The project‚Äôs backer, Northwest Innovation Works, says the project would provide a cleaner source of plastics than coal-based methanol.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginians are being told to be on the lookout for an invasive insect. The state Department of Agriculture says in a news release that a small population of the spotted lanternfly was detected in the Eastern Panhandle community of Bunker Hill last month. The insects are devastating to trees and crops such as grapes and hops. They lay eggs in the fall on surfaces including vehicles, firewood, outdoor furniture and campers. That allows them to hitch a ride to new areas. Agriculture Commissioner Kent Leonhardt says protecting the fruit orchards and wineries in the Eastern Panhandle is a concern. The agency says landowners should inspect their property for lanternfly egg masses. The insect is native to China and likely arrived in North America on goods imported from Asia.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers has signed an executive order designed to promote diversity and inclusiveness in state government. Evers signed the order at a state office building Tuesday surrounded by Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, members of his Cabinet, Democratic state lawmakers and others in his administration. The order requires state agencies to develop and implement equity and inclusion action plans. It also calls for creating and providing mandatory equity and inclusion training for all state agency employees. Evers is also creating a diversity and equity advisory council. He says the state is taking a proactive role in making make sure government employees feel empowered and heard in the workplace. Supporters say the effort will help address racial disparities in Wisconsin.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: An interim legislative committee has rejected a proposed bill to raise the state‚Äôs property tax. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports that members of the Joint Revenue Interim Committee took the action during their meeting Monday in Cheyenne. The bill would have raised the tax rate on real and personal property from 9.5% to 11.5%, a jump that calculates to a roughly 20% increase in taxable property. Under the bill, minerals and industrial property would have been excluded from the increase. Proponents of the idea say the increase is essential to help the state deal with declining mineral industry revenue in the coming years. But opponents say raising the property tax could place an unfair burden on low-income people.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/13"}]}

The flammable liquid is then blended with gasoline refined on site before the mixture is shipped to customers across the country.\n\nBut if changes, called the Ethanol Marketing Project, are approved by state regulators, ethanol also would be brought in by train. The expanded capacity would allow the refinery to act as depot that receives, stores and ships ethanol to other refineries along the East Coast ‚Äì potentially cutting costs for those facilities that now pay to have ethanol shipped to them directly.\n\n\"The Ethanol Project will allow the refinery to optimize its logistics capabilities, which is critical in the context of the increasingly challenging economic conditions faced particularly by refineries in the northeastern U.S.,\" PBF Energy spokeswoman Lisa Lindsey said via email.\n\nSTORY: Business community eyes Coastal Zone Act change\n\nSTORY: DNREC targets West Virginia coal-fired plant\n\nPBF Energy says it hopes to begin work on the project in late 2016 and begin full production by the first quarter of 2017.\n\nConstruction work is expected to employ 20 to 25 workers, although no additional hiring is anticipated as a result of the expanded operations.\n\nBut first, the New Jersey-based company must seek permission from the same state agency that has repeatedly cited it for a string of air quality violations in recent months.\n\nThe Delaware City Refining Co. is currently facing up to $470,000 in fines related to dozens of incidents in which potentially toxic gases were released into the air between mid-2013 to early 2016.\n\nJust last month, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control notified the refinery of 18 new violations stemming from a plant shutdown that occurred during a January blizzard.\n\nThose violations, however, are not expected play a factor in DNREC Secretary David Small‚Äôs decision on the refinery‚Äôs application for a permit under the Coastal Zone Act.\n\n‚ÄúThere is no provision for considering compliance history when weighing a Coastal Zone Act permit application,‚Äù said Phil Cherry, director of DNREC‚Äôs Division of Energy and Climate.\n\n‚ÄúThe Coastal Zone Act is more of a land-use statute than environmental one,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúFor us to withhold a permit because of infractions over the last few years probably would not hold up in court.‚Äù\n\nPassed in 1971, the state‚Äôs Coastal Zone Act bars new heavy industry and bulk product facilities from being developed on a two-mile strip along the state‚Äôs 115 miles of coastline, both sides of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, and a ribbon around Delaware‚Äôs Inland Bays.\n\nA grandfathering provision allows existing uses, such as the Delaware City Refinery, to continue operations, although new activities must go through a permitting process. By statute, that process considers six factors including the environmental and economic impact of the proposed use, aesthetics, impact on public lands and local land use policy.\n\nPBF Energy filed its application for a Coastal Zone Act permit on Aug. 15 ‚Äì the same day it received its most recent violation notice from DNREC.\n\nAccording to that document, the Delaware Refining Co. is seeking permission to undertake a $7 million construction project that would allow the facility to expand its ethanol operations.\n\nIn addition to increasing the amount of ethanol brought into and out of the facility, the permit also would allow the refinery to use an existing tank to store another 6.4 million gallons ‚Äì a 136-percent increase in capacity.\n\nDespite the enhanced volume and new modes of transportation involved, PBF Energy has argued that the Ethanol Marketing Project is simply an extension of its existing ethanol operations and should not require an additional permit.\n\nDNREC, however, says the movement of pure ethanol out of the facility ‚Äì rather than a fuel blend ‚Äì for sale to other parties constitutes a new use that requires state approval.\n\n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see it quite the same way,‚Äù Cherry said.\n\nPBF Energy also claims the project will result in a net reduction in air pollution at the refinery. The company plans to install systems designed to capture ‚Äúvolatile organic compounds‚Äù that might escape from its storage tanks, along with enhanced systems at its existing truck-loading facility.\n\nThe refinery likely will be required to seek an air quality permit for those systems, even if its Coastal Zone Act permit application is approved. That permit application could include consideration of past violations not factored into approval of its Coastal Zone Act permit.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether any community groups will voice an opinion on the refinery‚Äôs current application, which has yet to be scheduled for a public hearing.\n\nRefinery officials did not respond to questions about the increase in truck or train traffic that would result from the expanded ethanol operations.\n\nIn recent years, the refinery has ramped up delivery of crude-oil by rail from North Dakota and Canada, which is now believed to top 8.8 million gallons per day. Train delays at rail crossings and reports of derailments and fires elsewhere have turned that issue into a local political and public safety concern.\n\n\"I think those shipments have probably decreased over the last year as the price of crude has fallen,\" said Seth Ross, a member of the Delaware Nature Society who served on the Delaware City refinery's citizens advisory panel until 2014. \"So overall having ethanol shipped by train may not create any additional hazard because it essentially would be a wash.\"\n\nBrenna Goggin, advocacy director for the Delaware Nature Society, said she does not anticipate the application facing much opposition.\n\n‚ÄúThis project does not cause any concerns from our standpoint because it will result in an overall reduction of VOC emissions,‚Äù she said, adding that the refinery‚Äôs air quality violations and its Coastal Zone Act permit application are separate issues.\n\nDNREC‚Äôs Cherry agreed.\n\n‚ÄúThe kinds of violations we‚Äôve seen at the refinery are not the result of willful neglect, but rather accidents that, unfortunately, can happen when you‚Äôre operating a refinery of that size,‚Äù he said.\n\nThe facility, which employs about 550 workers, repeatedly has been cited by DNREC this summer stemming from the release of numerous toxic chemicals in violation of its existing permit.\n\nDNREC issued a single notice in May citing the refinery for 26 ‚Äúflaring‚Äù incidents between mid-2013 and late 2015 that collectively released more than 100 tons of sulfur dioxide and other potentially harmful chemicals.\n\nAnother notice was issued in July citing the refinery for the release of another 3 tons of sulfur dioxide and nearly 16 tons of six other chemicals during two equipment leaks in late 2014 and early 2015.\n\nA third notice ‚Äì issued by DNREC on Aug. 15 ‚Äì recorded a series of permit violations stemming from a near total power outage at the refinery that began during a Jan. 23 blizzard.\n\nThe shutdown resulted in the release of nearly 212,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide and 1,100 pounds of hydrogen sulfide. Both chemicals can be poisonous in high concentrations, leading to respiratory illness and even death.\n\nLindsey, the refinery spokeswoman, declined to discuss specifics about the violation notices received by the refinery.\n\n‚ÄúWe can assure you our Delaware City team is dedicated to operating the refinery in an environmentally responsible manner and continuously reducing emissions from the plant,‚Äù she said.\n\nCherry said he expects a public hearing date on PBF Energy's permit application to be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/politics/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-ukraine/index.html", "title": "Exclusive: Musk's SpaceX says it can no longer pay for critical ...", "text": "Washington CNN ‚Äî\n\nSince they first started arriving in Ukraine last spring, the Starlink satellite internet terminals made by Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX have been a vital source of communication for Ukraine‚Äôs military, allowing it to fight and stay connected even as cellular phone and internet networks have been destroyed in its war with Russia.\n\nSo far roughly 20,000 Starlink satellite units have been donated to Ukraine, with Musk tweeting on Friday the ‚Äúoperation has cost SpaceX $80 million and will exceed $100 million by the end of the year.‚Äù\n\nBut those charitable contributions could be coming to an end, as SpaceX has warned the Pentagon that it may stop funding the service in Ukraine unless the US military kicks in tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nDocuments obtained by CNN show that last month Musk‚Äôs SpaceX sent a letter to the Pentagon saying it can no longer continue to fund the Starlink service as it has. The letter also requested that the Pentagon take over funding for Ukraine‚Äôs government and military use of Starlink, which SpaceX claims would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year and could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months.\n\n‚ÄúWe are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,‚Äù SpaceX‚Äôs director of government sales wrote to the Pentagon in the September letter.\n\nAmong the SpaceX documents sent to the Pentagon and seen by CNN is a previously unreported direct request made to Musk in July by the Ukrainian military‚Äôs commanding general, General Valerii Zaluzhniy, for almost 8,000 more Starlink terminals.\n\nIn a separate cover letter to the Pentagon, an outside consultant working for SpaceX wrote, ‚ÄúSpaceX faces terribly difficult decisions here. I do not think they have the financial ability to provide any additional terminals or service as requested by General Zaluzhniy.‚Äù\n\nThe documents, which have not been previously reported, provide a rare breakdown of SpaceX‚Äôs own internal numbers on Starlink, detailing the costs and payments associated with the thousands of terminals in Ukraine. They also shed new light on behind-the-scenes negotiations that have provided millions of dollars in communications hardware and services to Ukraine at little cost to Kyiv.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed they received correspondence from SpaceX about the funding of the Starlink satellite communications product in Ukraine, a statement from Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Friday.\n\nEarlier in the day, Singh confirmed the Pentagon had been in communication with SpaceX but did not say whether it was over the funding of the Starlink satellite communication product.\n\nMusk on Friday said that in asking the Pentagon to pick up the bill for Starlink in Ukraine, he was following the advice of a Ukrainian diplomat who responded to Musk‚Äôs Ukraine peace plan earlier this month, before the letter was sent to the Pentagon, with: ‚ÄúF*** off.‚Äù\n\nUkraine‚Äôs ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, responded earlier this month to Musk‚Äôs claimed peace plan for Russia‚Äôs Ukraine war by saying: ‚ÄúF*** off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just following his recommendation,‚Äù Musk said on Friday, responding to a tweet that referenced CNN‚Äôs reporting and Melnyk‚Äôs comments, even though the letter SpaceX sent to the Pentagon was sent before the Twitter exchange.\n\nReports of outages\n\nThe letters come amid recent reports of wide-ranging Starlink outages as Ukrainian troops attempt to retake ground occupied by Russia in the eastern and southern parts of the country.\n\nSources familiar with the outages said they suddenly affected the entire frontline as it stood on September 30. ‚ÄúThat has affected every effort of the Ukrainians to push past that front,‚Äù said one person familiar with the outages who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. ‚ÄúStarlink is the main way units on the battlefield have to communicate.‚Äù\n\nThis photograph taken on September 25 shows an antenna of the Starlink satellite-based broadband system donated by US tech billionaire Elon Musk in Izyum, Kharkiv region, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere was no warning to Ukrainian forces, a second person said, adding that now when Ukraine liberates an area a request has to be made for Starlink services to be turned on.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported the outages which resulted in a ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù loss of communication, a senior Ukrainian official said. In a tweet responding to the article, Musk didn‚Äôt dispute the outage, saying that what is happening on the battlefield is classified.\n\nSpaceX‚Äôs suggestion it will stop funding Starlink also comes amid rising concern in Ukraine over Musk‚Äôs allegiance. Musk recently tweeted a controversial peace plan that would have Ukraine give up Crimea and control over the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\n\nAfter Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the question of who Musk sides with, he responded that he ‚Äústill very much support[s] Ukraine‚Äù but fears ‚Äúmassive escalation.‚Äù\n\nMusk also argued privately last month that Ukraine doesn‚Äôt want peace negotiations right now and that if they went along with his plan, ‚ÄúRussia would accept those terms,‚Äù according to a person who heard them.\n\n‚ÄúUkraine knows that its current government and wartime efforts are totally dependent on Starlink,‚Äù the person familiar with the discussions said. ‚ÄúThe decision to keep Starlink running or not rests entirely in the hands of one man. That‚Äôs Elon Musk. He hasn‚Äôt been elected, no one decided to give him that power. He has it because of the technology and the company he built.‚Äù\n\nOn Tuesday Musk denied a report he has spoken to Putin directly about Ukraine. On Thursday, when a Ukrainian minister tweeted that Starlink is essential to Ukraine‚Äôs infrastructure, Musk replied: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre most welcome. Glad to support Ukraine.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe gall to look like heroes‚Äù\n\nMore than seven months into the war, it‚Äôs hard to overstate the impact Starlink has had in Ukraine. The government in Kyiv, Ukrainian troops as well and NGOs and civilians have relied on the nimble, compact and easy-to-use units created by SpaceX. It‚Äôs not only used for voice and electronic communication but to help fly drones and send back video to correct artillery fire.\n\nCNN has seen it used at numerous Ukrainian bases.\n\nElon Musk pauses and looks down as he speaks during a press conference at SpaceX's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Village in South Texas on February 10, 2022. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n‚ÄúStarlink has been absolutely essential because the Russians have targeted the Ukrainian communications infrastructure,‚Äù said Dimitri Alperovitch, co-founder of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a think tank. ‚ÄúWithout that they‚Äôd be really operating in the blind in many cases.‚Äù\n\nThough Musk has received widespread acclaim and thanks for responding to requests for Starlink service to Ukraine right as the war was starting, in reality, the vast majority of the 20,000 terminals have received full or partial funding from outside sources, including the US government, the UK and Poland, according to the SpaceX letter to the Pentagon.\n\nSpaceX‚Äôs request that the US military foot the bill has rankled top brass at the Pentagon, with one senior defense official telling CNN that SpaceX has ‚Äúthe gall to look like heroes‚Äù while having others pay so much and now presenting them with a bill for tens of millions per month.\n\nAccording to the SpaceX figures shared with the Pentagon, about 85% of the 20,000 terminals in Ukraine were paid ‚Äì or partially paid ‚Äì for by countries like the US and Poland or other entities. Those entities also paid for about 30% of the internet connectivity, which SpaceX says costs $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. (Over the weekend, Musk tweeted there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine.)\n\nIn his July letter to Musk, Ukraine‚Äôs commander-in-chief, Gen. Zaluzhniy, praised the Starlink units‚Äô ‚Äúexceptional utility‚Äù and said some 4,000 terminals had been deployed by the military. However, around 500 terminals per month are destroyed in the fighting, Zaluzhniy said, before asking for 6,200 more terminals for the Ukrainian military and intelligence services and 500 per month going forward to offset the losses.\n\nSpaceX said they responded by asking Zaluzhniy to instead take up his request to the Department of Defense.\n\nOn September 8, the senior director of government sales for SpaceX wrote the Pentagon saying the costs have gotten too high, approaching $100 million. The official asked the Department of Defense to pick up Ukraine‚Äôs new request as well as ongoing service costs, totaling $124 million for the remainder of 2022.\n\nThose costs, according to the senior defense official, would reach almost $380 million for a full year.\n\nSpaceX declined repeated requests for comment on both the outages and their recent request to the Pentagon. A lawyer for Musk did not reply to a request for comment. Defense Department spokesman Bob Ditchey told CNN, ‚ÄúThe Department continues to work with industry to explore solutions for Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces as they repel Russia‚Äôs brutal and unprovoked aggression. We do not have anything else to add at this time.‚Äù\n\nBreaking down the costs\n\nEarly US support for Starlink came via the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which according to the Washington Post spent roughly $3 million on hardware and services in Ukraine. The largest single contributor of terminals, according to the newly obtained documents, is Poland with payment for almost 9,000 individual terminals.\n\nUS Pentagon in Washington DC building looking down aerial view from above Ivan Cholakov/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe US has provided almost 1,700 terminals. Other contributors include the UK, NGOs and crowdfunding.\n\nThe far more expensive part, however, is the ongoing connectivity. SpaceX says it has paid for about 70% of the service provided to Ukraine and claims to have offered that highest level ‚Äì $4,500 a month ‚Äì to all terminals in Ukraine despite the majority only having signed on for the cheaper $500 per month service.\n\nThe terminals themselves cost $1500 and $2500 for the two models sent to Ukraine, the documents say, while consumer models on Starlink‚Äôs website are far cheaper and service in Ukraine is just $60 per month.\n\nThat‚Äôs just 1.3% of the service rate SpaceX says it needs the Pentagon to start paying.\n\n‚ÄúYou could say he‚Äôs trying to get money from the government or just trying to say ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to be part of this anymore,‚Äô‚Äù said the person familiar with Ukraine‚Äôs requests for Starlink. Given the recent outages and Musk‚Äôs reputation for being unpredictable, ‚ÄúFeelings are running really high on the Ukrainian side,‚Äù this person said.\n\nMusk is the biggest shareholder of the privately-held SpaceX. In May, SpaceX disclosed that its valuation had risen to $127 billion and it has raised $2 billion this year, CNBC reported.\n\nLast week, Musk faced a barrage of criticism on Twitter ‚Äì including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ‚Äì after presenting in a series of tweets his peace plan to end the war. It would include giving Crimea to Russia and re-do referenda, supervised by the United Nations this time, in the four regions Russia recently illegally annexed.\n\nIt echoed comments he‚Äôd made last month at an exclusive closed-door conference in Aspen, Colorado called ‚ÄúThe Weekend,‚Äù at which Musk told a room full of attendees that Ukraine should seek peace now because they‚Äôve had recent victories.\n\n‚ÄúThis is the time to do it. They don‚Äôt want to do it, that‚Äôs for sure. But this is the time to do it,‚Äù he said, according to a person in the room. ‚ÄúEveryone wants to seek peace when they‚Äôre losing but they don‚Äôt want to seek peace when they‚Äôre winning. For now.‚Äù", "authors": ["Alex Marquardt"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/09/hospital-wedding-howard-celebrates-home-order-news-around-states/114749772/", "title": "Hospital wedding, Howard celebrates: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: An organization for teachers is expressing concern that children are being allowed to return to school before completing required COVID-19 quarantine periods, potentially putting the health of students and school employees at risk. The Alabama Education Association sent a letter Thursday to the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners saying it had learned some doctors are writing excuses for students to return to school before mandated quarantine periods expired. Theron Stokes, associate executive director of AEA, said doctors should be aware of the guidelines and follow them. ‚ÄúWhen students return to school having not completed the entire 14-day quarantine period, they are placing their fellow students and their schools‚Äô employees at risk. For students and school employees who have underlying health conditions, these decisions can be deadly,‚Äù Stokes wrote.

The changes take effect Monday, with masks to be worn, with a few exceptions, in indoor public settings or communal areas and outdoors when distancing from non-household members is not possible. In some cases, such as for individuals with disabilities who cannot tolerate a mask, face shields will be allowed unless wearing one would be impossible, the order says. Masks are to be worn by school-age children older than 5, those who exercise or work at gyms, and athletes, players, coaches and officials who participate in organized sports, according to the municipality directives. Athletes must keep a mask on for indoor sports, but one is not required while ‚Äúexercising vigorously outdoors,‚Äù the directives state.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A top hospital official urged Arizonans to help curb the spread of the coronavirus by considering alternatives to traditional Thanksgiving get-togethers. ‚ÄúCongregating in large groups and close contact with others outside of your immediate household put you and those around you at risk,‚Äù said Dr. Marjorie Bessell, chief clinical officer of Banner Health. ‚ÄúI know we are asking a lot of you.‚Äù Banner operates 23 hospitals in Arizona and several in other states. Arizona health officials on Sunday reported 1,880 new COVID-19 cases and 17 additional deaths. State Department of Health Services officials said the latest figures increase Arizona‚Äôs totals to 259,264 cases and 6,164 known deaths since the coronavirus pandemic began. Cases and hospitalizations have been steadily increasing in Arizona since late September and throughout October after bottoming out in August after the state was a national hot spot in June and July.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state hit a record one-day increase in coronavirus cases Friday for the second day in a row, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he was growing concerned about hospital capacity. The Department of Health said the state‚Äôs probable and confirmed virus cases rose by 1,870. The state‚Äôs previous one-day high came Thursday, when it reported 1,548 new cases. On Saturday the department reported 1,598 new cases and 12 additional deaths for totals of 120,828 cases and 2,068 deaths since the pandemic began. The department reported 722 hospitalizations, 16 more than Friday‚Äôs then-record high. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs numbers show we are not in a good position as we head into the colder months,‚Äù Gov.

Darrell Issa was victorious Saturday in his race to return to Congress, where he once headed the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and became a GOP favorite for launching a string of investigations of the Obama administration. The former nine-term congressman and ardent supporter of President Donald Trump trailed early in the San Diego-area 50th District. But as more votes were counted after Election Day, he overtook Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar. The latest vote count update gave him about 54% of the votes and a 23,000-vote lead. Issa already had declared victory in a statement posted to social media Friday night. Campa-Najjar, a 31-year-old former Obama administration official, was making his second bid for the seat. He received more votes than he did in 2018 and thanked his supporters for ‚Äúgiving a Latino-Arab American a chance to do something special.‚Äù\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: City officials are urging residents to stay home between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. in an effort to stem the tide of coronavirus cases, which could overwhelm area hospitals by the end of the year. Mayor Michael Hancock said during a virtual news conference Friday that the ‚ÄúHome by 10 Order,‚Äù which will last for at least 30 days, is necessary to avoid another citywide stay-at-home order. He also urged residents not to gather or mix with other households. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to mince any words here when it comes to the spread of the coronavirus,‚Äù Hancock said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on a very dangerous path. We‚Äôre seeing rapid, significant increases in the numbers of people getting sick, and many of those people ended up in the hospital.‚Äù The mayor shied away from calling the order a curfew because he said enforcement would only target the most egregious violations ‚Äì not, for instance, someone walking their dog or going for a run after 10 p.m.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: Several colleges and universities have added new restrictions for students as coronavirus cases continue to rise in the state. Quinnipiac University announced it is instituting a two-week quarantine after recording 155 positive tests on campus since Wednesday. The quarantine means residential students must stay in their rooms, except to pick up takeout meals from the dining hall, and students living off campus can only return for testing. Students in isolation who have tested positive for the coronavirus will have meals delivered to their rooms each night. At Yale University, students residing in Davenport, Hopper, and Saybrook Colleges were ordered to quarantine because of positive coronavirus tests. In Fairfield, Sacred Heart and Fairfield universities have instituted curfews. The state reported Friday that 22 more people were hospitalized with COVID-19, bringing the total to 402, the highest total in five months.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: For the Rehoboth Beach Film Society, the show (or shows) must go on. The 23rd annual Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival is taking place as scheduled this month with a few modifications for health concerns. Only five films will be shown inside the society‚Äôs Cinema Art Theater, with 10 more available to stream at home. ‚ÄúWe had the opportunity to carry out this event with the safety of our viewers as a priority,‚Äù said Rehoboth Beach Film Society Executive Director Sue Early. ‚ÄúThey can watch films at home this year. It‚Äôs not the same experience, but there‚Äôs some great films to see. And in our theater, we could be showing at 60%, and we‚Äôre only going to use 30 out of 104 seats, which is just under 29%. They are well-spaced and cleaned after every screening. So it‚Äôs really safe.‚Äù Tickets are on sale now for the festival, which runs Nov. 5-15.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Hundreds of people gathered on the campus of Howard University on Saturday to celebrate their sister Kamala Harris after her announcement as vice president-elect, WUSA-TV reports. ‚ÄúWhen you come to Howard University, that is a very distinct choice,‚Äù said Niambi Carter, associate professor of political science at Howard University. ‚ÄúYou are choosing a legacy and a lineage that is great in so many aspects.‚Äù A large group of Alpha chapter members of Alpha Kappa Alpha gathered in front of the sorority‚Äôs plot on the yard to cheer for Harris‚Äô election. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so proud of Kamala, and I‚Äôm so proud to stand on the grounds where she walked,‚Äù alumna Kenya Sumner said. Harris graduated from Howard with a degree in political science and economics in 1986, the same year she became a member of the Alpha chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first historically black sorority, founded on Howard‚Äôs campus.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrange Park: Eight weeks after being admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, Henry Bell and his longtime fiancee decided the time was right for a wedding. So the day before his anticipated release from the inpatient rehab center at Orange Park Medical Center, Bell, 63, and Antionette Brown, 48, said their vows in the parking lot Thursday. Brown‚Äôs uncle performed the ceremony. ‚ÄúHis condition was deadly,‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúWe decided to do it now because we feel they (the hospital staff) are like family and wanted to share the life they gave us back.‚Äù Bell was admitted to the hospital Sept. 13 and immediately put on a ventilator. Brown and the couple‚Äôs seven grown children could only wait and hope for his condition to improve. He spent weeks in intensive care. He entered the hospital‚Äôs rehab center Sunday, and his recovery has included learning how to walk again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Athens-Clarke County plans to rent space for jury trials and grand jury proceedings. Grand juries and trials have been on hold in the state since March 14, when state Supreme Court Chief Justice Harold Melton declared a statewide judicial emergency because of the coronavirus threat. In subsequent renewal orders, Melton amended them to allow for court proceedings if they could be conducted safely. The best option for holding court proceedings in Athens-Clarke County is by using the Classic Center, said a committee tasked with deciding the issue. The county will pay the Classic Center up to $350,815 to rent space for the proceedings. The price Athens-Clarke will pay includes daily cleaning of the rooms used for trial proceedings, including space to conduct actual trials and a jury deliberation room. The $350,815 amount is based on the cost of 30 jury trials that last an average of five days each.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Land and Natural Resources reopened a popular scenic spot on Oahu that has been closed to visitors since the outbreak of the coronavirus. The Nuuanu Pali State Wayside, popularly known as Pali Lookout, was closed to the public at the outset of the pandemic because of budgetary constraints and crowding concerns. There were challenges in maintaining physical distancing at the lookout, State Parks Administrator Curt Cottrell said. Officials announced the park, which is among the most visited spots on Oahu, reopened Wednesday with daily hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The gates to the park‚Äôs access roads will be unlocked and secured daily by the Honolulu Police Department. The state set new parking fees of $7 per vehicle for nonresidents. Hawaii residents are not subject to parking and entry fees at any state parks. Tour buses are largely absent from the lookout, making the volume of visitors much lower.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A state panel of medical experts is asking the governor for a statewide mask mandate, and hospitals are running out of space for COVID-19 patients, after a week marked with record numbers of new cases and deaths. At least 671 Idaho residents have died from the coronavirus, and a record high of 1,290 new COVID-19 cases were reported on Wednesday alone, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, followed by 1,265 new cases Thursday. More than 69,500 residents have been confirmed to have the illness since the pandemic began. Idaho hospitals have reported more than 200 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 every day since Oct. 12. On Nov. 2, the most recent data available, there were nearly 300 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Jeanie Gentry, CEO of Steele Memorial Medical Center in Salmon, told the Idaho Statesman the facility is short about 40% of its staffers because they‚Äôve been exposed or sickened.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has tested negative for the coronavirus after learning he may have been exposed during a meeting to someone who tested positive. Members of Pritzker‚Äôs staff who attended the meeting last Monday also tested negative for the virus, his office said Saturday in a news release. Pritzker had self-isolated Friday while awaiting test results. They were the second negative test results for Pritzker and staff members who also underwent weekly tests Wednesday, according to his office. Meanwhile, 12,438 newly confirmed and probable cases of the virus and another 76 deaths were reported Saturday by the Illinois Department of Public Health. More than 10,370 new cases and 49 deaths were reported Friday. Illinois has had nearly 478,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 10,150 deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: The University of Notre Dame‚Äôs Faculty Senate formally expressed disappointment in the school president‚Äôs failure to wear a face mask at a White House event days before he tested positive for the coronavirus. The Faculty Senate voted 29-13 on Thursday for a resolution expressing disappointment in the Rev. John Jenkins‚Äô failure to wear a mask and practice social distancing at a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor confirmed last month as a U.S. Supreme Court justice. The Faculty Senate was originally expected to vote on a no confidence resolution, but that was amended. Jenkins tested positive for the coronavirus days after the Rose Garden ceremony, where President Donald Trump introduced Barrett as his nominee to the high court. Jenkins was seen without a mask, and he shook hands and sat shoulder-to-shoulder with others.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State prison officials reported Friday that a coronavirus outbreak has infected nearly half of the inmates at a prison in Anamosa. Testing last week revealed 476 inmates among 985 at the prison tested positive for the virus, said Cord Overton, a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Corrections. A report provided by the department indicates 37 staff members also tested positive. Across the nine institutions the department manages, 601 inmates were infected as of Friday afternoon. The report shows coronavirus has been active in the prison system since testing began in March with more than 21,000 tests administered to inmates. It said 1,252 inmates have recovered, an indication they have at one time tested positive but are no longer symptomatic are believed to be contagious. Four Iowa inmates have died during the pandemic, the report said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state saw most of a projected budget shortfall melt away Friday with a fiscal forecast that is less pessimistic about the economy and tax collections than a dire estimate issued this spring during a statewide lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic. The forecasting group boosted the state‚Äôs forecast for tax collections by $463 million, or 6.3%, for the 2021 budget year that began July 1. The group also issued its first calculations for the 2022 budget year that starts in July 2021, and while the forecast predicts a drop in tax collections of 2.1%, or $166 million, that‚Äôs due largely to the end of a temporary, pandemic-induced move to help income taxpayers. The Legislature‚Äôs nonpartisan research staff now projects a $153 million budget shortfall for the state‚Äôs 2022 budget year, an amount that almost can be covered by an internal shuffling of government funds that Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly already has proposed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state‚Äôs bar and restaurant operators are getting a break from alcoholic beverage renewal fees in a cost-saving step as they struggle with revenue losses from the pandemic. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is granting a 12-month fee renewal waiver to license holders, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday. Bar and restaurant operators who haven‚Äôt submitted the renewal fee this year won‚Äôt have to pay until 2021, he said. Those who have paid this year will have their fees waived in 2021, he said. ‚ÄúThis has certainly been a difficult year for our bars, restaurants and venues, and they deserve this innovative support as we face what could be a very painful winter,‚Äù Beshear said. Bars and restaurants have endured capacity limitations to help contain the coronavirus. The fee waiver doesn‚Äôt apply to producers, distributors, wholesalers and others able to continue operations throughout the virus-related state of emergency.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: In response to complaints that family and clergy were barred from hospitals and nursing homes amid the coronavirus pandemic, legislators have rewritten state laws to lessen visitation restrictions during public health emergencies. The bills passed unanimously in the special session that ended last month and were signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. They still will give discretion to the Louisiana Department of Health to decide just how wide-open the visitation can be and what safety protections will have to be followed. One measure by Sen. Robert Mills, a Minden Republican, calls on the health department to create rules requiring inpatient health care facilities to allow pastors, priests and other members of the clergy to visit patients during a public health emergency, if the patient asks for the visit.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials on Friday recommended caution at more schools in the state because of the rise in coronavirus cases. The state uses a color-coded system to categorize the level of precaution schools should use. The administration of Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said it‚Äôs adding schools in Knox County and Franklin County to the ‚Äúyellow‚Äù category, which is an intermediate level. Those counties join Somerset and Washington counties in the yellow category. All other counties in the state are in the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù category, the lowest level, though officials said they‚Äôre closely monitoring schools in Waldo and Kennebec counties. The state recommends that schools located in counties in the yellow category consider hybrid instruction models to reduce the number of people in schools and classrooms. The change in category for some schools came as cases surged around the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city is tightening restrictions on restaurants and indoor and outdoor gatherings in response to rising cases of the coronavirus, Mayor Bernard ‚ÄúJack‚Äù Young announced Friday. The changes will take effect Thursday at 5 p.m. Young said numbers of people in restaurants, religious facilities, theaters and malls will be limited to 25% capacity. Young said food service establishments must close indoor dining at 10 p.m. Bars that don‚Äôt have a license to sell food will be closed. ‚ÄúI am instituting these restrictions for the public health and to save lives in Baltimore city,‚Äù Young said. Also, the city‚Äôs health commissioner revised an order to require masks to be worn in public at all times, whether people are inside or outside. Dr. Letitia Dzirasa‚Äôs order is effective immediately. ‚ÄúOver the past month Baltimore city has seen our data trends move in the wrong direction,‚Äù she said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State officials on Friday urged more schools to return to full, in-person instruction, saying that only communities with the highest COVID-19 rates should be using any form of remote learning. Under previous guidance, schools were told to shift among remote learning, in-person learning or a mix of the two depending on their area‚Äôs infection rate. Areas with moderate spread were advised to use remote or hybrid learning, while only those with the lowest rates were encouraged to bring students back full time. But speaking at a news conference, Gov. Charlie Baker said there‚Äôs growing evidence that schools are not a significant source of spread and that keeping students at home hurts their learning and mental health. ‚ÄúWe continue to see too many communities with children learning in remote-only models,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe all know that losing a week, a month, a quarter or more in the life of a kid‚Äôs education has real consequences.‚Äù\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Joe Biden reclaimed the Wolverine State for Democrats with a surge of support in urban regions like Detroit and Grand Rapids, offsetting high turnout in rural and exurban areas for President Donald Trump. Biden‚Äôs 146,000-vote margin, 2.7 percentage points, was powered by gains in big, vote-rich counties such as Oakland near Detroit and Kent, which includes Grand Rapids ‚Äì amid a record 5.5 million people casting ballots statewide. Biden won Oakland by 14 points, besting Hillary Clinton‚Äôs 8-point edge in 2016. He carried Kent by almost 6 points after Trump netted it by 3 points four years ago. Trump again won traditional bellwether Macomb County outside Detroit, by roughly 8 points ‚Äì less than his 11-point margin in 2016, however. Biden became just the second Democratic presidential candidate to carry Kent in more than 50 years, after Barack Obama did it in his first run.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: COVID-19 is sweeping across the state at an unprecedented pace, breaking records for new cases and daily deaths and raising concerns about the ability of hospitals to keep up. The Star Tribune reports Saturday‚Äôs tally of 4,647 new cases ‚Äì a figure that would have easily set a record during the first eight months of the pandemic ‚Äì wasn‚Äôt even close to the biggest single-day count of the past week. For the seven-day period ending Saturday, Minnesota reported more than 25,000 new COVID-19 cases, or more than 10% of the state‚Äôs cases since March. The Minnesota Department of Health reported another 34 deaths Saturday, bringing the week‚Äôs total to 168, the second-highest one-week count since the start of the pandemic. Hospitals, meanwhile, are scrambling to treat more COVID-19 patients even as the virus threatens to sideline more health care workers.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Health has been working around the clock to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Now, the agency will be responsible for starting a statewide medical marijuana program within the next nine months. Uncertified election results showed 74% of Mississippi voters approved the ballot measure that allows doctors to prescribe up to 5 ounces of marijuana per month for people who have at least one of more than 20 serious medical conditions. ‚ÄúThis vote shows minds are changing,‚Äù said Jaqueline Temple Rudder, a homemaker from Madison County who lost her father-in-law to cancer and voted for Initiative 65. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want our sick suffering.‚Äù Both Gov. Tate Reeves and state‚Äôs top health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, opposed the initiative. Officials with the Department of Health will have until August to begin licensing treatment centers and certifying eligible patients.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Local health departments in the state don‚Äôt have enough staffers to conduct contact tracing for all the COVID-19 cases popping up, so they have been prioritizing the ones they try to trace back to their sources, officials said. The state‚Äôs rate of positive tests over the past two weeks is more than double the national average, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Larry Jones, who heads the Missouri Center for Public Health Excellence, said local health departments are struggling to keep up with contact tracing, which helps determine how a disease is spreading. Missouri on Sunday reported 4,131 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three more deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Missouri has risen over the past two weeks, from about 1,789 new cases per day Oct. 24 to about 3,126 as of Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A nursing facility in Butte has reported 10 COVID-19-related deaths in less than two weeks, and Gallatin County on Friday enacted stricter measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. Montana has hit a record for hospitalizations, and the confirmed number of infection cases was closing in on 38,000, state officials said. The state health department confirmed 986 more cases of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the total for the past week to 6,040, or an average of 863 cases per day. Over the previous week, the daily average was 779. Montana has reported 418 deaths, which may not include all 10 deaths tied to the outbreak at the Continental Care & Rehabilitation nursing facility in Butte. The Gallatin County health board on Friday said bars, restaurants and casinos must close by 10 p.m. instead of 12:30 a.m. They must also limit group sizes at tables to six adults plus children who are with a parent or guardian.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to report record numbers of new coronavirus cases and people hospitalized with the virus. Health officials said the surge in cases over the past month continued Friday with 2,681 new cases and 748 people hospitalized with the virus. Both those were new records, and the state‚Äôs rate of new cases was the seventh-highest in the nation. The state said 27 new deaths were reported Friday to give Nebraska 701 deaths. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has increased over the past two weeks from 836.71 new cases per day Oct. 23 to 1,408.86 new cases per day Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Also Friday, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said nine more staff members had tested positive for the virus to give it a total of 225 staff members who have been diagnosed with the virus. The department said the ill staffers are all isolating themselves at home.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Democrats successfully won reelection in the swing state‚Äôs two battleground congressional districts. First-term Rep. Susie Lee won reelection to a second term by defeating former professional wrestler Dan Rodimer in the 3rd District. Republicans believed the Las Vegas-area district offered them their best chance at unseating an incumbent. Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford was reelected in the state‚Äôs other battleground district, defeating Republican former Assemblyman Jim Marchant. Lee and Horsford‚Äôs victories cement a six-year hold on Nevada‚Äôs swing districts, which Democrats have won in the three most recent elections, and helps Democrats hoping maintain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, where many races remain too early to call with votes left to be counted. The result sends Nevada‚Äôs existing delegation back to Washington, D.C.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth-Hitchcock is again putting strict limits on visitors to its hospitals and outpatient clinics in response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Effective Friday, visitors are banned under most circumstances. Limited exceptions will be made for pediatric patients, women giving birth, patients at the end of life and those in a few other circumstances. The return to more restrictive policies applies to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon as well as the health system‚Äôs outpatient clinics and facilities. Officials said their decision was based on the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in both New Hampshire and Vermont. Meanwhile, the state‚Äôs court system said it is suspending in-person hearings for a few days after Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year‚Äôs Day to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday named his associate counsel to lead the commission that will oversee the state‚Äôs new recreational marijuana marketplace. Dianna Houenou, who serves as legal counsel to Murphy‚Äôs administration, will chair the Cannabis Regulatory Commission. Before working in Murphy‚Äôs administration, Houenou was policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union in New Jersey. Murphy, a Democrat, made the announcement just days after New Jersey voters approved a constitutional amendment legalizing recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. The amendment goes into effect at the start of next year and calls for state regulators to set up a marketplace for the legal sale of the drug. It‚Äôs unclear when marijuana will be ready to hit retail shelves in the state. Advocates for legalization said the soonest they expect it could happen toward the end of 2021.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State officials have the power to impose civil penalties when enforcing public health orders that call for businesses to restrict their operations amid a public health emergency, the state Supreme Court said Friday. The unanimous written opinion details the legal reasoning for an oral decision made by the court in August in a case brought by businesses that challenged health orders issued as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had petitioned the court to resolve the dispute. Lujan Grisham has warned that more restrictions could be imposed as early as this week as infections, hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase. She also said she has been disappointed in enforcement, pointing to businesses and country clubs in Albuquerque and elsewhere that hosted Halloween parties despite the ban on gatherings.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Restrictions in some New York City pandemic hot spots will be rolled back, even as the state prepares to combat coronavirus flare-ups upstate, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday. The governor said he‚Äôs considering imposing additional social distancing restrictions in ‚Äúmicrocluster‚Äù zones in the Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse areas because of rising infection rates. The addition of more of those zones upstate reflect the shifting state strategy as COVID-19 becomes a worsening problem beyond New York City, once an epicenter of the pandemic. The governor also said the National Guard will increase its presence at airports to help make sure travelers from non-neighboring states can provide proof of a negative coronavirus test. ‚ÄúIn general, downstate New York is doing better than upstate New York, which is a total reversal from the first phase of COVID,‚Äù Cuomo said during a telephone briefing.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans pressed state election officials Friday to make public more information about the number of outstanding ballots from last week‚Äôs election that could be counted. Nearly a dozen Election Day races in North Carolina, including those for president and U.S. Senate, remained too early to call because as many as 172,000 ballots had either yet to be counted or rejected, or could trickle in before this week‚Äôs deadline to receive mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day. The actual number of ballots that will arrive is likely to be less, however, because many people who requested absentee ballots ended up voting on Election Day or perhaps didn‚Äôt vote at all. And past elections show a significant portion of the 41,000 provisional ballots cast Tuesday will be rejected.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A child with COVID-19 has been confirmed to have a rare condition that causes inflammation in different parts of the body, state health officials said Friday. The child, who was discharged from the hospital and is resting at home, is the first confirmed case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in the state. ‚ÄúThis development is an unfortunate reminder that COVID-19 can impact people of any age, even children,‚Äù Dr. Joan Connell, Department of Health field medical officer and pediatrician, said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe best way to help prevent your child from getting MIS-C is to take action to avoid exposure to the COVID-19 virus and teach your child how to do the same.‚Äù MIS-C ‚Äì short for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children ‚Äì can inflame the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs. Children with it have experienced persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes and fatigue. Long-term effects are unknown.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The number of coronavirus cases in the state has continued to spike despite pleas from the governor for people to help slow the spread. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Ohio has risen over the past two weeks from 2,084 new cases per day Oct. 22 to 3,748 new cases per day Thursday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in the state has also risen over the past two weeks from 4.96% on Oct. 22 to 7.93% on Thursday, according to the tracking hub. The Health Department on Friday reported 5,008 probable and confirmed cases, another daily record high. Ohio has reported more than 240,000 probable and confirmed cases to date, including 5,494 deaths. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday that he planned to announce additional measures soon to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of newly reported coronavirus cases in the state Saturday more than doubled the previous one-day record, and the Department of Health said a backlog of cases and possibly duplicate reporting were the reason. There were 4,741 new cases, bringing the total to 136,492 since the pandemic began, the department said. The previous one-day record of 2,101 new cases was recorded Thursday as cases in the state have surged in recent weeks. ‚ÄúWe have reason to believe that our normal case count would have continued on an upward trajectory without the backlog and duplication,‚Äù which is due to a transition from a manual to electronic reporting system, according to a health department statement. In a statement, Gov. Kevin Stitt called on residents to wash hands often, socially distance and voluntarily wear masks at indoor public places.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Following a record-breaking day of COVID-19 cases in the state, officials announced new restrictions Friday that will be implemented in at least five of the state‚Äôs counties as part of a two-week pause on social activities. The updated safety measures, which begin Wednesday, include halting visitations to long-term care facilities, reducing the capacity of indoor dining at restaurants to 50 people, encouraging all businesses to mandate working from home, and urging Oregonians not to gather with people who do not live in their household ‚Äì but if they do to limit it to six people. If people have multiple get-togethers, which is discouraged, it should be the same social circle of six people. ‚ÄúLet me be clear, we cannot allow this disease to continue to spread so rapidly in our communities. Lives are at stake,‚Äù Gov. Kate Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Bail has been set at $750,000 each for two men authorities said were armed with loaded handguns when they were arrested near the city‚Äôs convention center where votes were being counted. Joshua Macias, 42, and Antonio LaMotta, 61, traveled from the Virginia Beach, Virginia, area in a Hummer and did not have permits to carry the weapons in Pennsylvania, police said. They were charged with carrying a concealed firearm without a license and carrying a firearm on a public street. The men were stopped Thursday about a block from the vehicle, Macias with a .40-caliber Beretta handgun inside his jacket and LaMotta with a 9 mm Beretta in a holster, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. An AR-style rifle and ammunition were found inside the vehicle, Outlaw said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: Protesters gathered near a prison that houses federal detainees Friday, denouncing the facility‚Äôs contract with U.S. immigration authorities and pointing to a surge in coronavirus infections among detainees. Demonstrators blocked roads leading to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, where authorities say more than 150 detainees have tested positive for COVID-19. Activists have repeatedly called for Wyatt‚Äôs closure, saying conditions are subpar. The publicly owned but privately operated lockup has about 540 inmates in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In April, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal class-action lawsuit seeking the release of dozens of detainees, saying the virus was spreading ‚Äúuncontrollably.‚Äù More than two dozen detainees subsequently were freed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two days after his opponent proclaimed victory in South Carolina‚Äôs 1st District, freshman U.S. House Rep. Joe Cunningham conceded defeat Friday, saying he was proud of the work he had done in his single term in Congress and pledging to continue to work toward bipartisan progress as a private citizen. Standing in front of the U.S. Customs House in Charleston, Cunningham told supporters that he had called Republican Nancy Mace to offer support and congratulations. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs now my representative,‚Äù Cunningham said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm rooting for her.‚Äù The Associated Press called the race for Mace early Wednesday morning, but Cunningham did not concede, citing scanning issues with absentee ballots in one of the district‚Äôs counties. In her victory, Mace, 42, becomes the first Republican woman elected to Congress in South Carolina and only the second-ever woman from the state elected to a full House term.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: More than 100 state residents have died of complications due to the coronavirus in the first eight days of November, health officials said Sunday. The Department of Health confirmed 13 deaths in the past day, for a total of 111 this month and 536 since the start of the pandemic. The overall death count is the 24th-highest per capita in the country in the past two weeks, Johns Hopkins University researchers said. The state reported 1,426 positive tests for COVID-19 since Saturday. South Dakota ranks second in the country behind North Dakota in the number of new cases per capita in the past two weeks. The top five counties with the most cases per capita in that time are Bon Homme, Dewey, Buffalo, Potter and Sanborn, according to the COVID Tracking Project. There are 546 people being treated in hospitals in the state, up 31 in the past day. Of those, 96 are in intensive care units, and 69 are using ventilators.\n\nTennessee\n\nJohnson City: Health officials in northeastern Tennessee say they do not have enough nurses to combat COVID-19 inside the region‚Äôs hospital system. ‚ÄúThere are no longer enough nurses to fill the need that we have,‚Äù Ballad Health Senior Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer Lisa Smithgall told WJHL-TV. According to Ballad Health, the hospital system is looking to hire 350 registered nurses to fill its nurse shortage. ‚ÄúIn the last eight weeks, we‚Äôve had more than 900 patients admitted to COVID-19,‚Äù said Ballad Health Chief Administrative Officer Eric Deaton. After hitting 200 inpatients last week, the health care system has adjusted its COVID-19 surge plan to receive 300 inpatients. ‚ÄúThese numbers represent lives; they‚Äôre non-encouraging,‚Äù Deaton said. ‚ÄúIn fact, it‚Äôs really becoming a tragedy in the increased rates that we‚Äôre seeing.‚Äù\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: A district judge on Friday upheld an order from El Paso County‚Äôs top elected official shutting down businesses while the region fights an alarming surge in COVID-19 cases. The decision from Judge Bill Moody of El Paso‚Äôs 34th District Court came as federal military medical teams deployed to the border region at the request of the state. The county‚Äôs top elected official, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, ordered a two-week shutdown of nonessential activities late last month. In making his decision, Moody pointed out that during the Spanish flu pandemic in the early part of the 20th century, city and county elected officials had authority to respond as they ‚Äúthought was necessary to protect the health and financial interests of their individual communities.‚Äù Chris Hilton, an attorney with the Texas attorney general‚Äôs office, said the state would appeal.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state‚Äôs largest teachers union called for the governor to move all public secondary schools in high coronavirus transmission areas to remote learning Friday as the state reported a single-day record of 17 COVID-19 deaths. The Utah Education Association also called for Republican Gov. Gary Herbert to suspend all extracurricular activities that can‚Äôt comply with social distancing guidelines in high transmission areas from the Thanksgiving holiday throughout winter break. ‚ÄúWe are now seeing multiple schools repeatedly shift back and forth from in-person to at-home learning due to outbreaks,‚Äù the union wrote in a statement. ‚ÄúThis cycle is obviously not helping to control the virus spread and, as educators, we can unequivocally state the continual interruptions are not in the best interest of student learning.‚Äù\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott said Friday that comments by President Donald Trump casting doubts on the integrity of the election process are hurting society. Scott said all legal votes cast in the 2020 election need to be counted, including mail-in votes. Scott‚Äôs comments came a day after President Donald Trump made baseless claims of fraud in the ballot-counting process for the presidential election. Scott said that the president‚Äôs comments are ‚Äúinciting a lot of rhetoric‚Äù and that many of his followers take him at his word. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe any of the statements he made last night are true, and I do believe it is hurting our society and our ability to work together,‚Äù Scott said. After voting Tuesday, he said he had cast his presidential ballot for former Vice President Joe Biden. He said he had never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate before but had to put ‚Äúcountry over party.‚Äù\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Freshman Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger has kept her seat in a competitive congressional race in the Richmond suburbs. The former CIA operations officer defeated Republican challenger and state House delegate Nick Freitas in a close race that was called Sunday. Spanberger is considered one of Congress‚Äô more moderate Democrats and was part of a wave of women who helped Democrats retake the U.S. House in 2018. But Freitas had tried to tie Spanberger to her party‚Äôs leadership and said it was out of sync with constituents. Spanberger spent nearly a decade with the CIA, working on counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation cases. She is one of two moderate Virginia Democrats who held on to U.S. House seats they flipped from red to blue two years ago, as Democrats‚Äô strength in the Old Dominion continues to grow.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state set a daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 1,777 new confirmed cases announced Saturday, and the state Department of Health warned that COVID-19 cases are spreading in the Puget Sound region. In a statement, the health agency said the high numbers the state has seen over the past week reflect an overall surge that started in mid-September. King, Snohomish and Pierce counties are currently the hot spots in the region, officials said. ‚ÄúCOVID-19 is currently spreading very quickly in Washington state,‚Äù said Secretary of Health John Wiesman. ‚ÄúWe are very concerned that disease transmission will only grow over the next few weeks with the holidays coming up. The threat to overwhelming not just our hospital systems, but our ability to do contact tracing, is real. We need everyone in Washington state to take action now to stop the spread.‚Äù\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported surging COVID-19 case numbers Saturday along with 15 newly reported deaths from the virus. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources reported 655 newly reported cases as of 10 a.m. Saturday for a total of 27,742 total cases and 502 deaths since the pandemic reached the state. The daily case count set a record for the state, a day after West Virginia saw a new peak of 540 cases over 24 hours. On Friday, several government staff and officials including Gov. Jim Justice were tested for the virus after a staffer in the Capitol building tested positive Friday morning. The attorney general‚Äôs office later said the employee believed to have the virus tested negative Friday night. Justice said he was tested for the virus minutes before a noon news conference Friday, where he announced the record high of new cases. He also urged West Virginians to get tested at sites around the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: State health officials reported a new daily high of more than 7,000 new COVID-19 cases ‚Äì another new daily record. Saturday‚Äôs total of 7,065 confirmed infections is more than 900 cases higher than the previous record, set Friday with 6,141 cases, according to the state Department of Health Services. The state first passed 6,000 daily cases Friday, and Tuesday and Wednesday of this past week also saw record-setting numbers of new cases. The 7,065 positive cases made up 37% of the 18,928 test results reported Saturday by the state health department. The seven-day average of new cases also rose again, hitting 5,394, which is the highest weekly average to date, according to DHS. The state health department also reported 45 more people have died, bringing the state‚Äôs death toll to 2,301.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State health officials reported 646 new coronavirus cases Sunday, the second-highest single-day total of the pandemic in the state. The Department of Health listed 966 new cases Friday, the highest single-day total. The Casper Star-Tribune reports at least 114 people have died of the coronavirus, and more than 14,690 people have tested positive. The new totals come amid a rapid surge in the numbers of cases in Wyoming and throughout much of the U.S. Gov. Mark Gordon has said he is not considering implementing a statewide face mask order but has urged residents to wear masks. Albany County, which includes Laramie; the Wind River Reservation; and Teton and Laramie counties have implemented mask mandates under which residents must wear facial coverings when outside their homes, with some exceptions.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/12/surprise-vacation-yard-sale-reprieve-teacher-sick-day-news-around-states/114862294/", "title": "Surprise vacation, yard sale reprieve, teacher sick day: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State health officials are urging people to serve up a heaping side of precaution at Thanksgiving, as the holiday comes amid a national surge in COVID-19 cases. Officials say people should skip large family gatherings in favor of scaled-back events. ‚ÄúWe all want to see our family at holiday time, and yet this is a special year. This is a year unlike any we‚Äôve ever had,‚Äù Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said. ‚ÄúMany things maybe could be done virtually, which is not nearly as much fun but certainly safer.‚Äù The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines. Suzanne Judd, an epidemiologist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham‚Äôs School of Public Health, said Thanksgiving is particularly problematic because it‚Äôs a holiday celebrated by family gatherings indoors. ‚ÄúGatherings greater than 10 people pose a substantial risk of one of the people being COVID-positive and not knowing,‚Äù Judd said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The spread of the coronavirus at the state‚Äôs largest prison has accelerated beyond an initial outbreak, with 110 inmates testing positive for the virus as of Monday. Goose Creek Correctional Center first announced a virus outbreak at the facility Nov. 2, when the Alaska Department of Corrections said 22 inmates and five staff members tested positive, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The prison west of Wasilla near Point McKenzie housed 1,317 pretrial and sentenced prisoners as of Monday, department spokeswoman Sarah Gallagher said. Staff are required and inmates are strongly encouraged to wear masks, she said. The outbreak began in one of the prison‚Äôs housing units, known as mods. Each mod has 64 prisoners, indicating the outbreak has expanded beyond a single unit, Gallagher said. Each mod continues to operate as a ‚Äúfamily unit‚Äù in order to minimize the risk of further transmission, Gallagher said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With the state reporting a daily average of 1,900 new COVID-19 cases over the past week, Gov. Doug Ducey has urged residents to be careful. In a video posted Tuesday, Ducey urged Arizona residents to wear face coverings, wash hands, practice social distancing and stay home when sick. ‚ÄúGatherings of families and friends from outside your household are no safer than going to the grocery store,‚Äù he said. Ducey, a Republican, has not implemented a statewide masking requirement, while many local governments in the state have done so. He announced no new virus prevention initiatives in the video posted on social media and his office‚Äôs website. He cited past moves that included increasing testing and providing money to hospitals for protective gear, staffing and ventilators. Ducey said he wants to protect public health ‚Äúkeep our economy safely open and moving, We know that both are important to the health and well-being of Arizonans.‚Äù\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state‚Äôs COVID-19 hospitalizations again hit a new high Tuesday, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson resisted calls for new restrictions on businesses or gatherings to combat a surge in coronavirus cases. An outbreak of the virus among state legislators also grew to 11 on Tuesday, with a lawmaker testing positive. The Department of Health reported 24 more people were hospitalized because of COVID-19, bringing the state‚Äôs virus hospitalizations to a new high of 810. The state‚Äôs confirmed and probable virus cases rose by 1,424 to 124,235. ‚ÄúThe numbers aren‚Äôt good, the trend is not good, and we have a lot of work to do here in Arkansas and across the nation,‚Äù Hutchinson said at his weekly news briefing on the virus. The state‚Äôs COVID-19 deaths rose by four to 2,112. The Republican governor said many of the state‚Äôs cases are coming from smaller gatherings at homes that he said can‚Äôt be regulated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city will study the feasibility of using its enormous convention center as a temporary shelter for the increasing number of homeless people living on the streets. City Councilman Curren Price introduced a motion Tuesday seeking a report on what it would take to transform the 720,000-square-foot LA Convention Center in his downtown district. The property has not been used for conventions since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, the pandemic has forced more people into homelessness, Price said. With more than 60,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, encampments have gone up throughout the region on sidewalks, in empty lots and under freeway overpasses. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a panic situation along with a pandemic situation. Folks on the streets are just suffering,‚Äù Price told the Los Angeles Times. ‚ÄúWe have to do a better job of housing individuals who are homeless.‚Äù\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Department of Public Health and Environment has routinely deleted emails related to the coronavirus pandemic even though the state archives has asked that they be saved, a newspaper has found. The Denver Post reports it discovered that emails sent and received by state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy were deleted after the newspaper requested documents. The department said it would provide some records, including emails. But it said emails ‚Äúfrom May would have already been auto-deleted unless otherwise preserved, or they were previously deleted by Dr. Herlihy as part of a normal business process,‚Äù said Monica Wilkerson, the department‚Äôs records and legal services liaison. As of last year, the department deleted most employee emails after 90 days. The policy mirrors similar practices by the state government. The Colorado State Archives posted a notice in June asking agencies to ‚Äúkeep all records related to COVID-19.‚Äù Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition Executive Director Jeff Roberts said it is important to keep records so that journalists can report on a crisis affecting the health and safety of residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Canaan: More than 350 students and 20 teachers in a wealthy suburb are in quarantine after a new round of coronavirus testing turned up 15 infections, according to the local school district. New Canaan schools on Tuesday reported 13 students and two teachers tested positive, days after all 540 tests of students came back negative, the Stamford Advocate reports. There were also 26 new positive tests last weekend, First Selectman Kevin Moynihan said. ‚ÄúWe continue to see cases spread from gatherings, dinner parties, out-of-town caregivers, house cleaners and, not unexpectedly, within families,‚Äù Moynihan said. ‚ÄúThis rapid case increase over the weekend illustrates how fast community transmission spreads and accelerates.‚Äù The most recent testing resulted in quarantines for 213 students at New Canaan High School, 70 at Saxe Middle School and 70 at three elementary schools. People in quarantine are told they must stay home for 14 days.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Attorneys for a cleric say they‚Äôve reached a settlement with Gov. John Carney over the coronavirus restrictions he imposed on worship services. The Rev. Christopher Allan Bullock filed a lawsuit in May claiming Carney‚Äôs restrictions were unconstitutional and discriminatory. Carney then rescinded many of the restrictions, and his lawyers argued Bullock‚Äôs claims were moot. But Bullock‚Äôs attorneys asked for an injunction prohibiting the governor from imposing similar limitations in the future. Lawyers representing the New Castle County pastor and community activist said Wednesday that the settlement requires the governor to treat houses of worship in a neutral manner in any future emergency. Among other things, if certain businesses or activities are considered essential, that definition will include churches. Attorney Thomas Neuberger said the state also agreed to pay the plaintiffs $150,000 in lawyer fees and $7,200 in court costs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. reported 206 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday ‚Äì its highest single-day total since late May, WUSA-TV reports. Daily test data lags behind and is only available up to Nov. 7, so it‚Äôs unclear what, if any, connection to the weekend‚Äôs celebrations these numbers may have. The city is now averaging more than 100 new cases a day for the first time since May 30.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than a dozen Miami nurses and front-line health care workers are finally getting a well-deserved break. The group was scheduled for an upcoming, mandatory ‚Äì aka boring ‚Äì 48-hour training but was instead surprised with an island vacation to the Florida Keys. Jackson Health System supervisors were asked to choose staff who went above and beyond during the pandemic. Many of the staff, including respiratory therapists and lab techs, have not been able to take any time off during the pandemic to relax or spend time with their loved ones and have been working tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients, the hospital said. The 50 workers were told they had to attend a two-day training, but when they gathered at the hospital Tuesday, they were handed gift boxes with gift certificates. Hawks Cay Resort in the Florida Keys donated two-night stays to its island on Duck Key, surrounded by sparkling waters and swaying palm trees, as part of its Heroes Salute program.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is again hitting a new peak in public high school graduation rates. The state Department of Education said Tuesday that 83.8% of seniors graduated on time in the spring. That‚Äôs the highest level recorded since Georgia began calculating according to current methods, which require a student to graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma, and rose from 82% in 2019. The state says part of the increase came from a waiver allowing the state to count students with significant cognitive disabilities, about 1% of students overall, as graduating on time even if they take more than four years to complete high school. Because of the pandemic, many high school students did not have to take end-of-course exams last year, which would have counted for 20% of their overall grade. Most students take the courses that require the exams before their senior year, so it‚Äôs unclear whether the lack of tests influenced Georgia‚Äôs graduation rates.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Bankruptcies declined in October for the eighth time in 10 months as state unemployment reached a national high of 15.1% and as tourism was in the beginning stage of reopening after a major economic downturn. There were 125 bankruptcy filings in October, a 22.6% decrease from the 162 during the same period in the previous year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Data provided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, showed bankruptcy filings were down 9.8% to 1,274 for the year through October compared to 1,412 during the same period in 2019. Chapter 7 liquidation filings, the most common type of bankruptcy, fell 19.8% in October to 93 from 116 in the year-earlier period. Chapter 13 filings, which allow people with regular income sources to establish installment payment plans to creditors over three to five years, dropped 27.3% to 32 from 44 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge dismissed a case against a woman who was cited for holding a yard sale authorities said violated the state‚Äôs coronavirus stay-at-home order. Judge Van Valin on Friday dismissed the case brought by officials who said the yard sale was not an ‚Äúessential business,‚Äù The Idaho Statesman reports. Valin ruled the yard sale conducted in April by Christa Thompson of Rathdrum was not a business. Defense attorney Edward Dindinger said in a statement that the judge ruled the language of the stay-at-home order issued in response to the coronavirus pandemic did not apply to Thompson. The Rathdrum Police Department said in April that the event was a ‚Äúlarge nonessential yard sale‚Äù that filled the front yard and spilled into the back yard of her home. Thompson held the sale ‚Äúto liquidate her late father-in-law‚Äôs estate,‚Äù Dindinger said. Thompson faced a possible sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state set another single-day record for coronavirus infections Tuesday, pushing the total number of people who have tested positive in the state since the pandemic began past 500,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker presented statistics to show that hospitalizations are nearing their spring peak, when the initial wave of infections had officials scrambling for hospital beds and professionals to tend them. State public health officials reported 12,623 newly confirmed cases of the virus, nearly 15% higher than the previous record set Saturday, when cases also topped 12,000. In Chicago, officials reported a daily average of 1,686 new cases, roughly four times higher than a month ago. ‚ÄúThere are no signs of slowing,‚Äù Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said. Hospitalizations jumped 7.5% in one day to 4,742. The seven-day average of 4,207 in hospital beds is creeping toward the 4,822 average hit May 5.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is continuing its record-setting increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new infections, health officials said Tuesday as the state once again surpassed 4,000 new cases and reported 63 more deaths. The newly reported deaths raised Indiana‚Äôs pandemic death toll to 4,731, including confirmed and presumed coronavirus infections, the Indiana State Department of Health said in its daily statistics update. The 4,879 infections reported Tuesday were Indiana‚Äôs second-highest daily count of newly reported coronavirus cases and marked the sixth straight day the state reported more than 4,000 new cases. Indiana‚Äôs seven-day rolling average for newly confirmed cases rose to 4,490, according to Tuesday‚Äôs daily update of the state‚Äôs coronavirus dashboard. That is the highest level Indiana has seen during the pandemic and more than five times the seven-day rolling average of 858 newly confirmed cases the agency reported Sept. 22.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two more state prisons are reporting outbreaks of coronavirus infections, according to the Iowa Department of Corrections. Recent testing has revealed outbreaks at prisons in Clarinda, where 377 inmates and 16 staff members are positive, and Rockwell City, where 254 inmates and four staff members are positive, a DOC report updated Sunday shows. The Clarinda prison has about 900 inmates, and Rockwell City has 426. The department released data Friday showing an outbreak at the Anamosa prison, and the updated numbers show 485 infected inmates of the 982 inmates at the prison. An additional 50 staff members tested positive. Additional smaller prison outbreaks are reported at Mount Pleasant, where 18 inmates and five staff members are positive, and the women‚Äôs prison in Mitchellville, where four inmates and 10 staff members are positive.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state‚Äôs largest public school district, in Wichita, has scrapped plans to allow its middle and high school students to attend some in-person classes, and three counties have imposed new restrictions inspired by the coronavirus pandemic. The moves by local officials come as the state works to expand its overall testing capacity so under a ‚Äúunified‚Äù statewide strategy announced by Gov. Laura Kelly in late September. The strategy calls for regular testing of at-risk populations, including first responders, prison inmates, nursing home residents, and K-12 students and staff, as well as more aggressive testing in virus hot spots. The state plans to spend at least $53 million in federal coronavirus relief funds on contracts with private laboratories. But Kelly said Tuesday during a Statehouse news conference: ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt work if people are not abiding by the other safety protocols, particularly wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings.‚Äù\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentuckians should avoid large Thanksgiving gatherings as a safeguard to protect extended family and friends from a surging COVID-19 outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Instead, in-person get-togethers should be limited to people from the same household, he said. While the health guidelines might be tough to swallow, the guidance can save lives as Kentucky struggles with its worst outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic governor said. ‚ÄúThat person that you may think that you will really miss sitting across the table from you this year, I want to make sure is across the table from you next year,‚Äù Beshear said at a news conference. ‚ÄúAnd this right now is the most dangerous time we‚Äôve had in this virus.‚Äù The Thanksgiving guidance came as the state reported 2,120 new virus cases ‚Äì its highest total for a Tuesday and fifth-highest day overall, Beshear said. He also reported 14 more virus-related deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Shoppers will see state sales taxes suspended for two days this month, under a bill passed by lawmakers in their latest special session and signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, a Gonzales Republican, sponsored the measure to help residents and businesses recovering from hurricanes Laura and Delta and coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The state sales tax holiday will be held Nov. 20-21. Louisiana‚Äôs 4.45% state sales tax will not be charged on the first $2,500 of a purchase. The holiday doesn‚Äôt cover car, truck and other vehicle purchases. And it doesn‚Äôt apply to local sales taxes. The state is estimated to lose $4.5 million in sales tax collections because of the tax holiday, according to a nonpartisan financial analysis of the bill.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers plan to hold their first legislative sessions at the Augusta Civic Center instead of the Statehouse as coronavirus cases grow. The city-owned, 49,000-square-foot civic center, about 3 miles from the Statehouse, is typically used for events such as concerts, agriculture conventions and conferences. It would provide more space than the Statehouse, and that would make it easier to observe social distancing, a spokeswoman for outgoing Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon told the Portland Press Herald. The full Legislature last met in March. The top priority for lawmakers will be crafting a new, two-year state budget at a time when Maine‚Äôs finances have been stressed by the pandemic. New Hampshire lawmakers took a similar approach in June when they met in the University of New Hampshire Whittemore Center Arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will reduce indoor operations for bars and restaurants from 75% to 50% in response to rising coronavirus cases and increased hospitalizations, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday. The new limits took effect Wednesday. ‚ÄúLast week, I said that the warning lights were starting to blink on the dashboard and that it appeared we were approaching a critical turning point in the fight. Today, I‚Äôm reporting that we have now crossed over into the danger zone,‚Äù Hogan said at a news conference. ‚ÄúToo many residents and businesses have COVID fatigue and have begun letting their guard down.‚Äù State health officials also have issued a public health advisory effective immediately to strongly discourage indoor gatherings of 25 people or more at family gatherings or house parties. Contact tracing data has shown an increase in cases resulting from such gatherings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases could force the state to once again open field hospitals to care for a possible overflow of patients as intensive care units fill up, Gov. Charlie Baker warned Tuesday. Hospitals are also prepared to make an additional 400 beds available for COVID-19 patients by converting acute care beds to ICU beds to deal with an expected rise in cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus during the fall and winter, Baker said at a press conference. ‚ÄúThe trends obviously are going in the wrong direction and show no signs of changing,‚Äù he said. When and where field hospitals might be set up depends on space and need, Baker said. Massachusetts residents had done a good job controlling the virus after an initial spike in the spring but are getting careless and allowing the virus to get a toehold again, leading to a second surge, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state on Tuesday posted a record number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases, near 6,500, and reported 59 deaths within the previous 24 hours ‚Äì its deadliest day in six months. COVID-19, which subsided over the summer after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer imposed sweeping stay-at-home and other restrictions, has rebounded this fall. Asked if she might again order people to stay home, the Democrat said she was talking with the state health department about potential next steps. Mask requirements and gathering limits remain in effect despite a ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù state Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a law she used to issue orders, she said. Whitmer said she will not see extended family in person for Thanksgiving and said it is ‚Äúinherently dangerous‚Äù to have more than one household in an enclosed space without ventilation and open windows. The state‚Äôs latest average positivity rate is 9.4%, up from 4.9% two weeks ago.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials reported a record 56 new deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said. Walz told Minnesota Public Radio the daily report shows positivity rates above 20%, an important measure of how fast the disease is spreading. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Minnesota has nearly doubled over the past two weeks from just under 7% on Oct. 27 to nearly 13% on Tuesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. The governor made the comments a day after warning Minnesotans that the state is approaching the worst phase of the pandemic and that conditions will get dramatically worse unless people start changing their behavior. He said it won‚Äôt be unusual for people to open their newspapers and see 50 to 60 new deaths. ‚ÄúThis is just inevitable if we do not change our behaviors and take some mitigation efforts.‚Äù Walz told MPR. Minnesota‚Äôs previous record was 36 deaths, reported Friday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he, his wife and their three daughters are in isolation after the youngest tested positive for the coronavirus. Maddie Reeves, 8, attends a private elementary school in Jackson. The Republican governor said in a social media post: ‚ÄúShe feels OK, but could still use prayers! Please pray for her momma too!‚Äù Reeves also said everyone in his family is being tested for the virus. The governor announced his daughter‚Äôs infection shortly after he canceled his coronavirus news conference that was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. An executive order issued by Reeves requires children and teachers to wear masks in public and private schools. Sixteen of Mississippi‚Äôs 82 counties have been under a mask mandate that was set to expire Wednesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nO‚ÄôFallon: Twenty-eight employees of an election board have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, and a director believes they most likely got infected from voters, though local health officials aren‚Äôt convinced. The Jackson County Election Board‚Äôs Republican director, Tammy Brown, said Tuesday that eight full-time and 20 part-time employees tested positive for the virus in the past 21/ 2 weeks. Most are doing well and recovering at home, but two are hospitalized, including one in intensive care, Brown said. Jackson County is Missouri‚Äôs second-largest county, behind St. Louis County. While Kansas City is part of Jackson County, the city has its own election board. The Jackson County board handled votes cast by nearly 200,000 people. Jackson County Health Department spokeswoman Kayla Parker said community transmission is so widespread that determining the source would be next to impossible.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the state‚Äôs chief epidemiologist said the spread of the coronavirus has stressed medical services to the brink, and he predicted the situation will get worse as winter sets in. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre kind of preparing for the worst here,‚Äù Jim Murphy said. ‚ÄúWe have pretty spooky numbers for COVID, going into a fall respiratory season. It‚Äôs not a position that anybody would like to be in.‚Äù Murphy said the increase in cases across the state has led to a shortage in health care workers, in addition to a shortage in hospital beds. ‚ÄúYou can have a lot of beds. But if you don‚Äôt have the staff to support those beds, that‚Äôs a problem,‚Äù he said. U.S. officials have dispatched a team of nearly 30 physicians, nurses, paramedics and other health care workers to Montana‚Äôs largest city. The National Disaster Medical System team arrived Friday and will work in Billings for two weeks, The Billings Gazette reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to set records with the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and health care providers expect that to continue because of the recent surge of cases. Cliff Robertson, CEO of CHI Health, said his group of 14 hospitals in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa is preparing for COVID-19 cases to keep increasing over the next three to four weeks. He said COVID-19 patients already account for about 25% of all the patients in his hospitals. ‚ÄúWe highly encourage folks to take this seriously because ‚Ä¶ this virus is rampant in our community right now,‚Äù Robertson said. The steady increase in cases raises the concern that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist at Nebraska Medicine in Omaha. ‚ÄúIn three weeks‚Äô time, our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and we will no longer be able to deliver optimal and effective care for COVID, and we will also no longer be able to deliver appropriate care for everyone who comes in with a heart attack or a stroke.‚Äù\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Although the coronavirus is spreading at record rates, the state will not need to tighten restrictions if individuals commit to preventive measures like mask-wearing and working from home, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday. For the third time in three weeks, the governor referred to ‚Äúalarming trends‚Äù and said Nevada was almost at the point where stricter measures would be necessary. But unlike in the past, when he has hesitated to commit to benchmarks or timelines, he provided a deadline: If Nevada doesn‚Äôt show signs that it‚Äôs containing the virus in two weeks, he will be forced to tighten the state‚Äôs prevention measures. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have to go out, don‚Äôt go out. Reduce your time in public to what is necessary, and limit any and all exposures to those outside your household,‚Äù Sisolak said. ‚ÄúThink about changes like ordering groceries for delivery instead of going into the store, or picking up dinner curbside.‚Äù\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAmherst: Officials say an Election Day voter at a polling place tested positive for the coronavirus, but the town had safety precautions in place. WMUR-TV reports town officials in Amherst said they were notified by the state that a voter tested positive for the virus. They said the infected person was at Souhegan High School between 10:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. on Election Day. Amherst town moderator Steve Coughlan said it wasn‚Äôt crowded. The town is now contacting election volunteers who may have had direct contact with the voter. Coughlan said plexiglass shields separated voters from election workers. Volunteers had to wear masks, but voters did not. ‚ÄúI think we provided a very safe environment,‚Äù Coughlan said. ‚ÄúIt would be crazy for us to have thought that there would be zero infected voters out of everyone coming in. So we took precautions that were appropriate.‚Äù\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The family of the state‚Äôs first law enforcement officer to die from COVID-19 has filed a claim to sue Hudson County, saying he did not receive any masks or other personal protective equipment while working at the county jail. Bernard Waddell Sr., a corrections officer with 32 years of experience, was forced to work within close proximity to inmates who he believed were infected, said family lawyer Paul da Costa. ‚ÄúUp to his last day on the job, he was not provided with any PPE,‚Äù da Costa said. The virus devastated the jail in Kearny. Along with Waddell, it claimed the lives of two nurses, a commissary director and another corrections officer. Waddell, 56, died April 1. The Jersey City resident is survived by his wife and two sons. Around the time of his death, New Jersey was experiencing a severe shortage of face masks and gowns, prompting hospitals to ask the public for donations.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Santa Fe Public Schools is ending a short-lived soft opening of in-person learning as the coronavirus pandemic hobbles the state. ‚ÄúI am announcing today a hiatus of our volunteer hybrid program due to the rampant rise in COVID-19 cases in Santa Fe County and New Mexico and SFPS‚Äô philosophy to always prioritize the safety and well being of our students and staff,‚Äù Superintendent Veronica Garcia said. The volunteers included 58 teachers who went to work despite the pandemic, enabling about 200 elementary students to attend school in person at least part of the week. The program started Oct. 26 and will hold the last day of classes Nov. 20. ‚ÄúIf parents are able to keep their children home next week, I urge them to do so,‚Äù Garcia said. The announcement comes as the state sets records for COVID-19 cases amid dwindling space in hospitals and as students are failing classes at much higher rates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. across the state in the latest effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. He said people will also be barred from hosting private gatherings with more than 10 people. Cuomo said the new restrictions, which go into effect Friday, are necessary because new coronavirus infections have been traced to those types of activities. Businesses can reopen each morning. ‚ÄúBars, restaurants, gyms, house parties ‚Äì that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs coming from, primarily,‚Äù Cuomo said. The governor spoke as rates of coronavirus infection continued to rise. He said 1,628 people were hospitalized across the state for COVID-19 on Tuesday, and 21 people died. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing is what they predicted for months,‚Äù Cuomo said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state will remain paused in its current reopening plan for an additional three weeks, with indoor gathering limits reduced from 25 people to 10 people starting Friday. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced the tightening of gathering restrictions during a Tuesday news conference. The decision not to further reopen ahead of Thanksgiving comes at a time when the state is concerned about increases it has seen in COVID-19 cases and the percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive. ‚ÄúThe science shows that the transmission of this virus is much greater indoors, and the more people are gathered, the easier this virus can spread,‚Äù Cooper said. Cooper, who won reelection last week, noted that churches and restaurants would be unaffected by the updated guidance. The executive order will remain in place until Dec. 4.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state continues to lead the nation in daily new coronavirus cases per capita, with 1 in 83 residents testing positive in just the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. In the past two weeks, there were 2,265 new cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. State health officials reported a dozen new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus Wednesday, down from a record 30 deaths Tuesday. The deaths reported Wednesday increased total fatalities to 696 since the pandemic began. The report said 123 deaths have occurred in November, matching all of September. October has been the deadliest month so far in North Dakota, with 292 deaths. State health officials reported 1,039 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and a daily positivity rate of more than 18% for the second straight day.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine beseeched Ohioans on Wednesday to take the surging coronavirus spread seriously, issuing new orders on mask enforcement in businesses, limiting gatherings across the state, and threatening to close bars, restaurants and fitness centers if cases continue to rise. ‚ÄúThroughout our country‚Äôs history, each generation has faced unique sacrifices,‚Äù DeWine said in the statewide address. ‚ÄúToday, we all must do something far less dramatic but very important: Wear a mask so your friends and family members can live.‚Äù DeWine shifted the authority of mask enforcement from the local counties to the state. The Ohio Bureau of Workers‚Äô Compensation will be responsible for inspections across the 88 counties. If a business receives more than one violation, it will have to close for 24 hours. ‚ÄúWe must do this to protect our front-line workers,‚Äù DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of people hospitalized with confirmed and probable coronavirus in the state shattered the previous one-day record by nearly 200 on Wednesday, and more than 2,100 new cases were reported, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The department reported 1,248 hospitalizations to surpass the previous record of 1,055 set last Thursday. The department reported 2,177 new cases and 19 additional deaths since Tuesday for totals of 142,334 cases and 1,470 deaths since the pandemic began in March. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven‚Äôt been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day average of the percentage of people who tested positive has risen from 9% to nearly 16% in Oklahoma, and the average number of new cases each day increased from 1265.8 per day to 1,947.3.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown and state health officials warned Tuesday of the capacity challenges facing hospitals as COVID-19 case counts continue to spike. The Oregon Health Authority recorded a record 285 confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospitals Tuesday ‚Äì a 57% increase in just the past week and an 83% increase in the past four weeks. ‚ÄúThere are limitations to what Oregon‚Äôs health care system can handle,‚Äù said Dana Hargunani, the health authority‚Äôs chief medical officer. ‚ÄúEven with regional planning and the hard work of all of our hospital partners, we cannot handle ever-growing high daily case counts and widespread hospitalizations.‚Äù Currently out of Oregon‚Äôs 703 listed intensive care unit beds, 27% are available, and about 18% of non-ICU adult hospital beds in the state are available, based on data on from the health authority‚Äôs website. ‚ÄúOur fear that this virus would spread out of control as the colder months set in is now becoming a frightening reality,‚Äù Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city‚Äôs public school students will continue to attend classes virtually for the foreseeable future, district officials announced Tuesday. The announcement came on the same day Philadelphia public health officials saw a peak in confirmed virus cases and increased hospitalizations. The school district had planned to begin bringing back younger students for a hybrid in-person instruction model starting Nov. 30, with plans to phase in instruction for students with complex instructional needs and then older students next. ‚ÄúWe hope to see these students back in school before the spring,‚Äù Philadelphia district Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said, adding that it would ultimately depend on health experts and infection trends. About one-third of parents with students who would have been eligible to return had opted for in-person, part-time instruction that would have put students in classrooms two days a week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Employees of the state Senate are being told to work from home after three workers tested positive for the coronavirus, state officials said. The Senate‚Äôs roughly 50 workers were instructed to start working remotely Monday after three staffers tested positive over the weekend, The Providence Journal reports. They were told to work remotely for two weeks. The directive came from Gov. Gina Raimondo. Senate spokesman Greg Pare said the Senate president is ‚Äúfollowing that guidance and wants to do all he can to keep Senate staff members safe.‚Äù The House said it has no plans to shift to remote work. The new cases in the Senate were reported as the General Assembly looks for ways to gather for its first full sessions since July. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio previously said he is exploring whether meetings can be held at the Rhode Island Convention Center.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials in the state‚Äôs largest school district say the number of students who received an F in at least one class tripled this year, as the district adjusted learning because of the coronavirus pandemic. First-quarter report cards show a little more than 16,000 students in Greenville County Schools had an F. That compares to roughly 5,300 students with at least one failing grade in the first quarter last year. The pandemic has limited in-person teaching for the district‚Äôs 75,000 students, and Associate Superintendent of Academics Jeff McCoy said that likely was a factor in the jump in Fs. He also cited the stress of the crisis on families and the emergency shutdown of schools in the spring. Still, the district wasn‚Äôt expecting such a big increase in the number of struggling students. McCoy said the report cards show a much larger proportion of virtual students are receiving failing grades compared to in-person students.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The mayor cast the tie-breaking vote that defeated a proposed mask mandate in the state‚Äôs largest city Tuesday night. After more than two hours of public comment, Mayor Paul TenHaken rejected the mandate after the City Council tied 4-4 on the ordinance. The mandate would have required face coverings to be worn by people in most indoor public places where 6-foot social distancing was not achievable. Violations carried a $50 fine. ‚ÄúI believe the small uptick we‚Äôll see in compliance is not worth the community division that this will create,‚Äù TenHaken said as he ended debate. Councilor Greg Neitzert said he did not want to live in a city where people are calling the police because someone isn‚Äôt wearing a mask. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just about health,‚Äù Neitzert said. ‚ÄúWe also have to look at principles.‚Äù The Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce opposed it. Several faith leaders in the city supported the mandate.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that he‚Äôs looking to include ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù teacher pay raises in next year‚Äôs budget despite facing financial crunches brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee had originally proposed funneling an additional $117 million to K-12 teacher salaries earlier this year before the virus outbreak began rippling across the state. If approved, the starting minimum annual salary for teachers would have increased from $36,000 to $40,000 over the next two years. Yet months later, Lee was forced to strip the teacher funding boost, as well as many other budget initiatives, as officials braced for funding shortfalls. However, Tennessee‚Äôs revenues have come in slightly higher than originally projected over the past three months, allowing Lee‚Äôs administration to remain slightly optimistic that it will be able to fund some new measures rather than have to dip into rainy day funds.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state has become the first with more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases as the nation continues to face a surge of infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University early Wednesday. The nation‚Äôs second-most populous state has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases with 19,337 deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to the count on the Johns Hopkins website. Texas recorded 10,865 new cases Tuesday, setting a new daily record that surpassed by 74 cases an old mark set July 15, state officials said. According to state figures Tuesday, an estimated 132,146 cases are active, the most since Aug. 17, and 6,170 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, the most since Aug. 18. There were 94 new deaths Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Meanwhile, cases of the coronavirus are surging in the Laredo area, health officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A group of teachers has organized an event to encourage educators across the state to call in sick and use the day off to get tested for the coronavirus amid a surge in confirmed infection cases. ‚ÄúThere are no testing requirements for teachers or students currently,‚Äù Granite School District teacher Lindsay Plummer said. Some teachers believe the ‚Äútest out‚Äù planned for Thursday will prompt state leaders to do more to limit the spread of COVID-19 and increase safety protocols in classrooms, FOX13 reports. Plummer said the group was inspired to act following remarks made by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert on Sunday, when he put in place a statewide mask mandate. ‚ÄúThe goal of doing something like this is we want to push them to do more,‚Äù she said. The Utah Education Association said it is aware of event but is urging teachers to be patient. Herbert‚Äôs office has said all teachers have universal access to testing.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state on Tuesday suspended a program that allowed people from across the Northeast to visit Vermont without quarantining if they come from a county with a low rate of coronavirus infection. Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that the number of counties eligible ‚Äì listed on a map that uses red, orange and green to indicate eligibility ‚Äì has continued to shrink. As of Tuesday only two counties between Maine and Ohio were listed as green. ‚ÄúThe fact is, along with social gatherings, travel to and from other states without the proper quarantine continues to be one of the common denominators in our rising case counts,‚Äù Scott said. Essential travel ‚Äì such as work, school, medical care, personal safety, shared child custody or buying groceries ‚Äì is not affected, but people should only do what they need to do and then return home, he said. Vermont determined eligible counties as those with virus rates of less than 400 cases per million residents.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday announced plans to significantly increase statewide testing capacity and to launch a media campaign in southwest Virginia, which has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past month. The moves came three days after Virginia reported 2,103 new cases ‚Äì its biggest single-day increase in new cases since the start of the pandemic. On Tuesday, the state reported 1,435 new cases. The state‚Äôs seven-day moving average of new cases is 1,462. The seven-day testing positivity rate has also climbed from just under 5% a few weeks ago to 6.2% on Tuesday. Since the start of the pandemic, the state has recorded a total of 194,192 cases, with 3,726 deaths. Northam said he is focusing on mitigation efforts and continuing to encourage people to wear masks and practice social distancing. He said he is not currently considering ordering new restrictions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two hospitals near the city are struggling with COVID-19 outbreaks within the facilities. The Auburn Medical Center reported at least five employees and eight patients tested positive for the coronavirus, after an outbreak on a fourth-floor unit. The hospital said in a statement Tuesday that one patient died after the outbreak was detected late last week, The Seattle Times reports. The MultiCare hospital system, which owns the hospital, tested all 40 patients in the unit and 212 staffers who had worked there in the two-week period before the first positive test was reported, officials said. At St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton, at least six people have been infected since early November. CHI Franciscan, the hospital system that owns St. Michael, announced Tuesday that four patients and two employees have been infected to date. State health officials have reported 350 outbreaks in health care settings, including hospitals, since Oct. 24, a statewide outbreak report said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new high of 642 coronavirus cases Wednesday and seven deaths as the pandemic continued its march into rural enclaves. There are 277 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, slightly down from the peak of 290 last week. A total of 553 deaths have been linked to COVID-19. Virus-related deaths have increased 45% in the past month. The daily positivity rate is up to 5.9%, the highest it has been in about two months. ‚ÄúThe enemy is at our borders, and the enemy is coming at us right now,‚Äù Gov. Jim Justice said at a press briefing. Twenty-five counties had the most severe designation of virus spread, with 25 or more cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said all options are on the table for bringing new travel and business restrictions, but nothing is planned yet. ‚ÄúLegally, I can‚Äôt go out and start arresting people‚Äù for not wearing masks, Justice said in urging people to follow guidelines and get tested for the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers renewed his pleas Tuesday for people to stay home to avoid the coronavirus in an unusual prime-time speech hours after the state set new records for infections and deaths. The governor announced he was advising people to stay in their houses and businesses to allow people to work remotely, requiring masks, and limiting the number of people in stores and offices. He said projections show that if nothing changes, deaths could double to 5,000 by January. Evers has been imploring people to stay home and wear masks for months during twice-weekly afternoon news conferences to little avail. This time his office streamed his remarks live on his Facebook page and YouTube channel. ‚ÄúSo I want to be clear tonight: Each day this virus goes unchecked is a setback for our economic recovery,‚Äù Evers said. Republicans and their conservative allies have worked to block every Evers initiative to stop the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The son of a state representative who opposed COVID-19 public restrictions said his father was positive for the coronavirus when he died. Roy Edwards, 66, died Nov. 2 at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper after being hospitalized for more than a week with illness that was not immediately disclosed, The Gillette News Record reports. Edwards continued to oppose public restrictions resulting from the pandemic during his recent campaign to retain his House seat. He was reelected the day after he died. Mitch Edwards said his father initially experienced minor virus symptoms. He was told by a medical professional that he had sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinuses, and did not need to be tested for COVID-19. Roy Edwards was not advised to quarantine, but he did so as a a precaution, Mitch Edwards said. His symptoms worsened, and he had trouble breathing Oct. 23, when he again sought medical attention.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2016/01/21/judge-reverses-arbitrators-finding-lot-rent-case/79078308/", "title": "Judge reverses arbitrator's finding in lot-rent case", "text": "James Fisher\n\nThe News Journal\n\nFor the second time in two years, a Superior Court judge ruled the owner of Bon Ayre, a Smyrna manufactured home neighborhood, raised lot rents above a cost of living-guided cap without giving a valid reason for the above-average increases.\n\nKent County judge William L. Witham, in a Jan. 12 ruling, overturned the earlier decision of an independent arbitrator who had found the rent increases justified because lot rents in other Delaware manufactured home communities rose.\n\nWitham, though, said landlords cannot rely solely on \"market rent\" factors to justify raising lot rent. They also must show their costs for \"operating, maintaining, or improving\" the community have gone up, Witham ruled, citing language in a 2013 law that added new limits on lot-rent hikes. Since Bon Ayre Land LLC, the company that owns the development, did not try to show its expenses had gone up, Witham said, the arbitrator was wrong to allow the rent to be hiked.\n\nFor residents of the 194-home Bon Ayre neighborhood, the ruling is a welcome respite, but it doesn't end their legal battles with Bon Ayre Land. In a separate case, Witham sided with residents who had opposed an earlier attempt to hike rents above the consumer price index in 2014. Bon Ayre Land appealed that ruling, issued in February 2015, to the Delaware Supreme Court, which will hear arguments about it next month.\n\nMilton Stroup, the vice president of the homeowners group Bon Ayre Community Association, said there have been nine sets of disputed rent hikes that went to arbitration since the law was passed.\n\nBon Ayre Land is represented in the courts by a Wilmington personal injury lawyer, L. Vincent Ramunno, who is also the company's registered agent. Ramunno's family owns the company that owns the development, he said.\n\nIn an interview, Ramunno said Witham's rulings show the law in question, the Rent Justification Act, is unfair, vague and leads to \"gotcha\" decisions that punish landowners for \"hypertechnical\" failures to follow its rules.\n\n\"The statute, frankly, it's very unfair as applied,\" Ramunno said. \"It's a gotcha decision rather than on the merits.\"\n\nJoan Peculski, a Bon Ayre resident, said she was pleased with the ruling. \"Nobody is saying he‚Äôs not entitled to make a buck, but this is too much,\" Peculski said.\n\nAG settles suit with operators of Bon Ayre\n\nThe Rent Justification Act requires landowners seeking to raise rents beyond a certain yardstick ‚Äî the past three years' change in a federal consumer price index ‚Äî to justify them if homeowners protest.\n\nBon Ayre Land \"argues that market rent is sufficient as a stand alone element under the statute to justify a rental increase,\" Witham's opinion said. The company pointed to that argument in defending rent increase notices sent to three tenants amounting to 14.3 percent hikes in monthly rent, from $349 to $399, and another tenant's notice that floated a 22.6 percent hike, from $309 to $379. At the time, any increases greater than 1.6 percent were eligible to be challenged in arbitration.\n\n\"These are the types of rent increases the statute seeks to avoid,\" Witham said in his ruling. The law, he said, requires a landowner to show its operating or maintenance costs are rising to justify an over-the-limit rent hike, which Bon Ayre Land didn't do. Witham also ruled that Bon Ayre Land didn't produce enough evidence that other communities' rents were on the rise to justify the \"market rent\" part of its argument.\n\nMany manufactured housing residents come to feel their landlords have significant leverage over them. It is expensive and complicated to move a mobile home once it's been settled on a leased lot in a landlord's community, so there's pressure to agree to terms in signing new lot rent leases. Delaware's attorney general, Matt Denn, is suing one manufactured community owner, Hometown America, over allegations it pressured residents into waiving their rights to arbitrate proposed rent hikes. Witham, in his opinion, said community owners have \"disproportionate power in setting rental rates once a home owner has placed his manufactured home on a lot.\"\n\nIt's also true that many community owners are frequent campaign donors. A political action committee supporting their industry, First State Manufactured Housing PAC, took in more than $21,000 in donations from 51 givers in 2015, according to state records. A PAC representing their tenants, meanwhile, went defunct in 2014.\n\nBut Ramunno said he believes landowners like himself draw the short straw in dealing with the General Assembly when it comes to lot-rent issues.\n\n\"I will ask them to, if they want to be equitable about it, to change the statute or at least make it clear,\" Ramunno said of the General Assembly. \"But I'm just one person. There are thousands of these tenants who just swarm the legislature.\"\n\nPeculski disagreed. \"He has unlimited resources, and he is a very powerful man in Delaware,\" she said of Ramunno. \"But that shouldn't stop what's right.\"\n\nContact James Fisher at (302) 983-6772, on Twitter @JamesFisherTNJ or jfisher@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/09/politics/gun-control-second-amendment-supreme-court-bruen-fallout/index.html", "title": "How the Supreme Court put gun control laws in jeopardy nationwide", "text": "CNN ‚Äî\n\nIt did not take long for top gun rights activists to realize that the Second Amendment ruling handed down by the Supreme Court in June was going to transform the legal fight over access to firearms.\n\nDudley Brown, the president of the National Association for Gun Rights, said the realization started to come when he received a phone call from another executive at his organization minutes after the decision was released.\n\n‚ÄúHe had just scanned through it. He said, ‚ÄòYou won‚Äôt believe what this decision says. it‚Äôs way better than what we ever hoped for,‚Äô‚Äù Brown told CNN. Brown was coincidentally at the time walking by the Supreme Court, trekking between Senate and House offices as part of a lobbying push against new gun legislation being considered in the wake a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.\n\n‚ÄúQuickly, we knew this was something that was going to change the landscape,‚Äù Brown said.\n\nIn the three months since the 6-3 decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, scores of new lawsuits have been filed against gun restrictions at the federal, state and local levels.\n\nThough the Supreme Court case concerned a type of gun permitting regime embraced by just a handful of states, the conservative majority used the Bruen decision to provide new instructions for how courts are to assess the constitutionality of gun laws nationwide.\n\nThe decision was the first major Supreme Court guns ruling in more than a decade, and it came after Justice Clarence Thomas ‚Äì who authored the majority opinion ‚Äì had previously complained that the high court had allowed the Second Amendment to be treated as a ‚Äúa disfavored right.‚Äù\n\nSince the June ruling, federal judges in at least a half-dozen different cases have already cited the Bruen decision to rule against gun restrictions that have included local assault weapons bans, prohibitions on the manufacture of homemade firearms and bans on older teenagers publicly carrying handguns.\n\nSeveral other laws now face new legal challenges under the precedent, among them zoning restrictions barring shooting ranges, licensing and training laws and the federal ban on certain misdemeanor offenders from possessing firearms.\n\n‚ÄúThe much more consequential thing about Bruen is that the court actually went further and did a little bit more than it needed to do and articulated an entirely new framework for how Second Amendment challenges are decided,‚Äù said Andrew Willinger, the executive director of Duke Center for Firearms Law.\n\nWhat the Supreme Court told judges to do\n\nThe case the Supreme Court decided last term was a challenge to the New York state system of approving licenses for gun owners to publicly carry their weapons. By a 6-3 vote, the justices said the rules ‚Äì in which government officials had some discretion in deciding whether an applicant would be granted a license ‚Äì violated the Second Amendment.\n\nBut what extended the reach of the ruling beyond the roughly half dozen states with similar licensing procedures was what Thomas said about how courts should decide whether gun limits comply with the Second Amendment.\n\nThomas said that the only regulations that can be deemed constitutional are ones don‚Äôt encroach on conduct plainly covered by the Second Amendment‚Äôs text and that are ‚Äúconsistent with this Nation‚Äôs historical tradition‚Äù ‚Äì meaning they have a parallel in the type of regulations in place at the time of the Constitution‚Äôs framing.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer, writing for the three liberal dissenters, wrote that this approach was ‚Äúdeeply impractical‚Äù and that it imposed ‚Äúa task on the lower courts that judges cannot easily accomplish.‚Äù\n\nBefore the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling, lower courts were coalescing around an approach that weighed the burden a restriction put on gun rights against the rationale the government had for implementing the law. The flurry of litigation spawned by the new precedent has begun to show how much the Bruen test will remake the legal playing field around firearms.\n\nA federal district judge cited the ruling last month when halting Delaware restrictions on possessing and manufacturing untraceable firearms, saying that the law‚Äôs defenders failed to provide persuasive evidence that similar restrictions existed in the historical record. The precedent was also referenced when local assault weapon bans in two Colorado jurisdictions were put on hold this summer; the judges in both cases were each appointed by Democratic presidents.\n\nOn Thursday, a federal judge in Syracuse leaned on Bruen to pause several New York restrictions, including limits on carrying firearms to sensitive places like summer camps, domestic violence shelters and zoos.\n\nLaws that withstood legal challenge in the past are now in jeopardy.\n\nTexas‚Äô public carry handgun ban for 18- to 20-year-olds ‚Äì a ban that was upheld by the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals in 2012 ‚Äì was struck down by a district court last month. US District Judge Mark Pittman wrote in the opinion that he had not been pointed to any Founding-era laws that were a ‚Äúsufficient historical analog to support Texas‚Äôs statutory prohibition.‚Äù\n\nGun safety advocates say there are cases where the historical record will be on their side, and, at least in the early post-Bruen flurry of legal action, some laws have been successfully defended in court.\n\nA judge who declined to block a San Jose, California, law requiring liability insurance for gun owners said that the mandate had adequate parallels in 19th century surety laws, which required some individuals to post bond in order to carry weapons. A week after a federal judge in Texas ruled against a federal law banning those under felony indictment from buying, the same judge decided in favor of the prohibitions on convicted felons possessing firearms. US District Judge David Counts reasoned in the latter case that there was a historical tradition supporting the exclusion from the Second Amendment‚Äôs protections people who ‚Äúsquander their rights for crimes and violence.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf the question is now whether there‚Äôs a tradition of regulating firearms in different respects, we think that the historical evidence is going to show the answer is yes,‚Äù said Eric Tirschwell, the executive director of Everytown Law, which is the litigation arm of the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety.\n\nChanging the work advocates must do to defend restrictions\n\nThe Bruen ruling, when laying out the historical prong of the test, said it was up to the government that was defending a gun law to prove the restriction had a parallel in the past.\n\nThis shift in burden has put gun rights groups at a greater advantage in court. It has also changed the type of work that government defenders ‚Äì and the outside gun safety groups that often support them in litigation ‚Äì must do to advocate for their laws.\n\n‚ÄúImagine if you are a district attorney, somewhere in some random state, you suddenly get a lawsuit brought on this, on some gun law you‚Äôve got, and then you‚Äôve got maybe 30 days to respond to the lawsuit. What are you going to do?‚Äù said Carlton Larson, a professor at UC-Davis School of Law who specializes in the historical basis of Second Amendment rights.\n\n‚ÄúI am a legal historian by training,‚Äù Larson said. ‚ÄúI would find it very, very hard to turn around quickly on that and come up with something thoughtful.‚Äù\n\nBut gun rights advocates say this work of historical analysis is a better fit for courts than the means-ends balancing test that many lower courts were applying pre-Bruen. The old approach required courts to act like legislators, said Peter Patterson ‚Äì a lawyer for the firm Cooper and Kirk, which has represented gun rights groups in high profile cases ‚Äì while the historical analysis, he said, is ‚Äúmuch more a judicial task.‚Äù\n\nThe Bruen decision has also put a greater focus on the first prong of the legal test ‚Äì whether the conduct being burden is even covered by the Second Amendment in the first place ‚Äì which was a question that was ‚Äúunderappreciated‚Äù in litigation over gun laws in the past, according to Tirschwell.\n\nUnanswered legal questions courts will hash out\n\nAs lower courts begin to apply the new precedent, questions left open by the Bruen ruling will be hashed out and debated.\n\nWhile finding laws in the historical record may be ‚Äúclear cut,‚Äù according to David Kopel, an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs still room for judicial discretion‚Äù in deciphering how closely a contemporary law must mimic its historical counterpart to be upheld.\n\n‚ÄúBruen says: You can have a modern gun law, that it doesn‚Äôt have to be a twin of some historic law. You can reason by analogy,‚Äù Kopel said.\n\nUS District Judge Glenn Suddaby, the judge who blocked parts of a New York gun law Thursday, said the historical parallels were strong enough for him to let stand the state‚Äôs ban on carrying firearms into schools.\n\n‚ÄúHowever, the Court cannot find these historical statutes analogous to a prohibition on ‚Äòsummer camps,‚Äô‚Äù he wrote, so he was halting the ban on carrying firearms there.\n\nOne question legal experts will be watching is what Bruen means for the types of gun laws that the Supreme Court had previously identified as ‚Äúpresumptively lawful‚Äù in the landmark 2008 Heller case establishing that individuals have a right to bear arms. In the majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that the ruling was not meant to cast doubt on restrictions on carrying guns in sensitive places, possession bans for the mentally ill or felons, or other certain conditions imposed on the purchase of firearms.\n\n‚ÄúIt seems to be those that those Heller exceptions are up for grabs, potentially,‚Äù Larson said, referring to the name of the 2008 case.\n\nAnother question raised by the Bruen decision is what should be the historical touchpoint for assessing whether a restriction is constitutional: the 1791 enshrining of the Bill of Rights or the 1868 ratification of the 14th Amendment, under which the court has extended the protections against federal infringements on gun rights to state and local governments.\n\nGun advocates are staking out their arguments for seeing the earlier time period as the relevant one for whether a contemporary gun law has a historical analogue.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really difficult for me to see guideposts in what the court said in Bruen,‚Äù Willinger said. ‚ÄúIt really does leave quite a bit up to the judge in terms of determining what level of generality do I use to look at the history.‚Äù", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/04/25/dramatic-rise-pardons-delaware/26374339/", "title": "Dramatic rise in pardons in Delaware", "text": "Cris Barrish, and Jonathan Starkey\n\nGov. Jack Markell has signed 1%2C569 pardons during his first six-plus years in office.\n\nA pardon is an act of %22exective grace%22 from the governor.\n\nThe governor%27s office and the Board of Pardons don%27t track how many people pardoned re-offend.\n\nSince 1950%2C the board has recommended pardons for about 85 percent of 4%2C800 applicants.\n\nGov. Jack Markell has signed 1,569 pardons during his six-plus years in office, more than any other Delaware governor. The vast majority were awarded to people with minor offenses, although some went to criminals with serious felonies.\n\nMarkell and state officials say pardons are an important tool to ensure people with criminal records aren't stigmatized forever and help deserving people secure jobs and move on with their lives after incarceration.\n\nHowever, an analysis by The News Journal shows the state doesn't track the progress of those who have received pardons. The information is public record, but the governor's office and Board of Pardons has no system to follow whether a person who receives a pardon commits another crime.\n\nIn fact, no state officials could answer questions about how many of the 1,569 re-offended.\n\nPardons add a disclaimer to a criminal record saying someone is officially forgiven by the state but do not erase convictions. Rather, they restore civil liberties, including the right to vote and buy firearms. It can be used to show prospective employers a person is reformed ‚Äî a kind of seal of approval from the governor.\n\nThrough the late 1980s, the state Board of Pardons considered about 50 bids annually. Last year the board had a record 432 bids ‚Äì eight times more than a quarter-century earlier.\n\nDipeshkumar Patel, 44, was granted a pardon in 2014 over a prosecutor's objections and later slammed his Mercedes-Benz sedan into a stopped car on New Castle Avenue. His blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit, records show.\n\nHe had pleaded guilty in 1999 to patronizing a prostitute and in 2002 and 2004 for selling alcohol to a minor. Patel also was arrested for drunken driving in 1993 and 2008 and took the first offender's program both times.\n\nHe sought the pardon in 2013, Patel said, because he wanted his criminal record \"to be nice and clean if you apply for a job.\"\n\nA month after Markell's pardon, however, Patel was arrested again for selling alcohol to a minor. He pleaded guilty in June and was fined $500, about a month before the traffic accident. He was charged with a third-offense DUI, leaving the scene of an accident and other offenses.\n\nThe state dropped all but the new DUI charge, a Class G felony, and he pleaded guilty. A judge sentenced him to three months behind bars. Patel also lost his license for three years.\n\n\"I was just having a little fun with a friend and the cop stopped me,\" Patel said in an interview. \"That's it. I didn't think. It ain't going to happen no more.\"\n\nMarkell, who sat on the pardons board for a decade as state treasurer, said he was unaware his pardon numbers were at historic levels. Gov. Ruth Ann Minner signed 940 in eight years before Markell took office. Tom Carper, whom she succeeded, signed 675 in eight years.\n\nIn 1989, Gov. Mike Castle's fifth year in office, he gave out 48 pardons. In 2014, Markell signed 338 ‚Äì seven times as many.\n\nMarkell said applications for pardons have increased because more employers use criminal background checks. The \"best predictor\" of whether someone will re-offend is whether they have a job, he said.\n\n\"We're trying to get more people employed,\" he said.\n\nMore employers require background checks in part because state laws mandate them before hiring people to a variety of jobs, including nursing home administrators, pharmacy technicians, charitable gaming operators, charter school founders, physical therapists and bail bond agents.\n\nDelaware, like other cities and states, has taken other limited steps that attempt to make it easier for citizens with a criminal record to find employment. Legislation passed last year, and signed into law by Markell, prevents most government employers in Delaware from asking applicants about a criminal history before the first interview. The so-called \"ban-the-box\" measure prevents government hiring managers from initially screening applicants based on previous run-ins with the law. It still allows governments to run background checks as a condition of employment.\n\nFred Calhoun, president of the Delaware Fraternal Order of Police, said the growth in pardons shows that more care is needed to make sure they are given to people are won't re-offend. In some cases, the state should consider rescinding pardons, he said.\n\nGranting pardons without any follow-up, he said, gives businesses a \"false sense of security\" about job applicants.\n\n\"If they're going to give businesses and companies the impression that this person is a clean-cut, no-problems citizen, the board is obligated to track that person,\" Calhoun said.\n\nThomas J. Brackin, president of the Delaware State Troopers Association, said the sheer number of pardons signed by Markell raises questions about how thoroughly applications are reviewed.\n\n\"It makes you pause and think, 'Why so many?'\n\n\" Brackin said. \"I have to give them the benefit of the doubt. But it makes you wonder how exhaustive of a vetting process we're running.\"\n\nGood behavior, other factors considered\n\nAnyone with a criminal conviction can apply for a pardon, but the five-member Board of Pardons advises prospective applicants that it likes to see a period of good behavior of at least three years since their sentence was completed, including probation and payment of fines.\n\nBefore an application can reach the governor's desk, it has to be approved at a public meeting by three members of the board, composed of lieutenant governor, treasurer, auditor, secretary of state and Chancery Court chief judge. Monthly board hearings can include testimony from the offender, an attorney, prosecutors and victims. The board also considers requests for commutation ‚Äî a sentence reduction for someone in prison.\n\nMembers give the greatest weight to the recommendation by the Attorney General's Office, which is notified of every case and reviews the person's criminal history. The prosecutor's position, said the current board chair, Secretary of State Jeffrey W. Bullock, is \"the most important single factor.\"\n\nThose who seek pardons for more serious offenses also must undergo a psychiatric evaluation that includes the \"probability of the applicant again committing any crime.\"\n\nAt the Pardon Board's meeting last week in Dover, 46 people were scheduled ‚Äî burglars, thieves, shoplifters and low-level drug and alcohol violators, but also a methamphetamine trafficker and a cocaine trafficker. Each hearing lasted between five and 15 minutes, with members either ruling immediately or conferring in private before announcing their decision.\n\nSince 1950, the board has recommended pardons for about 85 percent of 4,800 applicants. Governors have granted 93 percent of the board-approved bids.\n\nThe lack of data on re-incarceration, however, means it's impossible to know if this process is effective.\n\nMarkell said he carefully weighs every case. He has issued pardons in 1,569 of the 1,672 cases he has decided. He has 175 cases pending.\n\n\"I take each one that's in front of me,\" Markell said. \"One at a time.\"\n\nAmong those pardoned since 1955 by all governors, 44 had been convicted of offensive touching, 32 of third-degree assault and 22 of theft.\n\nOf those pardoned for a single crime, the most common ones were shoplifting (204), offensive touching (97), third-degree assault (67) and disorderly conduct (63). Nineteen of the single-conviction pardons were for first-degree murder, 24 for second-degree murder and 21 for manslaughter.\n\nMarkell also has pardoned several dozen people for serious felonies: six for murder or manslaughter, five for rape, and 14 for robbery, with almost all those criminals getting pardoned for other crimes.\n\nMost receive little if any public scrutiny. An exception was Markell's pardon of preacher and Wilmington activist the Rev. Derrick D. Johnson soon after he took office in 2009.\n\nOver a 25-year period ending in 2002, Johnson had been convicted of manslaughter, possession of a weapon during a felony, possession of a firearm by a person prohibited, robbery, attempted robbery, unlawful imprisonment and carrying a concealed deadly weapon.\n\nJohnson, who spent several years in prison for his crimes, appeared before the board in November 2008. Then-Attorney General Beau Biden's office didn't object and board members agreed.\n\nMarkell wrote that despite a long criminal record, Johnson appeared to have \"learned from his behavior and has lived a productive life.\"\n\nJohnson, who has not been rearrested, said his joy at being pardoned was \"unimaginable\" and he often talks about the subject when visiting inmates in and out of Delaware.\n\n\"It's one of the most important things that happened in my life. It made me appreciate lawful living as much as being free,\" he said. \"It kind of says, 'We forgive you.\"\n\n'Somebody is going to break bad'\n\nDevin L. Trotter, 29, said he sought his pardon for the same reason Markell and others cited ‚Äî he couldn't find a good job.\n\n\"If you are not getting in, eventually you have to say, 'It must be my background,'\" Trotter said.\n\nRealizing he couldn't get the felony expunged ‚Äî completely erased with the record destroyed ‚Äî he chose the next-best option. Trotter wanted the pardon for a May 2005 crime in Newark, court papers show.\n\nThen 19, Trotter was a back-seat passenger in a sport-utility vehicle searched by police, who found about 3 grams each of crack cocaine and marijuana, and a loaded .22-caliber handgun, according to the records. He was charged with carrying a concealed deadly weapon, using a vehicle for keeping drugs and second-degree conspiracy, plus cocaine and marijuana possession.\n\nFour days later, Trotter was arrested again, charged with cocaine trafficking after police who raided a New Castle-area motel room he had recently left found a half-ounce of cocaine.\n\nSentenced to 2 1/ 2 years of probation, he was discharged 10 months later after his probation officer wrote that he followed all rules, had a steady job and finished drug counseling.\n\nHe avoided criminal trouble for eight years and in August 2013 made his pardon pitch, without an attorney. Biden's office did not object and the five members ‚Äî Bullock, State Auditor R. Thomas Wagner, then-Lt. Gov. Matt Denn, Chancellor Leo E. Strine Jr. and Treasurer Chip Flowers ‚Äî unanimously approved.\n\nTrotter, a father of two, was able to be hired at Amazon.com's Middletown warehouse. A few months after getting the pardon, Trotter legally bought a .40-caliber Smith and Wesson revolver. He bought it for protection, he said, because he is often in Wilmington where shootings have occurred.\n\nTrotter had the gun on Feb. 20, when he drove three friends to the city's Club Lavish. He left the weapon partially under his seat and locked its magazine with 14 bullets in the glove box, he said.\n\nPolice responding to a fight at the club ran the tag on Trotter's 2003 Lincoln sedan and found no registration. Looking inside, an officer saw \"the handle of a firearm sticking out\" under the seat, court document said.\n\nPolice used a search warrant and found 11 tablets of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax, 47 bags of heroin stamped \"evil dead,\" and about 20 grams of marijuana in several vials, including Trotter's prescription bottle for Xanax.\n\nHe was charged with carrying a concealed deadly weapon, and possessing Xanax and marijuana.\n\nNow free on unsecured bail, Trotter said in an interview the gun charge is bogus ‚Äî that he didn't want to leave his gun on the seat, fearing someone might break into his car. Although the marijuana was in his bottle, Trotter said he wasn't \"stupid\" enough to put illegal drugs in a bottle with his name. He said the other men must have stashed the weed.\n\nTrotter understands people might think he has thumbed his nose at the governor.\n\n\"I'm not saying I'm a role model citizen, but I'm not wrong in this case,\" Trotter said.\n\nHis main worry, Trotter said, is the same as when he sought the pardon ‚Äî getting a job. After he was busted, Trotter said, Amazon let him go.\n\nMargaret Colgate Love, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who has sought presidential pardons for clients and studies state clemency laws, said she knows of no states that track those who get pardons or have provisions to revoke pardons.\n\n\"Every once in a while, somebody is going to break bad,\" Love said. \"But pardons are a tremendously positive tool for law enforcement. They encourage people to go straight. And they reward it.\"\n\nIn Delaware and six other states, governors share pardoning power with separate boards, according to Love's research published by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. Rhode Island's governor pardons with the advice and consent of the state Senate.\n\nState Sen. David Lawson, a retired state trooper, agreed that monitoring is needed \"if nothing else, just to see if the pardon system is working.\"\n\nBullock said the board has never considered tracking those who receive pardons. While Delaware has no legal mechanism for rescinding a pardon, Bullock agreed a felony arrest soon afterward is \"strong evidence that someone did not deserve a pardon in the first place.\"\n\nCurrent and former board members, including Denn, now attorney general, said they hadn't previously considered tracking pardoners. They also wondered what doing so would accomplish because all of a person's convictions, pre- and post-pardon, show up on a criminal records check available to any citizen or prospective employer.\n\n\"I don't think it would be bad information to have,\" Markell said. \"The question is, what would we do with it?\"\n\nMarkell expressed concern data could be used to deny pardons not based on individual circumstances, but on statistical probabilities of re-offending.\n\n\"I'm not going to hold somebody else's mistake against the current applicant,\" the governor said.\n\nBullock said such reports would be helpful. But even more beneficial, he said, is that Denn's office has begun providing police reports about specific cases for which a pardon is sought. Such reports, Bullock said, \"are a significant improvement\" and help members prepare for meetings.\n\nDenn said there would be some benefit to monitoring offenders. Having such \"statistical information\" would let members know, for example, \"what percentage of people who get a pardon for X type of offense later commit another crime.\"\n\nWagner said more data would be helpful for board members considering pardons. Having that information would confirm or disprove his theory that awarding pardons to people under age 30 comes with a higher risk that they will re-offend.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you give them the second chance to get on with their life,\" Wagner said. \"If they blow it, they blow it.\"\n\nContact senior investigative reporter Cris Barrish at (302) 324-2785, cbarrish@delawareonline.com, on Facebook or Twitter @crisbarrish.

A pardon, however, does not remove the conviction from someone's record.\n\nProcess: The application must fill out a detailed application and send it to the Board of Pardons for review. The Attorney General's Office also reviews the person's criminal history. The board meets in public monthly and in each case can hear testimony from petitioners, their attorneys, prosecutors and victims. At least of the five board must approve the petition before it can be sent to the governor, which makes the final decision.\n\nHow many: Gov.

The Alabama Historical Commission, in a statement, said an exhibit named for the slave ship Clotilda is set to open this fall in Mobile, where the schooner arrived with African captives in 1860. The artifacts include pieces of wood and metal taken from a muddy river bottom where the ship was discovered, said Jim Delgado, a maritime archaeologist who helped identify the wreck. The History Museum of Mobile will add pieces from its own collection to help tell the story of the port‚Äôs maritime history, the commission said. The city is working on plans for a new facility to house the exhibition. To settle a bet between wealthy white men on whether slaves could be imported into the South in defiance of a federal ban, the wooden ship illegally transported 110 people from west Africa to Alabama, where they became slaves. The freed people later settled in a community called Africatown, which still exists and will be the site of the exhibition.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The city‚Äôs tourism task force is not expected to recommend placing a cap on the number of visitors during the upcoming tourist season. The City and Borough of Juneau Visitor Industry Task Force is more likely to recommend the city use infrastructure to limit the number of visitors, The Juneau Empire reports. The 10-member task force met Sunday to develop recommendations it hopes to present to a March 23 meeting of the Committee of the Whole, a work session of the city assembly. The infrastructure changes could include berthing larger cruise ships filled with passengers closer to the city to reduce congestion, as well as requiring longer separations between ship arrivals. Mayor Beth Weldon created the task force in 2019 to answer questions about the management of Juneau‚Äôs growing tourist industry. There are expected to be 1.44 million visitors to Southeast Alaska communities this season.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Rough roads are costing the state‚Äôs drivers about $2,000 each year in car repairs and time lost to traffic, according to a report officials released Tuesday amid a renewed push at the Capitol to raise gas taxes. The report from TRIP, a Washington, D.C., transportation nonprofit, concludes that the total cost to Arizona drivers from added vehicle repairs, crashes where the roadway was a contributing factor, and added time and fuel expenses is worth $9.6 billion. The report says 44% of major roads and highways in Arizona are in poor or mediocre condition, based on data from the Federal Highway Administration. Officials from the League of Arizona Cities and Towns along with the County Supervisors Association of Arizona, representing all 91 incorporated municipalities and supervisors from all 15 counties, said the report shows the need for more tax revenue for road repairs.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Arkansas Department of Human Services is requesting double-digit pay increases for direct care workers at state institutions for the developmentally disabled in hopes of retaining the employees. The department‚Äôs proposal includes five human development centers where pay would increase about 18%, from $22,000 to $26,034, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Pay for supervisors would also increase almost 12%. Currently direct care and support staff members all make the same starting pay. Part of the proposal would also offer free training for all employees to become certified nursing assistants and require the direct care staff members from all five centers to achieve the certification by the end of the year. The proposed changes in salary increase are in hopes of reducing annual turnover that currently averages more than 100% across the five centers, said Melissa Stone, director of the department‚Äôs Division of Developmental Disabilities Services.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state may have to end most restrictions on personalized license plate language that some might find offensive, if a lawsuit filed Tuesday prevails. The libertarian Pacific Legal Foundation lawsuit challenges the state Department of Motor Vehicles‚Äô current policy on free speech grounds. The department denied more than 30,000 of the nearly 250,000 applications submitted in 2018, the last year for which statistics are available, after deciding that the proposed language ‚Äúmay carry connotations offensive to good taste and decency,‚Äù says the lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco. Department officials declined comment on the pending litigation, which challenges a program that brought the state nearly $60 million last year. The environmental plates challenged in the lawsuit cost $53 initially and $43 annually to renew and are among 14 special interest license plates that help pay for environmental and special programs.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A bill allowing electric vehicle manufacturers to sell directly to consumers passed a key state legislative committee, clearing the way for a compromise with auto dealerships. The House Energy and Environment Committee approved an amended version of the bill Monday, The Colorado Sun reports. The original measure would have allowed Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and other automakers with dealer franchises to jump into the direct-sales market to sell their electric vehicles. The compromise was an amendment that will allow only automakers that have no existing dealer franchise to sell electric vehicles direct to consumers. Democratic House Speaker KC Becker, a primary sponsor of the measure, said the bill‚Äôs intention is to close a loophole allowing only Tesla Inc. to sell its electric cars directly to Colorado residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Haven: A lawsuit brought by a retired police department employee was reinstated Tuesday by an appeals court. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Dyanna Green can try to prove that her punishment for taking a container of biscuits from the department‚Äôs communal refrigerator was part of age discrimination. Green was 58 and working in the records division in 2012 when she says the department‚Äôs bosses created a hostile work environment to force retirement after hiring someone else half her age to replace a recently retired worker in the division. Facing a disciplinary hearing, she quit. In December 2014, Green maintained she took one of two canisters of buttermilk biscuits dough to her desk, planning to bake them at home and bring them back for officers and staff, the appeals court said. But before Green went home, a lieutenant sent an email to employees demanding the missing canister be returned. When Green tried to return it, she encountered the police chief standing by the refrigerator, which had yellow ‚Äúcrime scene‚Äù tape sealing it, the appeals court said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Some state lawmakers say that if you do business in Delaware, you need to accept cash. A bill introduced Tuesday prohibits any business selling goods or services from refusing to accept cash from a consumer making an in-person purchase. Senate President David McBride says not everyone has a bank account, and many people cannot obtain credit or debit cards. Lawmakers also note that there is currently no federal law mandating that businesses or individuals accept paper currency. Officials in other states and localities, including Massachusetts, New Jersey, Philadelphia and New York City, also have taken action to ban cashless stores. Massachusetts passed its law almost 40 years ago. Under the proposed legislation in Delaware, a person who violated the law could be fined up to $10,000 per violation.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The annual St. Patrick‚Äôs Parade in the district has been postponed as what officials say is a precaution to growing coronavirus concerns, WUSA-TV reports. The parade was originally scheduled for this Sunday. Organizers with the parade committee announced the postponement in an email Wednesday, citing concerns about the health and safety of attendants. The parade is one of many events and conferences to get postponed or canceled in the DMV, with organizers and attendants taking preventative measures to help reduce the impact of the virus. On Wednesday, D.C. Public Schools announced it will be closing schools next week to prepare for potential impact on students and faculty. Colleges have begun to prepare for the virus impact as well, with Georgetown University announcing Wednesday that it will move to virtual learning until after spring break Monday.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state would create a task force to identify unmarked and abandoned African American cemeteries and make recommendations on how to preserve them under a bill unanimously passed by the Senate on Monday. Several such cemeteries have been found around the state, including one in Tampa where the local housing authority built apartments above the graves of about 800 African Americans buried in the early 1900s, as well as a slave burying ground that‚Äôs now under a Tallahassee golf course. ‚ÄúAcross the state of Florida, such cemeteries called lost are being found,‚Äù Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson said. ‚ÄúWe cannot continue to run away from our collective history, and we can no longer allow others to rewrite that history or, at its worst, force the history off the pages of time.‚Äù\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Legislation advancing at the state Capitol aims to raise the age at which teens can be charged as adults from 17 to 18. The House Juvenile Justice Committee approved the bill unanimously Monday, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Georgia, Wisconsin and Texas are the only states that charge people over the age of 16 as adults, according to the newspaper. The bill moving forward in Georgia would allow the juvenile justice system to handle cases involving 17-year-olds accused of committing crimes. Those cases are currently heard in superior court. ‚ÄúThis is really about making sure 17-year-olds aren‚Äôt burdened with criminal records that are going to hurt them in the long run,‚Äù said Josh Rovner with Washington, D.C.-based criminal justice nonprofit The Sentencing Project. Supporters say it would also give the teens greater access to services that try to prevent them from committing another crime.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Officials have confirmed another discovery of a fungal disease that has killed hundreds of thousands of native ohia trees in the state. An ohia tree with the infection was found on Oahu near the popular Poamoho trail above Wahiawa, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources confirmed the tree was infected with Ceratocystis huliohia, the less aggressive of the two fungal species responsible for the blight. The fungal disease infected four other trees on Oahu and has been found on each of the four main islands. An aerial survey in November found Oahu‚Äôs fourth case of the fungal disease at the Honolulu Watershed Forest Reserve above Tripler Army Medical Center. The state will be cautious in removing the latest infected tree because Poamoho is a critical watershed that is home to numerous endangered plants and animals, officials say.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Environmental groups filed a lawsuit Tuesday challenging a Trump administration decision to reopen a long-closed road built through grizzly bear habitat in northern Idaho. The Center for Biological Diversity and four other groups contend the road will harm grizzly bears, mountain caribou and other wildlife in the Selkirk Mountains. The U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security last month announced plans to reopen more than 5 miles of Bog Creek Road because of threats to border security. The agencies didn‚Äôt specify the types of threats. The road was closed in the late 1980s to protect endangered grizzly bears roaming the area between Upper Priest Lake and the Canadian border. ‚ÄúNot only is this proposed road bad for bears, it‚Äôs also totally unnecessary for border security,‚Äù said Andrea Santarsiere, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man‚Äôs decades¬≠long stay in isolation in a prison in the state has prompted proposed legislation that would limit how long a prisoner can stay in solitary confinement. Called the Anthony Gay Isolated Confinement Restriction Act, the legislation would bar the Illinois Department of Corrections from placing an inmate in isolation for more than 10 days in a six-month period. IDOC would also be required to give isolated inmates access to therapy, medical appointments, job assignments and exercise outside their cells. Anthony Gay went to prison in 1994 for stealing a dollar bill and a hat. Behavior problems, including self-mutilation, added to his sentence, and by the time he was released in August 2018, he had served 24 years in prison, 22 in solitary confinement. Later that year, the Corrections Department determined nearly 1 in 3 prisoners in segregation had serious mental illness issues.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: In an effort to combat distracted driving, state legislators on Tuesday gave their final approval to a proposal banning motorists from using handheld cellphones on Indiana roads. The state House voted 81-11 and the Senate 49-1 in favor of the bill allowing cellphone use by drivers only with hands-free or voice-operated technology, except in emergencies. The measure would broaden the state‚Äôs current ban on texting while driving that officials point out is unenforceable and doesn‚Äôt ban actions such as emailing or using Snapchat, Twitter and other apps. The new law would take effect in July, but any tickets issued to violators won‚Äôt result in state Bureau of Motor Vehicles points toward a driver‚Äôs license suspension until July 2021. Distracted driving was to blame in at least 860 injury crashes and 48 fatalities in Indiana last year, according to state police.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state House has passed a bill that would change how much THC patients can receive through the medical marijuana program, add more qualifying conditions and allow more health care practitioners to recommend Iowans be added to the program. The bill, which passed on a vote of 52-46, follows the recommendation of a state advisory board and is in line with what Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds said she is comfortable with signing, but Democrats called it a step backward for the program. The bill would replace Iowa‚Äôs current percentage-based limit, which allows medical marijuana products to contain up to 3% THC, with a per-patient limit of 4.5 grams of THC in a 90-day period. There are two exceptions to the THC limit: if a doctor determines that amount is insufficient to treat a patient‚Äôs condition, or if the patient is terminally ill.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Legislators are taking steps to allow college athletes to hire agents and sign endorsement deals because they fear that if they don‚Äôt, out-of-state rivals will attract the best recruits and leave Kansas‚Äô athletic programs in the dust. A bill that would bar state universities from preventing their athletes from earning outside compensation easily cleared the state Senate Commerce Committee on Tuesday. It also would allow private, nonprofit colleges to permit their athletes to hire agents and do endorsements. It goes next to the full Senate for debate. Athletics officials at the University of Kansas and Kansas State University back the measure, and it appears to have bipartisan support, as Kansas‚Äô top-ranked men‚Äôs basketball team looks ahead to March Madness. ‚ÄúWe need to make sure that we are, as a state giving, a signal to the NCAA, ‚ÄòYou need to be addressing this, or you‚Äôre going to have a quilt of legislation in all the different states,‚Äô ‚Äù said state Sen. Molly Baumgardner, a Kansas City-area Republican.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear urged churches on Wednesday to cancel worship services this week as part of his recommendation that people avoid large gatherings to help prevent spread of the new coronavirus. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe that whether you go to church during this period of time is a test of faith,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI believe God gives us wisdom to protect each other, and we should do that.‚Äù Beshear also said that state prisons are being temporarily closed to visitors and that nonessential out-of-state travel has been suspended for state employees. He recommended that private businesses do the same. The governor acknowledged that recommending the cancellation of worship services statewide was a ‚Äúbig step‚Äù and one that‚Äôs likely to draw some pushback. But he said he sees it as necessary to protect public health.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state is restarting its stalled effort to replace its voting machines, with the solicitation for bidders expected to go out shortly, Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said Tuesday. New machines, however, won‚Äôt be in place quickly. Louisiana will continue casting ballots this fall on the same types of voting system that it has used for 15 years, without the paper backup advocated by many elections security experts. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be after the election. It won‚Äôt be for the presidential election because we don‚Äôt have the time to get through the (bid) process completely,‚Äù Ardoin, the state‚Äôs chief elections official, told lawmakers during a House Appropriations Committee budget hearing. Allegations of improper bid handling derailed a previous effort to replace Louisiana‚Äôs voting machines, so the secretary of state‚Äôs office has had to redo its vendor search process.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Legislature is revisiting the state‚Äôs stricter vaccine law to make some tweaks before it goes into effect next year. The new law eliminates religious and philosophical exemptions for childhood vaccines starting in September 2021. But the education committee on Monday took up a proposal to exempt students enrolled in online charter schools from the new requirements. The bill‚Äôs sponsor, Rep. Ryan Tipping, said Monday that it made little sense for the stricter rules to apply to kids who don‚Äôt sit in a classroom. Reject Big Pharma, a group that unsuccessfully fought the elimination of most vaccine opt-outs, was represented at the hearing. Mainers voted overwhelmingly last week to keep the new law that ends nonmedical vaccine opt-outs by September 2021 at public and private schools and universities, including nursery schools.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Electric bills may be going up if the state‚Äôs Public Service Commission approves a request from Delmarva Power to raise rates to its Eastern Shore customers. The electric provider is asking the commission to approve a rate increase that could cost the ‚Äúaverage electric residential customer‚Äù $5.10 more a month, according to a press release from the PSC. Delmarva Power currently serves 206,000 customers on the Eastern Shore, according to the PSC press release. The utility estimated the rate increase could result in an additional $18.5 million for the company, according to a filing with the PSC. Delmarva Power has been replacing parts of its infrastructure as well as installing new technology to ‚Äúprovide reliable service in a cost-effective manner,‚Äù according to the company‚Äôs request.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A police patrol plan on the area‚Äôs public transit system that took effect in 2016 continues to keep violent crime consistently lower than it was just five years ago, Transit Police Superintendent Richard Sullivan said. Sullivan on Tuesday released figures showing there were 779 homicides, rapes, aggravated assaults, larcenies and other so-called part one violent crimes on the MBTA last year, compared to 770 in 2018, he said Tuesday. The four-year average for 2016 through 2019, however, stands at 782, compared to 998 for the previous five years, he told The Boston Globe. Sullivan said the numbers show that since he and Chief Kenneth Green instituted a new patrol plan in 2016, ‚Äúpart-one crimes had a precipitous drop, and we‚Äôve maintained that for the last four years.‚Äù Riders take more than 1.1 million trips on the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority every weekday.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Water and sewer system projects are getting started in two neighborhoods as part of a $500 million program to upgrade the city‚Äôs aging water infrastructure. Detroit‚Äôs Water and Sewerage Department is investing more than $44 million into Cornerstone Village and North Rosedale Park, according to the city. The work includes replacing water mains, fire hydrants and city sewer pipes. Lead service lines will be replaced with copper pipes on blocks where water mains are being replaced. The Water and Sewerage Department is replacing some service lines on private property at the department‚Äôs cost. Cornerstone Village is on Detroit‚Äôs east side. North Rosedale Park is in northwest Detroit. Most Detroit water and sewer pipes are more than 80 years old, the city said, adding that the last massive infrastructure upgrade was in 1930.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Some 36,000 public school students had another day off Wednesday while their teachers walked the picket line in the second day of a labor strike. Teachers and support staff picketed again outside the city‚Äôs schools, as parents scrambled to make alternative plans for their children. St. Paul Federation of Educators spokeswoman Megan Boldt said Wednesday that no new contract talks have been scheduled with the school district. ‚ÄúWe are ready to come back to the table when the district is ready to make some movement,‚Äù said union president Nick Faber. The two sides broke off talks about 3 a.m. Tuesday after six days of mediation. The union wants mental health teams in every school building, but district officials say that would be cost-prohibitive. The union also wants more multilingual staff and additional educators working with students with special needs.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state House voted Tuesday to put a second medical marijuana proposal on the statewide ballot this year. But people who petitioned to get the first one there say the second is designed to split the vote and kill both proposals. More than 200,000 people signed petitions to put Initiative 65 on the November ballot. It would amend the Mississippi Constitution to allow the prescription of up to 5 ounces of marijuana per month for a person with a debilitating medical condition. On Tuesday, the Mississippi House voted to put an alternative medical marijuana proposal on the same ballot. Republican Rep. Trey Lamar of Senatobia said the alternative would allow local zoning regulations that would prevent pot shops from springing up on main streets. The alternative would restrict the smoking of prescribed marijuana to people with terminal illnesses, although people who are ill but not dying could use oils or other forms of the drug.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A new four-year medical school will focus on training doctors who will work in poor urban and rural areas. Puerto Rico-based Ponce Health Sciences University is making an $80 million commitment to develop the new campus in north St. Louis, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Construction will begin later this year with a freshman class of 150 in the fall of 2022. Ponce President David Lenihan told the newspaper the goal is to provide opportunities for minority and low-income students who fail to get a spot in a traditional medical school but show promise to succeed. He said those students tend to work in communities where they grew up and have a strong understanding of their patients. Herb Kuhn, Missouri Hospital Association president, said several counties have no primary care physicians, and eight acute hospitals in rural Missouri have closed in the past five years. All told, 44 Missouri counties lack a hospital.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The U.S. Department of the Interior is providing money for two specialists to help it manage grizzly bears in the state following conflicts with landowners and livestock that often end in bears being killed by wildlife workers. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in letter to members of Montana‚Äôs congressional delegation that the agency would play a ‚Äúmore conclusive role‚Äù in dealing with problem bears. Grizzlies are protected as a threatened species, and hunting of them is not allowed. However, bears that prey on livestock or pose a threat to public safety are routinely killed. Interior is entering a $250,000 contract with the U.S. Department of Agriculture‚Äôs Wildlife Services to hire the two bear management specialists. The state is home to the largest grizzly populations in the U.S. outside Alaska, with more than 1,000 bears in northwestern Montana, and hundreds more live in the Yellowstone region.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State lawmakers will debate a new bill to lower property taxes as early as next week after a legislative committee endorsed it in a Tuesday vote. Members of the Revenue Committee voted 6-1 in favor of the bill, which would provide roughly the same $520 million boost to Nebraska‚Äôs K-12 public schools as an earlier proposal that stalled last month. Schools are the biggest consumers of local property tax revenue in Nebraska, and the bill would offer them the additional money along with tighter controls on their ability to tax and spend. Schools fought an earlier version of the bill, saying they don‚Äôt trust the state to maintain its commitment and arguing that the controls would hinder their flexibility. The new version relaxes some of the proposed controls, although schools may still question it.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A state judge has again rejected a decades¬≠long bid to tap groundwater beneath vast rangelands in northeast Nevada and pipe it to fast-growing suburbs and glittering gambling resorts in and around Las Vegas. In a strongly worded statement, Judge Robert Estes said he saw no reason to undo findings he made in December 2013 that block a Southern Nevada Water Authority plan to spend billions of dollars to pump groundwater from four rural valleys in White Pine and Lincoln counties near the Utah border. Simeon Herskovits, an attorney representing the Great Basin Water Network and most opponents of the project, called the ruling ‚Äúthe end of the road for the Southern Nevada Water Authority and the state engineer, unless they appeal again to the (state) Supreme Court.‚Äù The order followed two days of hearings last November.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: As spring approaches, the state‚Äôs Department of Environmental Services wants to hear from residents when lakes and ponds become ice-free. The ‚Äúice-out‚Äù conditions mean a water body is thawed and can be navigated by boat. Lake Winnipesaukee has annual ‚Äúice-out‚Äù observations by aircraft. New Hampshire Public Radio reports there are ‚Äúice-out‚Äù conditions on some lakes in the southern part of the state. It‚Äôs similar to conditions in other mild winter years, such as 2018 and 2016. State officials are looking for more long-term data of ‚Äúice-in‚Äù dates, as well, to show whether warmer winters are causing shorter ice seasons.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nLeonia: A town near the busy George Washington Bridge has won a court reprieve in its effort to close residential streets to reduce gridlock from commuters using navigation apps. Leonia made headlines two years ago when it implemented the closures, after the town passed ordinances limiting traffic on some streets to local residents or nonresidents having business in town. Apps like Waze and Apple Maps typically reroute some of the tens of thousands of vehicles headed to the bridge each morning, particularly when there is an accident or other disruption. Police said in 2018 that studies showed that more than 2,000 vehicles often passed through the town of about 9,000 residents from just one of the three exits off Interstate 95, causing safety concerns and gridlock on side streets.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: A woman is facing charges after police say she stole a car and later tried to claim she was pop singer Beyonce Knowles. Surena Henry was arrested Saturday morning in Las Cruces when an officer spotted a vehicle that resembled one that recently had been reported stolen, the Las Cruces Sun-News reports. According to court documents, the 48-year-old Henry ignored the officer‚Äôs orders to pull over and later parked in front of her home. Documents say Henry told the officer she was Beyonce. Police also reported Henry told the officer she found the keys in the vehicle and decided to take it for a joy ride. She also allegedly told police that she didn‚Äôt stop driving when she saw the emergency lights because she didn‚Äôt feel like it. Henry is charged with unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, concealing identity, and resisting or obstructing an arrest.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The New York City St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Parade has been postponed for the first time in its 258-year history because of coronavirus concerns, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. The postponement of next Tuesday‚Äôs parade adds to the roster of events and holidays upended around the world by the spreading infection. Chicago, Boston and even the Irish capital, Dublin, have canceled St. Patrick‚Äôs Day parades. The New York parade honoring Irish heritage dates back longer than the United States and draws tens of thousands of marchers and throngs of spectators to Manhattan‚Äôs Fifth Avenue. Cuomo, a Democrat, said while the risk of transmission might be lower in an outdoor gathering, health experts had urged him to call it off. The governor‚Äôs statement did not say when this year‚Äôs parade will take place, if at all. But Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted late in the night that he promises the parade will go on, ‚Äúwhether it‚Äôs in the heat of summer or on a clear fall day.‚Äù\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A police shooting that wounded a suspect during a foot chase in the city sparked protests early Wednesday from hundreds who demanded answers and burned a flag outside the governor‚Äôs mansion. Police Chief Cassandra Deck-Brown said officers responded to a 911 call Tuesday evening reporting a man with a gun near a shopping center in eastern Raleigh. She said arriving officers spotted a person matching the caller‚Äôs description, later identified as 26-year-old Javier Torres. Torres ran and was chased by officers who repeatedly ordered him to stop and drop the gun, Deck-Brown said. Torres was shot in the abdomen by an officer who had joined the chase, the chief said, adding that the suspect was running directly toward that officer and would not drop his gun. The extent of Torres‚Äô injuries was not immediately known.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Democrats moved Tuesday to bolster staffing at the largest of the state‚Äôs 14 caucus sites after heavy turnout forced some voters in Fargo to wait in line as long as an hour. The party had been expecting a big surge in turnout due to a revamping of the state‚Äôs caucus system and high interest in the presidential race. North Dakota shifted this year from traditional caucuses to so-called firehouse caucuses that function largely like a typical election, with voters able to show up, cast a ballot and leave. The process is run by the parties. Democrats set up 14 voting sites around the state, with voting from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. The lines were longest in Fargo, the state‚Äôs largest city and home to North Dakota State University. The party said wait times in Grand Forks, home to the University of North Dakota, were about 40 minutes. Lines were shorter in Bismarck and Minot. Bernie Sanders ultimately won North Dakota, the smallest prize among states that voted Tuesday.\n\nOhio\n\nAthens: An investigation into hazing allegations against Ohio University‚Äôs marching band found several ‚Äúconcerning‚Äù unsanctioned band traditions, according to university documents. The Marching 110 is one of several campus groups that was investigated last fall for hazing allegations that led to the suspension of all the university‚Äôs fraternities. The investigation, which included interviews with 117 students and seven staff members, could lead to the removal of some students from the band, The Columbus Dispatch reports. Multiple annual band events included the illegal consumption of alcohol, as well as the use of marijuana on a bus during a band trip, according to a summary of the investigation. The summary also detailed other incidents such as band members competing to drink a gallon of milk in an hour and one section watching pornography together for several years. None of the conduct resulted in ‚Äúgrave physical harm,‚Äù and students were not forced to consume alcohol or marijuana.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state House on Wednesday passed legislation to prohibit minors under 16 years of age from getting married. The House‚Äôs vote reversed actions the chamber took earlier in the week to kill a different version of the bill.The latest version of House Bill 3873 by Rep. Jason Dunnington, D-Oklahoma City, prohibits those under age 16 from getting married. Currently, teenagers under age 16 can get married if a court approves. Under the proposal, minors ages 16 and 17 would have to get parental and court approval for a marriage. Additionally, the court would be required to conduct an on-camera interview with the minor or minors to ensure they are entering the marriage willingly. The court also would be required to verify a minor is of age to get married, according to the amendment proposed by Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid. The amendment seemed to appease many legislative Republicans who voted down an earlier version of the bill, saying it cut parents out of the process.\n\nOregon\n\nBend: The U.S. Forest Service wants to change the rules for recreation in the hundreds of underground caves that dot the Deschutes National Forest to protect them from vandalism. Rules to shield the caves ‚Äì and the bats that call them their home ‚Äì have been in effect since the 1990s, The Bulletin reports. Advances in mobile mapping technology and an increase in central Oregon‚Äôs population, however, have put more of a strain on the 700 known caves. Problems include litter, graffiti, loud music that can disturb bats, bolts and anchors that have been illegally installed for climbing, and human feces, the newspaper says. Streamlining the rules will make it easier for the public to understand them and will give the laws more teeth, officials said. Tom Rodhouse, an ecologist with the National Park Service, said the efforts will also help bats, which use some of central Oregon‚Äôs caves for protection in both summer and winter.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A task force set up three years ago issued recommendations Wednesday about how to improve the process of reentering outside society among prisoners who have finished their sentences. The Pennsylvania Reentry Council‚Äôs report addresses housing, work, health, education and other challenges that former inmates face upon release from incarceration. The group says reentry coalitions are currently in 30 of the 67 counties but should be established across the state. It is calling for all prisons and jails to hire reentry counselors, as the Department of Corrections has done. It urges lawmakers to fund a program to provide state-issued identification to all inmates upon release, expanding to counties an effort that‚Äôs currently done in state prisons with assistance from the Transportation Department.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Employees making minimum wage in the state can expect to receive an additional $1 per hour. Gov. Gina Raimondo signed a bill into law Tuesday that raises the minimum wage from $10.50 to $11.50, effective Oct. 1. The state House of Representatives passed the legislation in February. Some Republicans voted against the bill, saying the steadily rising wage threatens to hurt employers and could lead to job losses. Some Democrats supported the bill, though they had wanted a higher raise. The minimum wage has increased multiple times since 2012, when it was $7.40. It was bumped up from $10.10 to $10.50 at the beginning of 2019. The hourly rate in Massachusetts is $12.75, and Maine‚Äôs is $12. Connecticut‚Äôs minimum wage is $11.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The House passed the state‚Äôs $10 billion budget Wednesday, putting additional money into teacher salaries, roads, safety at state prisons, and tax relief and rebates. The House finished work on the spending plan a day earlier than usual, much faster than expected given that lawmakers had $1.8 billion more to spend this year than last. The biggest debate of the week was over raises for state employees. The spending plan offers $42 million for extra pay but sends the pool of money to agency leaders to decide who gets raises and how much. Democrats wanted to offer an across-the-board increase ‚Äì a 5% or 2.5% raise for all state employees that would be funded by reducing tax cuts ‚Äì because they said it would take possible favoritism out of the equation. ‚ÄúNot everybody in state government has the luxury of knowing somebody in this chamber,‚Äù said Democratic Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter of Orangeburg.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe passed a referendum to legalize medical and recreational marijuana on the Pine Ridge Reservation, according to preliminary results from the tribe‚Äôs election commission. A proposal to allow alcohol in the tribe‚Äôs casino failed. In the tally from all precincts announced Wednesday morning, both medical and recreational marijuana passed by wide margins, with 82% of voters approving medical marijuana and 74% approving recreational pot. The alcohol proposal failed by 12 percentage points. The Oglala Sioux will become the only Native American tribe to set up a cannabis market in a state where it‚Äôs otherwise illegal. Chase Iron Eyes, a spokesperson for the tribe‚Äôs president, Julian Bear Runner, said the vote reflected the difference in how many tribal members perceive alcohol and marijuana. He called alcohol a ‚Äúpoison‚Äù that was forced on the tribe but marijuana a ‚Äúhealing plant‚Äù that presented a path out of poverty and historical trauma.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is recruiting volunteers to adopt a trail, according to a news release from the park. Trail volunteers are asked to hike at least one designated trail four times each year and submit a report on conditions. With 848 miles of maintained trails, the information volunteers provide is critical to helping trail maintenance staff prioritize work, according to the release. The cooperation helps ensure that trails remain accessible to visitors. Volunteers should be comfortable hiking in the backcountry and enjoy interaction with visitors, according to the release. A 3-hour training session is required. Information on adopting a trail and other volunteer opportunities is available at the Friends of the Smokies website under the ‚Äúvolunteer‚Äù tab.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of driving while intoxicated after his wife called police to their house over an argument, according to court records released Tuesday. The Infowars founder was booked into an Austin jail shortly after midnight and released on bond a few hours later, Travis County Sheriff‚Äôs Office spokeswoman Kristen Dark said. Jones, 46, had a ‚Äústrong odor of alcohol‚Äù coming from him, and his blood-alcohol level was recorded at .076 and .079, according to court records. In Texas, the legal blood alcohol limit is .08%. Jones was also allegedly unable to complete sobriety tests, losing his balance and failing to touch heel to toe. An attorney for Jones did not immediately return a message seeking comment Tuesday. An article posted on his Infowars website suggested he was pulled over for going 5 miles per hour over the speed limit. The article mentions Jones having a ‚Äúsmall amount of sake‚Äù with his wife at dinner but does not mention an argument.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: All six women in the state Senate walked out in protest and refused to vote before the chamber passed a bill mandating that a woman be shown an ultrasound before receiving an abortion. Republican Sen. Deidre Henderson said the walkout late Tuesday was a spontaneous decision to underscore concerns about the ‚Äúinvasive nature‚Äù of the bill. The six female lawmakers ‚Äì two Republicans and four Democrats ‚Äì would not have changed the outcome. Five Republican men voted against the measure that passed 16-7. Henderson said she opposes abortion, but the mandatory ultrasound proposal went too far. It would require showing a pregnant woman images and making the fetal heartbeat audible, if possible. Women now get an ultrasound before abortions, but providers aren‚Äôt required to show them the results. Under the bill, doctors could be fined $100,000 or more if they don‚Äôt.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The City Council has voted to guarantee local law enforcement cannot report a person‚Äôs citizenship status to federal immigration agents. The council voted 11 to 1 Monday night in support of a resolution written by Councilor Perri Freeman, WCAX-TV reports. The resolution amends the Fair and Impartial Policing Policy adopted by the city in 2017. The resolution came in response to concerns about potential loopholes in protections for immigrants in the policy. Activists contended that immigrants living in Burlington should not have to fear that local law enforcement officers are working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But Burlington Interim Police Chief Jennifer Morrison said that the council‚Äôs decision violates federal law and could put federal funding at risk.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Hunters killed a record number of American black bears during the state‚Äôs 2019-2020 hunting season, according to data from the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. Hunters reported 3,540 kills during the period, the Virginian-Pilot reports, citing data from the department. That‚Äôs about 840 more bears than were recorded during the 2018-2019 season, said Stephanie Simek, the department‚Äôs bear project leader. American black bears are the only species of bear in the state, and the department said it extended the hunting season for the animals by up to a week in some areas in order to try to stabilize rising populations. Depending on the area, some hunting seasons started in late September or early October and continued through the first week of January, the newspaper said.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: People in the state remain sharply divided on whether four federal hydroelectric dams along the Snake River should be removed to help endangered salmon and orca recover, a state report concluded. The final version of the report said the dams bring benefits and liabilities to the region, and there is no clear consensus in the state on whether they should be retained. ‚Äú‚ÄòThey have boosted the economy and local communities in southeast Washington but have also harmed tribal and fishing communities throughout the Pacific Northwest,‚Äù said the report, released by Gov. Jay Inslee. The contentious issue of removing the dams has been kicking around the Northwest for a couple of decades and largely breaks along political lines. Republicans tend to favor keeping the dams, while Democrats tend to be more open to removing them.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: More than 200 properties in a historic district have been added to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Park Service approved the addition of the South Wheeling area last week, news outlets report. The area includes historic properties between 31st and 41st streets from Chapline Street to West Virginia 2. Wheeling Heritage and the Wheeling Historic Landmarks Commission oversaw the project. ‚ÄúSouth Wheeling as a historic district is important because it recognizes the industrial and vernacular architecture of Wheeling,‚Äù said Betsy Sweeny, historic preservation program manager for Wheeling Heritage. Along with giving the properites recognition, the listing makes property owners eligible for tax incentives and opportunities, such as the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit, Sweeny said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Nine out of 10 students in the class of 2019 completed high school within four years, continuing an upward trend, the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction reported Tuesday. The state‚Äôs graduation rate has increased 1.6% over the past five years. It is 90% in 2019, up from 89.6% in 2018 and 88.6% in 2017. There were also improvements among smaller subgroups of students, including blacks, Hispanics and those learning how to speak English. Black students in the class of 2019 graduated in four years at 71.3%, a 2-point increase from the previous year and a 7.3-point improvement over the past five years. The 82.8% graduation rate for Hispanic students increased a half-point between 2018 and 2019. English-language learners saw a 4.5-percentage-point increase from the prior year, with a 74.6% graduation rate in 2019. That was up 12.4 points over the past five years, the education department said.\n\nWyoming\n\nRock Springs: The Bureau of Land Management has scheduled multiple adoption events in southwestern Wyoming for about 40 wild horses that were corralled in October. People can look over and adopt the horses at the Rock Springs Wild Horse Holding Facility this Friday and Saturday and April 24-25, the Rocket-Miner reports. Animals will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, according to a statement by the agency. Gates will open at 9 a.m., and load-out begins at 1 p.m. and continues until 3:30 p.m. each day. Anyone at least 18 years of age and wishing to adopt must fill out an application, have it approved by the agency and pay a $25 adoption fee for each horse, the statement said. If approved, adopters must make their own arrangements to transport the horses from the adoption facility.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/10/10/wilmington-police-sharing-less-information-violent-crime/3309533002/", "title": "Wilmington going from 'Murder Town' to 'Mystery Town'", "text": "Last fall, Wilmington police began reducing the amount of information they provide to the public about violent crime.\n\nSome of the information they release is sparse, creates more questions than answers or is presented in a way that makes the incident look less severe.\n\nAnd more recently, that information is often withheld from the public for days or weeks.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/10"}]}

At least two other big-city police departments have made similar moves in recent years.\n\n‚ÄúSo the catch up is really about getting the applicant pool much wider, much more experienced, and more importantly, much more diverse as we fill our vacancies,‚Äù Brown said Tuesday.\n\nPhiladelphia used to require some college for officers, but changed that policy to help ease a staffing shortage. That city‚Äôs former commissioner called the lowering of standards an ‚Äúembarrassment.‚Äù New Orleans police also jettisoned a 60-hour requirement, and the education requirement for new recruits is a GED or high school diploma. That move was also in response to staffing shortages.\n\nDuring a news conference last week, New York City Mayor Eric Adams applauded Chicago‚Äôs recruitment practices after a trip to the city to meet with Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hearing all over the country that there is a requirement problem with police officers,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere were historical barriers that were preventing people from using life experiences to have waivers.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to look to duplicate that in New York City and so in the brief conversation I had, I know that this is an entry way to learn from each other,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe want to look at best practices of how do we finally turn the generational problem of crime in our cities.‚Äù\n\nThere‚Äôs a broader trend of relaxing standards\n\nPolice departments across the country are struggling to maintain their workforces, according to recent survey data compiled by the Police Executive Research Forum. According to their findings, collected from about 180 police departments of various sizes:\n\n‚Ä¢ There were 42.7% more resignations in 2021 than in 2019.\n\n‚Ä¢ Agencies of all sizes reported substantial increases in resignations from 2019 to 2021.\n\n‚Ä¢ There were 23.6% more retirements in 2021 than in 2019.\n\n‚Ä¢ Agencies of all sizes reported an increase in retirements from 2019 to 2020, and large agencies saw the largest increase.\n\n‚ÄúThe job has become much more demanding, complicated, sophisticated in terms of technology, in terms of writing, all of the tools ‚Äì judgment, decision making ‚Äì all of the things we expect that translates into police officers of future,‚Äù said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. ‚ÄúIf you want to change American police culture, you need to hire the best and the brightest. I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs where we are today given what we‚Äôre seeing.‚Äù\n\nWexler said that not everyone who‚Äôs gone to college goes on to become a good police officer ‚Äì ‚ÄúI know some people who‚Äôve gone to college and they‚Äôre complete idiots, absolutely no common sense‚Äù ‚Äì and there‚Äôs value in hiring older candidates with life experience who‚Äôve been in the workforce or couldn‚Äôt go to school because they‚Äôre raising a family.\n\nBut broadly, dropping the education requirement is ‚Äúworrisome,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe do know a more educated workforce is, you‚Äôre getting a candidate pool (that) recognizes importance of education.‚Äù The Chicago move is part of a broader trend of relaxing standards to entice more people into becoming police officers.\n\nRelaxing standards could mean allowing tattoos or prior use of marijuana. ‚ÄúBut also looking at things, like, how do you attract a larger base of candidates to choose from. If you talk to any chief today, they will tell you they‚Äôre just not seeing the same number of people they‚Äôve seen in years,‚Äù Wexler said.\n\nLife experience makes ‚Äòa very big difference‚Äô\n\nIn Chicago, about 3,800 people took the police department‚Äôs entry exam over the four months it was offered in 2021. As many as 22,000 took the exam in 2018, about 14,000 applicants in 2016, and about 19,000 applicants in 2013.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department‚Äôs attrition rate more than doubled from 4% in 2020 to 8.5% in 2021, according to Brown. Chicago police declined to comment on how many people took recent entrance exams, or were hired from those exams, but called the pool of candidates ‚Äúvery small.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe 60 hours of college credit requirement can be prohibitive,‚Äù Brown said two weeks ago at a news conference. A deputy chief, at the same news conference, said that ‚Äúlife experience really does make a very big difference.‚Äù\n\nBrown said the restrictions on recruit class sizes early in the pandemic to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 had an impact on the overall attrition rate, as well as an outbreak of Covid-19 in the summer of 2020 that prompted a shutdown of the police academy.\n\nChicago‚Äôs most recent recruit class in February was 48% female, 65% Hispanic, Brown said. The racial and ethnic makeup of the department in its entirety includes 20% African American, 4% Asian, 45% White, 30% Hispanic and ‚Äúvarious other categories of diversity‚Äù that account for 1% of officers, he added. The city, as of the most recent census, is 33% White, 29.2% Black, and 28.6% Hispanic or Latino. That changed slightly from 10 years earlier, when the city‚Äôs Black population was larger.\n\nMigdalia Bulnes, deputy chief of the newly created recruiting team for the agency, said that their goal was to open the pool of applicants to people who have work experience but were not able to attend college to obtain the 60 credit hours required for the job.\n\n‚ÄúThere are many, many people just like that in our communities,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey are leaders, they have a job, they have experience, they have communication, they‚Äôre making decisions, they‚Äôre filling out reports. So those were the individuals that we thought of when we started talking about this program and exactly what we wanted to see come into this police department.‚Äù", "authors": ["Rebekah Riess Emma Tucker Peter Nickeas", "Rebekah Riess", "Emma Tucker", "Peter Nickeas"], "publish_date": "2022/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/2021/12/17/surge-leisure-hiring-november-brings-down-ohio-unemployment-rate/8937441002/", "title": "Surge in leisure hiring in November brings down Ohio ...", "text": "A surge in hiring in the badly damaged leisure and hospitality sector helped push Ohio's unemployment rate down last month and the total number of jobs in the state to a new high since the pandemic started nearly two years ago.\n\nOhio's unemployment rate hit 4.8% last month, down from 5.1% in October, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services reported Friday. The only time the rate has been lower since the coronavirus pandemic began was when it was 4.7% in March and April.\n\nThe rate also was 4.7% in February 2020, right before the pandemic struck and shut down much of the state and national economies.\n\nOhio employers added 12,200 jobs last month, led by a gain of 8,000 jobs in the leisure and hospitality sector that includes restaurants and hotels.\n\nThat sector now has 518,400 workers, the most since the pandemic began but about 60,000 below where it was February 2020, state jobs data show.\n\nThe construction sector added 2,800 jobs last month, and the professional and business services sectors added 2,200 jobs.

The toll of burnout is contributing to ...", "text": "New data shows teacher shortages remain just as widespread as they were in the summer, though the average number of vacancies has slightly declined.\n\nThe scale of the problem varies significantly by region, district, school, subject and grade level. Many areas have all the teachers they need.\n\nThe pay and pressures of the job are major ‚Äì though hardly the only ‚Äì reasons some schools are struggling to fill certain teaching positions.\n\nSeveral years ago, Naomi Norman, superintendent of Washtenaw Intermediate School District in Michigan, had a conversation that changed her perspective on the needs of the teaching profession. It was with a special education teaching assistant adored by the school community and a natural at working with children with complex learning needs.\n\nSpecial education teachers were, and remain, hard to come by. The field needed people precisely like this paraprofessional to fill those roles, Norman thought, so why hadn‚Äôt he considered pursuing a degree to become a professional teacher?\n\nThe aide explained he was the breadwinner for a family of five children and already working a second job to make do. He couldn‚Äôt afford to quit his day job, give up health insurance and go back to school, much less pay the tuition. Michigan is on the lower end when it comes to paraprofessional pay, with an average salary of less than $27,000, according to ZipRecruiter data.\n\nThe aide ended up leaving the education sector altogether soon after that. It‚Äôs become one of Norman‚Äôs missions to reduce such barriers into, and turnover from, the profession.\n\nFast-forward to the pandemic era: Special education teachers are even harder to come by, many of those barriers remain intact, and headlines have warned for months about catastrophic school staffing shortages nationwide.\n\nNorman‚Äôs experience offers a glimpse into why vacancies have remained so stubborn at some schools. Here‚Äôs what you need to know about the state of teacher shortages, now that schools are close to halfway done with the school year.\n\nRemote learning took its toll:The teacher shortages are just piling on.\n\nIs there truly a teacher shortage?\n\nThere is no national teacher shortage. Many classrooms have all the educators they need and in some cases never had vacancies to begin with.\n\nYet shortages in many others persist. Staffing levels can vary significantly by state, district, school, subject and grade level.\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has been regularly surveying a nationally representative sample of schools about various topics, including staff vacancies, in the COVID-19 era. According to its latest School Pulse Panel survey, from October, nearly half (45%) of public schools have at least one vacant teaching position, about the same rate as when the survey was done in January. The average number of vacancies per school, however, dropped from slightly more than three in June to two this October.\n\nGenerally speaking, 4% of teaching positions across the nation remained vacant, the October survey shows. But zooming in by subject area reveals significant variation.\n\nSpecial education continues to have it worst, with 7% of positions unfilled. English-language-learning programs are also especially understaffed (6%), as is computer science (5%). Areas with the fewest vacancies: social studies and English/language arts, at just 2% each.\n\nIs there a teacher shortage? Here's what the data says.\n\nWhy are there shortages of teachers?\n\nMyriad reasons: low pay and morale, mounting political and academic pressures, health and safety concerns. A generation of teachers hitting or nearing retirement and another generation of prospective teachers deterred by the profession‚Äôs flailing reputation and the sacrifices it necessitates.\n\n‚ÄúWe all know that our educators work very hard, and it‚Äôs not news to anyone that they often work beyond their required hours,‚Äù said NCES Commissioner Peggy Carr in a news briefing announcing results of a separate survey of teachers and principals. It showed teachers and principals work 52 hours and 58 hours a week on average, respectively.\n\nAccording to that same survey, 17% of teachers work elsewhere at another job.\n\nThere are also hurdles to joining the workforce, like those Norman, the Washtenaw school district superintendent in Ann Arbor, Michigan, described.\n\nSome state and district leaders are working to remove them, including a newly formed consortium of Michigan school systems aiming to bolster the pipeline into teaching. Norman is helping spearhead the initiative and piloting a grow-your-own program in her district, a regional agency that oversees the county‚Äôs special education services. The program has thus far paid three cohorts of 25 paraprofessionals each to earn teaching degrees and become certified special education teachers while continuing to work.\n\nThe program has created a ‚Äúnatural network‚Äù of professionals who can fill the area‚Äôs perennial special education vacancies, Norman said. But ‚Äúit‚Äôs not just a position filled. It‚Äôs a person supported. They're walking into that role with a huge net of support around them.‚Äù\n\nLack of such support has been another big reason some schools struggle to fill positions. COVID-19 aside, these challenges are not new ‚Äì nor are some of the shortages.\n\nWhich states have the worst teacher shortages right now?\n\nIt‚Äôs hard to say definitively. States don‚Äôt collect all the necessary data in a consistent, comprehensive or timely manner. One recent working paper analyzed available data and found that vacancies were particularly pronounced in Florida, Illinois and Arizona.\n\nIf national labor figures are any indication, teacher turnover has remained relatively stable since before the pandemic. But those statistics obscure what‚Äôs happening on the ground in many communities.\n\nAnother recent working paper focused on Tennessee, examining data from the beginning of 2019-20. Relatively few schools had vacancies, but the ones that did were spread throughout the state ‚Äì most regions had at least one school with positions they couldn‚Äôt fill.\n\nTest scores fell during the pandemic:How did your state fare?\n\nHow are teacher shortages affecting students?\n\nShortages tend to be worse in low-income areas. Fifty-seven percent of high-poverty schools that participated in the October School Pulse Panel reported at least one teaching vacancy, including well over a third with multiple openings. The same was true for 41% of low-poverty schools, less than a quarter of which reported multiple vacancies.\n\nSimilar disparities emerge when looking at the racial composition of schools. Sixty percent of those where at least three-quarters of students are people of color have one or more vacancies, compared with less than a third of those where at least three-quarters of students are white.\n\nThat means the shortages are concentrated at schools whose students were hit hardest by the academic disruptions of the pandemic.\n\nIn other words, the children arguably most in need of qualified teachers are also most likely to attend schools who don‚Äôt have enough.\n\nKeep reading USA TODAY's education reporting in 2023 for more on teachers and the teaching profession.\n\nContact Alia Wong at (202) 507-2256 or awong@usatoday.com.

On Nov. 8, Republican challenger and state Sen. Darren Bailey, R-Xenia, will face Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker in a race mired with major issues and big money.\n\nKent Redfield, a retired professor with the University of Illinois and the Institute for Government and Public Affairs, sees a race playing along three regions in the state: Chicago, downstate and the suburbs.\n\nTwo regions ‚àí Chicago and downstate ‚àí are essentially wrapped up for Pritzker and Bailey respectively. The battleground areas, Redfield says, are the suburbs primarily in the collar counties surrounding Chicago.\n\n\"You can make a difference there,\" he said. \"You can grow or shrink.\"\n\nMore:8-year-old boy and 3-year-old girl die after families contacted by Illinois DCFS\n\nAt a press conference held earlier this week, Bailey stood before the Department of Children and Family Services building to, as he put it, to \"discuss problems.\" This tactic, one where he attacked Pritzker and DCFS Director Marc Smith for the department's shortcomings, is the playbook Redfield projects will carry out in months to come.\n\n\"Bailey wants people to focus on what are the specific problems in terms of governing in Illinois and what are Pritzker's failings,\" he said.\n\nA similar strategy was used by former Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, said Redfield, whose campaign attacking Democrat weaknesses lead to the unseating of then-Gov. Pat Quinn in 2014.\n\nWhat he will try to avoid is past comments on abortion, where he previously supported a complete ban before backing away from that stance.\n\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wadeby the Supreme Court and ongoing legislation efforts regarding marriage equality and contraceptives could energize women's rights and LGBTQ+ groups around Pritzker, Redfield said.\n\nRedfield said Pritzker also will continue trying to portray Bailey, endorsed by former President Donald Trump, as radical. Such was the method of primary ads from the Democratic Governors Association which labeled the Republican candidate as \"too extreme.\"\n\nDuring that conference, points of emphasis made by Bailey included high numbers vacant positions within DCFS, improper vaccination protocols, and two deaths ‚àí one 8-year-old boy and one 3-year-old girl ‚àí that after DCFS contacted the families.\n\n\"I don't know what world that JB lives in, but this is not progress,\" said Bailey on Tuesday in front of the DCFS building on Monroe Street. \"This is incompetence of tragic proportions.\"\n\nThe State Journal-Register attempted to speak with the candidate to discuss how the department would operate if he was elected. After several phone calls, emails and text messages, there was no response.\n\nBailey sits on the state Child Care Accessibility & Early Childhood Education Committee, which received a $142 million request from DCFS in the previous legislative session to \"do their job more adequately,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Bailey, the department would already have $12 million unspent by the end of Fiscal Year 2022, which ended July 1. In FY 2021, DCFS had a remainder of $28 million unspent.\n\n\"That is gross negligence,\" said Bailey. \"I asked the question 'Where this money went?' I got no reply. I asked the question 'Why it wasn't spent?' I got no reply.\"\n\n\"This administration under Marc Smith's leadership has failed not only the organization, but the families and children in this state.\"\n\nBailey's chances of working with DCFS as governor, however, are met with him trailing in campaign funds and recent post-primary poll numbers.\n\nThe Republican had less than $365,000 in his campaign fund as of June 28, per filings submitted to the Illinois Board of Elections. Pritzker, who is financing his own campaign, had $60.8 million available in the his most recent filing as of July 15.\n\nAccording to Victory Research, Pritzker also holds a near 10-point lead over Bailey in its poll released last week and dominating the Chicago area.\n\nOf those surveyed, 78% in Chicago said they would vote for Pritzker compared to 13% choosing Bailey. The Republican challenger, however had leads in the central, western and southern parts of the state.\n\nBailey, who has referred to Chicago as a \"hellhole,\" did however pick up an endorsement from John Catanzara, president of Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 7, on Wednesday.\n\nContact Patrick Keck: 312-549-9340, pkeck@gannett.com, twitter.com/@pkeckreporter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/us/police-departments-struggle-recruit-retain-officers/index.html", "title": "Why police forces are struggling to recruit and keep officers | CNN", "text": "Durham, North Carolina CNN ‚Äî\n\nIn a growing number of American cities, if you call the police, there are fewer officers taking the call.\n\nPolice departments across the nation are raising concerns about current and future staffing levels. CNN reached out to nearly 20 departments nationwide, along with other key stakeholders including elected officials, union officials and outside recruiters for departments for this story.\n\nThey all point to similar concerns including Covid-19, the great resignation, the climate for law enforcement and local reform efforts that are making recruitment and retention difficult.\n\nThe challenges have led the chief of police in Durham, North Carolina, to join her officers in patrolling her own city. The department is down 90 officers out of a budgeted force of 627. The department has started to offer a $5,000 bonus for new hires to fill its ranks.\n\nDurham, North Carolina, Police Department Headquarters. CNN\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been tough,‚Äù Chief Patrice Andrews said of the current staffing issues facing her city. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had to be very creative with staffing, you know, putting investigators and those that typically wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be taking 911 calls, putting them back on the street.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe 911 calls don‚Äôt stop. People are still having emergencies, the emergencies don‚Äôt stop and certainly the emergencies don‚Äôt care if you are 60% staffed or below,‚Äù Andrews told CNN while she was on patrol. ‚ÄúThis profession is, is something we were all called to do and not everyone is meant to be the police. This profession is certainly a noble one, even yet and still, despite everything, this profession is certainly noble.‚Äù\n\nA national survey from June of 2021 found that departments around the country on average were filling 93% of budgeted positions available, according to the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a workforce that‚Äôs being compressed on the front end, you‚Äôve got a drop in people who want to be cops. And on the other end, you have a significant increase in people who are resigning and retiring. And we have a survey that we did (that found a) 44% increase in retirements, 18% increase in resignations (in police departments),‚Äù according to Police Executive Research Forum President Chuck Wexler.\n\nOn average, officers spend 8 months training before they can patrol the streets alone, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Meaning, it will take years to fill the open jobs at departments across the country, Wexler said.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a trying time to be a police officer in this country,‚Äù Wexler said. ‚ÄúSo, police chiefs are wondering who are going to be the cops of the future.‚Äù\n\nDepartments are also struggling daily to cover those out sick due to Covid-19, and higher rates of crime, Wexler and several departments said.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the department is down 440 officers or 7% of the number of police officers budgeted for the city, the department told CNN.\n\n‚ÄúWell, right now it‚Äôs not a very desirable job,‚Äù John McNesby, head of the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), told CNN. ‚ÄúEverything that‚Äôs been going on around the country for the last couple of years. ‚Ä¶ But right now, I mean just getting people to apply is a monster in itself.‚Äù\n\nDuring a recent recruitment event, 600 people said they would attend, only 200 showed up and only 26 moved on to the physical assessment phases, McNesby said. The FOP also points to a recently passed requirement that requires all applicants to have lived in the city for at least a year, as an additional challenge to find new officers in the city of brotherly love.\n\nIn Atlanta, which like many cities in America also saw unrest in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, two incidents of police use of force also put pressure on the local community. Community outreach events like Clippers and Cops, held in local barbershops around the city, are trying to ‚Äúbridge the gap‚Äù between the community and the police. The events allow officers to open a dialogue between themselves and the citizens who they serve and protect, participants say.\n\nAtlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant, left, with Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens. CNN\n\nDuring an appearance at the event this month, Andre Dickens, the newly elected mayor of Atlanta, said he is working to get the police department back to full strength.\n\n‚ÄúThe goal is to be smart on crime, and so we have to have a balanced approach to safety and justice,‚Äù Dickens said. ‚ÄúThat means getting more officers in because we lost about 400 to 500 officers over the past three years. So I‚Äôm trying to get those 400 officers back, but training them in conflict resolution and skills on how to de-escalate issues so that they can be better community-based cops.‚Äù\n\nThe mayor said a number of issues contributed to the decrease in the rank and file. ‚ÄúThere was a morale challenge across the last couple of years with Covid and with a lot of issues related to police, excessive use of force that went unchecked, but then ‚Ä¶ everybody said get rid of police and these sorts of things,‚Äù Dickens said.\n\nTyrone Dennis CNN\n\nThe founder of Clippers and Cops was one of those 400 officers who left the department. Detective Tyrone Dennis retired from the force in August 2020, moved back to St. Louis, Missouri, to be with his family and took a job as a director of school safety, a job that paid more than being a police officer.\n\n‚ÄúThey got to do better with pay ‚Ä¶ incentives to retain officers,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt would be foolish for me to stay for $48,000. When I have a wife and three kids to feed for $48,000. I can almost qualify for public assistance. That‚Äôs not cool,‚Äù Dennis said.\n\n‚ÄúBasically we‚Äôre one bullet away from death, and one mistake away from indictment so why roll the dice with my future when I can go do something else?‚Äù Dennis said.\n\nPolice leadership also say that pay should be more in line with work requirements. ‚ÄúWhen you think of what the line of work calls for and what they‚Äôre having to do, they‚Äôre wanting to be compensated, you know, but also to they‚Äôve got to be able to support their families. You know, we have officers that can‚Äôt even qualify for apartments because their, their income doesn‚Äôt match up with what the apartments require. That‚Äôs a problem,‚Äù Andrews said.\n\nIn Phoenix, the police department is sending detectives and officers from various specialty assignments to patrol. Last month, the department started to take additional reports virtually rather than send officers out, police department spokesperson Sgt. Andy Williams told CNN.\n\nThe police department is down 13% of its allotment of officers, according to data provided by Phoenix Police to CNN.\n\nIt is offering hiring bonuses of up to $8,700 dollars for new hires with college degrees, the department said.\n\nIn Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Police Chief Catriana A. Thompson says the situation is ‚Äúalarming.‚Äù The department is down 96 officers or 18% of its allotted force. Some of the department‚Äôs ‚Äúspecialized units have been disbanded temporarily until staffing levels improve,‚Äù Thompson told CNN in a statement.\n\nReliant Hiring Solutions, a firm that works with law enforcement around the country to set up job fairs, said it was more difficult to find recruits in more ‚Äúliberal cities,‚Äù Randall Blanchard, told CNN.\n\nIn Seattle, the department is experiencing ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù losses of staff, the department told CNN. The department is short more than 225 officers or 17% of its workforce.\n\n‚ÄúOur losses over the last two years have been unprecedented,‚Äù police department spokesperson Sgt. Randy Hyserik told CNN. ‚ÄúMany of our newer officers separated from our department and moved to smaller agencies in the area, and some left law enforcement altogether. In their exit interviews, many cited the ‚Äòdefund‚Äô movement and a lack of support from local elected officials as their reason for leaving our department, or for leaving law enforcement completely.‚Äù\n\nSeattle‚Äôs attrition rate has over doubled in the last two years. Prior to 2020, the annual attrition rate was 70 to 75 officers a year. The department has had 356 officers leave over the last two years, according to data provided to CNN by the department.\n\nPeople that call police for non-life-threatening calls may have to wait longer for a response, unless staffing levels are improved, ‚Äúyou may be lucky if you get an officer 2, 3, 4 hours down the line,‚Äù McNesby said.\n\n‚ÄúI mean it‚Äôs easier for me to sit here and talk about it,‚Äù McNesby said, ‚Äúbut it really affects the people standing at roll calls in the morning when they look to the left and look to the right and there‚Äôs nobody else there ‚Ä¶ or you have a citizen that‚Äôs on the line ‚Ä¶ where they feel the need for police attention and they dial 911 and you‚Äôre not getting anybody coming.‚Äù", "authors": ["Ryan Young Devon M.

Before Jones' arrival, the administrative position had been open for about a year.\n\n‚ÄúStates do face challenges in recruiting for this key leadership position, especially in rural areas,‚Äù Kafka said.\n\nMore:Trauma & Turnover: State Mental Health Hospital Investigation\n\nFormer HSC administrator David Bean agreed that selling a high-qualified candidate on living in Yankton, with a population of about 15,000, could pose challenges.\n\nBean said he‚Äôd prefer to see the state hire someone similar to Jones, who had previous experience as a hospital administrator at a psychiatric hospital. He said trying to uplift a facility that's experienced some troubles could be a daunting task for a person who isn‚Äôt qualified for the position.\n\nPhyllis Arends, executive director of National Alliance on Mental Illness in Sioux Falls, said she also wants to see an administrator who has previously run a facility. But, she said, the ideal candidate would also have a clinical background as well.\n\nA dearth of mental health professionals in South Dakota contributed to the problems Jones was tasked with trying to fix during his tenure at HSC. The state legislature last year approved a raise for entry-level workers at the state-run hospital in hopes putting Jones in a better position to fill the vacancies.\n\n‚ÄúIn South Dakota, it is well known that we have a terrible work force shortage in the mental health field,\" Arends said. ‚ÄúSo having to reach out beyond the wall of our communities and state needs to be done.‚Äù\n\nMore:Administrator resigns after one year at S.D. mental health hospital\n\nAn Argus Leader Media investigation in 2016 showed workers leaving the state hospital at a rate of about one every three days since July 2008. The number of employees injured by patients has gone up in three of four years, peaking at 222 in the fiscal year 2014. The high turnover was also coupled with low employee morale and violence against employees.\n\nA hiring fair was held in October to fill the dozens of open positions they had which included mental health aides, nurses and counselors. Several hires were made but the pool of employees in Yankton can only produce so many potential employees.\n\nBean said whomever takes over the facilities will still have to work toward finding enough qualified personnel to run the hospital.\n\n‚ÄúThe major challenges are always getting an adequate number of staff,\" Bean said. \"And paying adequate salaries for staff.\"\n\nFollow Mark Walker on Twitter @argusmwalker, call (605) 331-2333 or email mwalker@argusleader.com\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/09/03/job-seekers-share-their-search-stories-tough-covid-19-market-ohio-job-family-services/7429160002/", "title": "Job seekers share their search stories in tough COVID-19 market", "text": "Editor's note: This is Part 2 of a four-part series looking at how businesses and laborers are navigating a worker shortage.\n\nKim Porter spent more than a year trying to find a job comparable to the one she lost due to the pandemic.\n\nHad it not been for a friendly connection with Sundee Porter (no relation) of Holmes County Job and Family Services, the Green resident still might be looking for work.\n\nJob and Family Services and OhioMeansJobs.com are one path job seekers may use as they try to find a position that fulfills their career objectives.\n\nOhio's unemployment rate was 5.4% in July, up from 5.2% in June, with 301,000 workers jobless, according to state Department of Job and Family Services data. While there are plenty of jobs available across Ohio, finding a secure, high-paying position with advancement opportunities can be challenging.\n\nPorter, whose job search is ongoing, and another local resident who found a new career path, share their stories.\n\nWorkers Part 1:A worker shortage already existed for most industries, the pandemic made it worse\n\nFind jobs:Ashland, Holmes, and Wayne work together to help unemployed find jobs in a new industry\n\nGetting on track to finding a job\n\nPorter had nearly three decades of experience in management and administration when she lost her job at Med Spa in Green when COVID-19 led to the shutdown of many businesses.\n\nShe's working part time at a Med Spa in Cleveland while she looks for full-time employment.\n\n\"Since losing my job in March of 2020, getting interviews has been the hardest part; getting people to stand up and pay attention to my experience.\"\n\nShe sent out hundreds of resumes and went on roughly 10 interviews.\n\n\"When you've been in the workforce as long as I have, it's frustrating,\" Porter said. \"I have 30 years experience, and some people don't want to pay for that. I was pretty open and flexible about salary for the most part, and I think the fact that I'm pushing 60 might have had something to do with it.\"\n\nPorter didn't mind commuting 30 minutes but finding a full-time position with benefits proved difficult.\n\n\"I've got all this experience in management. It was tough to go from making $5,000 a month to nothing,\" she said.\n\nPorter broadened her horizons, and was willing to try a new field, but she felt more comfortable working in the health care industry.\n\nShe was getting nowhere with the unemployment bureau in Summit County and had no money coming in.\n\n\"A friend of mine, who had also been laid off, connected me with Sundee at Holmes JFS,\" Porter said. \"She's been like a godsend to me.

She was married and was not in the workforce. Later, she got a part-time job in retail.\n\nThe store where she worked shut down during the early stages of the pandemic. Swartzentruber divorced during that time and turned to unemployment.\n\nThrough Ohio Job and Family Services in Wooster she learned there was a need for health care workers, \"but I wasn't going to go to school to be a nurse.\"\n\n\"I looked into home health care, where it seemed there was a big need,\" she said.\n\nA state grant helped her pay for classes to become a certified state tested nursing assistant (STNA). Swartzentruber said she worked for a company 180 days then applied through Medicare for a license to provide home health care.\n\nAround the first of April, Swartzentruber began working for herself and makes her own hours working with her clients to accommodate their needs. She gets paid directly through the government.\n\n\"I've come a long way,\" she said. \"I did my research and was diligent in doing my homework to find this career, but help was right here all along.\"\n\nFinding the money for classes and training was one of the biggest hurdles she had to overcome. Swartzentruber said she wanted to find a meaningful career in a stable field.\n\n\"I am so proud of where I am and what the county did for me. I want people to know that help is out there,\" Swartzentruber said. \"I had no income when I was out of work, so I got food stamps. That really helped.

But he said he has never seen a worse case of child abuse and neglect than he saw Tuesday.\n\nHarwood was the coroner in the case of 8-year-old Navin Jones, who died Tuesday evening at OSF Healthcare St. Francis Medical Center in Peoria. Navin was in the care of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, but his body was found at his parents‚Äô home. Jones‚Äô family had been in contact with DCFS before his death, according to DCFS spokesman William McCaffrey.\n\nStephanie Jones, 35, and Brandon Walker, 40, Navin‚Äôs parents, face first-degree murder charges in connection with the boy‚Äôs death.\n\nMore:Peoria boy, 8, weighed 30 pounds, had signs of physical abuse when he died, prosecutor says\n\n‚ÄúI think there should be a hefty internal investigation by DCFS into this case,‚Äù Harwood said. ‚ÄúAnd if there were failures, those should be remedied.‚Äù\n\nThe Peoria Journal Star reported Peoria County State‚Äôs Attorney Dave Kenny said during the arraignment for Navin‚Äôs parents that the boy weighed 30 pounds and was living in deplorable conditions. The child was last seen in late October or early November, when he was in ‚Äúrelatively good health,‚Äù according to the newspaper report.\n\nHarwood declined to comment on Navin‚Äôs condition at the time of his death, citing the pending investigation, but did say the cause of his death was homicide and the manner was abuse and neglect.\n\nEighty miles due north of Peoria in Nelson, another coroner was investigating the death of 3-year-old Tamsin Miracle Sauer. She died in a Sterling hospital in Whiteside County on Saturday. The manner and cause of her death is still under investigation.\n\nTamsin‚Äôs family also had contact with DCFS, McCaffrey said.\n\nEarlier story:DCFS Director Marc Smith held in contempt of court for 7th time in 10 weeks\n\nAgency says it is aggressively hiring\n\nAlso on Tuesday, DCFS Director Marc Smith filed the first annual report on the department‚Äôs plan to address investigator caseloads as a requirement of a federal consent decree. That report, filed in a court document, showed there is a current statewide rolling vacancy percentage of 21 percent, and DCFS has a goal of reducing it to 6 percent or less.\n\nDCFS stated in the report that it is aggressively hiring, having added 198 investigators to the payroll since March 2021, but due to the high number of employees leaving and retiring, the overall headcount went up by only a dozen investigators.\n\nThe agency pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic and a labor crisis, coupled with rising child abuse investigations across the state, as obstacles to meeting that goal.\n\nCook County Public Guardian Charles Golbert, whose office represents about 7,100 children in state care, said Thursday that if DCFS had been keeping up with hiring over the past few decades it would not be in such straits now.\n\n‚ÄúIt's clear that when DCFS's investigators labor under untenable caseloads without the supports that they need, in violation of court orders, both children and the investigators alike are at risk of serious harm and even death,‚Äù Golbert said in a phone call. ‚ÄúI fear that until DCFS gets its investigator caseloads down to reasonable levels, as mandated under a federal court order that is now more than 30 years old, we will continue to see children harmed.‚Äù\n\nGolbert also mentioned the January death of DCFS investigator Deidre Silas as an impediment to hiring.\n\n‚ÄúIf the investigators have caseloads that are too high, that‚Äôs dangerous for kids and for workers,‚Äù Golbert said.\n\nIn the motion filed by DCFS on Tuesday, the 12-month average of investigations in March 2021 was 6,535. That rose to 7,726 in March 2022. An increase in reporting may be attributable to children having more contact with mandated reporters, such as teachers and doctors, as the pandemic eases. The increase may also be attributable to an increase in family stress, such as financial pressures.\n\nMore:After homicide of Peoria boy, investigation reopened into half-brother's death\n\nIn addition to recruiting and retention efforts, DCFS is conducting weekend ‚Äúblitzes,‚Äù moving staff from other locations to volunteer for weekend shifts to help with completing investigations. In DCFS‚Äôs northern region, the agency conducted 13 blitzes where 148 staff worked a combined 2,500 weekend hours to help with investigations.\n\nLast year, the court granted a three-year extension to DCFS to meet caseworker hiring goals. The parties agreed to make changes in 1991, but 30 years later the agency is still struggling to be in full compliance with the decree.\n\nThe deaths of Navin and Tamsin are the latest cases of children who have died after having contact with DCFS. Since January, Sophia Faye Davis, 1; Damari Perry, 6; and Zaraz Walker, 7 months, have died from child abuse.\n\nDirector faces eight contempt charges\n\nIn addition, DCFS Director Smith has faced eight contempt of court citations from a Cook County Judge. The contempt citations are based on improper placements for children in state care.\n\nLast week, Smith was cited for contempt for the eighth time from Cook County Circuit Judge Patrick Murphy.\n\nThe latest case involves a 14-year-old girl who entered DCFS care in September. She has been in 21 placements in her time with DCFS, according to a release by the Cook County Public Guardian‚Äôs Office. Those placements included time in a locked psychiatric ward, hospital emergency rooms, emergency foster homes and, most recently, in a temporary shelter. In December, DCFS recommended a residential placement for the girl.\n\nIn two of the eight cases, the contempt order was purged when the children were placed in their recommended setting. Those two cases involved:\n\n* An 8-year-old girl placed in a locked psychiatric hospital unnecessarily for more than seven months.\n\n* A 13-year-old boy kept in a ‚Äútemporary‚Äù shelter in Mount Vernon ‚Äì nearly five hours away from his family ‚Äì for nearly five months. Before the shelter, DCFS placed him in a utility room in an office.\n\nIn the other five previous cases, the contempt order remains in place and the children remain in their present settings. Those cases involve:\n\n* A 17-year-old boy who was placed in a locked psychiatric hospital for more than four months beyond medical necessity.\n\n* A 16-year-old girl housed in 25 different places in two months, including hospitals, emergency shelters, a shelter in Indiana, and temporary foster homes. Before that, she was in a locked psychiatric hospital for nearly two months after it was recommended that she be moved.\n\n* An 11-year-old girl medically approved for discharge from a locked psychiatric hospital for nearly a year waiting for a transfer to a residential placement.\n\n* A 15-year-old girl placed in a locked psychiatric hospital since Dec. 6, 2021 ‚Äì approximately three months waiting for transfer to a specialized foster home.\n\n* A 16-year-old boy who spent more than 375 days in a temporary shelter that was unable to meet his highly specialized needs given his low intellectual function.\n\nEach of the seven children in these cases is represented by the Cook County public guardian‚Äôs office. The orders for contempt were signed by Judge Murphy, who served for 25 years as the Cook County Public Guardian.\n\nHarwood, the coroner in Navin‚Äôs case, knows about DCFS. He and his husband became foster parents in 2017 and eventually adopted his son, Jacob, who was taken into state care after he was born prematurely to a mother who struggled with addiction.\n\nWhen Jacob‚Äôs biological mother died from drug exposure months after his birth, Harwood was the responding coroner. Harwood said he‚Äôs troubled by the death of the 8-year-old who died in his county Tuesday, while grateful for his own son, who was once a state ward.\n\n‚ÄúWe were lucky. He is our miracle,‚Äù Harwood said.\n\nCapitol News Illinois is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news service covering state government and distributed to more than 400 newspapers statewide.

Now, the Springfield Police Department is looking to hire another 15 in January as its staffing level is double-digit percentage points below its desired roster size.\n\nSPD Chief Kenny Winslow said he now has the green light from Springfield Mayor Jim Langfelder to hire as many officers as possible. But a competitive market and slow hiring and onboarding process has continued to put the department in a staffing bind.\n\nIn his quarterly report to the Springfield City Council, Winslow said SPD has had to essentially \"cannibalize\" every unit and shift rotation to use the most of its staff, which has 194 active and 30 inactive officers, according to preliminary quarterly numbers, well below the desired staffing level of 250.\n\nMore:Out on Adams officially opens; proceeds from LGBTQ merchandise will benefit Phoenix Center\n\n\"We're constantly hiring and recruiting,\" Winslow said, calling it a 365-day-a-year process. He compared it to colleges recruiting athletes, saying that SPD has to showcase incentives to compete with other departments from what is becoming a smaller and smaller recruiting class.\n\nA mixture of political factors and economic ramifications from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has contributed to shortages in a plethora of industries, has resulted in a smaller and smaller recruiting for SPD to choose candidates from. It most recently sent a class of 14 to a regional police academy. Winslow said SPD hoped to send 16 for training but two candidates backed out.\n\n\"There's a lot of guys, girls internalizing what they see on social media, what they see on TV and say 'I'm out,'\" Winslow said, speaking to growing calls for accountability and oversight into local police departments in light of a renewed nationwide focus into systemic racism and police brutality.\n\nMore:Top 5 takeaways from Week 9 of Illinois high school football in Springfield\n\nRegardless of the external factors, Winslow said he's confident SPD will be able to put together a full recruiting class and that the department will be able to slowly grow and return to pre-pandemic staffing levels.\n\nInternally, Winslow recognized that if the city knew in fall 2020 the immediate economic outlook, particularly how much money Springfield would get from the federal American Rescue Plan Act, it would've likely hired 16 officers from a recruiting class that season and they would currently be in a lot better position staffing-wise.\n\nIn order to avoid layoffs, payouts and furloughs, Langfelder asked several city departments not to hire candidates due to economic uncertainties. There was no firm timetable of a COVID-19 vaccine in fall 2020 and the election season and other political factors raised uncertainty over how much stimulus dollars the federal government was going to pump into local governments.\n\nMore:Growing Illinois sports betting market is now keeping company with top states like Nevada\n\nQuarterly report\n\nSPD released its preliminary numbers through June on arrests, shootings and other relevant figures compared to the same time in 2020:\n\nGun-related arrests were up more than 36% in 2021 through June compared to that same time in 2020. A total of 175 adults and 23 minors were arrested in 2021 for some gun-related offense, according to preliminary numbers from the report.\n\nCommon crimes such as theft, burglary and robbery were collectively down a few percentage points through June compared to that same timeframe in 2020.\n\nFifty-seven people were confirmed shot in Springfield through September, 20 more than the same time in 2020.
