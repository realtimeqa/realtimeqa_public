Of course, it will likely need to start playing more complete games down the stretch for that to happen, but mathematically, reaching the College Football Playoff remains possible.\n\nBefore the Crimson Tide faces LSU on Saturday, Nov. 4 (6:45 p.m., CBS) at Bryant-Denny Stadium, here's a look at how Alabama can win the SEC West and reach the College Football Playoff.\n\nHow Alabama schedule 2023 plays into winning SEC West\n\nThe Crimson Tide leads the division, but the game against LSU has big implications for who will play in Atlanta.\n\nHere's the rest of the schedule for the top three SEC West contenders, Alabama, LSU and Ole Miss.\n\nAlabama (5-0 SEC): LSU, Kentucky, Chattanooga, Auburn\n\nLSU: (4-1 SEC): Alabama, Florida, Georgia State, Texas A&M\n\nOle Miss (3-1 SEC): Vanderbilt, Texas A&M, Georgia, ULM, Mississippi State\n\nLSU GAME:Can Alabama football finally play a 60-minute game vs. LSU with SEC West on the line?\n\nTENNESSEE GAME:Inside the Alabama football locker room during halftime that flipped game vs. Tennessee\n\nAlabama has the head-to-head win over Ole Miss while the Rebels own the head-to-head win over LSU. Head-to-head is the first tiebreaker used if two teams are tied for a division title. Next is records of the tied teams within the division. For Alabama to win the division, the simplest path is to win out and remain undefeated in division and conference play. If the Crimson Tide beats LSU and Kentucky, it will be 7-0 in conference play and can finish no worse than 7-1 in conference play. Ole Miss could tie that, but Alabama would hold the head-to-head tiebreaker and win the division. So if Alabama wins the next two games, it wins the division.\n\nIf Alabama loses to LSU but beats Kentucky and Auburn, the cleanest way for Alabama to win the division would be if LSU loses to Florida or Texas A&M.\n\nBut if LSU wins out, Alabama beats Kentucky and Auburn, and Ole Miss wins out, that would put each team at 7-1 in SEC play for a three-way tie at the top. Then the scenarios get complex with tiebreakers. Combined head-to-head record among the tied teams is first, then record of the tied teams within the division is second, then there are more tiebreakers.\n\nAlabama football College Football Playoff scenarios, path\n\nIf Alabama wins out, it will likely make the four-team field.\n\nThe first College Football Playoff rankings won't come out until Oct. 31, but even those don't matter much until closer to selection day. Right now, the Crimson Tide ranks No. 8 in the US LBM Coaches Poll and No. 9 in the AP Top 25. There's plenty of football to be played, but right now, the four teams would be Georgia, Michigan, Ohio State and Florida State. That's the top four in both polls.\n\nGeorgia is in a precarious spot without All-American tight end Brock Bowers for a certain amount of time. Whether a team such as Florida, Missouri or Tennessee can hand the Bulldogs a loss over that span remains to be seen. Let's presume, however, that Georgia finds ways to stay undefeated through the rest of the regular season. That won't necessarily matter so long as the Crimson Tide can beat the Bulldogs in the SEC Championship Game. That would give both Alabama and Georgia one loss each, and if it came down to those two programs, Alabama would get the nod for a spot in the College Football Playoff.\n\nBut it might not come down to those two programs. There are six undefeated teams right now: Georgia, Michigan, Ohio State, Florida State, Washington and Oklahoma. The Wolverines and Buckeyes will play, so one of those teams will have one loss. The Seminoles might not have a loss, though. They don't play a ranked opponent the rest of the regular season, unless Florida moves into the top 25. Washington meanwhile has three matchups with ranked opponents (USC, Utah and Oregon State) coming up. The Huskies might emerge undefeated, too, but let's say one of those games results in a loss. The rest of Oklahoma's schedule isn't the toughest, but it will face Texas in the Big 12 championship game in all likelihood. The Sooners could have one loss, but they also could be undefeated.\n\nLet's say Florida State is undefeated, Washington has one loss, Oklahoma has one loss, Michigan is undefeated, Ohio State has one loss, Texas has one loss, Georgia has one loss and Alabama has one loss. Who gets the four spots?\n\nThat would all come down to who has more ranked wins, what the losses look like, etc. It's too early to make that comparison.\n\nBut it would be surprising if the College Football Playoff selection committee left off a one-loss SEC champion, even with the conference not having as dominant of a season.\n\nIf Alabama loses one more game, though, the College Football Playoff remains unlikely; no two-loss team has ever made it.\n\nSo win out, the Crimson Tide should be in. Lose one more, and the goals for the season will have to adjust.\n\nIn what bowl game will Alabama play?\n\nIf Alabama doesn't make the playoff, the Crimson Tide sits in a good position to make one of the first bowls outside it. The most popular projections right now are the Peach Bowl and the Cotton Bowl.\n\nMuch could still change, though. There's plenty of football to be played.\n\nNick Kelly covers Alabama football and men's basketball for The Tuscaloosa News, part of the USA TODAY Network.

If you count the illegal votes, then they stole the selection from us, keeping Florida State out of the playoff even though we posted a 13-0 record and a victory in the ACC Championship Game.\n\nClearly Florida State's chance at championship was STOLEN\n\nThis is a clear case of selection interference, and we’re looking very strongly at interference from big media, big money and big tech. The woke Radical Leftist Communist Marxists were likely involved as well, and we will find them and they will be held responsible.\n\nPrior to Sunday’s TOTALLY RIGGED announcement that Florida State was not one of the four teams selected for the College Football Playoff – despite incredible polling numbers, the kind of numbers nobody has ever seen – we were winning among all the key committee members, by quite a lot actually.\n\nDeSantis who?Nikki Haley's GOP ascent adds to the well-deserved humiliation of desperate Ron DeSantis\n\nAnd then our number started miraculously getting whittled away in secret, and they wouldn’t allow legally permissible observers into the selection room.\n\nThis is a corrupt system.\n\nThis is a matter of College Football Playoff selection security\n\nOur goal is to defend the integrity of the selection. We’ll not allow the corruption to steal such an important selection or any selection, for that matter. And we can’t allow anybody to silence our great Florida State supporters and manufacture results.\n\nWe’ve never seen such love and such affection and such spirit as we’ve seen for this. People know what’s happening, and they see what’s happening, and it’s before their eyes.\n\nOfficials at Michigan, Washington, Texas and Alabama – the universities whose teams were “selected” – never believed they could win this selection honestly. We really believe that. That’s why the selection committee did the mail-in ballots, where there’s tremendous corruption and fraud going on. That’s why they mailed out ballots without any verification measures whatsoever.\n\nIf they did this to FSU, they can do it to you\n\nThis was unprecedented in American history. This was by design. Despite years of claiming to care about the selection security, they refuse to include any requirement to verify committee-member signatures and identities, or to even determine whether committee members are eligible or ineligible to select.\n\nCheckmate, haters!A message from George Santos after the House voted to expel him\n\nPeople are walking into that selection committee meeting and nobody even knows who they are. The workers are writing down things and doing a lot of bad things. And we have a lot of information coming out in about two weeks, and it will shake you up and reveal corruption like you’ve never seen.\n\nDoes anyone really think Texas, with one loss, won the selection over us? It’s an old, weak program, and we’re supposed to believe they got more votes than Florida State, with our huge crowds and the passion and and all the great love?\n\nA simple message from Florida State: Stop the steal\n\nOur country has had enough. We will stop the steal. This was not a close selection and we clearly won, fair and square.\n\nAmerica is blessed with College Football Playoff selections. All over the world they talk about our selections. But you know what the world says about us now? They say we don't have free and fair selections.\n\nSad.\n\nHopefully Mike Pence will intervene to give FSU justice\n\nThe truth is, we won the selection in a landslide. This was a landslide.\n\nAnd now, if former Vice President Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the selection. It’s that simple. Let’s hope Mike does the right thing.\n\nFlorida State's fight will go on, because they won, and everybody knows it\n\nBut regardless, we will fight. We will fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a College Football Playoff system anymore.\n\nSo we won the selection, clearly. And we will be there on Jan. 1 to play in either the Rose Bowl or the Sugar Bowl, it doesn’t matter which one.\n\nNothing can stop our movement, which is the greatest college football movement the world has ever seen.\n\nBe there. Will be wild!\n\n(Adapted from speeches by former President Donald J.

James Madison University director of athletics Jeffrey Bourne, president Jonathan Alger, and rector Maribeth Herod wrote a letter to NCAA Division I Board of Directors chair Jere Morehead requesting a change to bowl consideration this season.\n\nThe Dukes are not eligible for a bowl game in 2023 because they recently moved up to the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) from the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). NCAA rules dictate the Dukes cannot make a bowl game or play in a conference championship game in their second FBS season.\n\nBut James Madison's been an anomaly in moving up to college football's top division. An 8-3 season in 2022 preceded an undefeated 2023 season so far, with the Dukes ranked no. 21 in the US LBM Coaches Poll. They're just one of seven undefeated teams left in the FBS, along with No. 1 Georgia, No. 2 Michigan, No. 3 Ohio State, No. 4 Florida State, No. 5 Washington, and Liberty.\n\nJames Madison Athletics released a statement Wednesday night in response to the NCAA's decision.\n\n\"We're saddened for our university community and, in particular, we're devastated for our football program,\" the statement read in part. \"The coaches and student-athletes who have orchestrated an amazing season and earned the the opportunity.\"\n\n'A broken institution':Virginia AG hires law firm for James Madison football in NCAA bowl game dispute\n\nNo bowling for Dukes:Why undefeated James Madison football (probably) isn't making a bowl game\n\nThe Dukes' athletics page wasn't the only account on X, formerly known as Twitter, pushing back on the NCAA's decision.\n\nOn a brighter note for the Dukes, James Madison welcomes College Gameday to Harrisonburg this weekend, for the first time since 2017, ahead of their matchup with Appalachian State.\n\nWins piling up:James Madison riding 13-game winning streak and making the transition from FCS look almost easy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/pac12/2023/12/01/washington-oregon-pac-12-title-college-football-playoff/71757588007/", "title": "How Washington winning Pac-12 impacts the College Football Playoff", "text": "One team is already locked into the College Football Playoff.\n\nWashington capped an undefeated regular season with a thrilling 34-31 win against Oregon in the Pac-12 championship game and is guaranteed to finish somewhere in the top four of the final playoff rankings, depending on how things play out across the rest of the Power Five.\n\nThe second win on the season against the Ducks is the ultimate response to doubters who dismissed the Huskies' chances in this game and place among the elite teams in the Bowl Subdivision.\n\nIn case it wasn't clear: Washington is a deserving playoff team and a dangerous matchup for any team in the semifinals.\n\nQuarterback Michael Penix completed 27 of 39 attempts for 319 yards and a touchdown and keyed two enormous touchdown drives in the fourth quarter to reverse Oregon's 24-20 lead. Washington led 20-3 in the second quarter but was in danger of letting the Pac-12 championship slip away before the offense reasserted itself against the Ducks' worn-down defense.\n\nAll that's left to decide is where the Huskies fall in the final rankings, which depends on how things play out in the SEC championship game between Georgia and Alabama along with the Big Ten championship between Michigan and Iowa. Regardless, Washington will become the first Pac-12 team to reach the playoff since the Huskies did so under former coach Chris Petersen in 2016.\n\nAlso on Friday, Liberty beat New Mexico State 49-35 to capture the Conference USA championship. The Flames are one of only a small handful of unbeaten teams in the Bowl Subdivision and a contender for the Group of Five's bid to the New Year's Six, but there's a roadblock of teams in their way, as we'll see.\n\nWhat Washington's win means for the playoff\n\nWashington has completed a perfect regular season in one of the top leagues in the FBS and can sit back and wait to see how the rest of the Power Five landscape unfolds during Saturday's games.\n\nThe only question is where the Huskies will land: whether as high as No. 1 or as low as No. 3. There is no chance Washington falls to No. 4 with a second win against the Ducks.\n\nGetting to No. 1 requires two upsets: Alabama over Georgia and Iowa over Michigan. The Huskies will probably stick at No. 3 should both favorites win, though beating Oregon twice could be enough for the committee to push them above the Wolverines.\n\nThen it's a question of matchups. The most likely is opposite Michigan as the second or third seed in the Rose Bowl, the earlier of the two semifinals on New Year's Day.\n\nShould Michigan lose and Florida State win, the Huskies would rise to No. 2 and take on the Seminoles. In the scenario where the Tide, Hawkeyes and Seminoles win to bump UW to No. 1, the matchup would come against Texas, Georgia or Michigan.\n\nMichael Penix and the Heisman Trophy\n\nPenix was the Heisman front-runner for a good chunk of the regular season before losing his grip in November, and went into Friday night third in the pecking order behind Oregon QB Bo Nix and LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels. The win should change things.\n\nBut maybe not enough. Penix was very solid in the first half but less so in the second, and he probably would've needed a more complete, eye-opening sort of game to make up ground he'd ceded to Nix and Daniels.\n\nThe good news is that Heisman voters probably can't vote for Nix over Penix, given the Huskies' two head-to-head wins this season. That's if many voters hadn't already sent in their ballots in advance of the weekend, which is always a possibility.\n\nThe bad news for Penix is that Daniels isn't going anywhere. For those torn between Nix and Daniels, Friday's result might not mean a switched vote to Penix but an embrace of the LSU senior as the obvious Heisman pick.\n\nCan Washington win the national championship?\n\nAny team that can beat Oregon once, let alone twice, is good enough to beat any opponent on a neutral field and win the national championship.\n\nThis second win erases the idea that the earlier victory at home was the result of coaching decisions on Dan Lanning's part or catching the Ducks on an off day. Washington was the more aggressive team and was very effective at the point of attack, offsetting the misguided belief that Oregon would be the more physical team on the line of scrimmage.\n\nOverall, this performance should open some eyes. Far more than just a borderline upset — Oregon was more than a touchdown favorite despite the previous loss — the win should lead to a reevaluation of the Huskies' chances against opponents such as Georgia, Michigan or Texas.\n\nLet's wait to see who Washington draws in the semifinals and, if they're fortunate, the championship game. But there's no doubt the Huskies have the offense, quarterback, coaching staff and mindset to shine on college football's biggest stage against some of the biggest brands in the sport.\n\nIs Liberty going to make a New Year's Six bowl?\n\nThe odds are slim even after the win against New Mexico State. While beating the Aggies will help boost Liberty's reputation with the selection committee, the Flames are still looking up at the winner of the American, especially if Tulane beats SMU in the conference championship game.\n\nWhile SMU was not in the latest playoff rankings, the Mustangs are expected to move ahead of Liberty should they beat the Green Wave.\n\nBasically, the Flames did all they could do during the regular season and will still come up short of the New Year's Six. That's not due to bias or lack of deep thinking on the part of the committee but a reflection on Liberty's extremely weak schedule.\n\nThe Flames did not play a Power Five opponent and have six wins against bowl teams, two coming against the Aggies. Outside of NMSU, the team's best win is either Jacksonville State or Bowling Green. That's not nearly enough to justify coming in ahead of the AAC champion.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/football/2023/12/03/ohio-state-football-to-face-missouri-in-cotton-bowl/71784457007/", "title": "Ohio State football to face Missouri in Cotton Bowl", "text": "Ohio State will play Missouri in the Cotton Bowl on Dec. 29, it was announced Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe Buckeyes (11-1) were ranked No. 7 in the final College Football Playoff rankings.

I personally think they did it for ratings and viewership.\"\n\nThe Seminoles' starting quarterback Jordan Travis suffered a broken leg in their Week 12 game against North Alabama, and the College Football Playoff Committee's decision to leave the Seminoles out of the playoffs was heavily influenced by his absence in their final game of the regular season and conference title game, which Florida State won nonetheless.\n\nDaniels extended his sympathy to Travis, saying, \"Prayers out to Jordan and everything he is going through right now.

So why stop now?\n\nOnce again if you’re new to this feature, the headings you see are not our takes. They are observations expressed by commentators, amateur or professional, regarding what just transpired on the field. Our aim is to put these views into proper perspective.\n\nWe’ll begin our breakdown of the top overreactions after Week 11 in college football with a quick look ahead to one of those seemingly inevitable events, examine the prospects for the sport’s most prestigious individual honor, and as usual try to sort out the big picture as the season winds down.\n\nThe Big Ten will get two playoff spots\n\nNow that Michigan and Ohio State are all but assured of being 11-0 at the time of their meeting for a second consecutive season, it’s become an article of faith among numerous analysts that both will make the four-team playoff as they did last year regardless of outcome.\n\nThat might indeed be the case, but there are more scenarios in play this time around that could lead to the loser getting left out. First and foremost, there might be three other power conference champs that finish without a loss. There might not be, of course. Washington has a tough finishing stretch in the Pac-12 (more on that below), and Florida State has survived its share of close calls already in ACC play.\n\nBut if there are four undefeated teams in the mix once conference champs are crowned in December, all the one-loss candidates will be closed out. Then even if there isn’t a full quartet that makes it to 13-0, either the Buckeyes or Wolverines at 11-1 wouldn’t necessarily get the nod over other members of the one-loss club with conference championships due to the Big Ten’s overall lack of depth. Ohio State might have a stronger argument due to its more challenging non-conference resume, but neither the Buckeyes nor the Wolverines want to be in that position.\n\nJayden Daniels is this year’s Caleb Williams\n\nThere have been some exceptions, but for the most part the Heisman Trophy has gone to a player on a title contender in the sport’s playoff era. One of those exceptions was last year, however, as Caleb Williams simply put up numbers that were too strong to ignore despite his USC Trojans falling short in the Pac-12 finale. Jayden Daniels has a similar argument this year. LSU can’t win the SEC, but the Tigers’ dual-threat QB leads the nation in total offense with 4,082 yards, including 918 rushing. His magnum opus came Saturday night when he torched Florida for 606 total yards and five touchdowns, and the Tigers needed most of them in a 52-35 victory.\n\nUnfortunately for Daniels, that might have been his last real chance to make an impression. Other candidates like Washington’s Michael Penix, Oregon’s Bo Nix, Ohio State’s Marvin Harrison Jr. and fast closing Jalen Milroe are going to have more opportunities in the spotlight in the season’s final weeks. But it does seem likely that Daniels earned himself at least a trip to New York, even if he doesn’t come home with a statue.\n\nRE-RANK: Michigan holds off Georgia at top of NCAA 1-133\n\nHIGHS AND LOWS: Week 11 college football winners and losers\n\nThey can breathe easy at SEC headquarters – the league champ is in\n\nSome less than favorable September results threw the SEC’s accustomed position of superiority in the sport into doubt. But now that the league’s flagship programs are guaranteed to meet in Atlanta, there’s no way the SEC will be left out of the final foursome, right?\n\nProbably not, but a couple teensy-weensy pieces of business must be handled first. Georgia has a final road trip to Tennessee before dealing with in-state foe Georgia Tech, and strange things occasionally happen to Alabama when Auburn hosts the Iron Bowl as will be the case in a couple of weeks. But assuming the Crimson Tide and Bulldogs reach Atlanta with still just the one loss between them, it’s conceivable but highly unlikely that the winner would be omitted. Georgia at 13-0 would be a lock, of course, and the résumé of a 12-1 Alabama that would necessarily include a win against the Bulldogs would figure to stack up favorably against most other one-loss candidates.\n\nAh, but what if one of those candidates is Texas? Does head-to-head trump all? There’s a case to be made that a result from Week 2 isn’t indicative of how the teams are playing in Week 14. This is the same kind of conundrum that often comes up in the committee room during basketball season as November results are weighed against February and March performances. Suffice it to say that however the committee resolves this potential issue should it arise, somebody’s extremely vocal fan base is not going to be happy.\n\nOregon State – last agent of chaos?\n\nSay this for the soon-to-be-erstwhile Pac-12. It has given us one heck of a last ride. Washington and Oregon have the inside track to a rematch, with the winner likely to earn strong playoff consideration if not an outright guarantee. But one of the teams left behind in the realignment derby might have a last laugh.\n\nOregon State gets a crack at both league leaders in the final two weeks of the regular season. The Beavers are fresh off hanging 62 on Stanford, not exactly welcome news for Washington’s struggling defense as it prepares to visit Corvallis next week. The Beavers then head to Eugene looking to upend the Ducks for a second consecutive season. Oregon State fans would love nothing better than to spoil the Pac-12’s last party. It probably won’t happen, but we’ll certainly enjoy the show.\n\nEvery school needs a Tyler from Spartanburg\n\nA couple of weeks ago, Clemson was sitting at 4-4 following a lackluster loss to North Carolina State. But since coach Dabo Swinney infamously went off on a disgruntled fan who called into his radio show, the Tigers have suddenly started to look like Clemson again, following up an upset of Notre Dame with a dominant performance against an improved Georgia Tech squad. Coincidence? Probably, but sometimes the smallest of sparks goes a long way toward firing up a team.\n\nOn the other hand, encouraging entitled fans to pop off, either on air or on the internet, isn’t always going to produce desired results. College football programs need their supporters, of course, but when those relationships get frayed, things often go badly for all involved. So Tyler from Spartanburg said his piece and might have gotten a positive response from his favorite team, but don’t expect that to work for everyone.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2023/10/18/james-madison-football-undefeated-not-bowl-eligible/71234324007/", "title": "Undefeated James Madison football isn't bowl eligible. Here's why.", "text": "Out of 133 schools in the NCAA's Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), there are just 11 undefeated college football teams left ahead of Week 8. The Big Ten has the most with three: No. 2 Michigan, No. 3 Ohio State, and No. 6 Penn State. The ACC has two in No. 4 Florida State and No. 10 North Carolina.\n\nThe remaining six undefeated teams come from six different conferences, including the Big 12 (No. 7 Oklahoma), Conference USA (Liberty), Mountain West (No. 22 Air Force), Pac-12 (No. 5 Washington), SEC (No. 1 Georgia), and the Sun Belt (James Madison).\n\nEvery one of those teams has a very good chance to make one of the 42 NCAA bowl games at the end of the 2023 season, except for James Madison. Due to an NCAA rule, the Dukes cannot appear in a bowl game in 2023, except on a technicality.\n\nCollege football bowl projections:What Washington's win means as season hits halfway mark\n\nHow James Madison football started\n\nThe James Madison football program started in the early 1970s after the school became a co-educational institution in 1966. Dr. Ronald E. Carrier, James Madison University president from 1971 to 1988, had the idea to start a football program.\n\n“I knew that we needed to change the psychology of the campus,” Carrier later said, per James Madison archives. “I put the forces into place – the activities, the events, the new courses – that would change the attitude of people and show them that this was truly a coeducational institution.\"\n\nFootball seemed like the best way to do this.\n\nThe 1972 season made for a rocky start. While the USC Trojans captured their seventh consensus national championship, the Dukes needed coaches to fill in during some practices to form two teams for scrimmage purposes. Coach Challace McMillin originally came to James Madison to launch a track and field program.\n\nIt took McMillin just three years to go from winless to undefeated. The 1975 Dukes team earned the Virginia College Athletic Association division title with a 9-0-1 record.\n\nIt took another 12 years before the Dukes reached the playoffs in the Football Conference Subdivison (FCS), called Division I-AA at the time. In 1991, they got their first playoff win under coach Rip Scherer. In 2004 under coach Mickey Matthews, the Dukes broke through for their first FCS title in a win over Montana.\n\nAfter that 2004 title season, the Dukes were a fixture in the FCS playoffs and haven't had a losing season since.\n\nThey earned a second FCS title in 2016 under Mike Houston. In 2021, after their fifth Colonial Athletic Association Conference title in six years, the school's athletic program decided to move up to the FBS and into the Sun Belt Conference starting in the 2022-23 year.\n\nNIL debate:Sen. Maria Cantwell says she wants any NIL legislation to also address NCAA athletes' rights\n\nHow James Madison could still make a bowl game\n\nMoving from the FCS to the FBS can be an adjustment for any program regardless of conference. The change in competition also comes with requirements to satisfy eligibility across the athletic program. NCAA bylaws require programs to wait two years before being eligible for a bowl game per the latest bylaw change in 2017.\n\nSince 2008, 13 teams have moved from the FCS level up to the FBS:\n\nLiberty was the most recent mover before James Madison. The team got approval in 2017 to move up to the FBS. The Flames posted a 6-6 record in 2018 before going 8-5 in 2019 and earning their first of three straight bowl-game wins.\n\nCoastal Carolina moved up to the FBS level one year earlier. The Chanticleers went 3-9, 5-7, and 5-7 in the first three years. In 2020, the team went 11-1 and made its first bowl game.\n\nStarting in the 2015 season, the Charlotte 49ers moved up to Conference USA but the team's had just one winning season since then.\n\nMid-season honors:Michael Penix headlines the USA TODAY Sports midseason college football All-America team\n\nBut unlike these recent programs, James Madison's hit the ground running.\n\nThe Dukes went 8-3 in their first FBS season, including a win over then-No. 23 Coastal Carolina in the season finale. Since 2008, only Georgia Southern (2014) and UTSA (2012) managed at least eight wins in their inaugural FBS season.\n\nJames Madison athletics filed a waiver request to shorten the re-classification period to one year. The NCAA denied the request in April. Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, a James Madison alum, wrote a letter asking the NCAA reconsider the decision.\n\nNCAA president Charlie Baker rejected the request in a letter Wednesday.\n\nWill 'common sense prevail'?\n\nDespite all of this, there is a way the Dukes could make a bowl game in 2023. FBS bowls require teams to win at least six games with a minimum 0.500 win percentage. If there aren't enough teams that meet that criteria, James Madison could be selected, per Baker's letter.\n\n“I really believe at the end of the day common sense prevails,\" James Madison coach Curt Cignetti said earlier this month. \"We have a number of very difficult challenges coming up down the road... I think six, seven, eight weeks from now when we have a clearer picture of who’s done what, common sense will prevail.”\n\nThe Dukes are 6-0 this season, including wins against Virginia and Utah State, with six games left in the season. They've already met standard bowl requirements and now just need at least one spot to open up in the FBS bowl schedule to have a chance.\n\nJames Madison vs. Marshall how to watch: TV and streaming\n\nThe Dukes head on the road to take on Sun Belt Conference foe Marshall Thundering Herd Thursday night.

They're 3-0 at home this season, and they've won 19 of their last 22 games there.\n\nBYU doesn't have the most high-powered offense. Its biggest weapon on that side of the ball is Chase Roberts, a sophomore wide receiver who boasts 24 catches for 358 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nBut the Cougars have enough playmakers on defense to make life difficult for the Sooners.\n\nBYU is led up front by Tyler Batty, a junior defensive end who ranks sixth in the Big 12 in sacks (3.5). It's also led at the second level by junior linebacker Ben Bywater, who ranks sixth in the conference in tackles (32).\n\nThen there's the secondary, where Jakob Robinson is the top contributor. The junior cornerback has three interceptions to his name, which is tied for the second-highest total in the Big 12.\n\nBYU has a few good wins under its belt this season. It earned a 38-31 road win over Arkansas in Week 3. It also earned a 35-27 home win over Cincinnati this past weekend.\n\nOU has more talented teams left on its schedule. Its game against Kansas, as Ryan mentioned, probably sits tops that list.\n\nBut the Sooners have never played in Provo.

That seems a bit high, but the message remains — the Sooners are in prime position to return to the CFP for the first time since the 2019 season.\n\nAnything short of a New Year’s Six bowl would be a disappointment for this team, which is an incredible turnaround from not only last season but even from where things stood before the season.\n\nMore:Where does 2023 OU-Texas football game rank in Big 12 era of Red River Rivalry? Let's vote\n\nMartinez: My perception has definitely changed as well.\n\nDespite having an easy schedule, I still picked OU to go 9-3. I figured the Sooners would be better on both sides of the ball, but I wasn't fully confident after they went 6-7 last season.\n\nI'm confident now, though.\n\nAfter defeating Texas, OU has a clear path to the College Football Playoff. And I didn't think I'd be saying that a few months ago.\n\nOf course, the Sooners aren't guaranteed to win all of their remaining regular-season games. As we discussed in the first question, there are still a few matchups that could cause some trouble.\n\nBut OU is clearly in the driver's seat. I agree that anything short of a New Year’s Six appearance would be a disappointment.\n\nAnd as crazy as it sounds, the ceiling is OU competing in the CFP for its first national championship since 2000.

RUSSO\n\nAP\n\nThe final season of the four-team College Football Playoff turned out to be the most controversial with an unprecedented snub.\n\nMichigan, Washington, Texas and Alabama were selected Sunday and Florida State became the first unbeaten Power Five conference champion to be excluded from the field.\n\nMichigan will face Alabama in the Rose Bowl, Washington will play Texas in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1 and the winners will meet for the national championship Jan. 8 in Houston.\n\nBefore the CFP grows to 12 next year — an expansion that was delayed by a year because of infighting among the conference commissioners who manage the postseason system — the selection committee faced the toughest decision in the 10-year history of the format.\n\n“Florida State is a different team than they were through the first 11 weeks,” explained Boo Corrigan, the selection committee chairman who is also the athletic director at North Carolina State, Florida State's Atlantic Coast Conference rival.\n\nThe Seminoles (13-0) lost star quarterback Jordan Travis to a season-ending injury two weeks ago, but continued to win with a backup and then a third-string quarterback. The committee, though, is instructed to judge teams for what they are heading into the playoff and decided FSU without Travis is not among the best four in the country.\n\n“I am disgusted and infuriated with the committee’s decision today to have what was earned on the field taken away because a small group of people decided they knew better than the results of the games. What is the point of playing games?” Florida State coach Mike Norvell said.\n\nHe added: “What happened today goes against everything that is true and right in college football. A team that overcame tremendous adversity and found a way to win doing whatever it took on the field was cheated today. It’s a sad day for college football.”\n\nTravis is a sixth-year player whose development into one of the best quarterbacks in college football has fueled Florida State's resurgence over the last three years.\n\n“Devastated. heartbroken,” Travis posted on the social media platform X. \"I wish my leg broke earlier in the season so y’all could see this team is much more than the quarterback. I thought results matter. 13-0 and this roster matches up across any team in those top 4 rankings. I am so sorry.”\n\nWhichever team was left out had a good argument to get in. That created unprecedented controversy and the committee passed over FSU to pick Alabama, which upset Georgia to win the Southeastern Conference championship, and Big 12 champion Texas, which beat the Crimson Tide on the road in September.\n\nThe SEC had never missed the playoff. Alabama, which is in for the eighth time, kept that streak alive. The Crimson Tide have won the playoff three times, most recently in 2020.\n\nTexas would have been just the second Power Five team with only one loss to be left out. Instead, the Longhorns will be making their first appearance in the CFP in their last season as a member of the Big 12. Texas moves to the SEC next year.\n\nTexas and Alabama were ranked seventh and eighth, respectively, in the committee's penultimate rankings and are now the first teams to jump from outside the top six in the second-to-last rankings into the playoff field. Georgia became the first team to enter championship weekend No. 1 and fail to make the field.\n\n“We’ve never had a year with eight teams at the top as good as these are. And the five conference champions (ranked) one through five, we’ve never had it come out that way,” CFP executive director Bill Hancock said. “My feeling is it probably was the toughest (decision ever for the committee).”\n\nBig Ten champion Michigan is making its third straight appearance in the CFP, still looking for its first playoff victory. The Wolverines, who have stayed unbeaten amid an NCAA investigation into allegations of in-person scouting and sign-stealing, are the favorites to win the national title, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nMichigan, looking for its first national title since 1997, opened as a 1 1/2-point favorite against Alabama. The Tide have won six national titles under coach Nick Saban.\n\n“We're not going to go in there saying, ‘Oh, this is Alabama, a team that’s won and won and won and won and won. No. We're that team,” Michigan running back Blake Corum told reporters.\n\nWashington is in the CFP for the second time, breaking the Pac-12's playoff drought after six years, and doing so the year before it leaves the conference for the Big Ten. The Huskies opened as a 4 1/2-point underdog to Texas and former Washington coach Steve Sarkisian. The two played last season in the Alamo Bowl and Washington won.\n\nGeorgia’s slim hopes of trying for a third consecutive national title also came to an end. The Bulldogs (12-1) had a 29-game winning streak snapped by the Crimson Tide, but leaving them out of the CFP didn't seem nearly as controversial as snubbing the Seminoles — even in a system ripe for criticism.\n\nIn 2014, Ohio State, playing with its third-string quarterback, vaulted over Baylor and TCU and into the playoff with a Big Ten title game blowout of Wisconsin. The Big 12 teams still haven’t gotten over it, but the Buckeyes went on to win it all. Ohio State has been on the short end a couple of times, too, winning the Big Ten in 2017 and ’18 and not getting in. But this year, the committee faced a truly vexing problem.\n\nFlorida State, which was No. 4 in the previous CFP rankings, appeared to be on the way to its second playoff appearance in mid-November when Travis suffered a serious injury in the first quarter against North Alabama and was lost for the year.\n\nThe Seminoles beat rival Florida last week with backup quarterback Tate Rodemaker, who then missed the ACC championship game against Louisville with a concussion. Florida State stayed unbeaten with a strong defensive performance, but scored only one touchdown.\n\n“To eliminate them from a chance to compete for a national championship is an unwarranted injustice that shows complete disregard and disrespect for their performance and accomplishments. It is unforgivable,” Florida State athletic director Michael Alford said.\n\nACC Commissioner Jim Phillips, who was among conference leaders who helped slow down the expansion process by a year after the SEC's plan to add Texas and Oklahoma was revealed in 2021, called leaving out the 'Noles “unfathomable.”\n\n“Their exclusion calls into question the selection process and whether the committee's own guidelines were followed, including the significant importance of being an undefeated Power Five conference champion,” Phillips said.\n\nAs the ACC champion, Florida State will head to the Orange Bowl for a showdown with Georgia.\n\n“It’s unfortunate that some good team had to get left out,” Saban said on ESPN, “but I really think that our team earned the right to be here.”\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

Courier Journal\n\nIt was a sad sight: Stripped of his crown, the former heavyweight champion of the world was reduced to making a paid appearance at a boat show in his hometown of Louisville, Ky.\n\n“I am not allowed to work in America and I’m not allowed to leave America,” Muhammad Ali said in February 1968, at the start of his first full year of exile from boxing. “I’m just about broke.”\n\nMarried a year with his first child on the way, Ali was so desperate his manager tried to arrange a bout in Arizona on an Indian reservation – outside the reach of state boxing commissions that wouldn’t let him fight. But the Pima tribe rejected the proposal, saying it would defile the memory of Indian veterans who’d fought for their country.\n\nThe previous April, Ali had declared himself a conscientious objector and refused induction into the U.S. Army, famously saying, “I ain’t got no quarrel with them Viet Cong.”\n\nBy 1968, 19,560 Americans had died in the Vietnam War and another 16,502 would die that year alone. It was the year the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese army mounted the Tet Offensive, an ambitious campaign that helped persuade the American public that the war wasn't going as well as the generals and politicians had led them to believe.\n\nThe war was escalating, as was opposition to it. Just a few weeks before Ali said no to his draft board, Martin Luther King Jr., had denounced the war. He later quoted Ali in support of his position: \"As \"Muhammad Ali puts it, we are all — black and brown and poor — victims of the same system of oppression.\"\n\nAli was already one of America's greatest heavyweights ever. He'd won an Olympic gold medal for the United States in Rome when he was just 18 and four years later, against all odds, defeated Sonny Liston to win his first title as world champion.\n\nAnd in an era when most fighters let their managers do the talking, Ali thrived in the spotlight. He was the master of \"rhyming prediction and derision,\" as biographer David Remnick would later write. He was already \"the greatest,\" as he proclaimed himself, not just for his skills in the ring, but for talking trash – and doing it in verse.\n\nIt wasn't just what he said, but how he said it, poet Maya Angelou later put it.\n\n\"'Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee' – I mean, as a poet, I like that,\" she once said. \"If he hadn't put his name on it, I might have chosen to use that.\"\n\nNow Ali was paying the price for refusing to serve. Convicted of violating selective service laws and sentenced to five years in prison, he was free on bail. But his passport had been taken away, along with his ability to make a living.\n\nWith his characteristic bluster, he insisted he didn’t ache for the money or the ring. Asked during a television appearance if he missed being heavyweight champion, he deadpanned, “No, they miss me.”\n\nBut sportswriter Dave Kindred, who interviewed Ali at the boat show for the Courier-Journal, wrote that the more Ali talked about not missing the ring, the more you realized he did.\n\n“It was his identity,” Kindred said recently. “Boxing gave him his sense of self.”\n\nWithout it, recalled New York Times sportswriter Robert Lipsyte, who traveled with Ali in 1968, “He could get moody and down.” Without boxing, Lipsyte said, Ali was often alone – and he was “not a guy who liked to be alone.”\n\nIn the decades to come, his country and the world would come to embrace him as an ambassador of peace and goodwill. And after his death in 2016, his legacy grew larger still.\n\nSo it is easy to forget that 50 years ago, in the tumult of 1968, Ali didn’t know how things would turn out, or if he’d ever fight again, said Bill Siegel, whose 2013 film, The Trials of Muhammad Ali, documented Ali's four years away from the ring.\n\nIt's easy, Siegel said, to forget that Ali \"was willing to sacrifice everything on principle.”\n\nRefusing induction, Ali cited religious reasons, specifically, the Quran's ban on Muslims fighting Christian wars, but his objection was far broader.\n\n“My conscience won’t let me go shoot my brother, or some darker people, or some poor hungry people in the mud for big powerful America,” he said. “And shoot them for what? They never called me nigger, they never lynched me, they didn’t put no dogs on me, they didn’t rob me of my nationality, rape and kill my mother and father. … Shoot them for what? How can I shoot them poor people?\"\n\nIt was a humbling year for Ali, but also one of remarkable growth. Exiled from boxing, he grew bigger than the sport.\n\nYet he was still widely reviled.\n\nPopular black athletes such as Jackie Robinson and Joe Louis denounced him. Time magazine, ripping him for his opposition to the war and his embrace of the Nation of Islam, called him \"Gaseous Cassius,\" a reference to what he called his slave name, Cassius Clay.\n\nIn Chicago, where he spent much of his banishment, Mayor Richard Daley refused to call him by his Muslim name, and Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner called him “unpatriotic.”\n\nOn British television, famed talk show host David Susskind excoriated Ali as “a disgrace to his country, his race and what he laughingly describes as his profession.” Ali, Susskind said, was a “simplistic pawn and a fool.”\n\nTo pay the bills and help support his wife, Khalilah, and their child, Ali embarked on a college speaking tour, earning pennies on the dollar compared to his time in the ring.\n\nHis first lecture, at Philadelphia's Temple University, paid $1,000. The next, at Cheney State College in Pennsylvania, half that.\n\nHe ended his appearance at Union College in New York with a poem: “I like your school and admire your style, but your pay is so small, I won’t be back for a while.”\n\nAt first he was a terrible speaker, Lipsyte and others recalled. He spewed religious dogma from Nation of Islam, which he had joined four years earlier, regurgitating the words of its leader, Elijah Muhammad.\n\nAt University of Wisconsin, students booed when he denounced interracial marriage as “a trick to keep us with the white man,” as they did the next day in San Francisco when he complained about the marijuana smell wafting from the crowd and insisted no “intelligent so-called Negro would allow his daughter to marry a white man.”\n\nHe distanced himself from the Civil Rights Movement, telling 400 men and women he wouldn't join them in the Poor People’s Campaign “because I don’t believe in turning the other cheek.”\n\n“I don’t say we shall overcome,” he said at another appearance, “because I done overcame.”\n\nBut Ali’s speeches got better. He warmed to the crowds, and they to him. Lipsyte said Ali, though poorly educated, was a quick study.\n\n“He had a real intellectual growth spurt,” Lipsyte said.\n\nAli developed his own consciousness, moving away from Nation of Islam orthodoxy. He delivered lengthy soliloquies on his objection to the war and his experience with racism in America.\n\nVerbally sparring with students forced him to become an independent thinker, said Kindred, who later wrote Sound and Fury: Two Powerful Lives, Fateful Friendship, a dual biography of Ali and sportscaster Howard Cosell,\n\nAnd as the anti-war movement grew, Ali became a hero.\n\n“Anti-war activists didn't care what he said about Elijah or the Nation, they cared only that the most famous man on Earth shared their opposition to that war,” Kindred said.\n\n“He became a man,” Spiegel said.\n\nAli also helped move black radicalism into the mainstream, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. later wrote.\n\nHe forged an unlikely alliance with King, who on the face of it had no grounds for common cause or friendship. The Nation of Islam bitterly opposed integration. Malcolm X had derided King's seminal 1963 \"March on Washington\" as \"the Farce on Washington.\"\n\nBut King and Ali found common bond through their opposition to the war – and the hatred they both faced. Dave Zirin, sports editor of The Nation, wrote that famed 1968 Olympian and protester John Carlos once told him, \"If there was an Olympic sport for the number of death threats received, King and Ali would be fighting for the gold.\"\n\nKing, hoping Ali's story would inspire others to refuse to serve in the war, singled out the boxer for praise in a sermon.\n\n\"He is giving up his fame,\" King said. \"He is giving up millions of dollars in order to stand for what his conscience tells him is right. No matter what you think of his religion, you have to admire his courage.\"\n\nIn May 1968, a federal appeals court affirmed Ali’s conviction, saying \"Clay had been fairly accorded due process of law, without discrimination.”\n\nBut Ali’s popularity was soaring, and he knew it. While he was driving in the San Francisco Bay Area, a black man on a bicycle spotted Ali and thrust his hand through an open window, Lipsyte wrote in a column.\n\n“Let me shake the hand of the only real heavyweight champion of the world,” the man said.\n\nAli was overjoyed.\n\n“They made me bigger by taking my title,” he told Lipsyte. “Before, that chap on the street couldn’t identify with me. He’d say, ‘You not with me, you up on the hill with whitey.’\n\n“There are only two kinds of men,” Ali continued, “those who compromise and those who take a stand.”\n\nAli told Pacifica Radio he was “proud to say that I am the first man in the history of all America, athlete and entertainer-wise, who gave up all the white man’s money, looked the white man in the eye, and told him the truth, and stayed with his people.\"\n\nIf he had ever lost his mojo, by October 1968 it was back.\n\nStriding down West 52nd Street in New York, he hummed a song in the cold evening air, walking with the “bright swagger of a champion,” Pete Hamill wrote in LIFE magazine. “People stepped out of a steak house to watch him go by. Auto horns beeped in salute. A middle-aged lady asked him to autograph her newspaper.\n\n\"Look at me,’” Ali said softly, \"Bigger than boxing. As big as all history.\"\n\nAs Ali’s consciousness grew, so did the nation’s.\n\n“The speeches were important, not just for Ali but for everyone who heard them,” Lipsyte said.\n\nAli particularly influenced black athletes, as dramatically seen at the 1968 Summer Olympics when medalists John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists in the Black Power salute Smith later called an endorsement of all human rights.\n\nAfrican-American athletes today continue that tradition as they kneel during the National Anthem to protest mistreatment by police.\n\nBut his story inspired all athletes to stand up for equality in their sport, and beyond. Baseball players fought for free agency; track stars to end the sham of amateurism; and women for equal tennis prize money.\n\n“I really believe if Ali hadn’t done what he did, Smith and Carlos wouldn’t have raised their fists,” Arthur Ashe, the pioneering black tennis star who protested apartheid and raised awareness about AIDS, said in the 1995 oral history Muhammad Ali: The People’s Champ.\n\n“He was largely responsible for it becoming an expected part of the black athlete’s responsibility to get involved,” Ashe said. “He put it all on the line for what he believed in. And if Ali did that, who were the rest of us lesser athlete mortals not to do it?”\n\nWith his Supreme Court appeal still pending, Ali's promoter arranged a fight in Georgia, which had no state boxing commission. Despite the objections of segregationist Gov. Lester Maddox, Ali took on Jerry Quarry in Atlanta on Oct. 26, 1970, and beat him in the third round.\n\nHis lawyers also won a court order forcing the New York State Athletic Commission to let him fight. The following March he lost the 15-round “Fight of the Century” to Joe Frazier.\n\nBut on June 28, 1971, he won his biggest victory: The Supreme Court unanimously overturned his conviction, saying his draft board failed to specify why his conscientious objector application was denied. Throughout the war, Selective Service granted more than 170,000 men C.O. status.\n\nAli twice reclaimed his heavyweight championship – and the hearts of some who supported the war. In 2005, wracked by Parkinson’s, his hands shaking, he accepted the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Medal of Freedom, at a White House ceremony.\n\n“The American people,” said President George W. Bush, “are proud to call Muhammad Ali one of our own.”\n\nFollow Andrew Wolfson on Twitter: @adwolfson.

She is also one of the few women honored — the 16th female Nobel Literature laureate.\n\nGlück, who shuns most publicity, told Sweden’s TT news agency from her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that her phone was ringing off the hook, and she was struggling to express her feelings about the award.\n\nMalm said he had spoken to Glück and the news “came as a surprise — but a welcome one as far as I could tell.”\n\nCheck out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist\n\nIn a 2012 interview with the Academy of Achievement, Glück noted that “worldly honor makes existence in the world easier” but said he true goal as an artist was “not capable of being had in my lifetime.”\n\n“I want to live after I die, in that ancient way,” she said. “And there’s no way of knowing whether that will happen, and there will be no knowing, no matter how many blue ribbons have been plastered to my corpse.”\n\nIn addition to being the recipient of myriad awards (among them the National Humanities Medal, Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award, National Critics Circle Award and the Bollingen Prize) Glück was the Poet Laureate of the Unites States from 2003 to 2004.\n\nGlück, 77, who is a professor of English at Yale University, was born in New York and raised in a family with Hungarian Jewish origins. She has spoken of how a teenage struggle with anorexia, and the therapy she received for it, influenced her incisive writing.\n\nShe made her debut in 1968 with “Firstborn,” and “was soon acclaimed as one of the most prominent poets in American contemporary literature,” the Nobel Academy said.\n\nHer poetry is “characterized by a striving for clarity,” often focusing on childhood and family life, and close relationship with parents and siblings, it said.\n\nIt noted her 2006 collection “Averno,” calling it “masterly” and “a visionary interpretation of the myth of Persephone’s descent into hell in the captivity of Hades, the god of death.”\n\nThe award, which includes a more than $1.1 million prize, comes after several years of controversy and scandal for the world’s pre-eminent literary accolade.\n\nMore:National Book Awards announces shortlist: Rumaan Alam, Douglas Stuart among finalists\n\nMore:2020 Booker Prize shortlist includes Diane Cook, Tsitsi Dangarembga\n\nIn 2018 the award was postponed after sex abuse allegations rocked the Swedish Academy, the secretive body that chooses the winners, and sparked a mass exodus of members.\n\nAfter the academy revamped itself in a bid to regain the trust of the Nobel Foundation, two laureates were named last year, with the 2018 prize going to Poland’s Olga Tokarczuk and the 2019 award to Austria’s Peter Handke.\n\nHandke’s prize caused a storm of protest: a strong supporter of the Serbs during the 1990s Balkan wars, he has been called an apologist for Serbian war crimes.

Stream these 20 ...", "text": "Hello, and welcome to your first of many lessons in learning about racial inequality in the United States.\n\nIn June 2020, protests sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of police erupted nationwide and had many Americans searching for resources to understand why Black folks are upset, angry, tired, fed up, sad and emotionally drained.\n\nSix days into 2021, Congress was set to formally declare Joe Biden the winner of the 2020 presidential election when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. Four people were killed, the National Guard was deployed and more than 50 people were arrested.\n\nThe police response to each of these protests was starkly different as many civil rights leaders and people on social media pointed out. While Black Lives Matter protestors clashed with law enforcement and were met with tear gas and rubber bullets, pro-Trump supporters, mostly white, stormed a federal building and the crowds of law enforcement were notably absent.\n\nWhile some have turned to books to learn about the prison industrial complex and white fragility, using pop culture as a learning tool can be a little less intimidating.\n\n\"People may feel like if they like a certain rapper or watch a certain show that means they're not racist, but it's deeper than that,\" says Todd Boyd, chairman for the study of race and popular culture at the University of Southern California. \"Pop culture has to be understood in the proper historical and political context – otherwise, it's just images detached from anything substantive.\"\n\nThink of it like watching the movie version instead of reading the 500-page literary classic you were assigned in high school – you'll get the big picture, albeit missing some key details. So make sure you're supplementing your pop culture knowledge with autobiographies and works of nonfiction as well, recommends Darnell Hunt, director of UCLA's Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies.\n\nWith the help of pop culture and film experts, we've compiled a list, by no means exhaustive, of TV shows and movies you can stream to help you on your journey in understanding the jarringly different life Black Americans live because of racism.\n\n\"There are lots of ways to be Black, so I want you to be able to see the funny parts of it, the horrible parts of it, the scary parts of it and to just immerse yourself in stories that have Black people as their center,\" says Arienne Thompson, adjunct lecturer in journalism at Georgetown University and former USA TODAY pop culture journalist.\n\nMovies\n\n'Do the Right Thing' (1989)\n\nThis is the quintessential movie about police brutality. \"It's a hot summer in New York City and these racial tensions are bubbling up and then climax and the conclusion of the movie is so wrenching,\" Thompson says. \"It's terrible for anyone to watch and especially for us to see a Black body abused that way onscreen.\"\n\nSpike Lee's film is also on Boyd's list: \"It's about racial conflict, police brutality, chokehold. ... It was prophetic if you think about the killing of Radio Raheem, and how that mirrors exactly what people are responding to right now,\" he says.\n\n'Fruitvale Station' (2013)\n\nSome films are just too traumatic to watch more than once – if you can even get through them that one time. For Thompson, this is one of them. The Ryan Coogler film tells the story of Oscar Grant (Michael B. Jordan), a 22-year-old Black man who was shot to death by police at an Oakland, California, metro station. Thompson calls it a modern-day \"Do the Right Thing.\"\n\n\"There was a young Black man sitting next to me and crying during the movie and I'll never forget that,\" Thompson says.\n\n'Moonlight' (2016)\n\nThis Academy Award-winning picture shows the grief and trauma of Black men through an entirely different lens than police brutality while also highlighting the Black LGBTQ community.\n\nOscar watch:Inside the magic of 'Moonlight'\n\n\"It's about seeing the wholeness of Black people and the wholeness of Black men and how they can surprise you by not being who you think they are,\" Thompson says.\n\n'Dead Presidents' (1995)\n\nWhile there are many Vietnam war movies, none focus on the Black veteran experience like Albert and Allen Hughes' \"Dead Presidents,\" Boyd says.\n\n\" 'Dead Presidents' is about Black soldiers in Vietnam and particularly the struggles they face when they return home, but it's also about what sort of world they enter when they come back home,\" Boyd says.\n\n'In the Heat of the Night' (1967)\n\nThis film came at the height of Sidney Poitier's career, several years after he became the first Black star to win best actor at the Oscars (for \"Lilies of the Field\").\n\n\"There's a moment in the film when one of the racist Southerners slaps him and he quickly slaps him back. I call it the 'slap heard 'round the world,' \" Boyd says. \"So instead of standing there, taking the slap and turning the other cheek, he fights back.\n\n\"That scene is really satisfying because it ties to the politics of the late '60s after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. – a lot of people are no longer willing to be so peaceful.\"\n\n'Get Out' (2017)\n\nJordan Peele's directorial debut turns white supremacy into a horror flick.\n\n\" 'Get Out' is the personification of that meme like 'I wish people loved Black people as much as they love Black culture,' like that's literally what the movie is about,\" Thompson says. \"That these white people would pay to become Black and to take on these attributes of blackness that they want, that they covet.\"\n\n'13th' (2016)\n\nAva DuVernay's documentary explains the prison industrial complex and is timely as it spans from the 1800s through to Donald Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nIt explores why this is an issue in our society, discusses private prisons and the politics behind that, Boyd says.\n\n'To Sleep With Anger' (1990)\n\n\"It's really a film about a Black family in Los Angeles and one of their old friends from down South shows up unexpected and disrupts their life,\" Boyd says. \"You never see a Black family represented in such a humanistic way. It's funny, it's interesting, it's just a unique film in that it represents just a regular Black family.\" The film stars Danny Glover.\n\n'The Hate U Give' (2018)\n\n\"The Hate U Give\" is based on Angie Thomas’ 2017 young-adult novel and takes on themes of Black Lives Matter, police brutality and Black identity and puts them in the thought-provoking story of a Black girl growing up \"in a Black inner-city community and going to a white private school across town,\" Hunt says.\n\n\"It's important especially if you have young people in your home and in your family to show how early the trauma and the grief can start for some of us,\" Thompson says.\n\n'To Kill a Mockingbird' (1962)\n\nThis classic tale, which won three Academy Awards, is a good place to start.\n\n\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is adapted from Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name and follows the story of Atticus Finch, a white lawyer (Gregory Peck) who represents a Black man (Tom Robinson) accused of raping a white woman.\n\nMore:Books about race flying off shelves, climbing best-seller lists following the death of George Floyd, protests\n\n\"If that's the first movie that you watch, I want that kernel of rage at what happened to (Robinson) to take you through all the way to 'Boyz n the Hood' and 'Fruitvale Station,' \" Thompson says.\n\n'Malcolm X' (1992)\n\nLee's \"Malcolm X\" stars Denzel Washington as the activist and is based on Alex Haley and Malcolm X's \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X.\" The film takes you through monumental events in his life, from his criminal history to joining the Nation of Islam to his assassination.\n\n\"If you're serious about being anti-racist and an ally, consider this the foundation of your history lesson. You have to know what we've gone through and what we've overcome and what we still need to knock down to understand what's happening today,\" Thompson says.\n\n'Let the Fire Burn' (2013)\n\nBoyd recommends this documentary that depicts the police bombing of the MOVE organization (a Black liberation group) in Philadelphia in 1985..\n\nThe standoff between the organizers and Philadelphia police resulted in the death of 11 people, including children, and displaced many others.\n\nTV\n\n'Insecure' (2016)\n\nIssa Rae's hit series shows a different side of the Black experience. It follows young black professionals living in Los Angeles who navigate friendships, relationships and microaggressions in the workplace.\n\nIt's not explicitly about racism, says Hunt, but it uses South LA and Crenshaw neighborhood as a \"character of sorts.\" It also gives viewers a look at \"regular Black life,\" while naturally highlighting the reality of racial tensions that Black people face on a daily basis.\n\nMore:How Issa Rae's 'Insecure' navigates the workplace with style\n\n'The Wire' (2002)\n\nDavid Simon's \"The Wire\" got recommendations from both Hunt and Thompson, who both call it one of the best TV shows they've seen. The critically acclaimed police series stars Idris Elba, Dominic West and John Doman and tackles themes like drug wars and the education system.\n\n\"It kind of lays out structural racism, the impact of the educational system. It kind of gives you a pretty comprehensive picture of the overwhelming conditions in the Black community,\" says Hunt.\n\n'A Different World' (1987)\n\nWhile the entire series addresses race, Thompson recommends these two episodes: \"Honeymoon in LA\" (Parts 1 & 2). Whitley (Jasmine Guy) and Dwayne (Kadeem Hardison) go on their honeymoon during the Los Angeles riots in 1992 and the series shows how they experience those events in a fictional way.\n\nThis \"Cosby Show\" spinoff follows Denise Huxtable (Lisa Bonet) as she attends a historically Black university. It also stars Jada Pinkett Smith at the start of her acting career.\n\n'Dear White People' (2017)\n\nThis Netflix series, based on Justin Simien's movie of the same name, follows a group of Black students at a predominately white university. One student, Samantha White (Logan Browning), starts a podcast directed at white students. The series explores colorism within the black community, class and activism, among other themes.\n\n\"It's a comedic and satirical look at the way Black people are viewed and the way they have to compose themselves when they're in largely white environments,\" says Hunt.\n\n'Watchmen' (2019)\n\nThe superhero comics series was adapted into a politically-relevant drama about race and the criminal justice system.\n\nMore:How HBO's 'Watchmen' embraces the political bent, bonkers spirit of seminal '80s comic\n\n\"It opens with the Tulsa race riots and it's kind of like this inciting event that frames what the characters are dealing with,\" Hunt says. \"Race and policing is a backdrop, even though it's fantastical, it's still dealing with those issues in a very allegorical way.\"\n\n'When They See Us' (2019)\n\nAva DuVernay's Netflix miniseries tells the story of the wrongful conviction of five Black and Latino teenagers (dubbed the Central Park Five) for the 1989 assault on a female jogger in New York's Central Park.\n\nAll five were exonerated in 2002 when serial rapist Matias Reyes confessed he was the sole attacker.\n\n\"It's quite revealing and actually features footage of the current president and his stance on the young Black men at the time,\" Hunt says.\n\n'Luke Cage' (2016)\n\nThe Marvel TV series stars Mike Colter, a Black man who stands up for what’s right, even when he’s being shot at and his neighbors sometimes would rather he not stir up trouble.\n\n\"Another superhero kind of fantasy show, but again it's rooted in race and set in Harlem,\" says Hunt. \"It deals with some of the issues that community has faced over the years and they kind of weave that into the narrative and why it is people do what they do.\"\n\n'Black-ish' (2014)\n\nKenya Barris' \"Black-ish\" is a more straightforward, explanatory series about race that follows an upper-middle-class Black family living in a predominately white neighborhood navigating microaggressions from fellow neighbors, colleagues and friends.\n\nThompson recommends the \"Hope\" episode if you're short on time, which is about the shooting of an unarmed Black teen.\n\n\"Watch this episode, watch 'Do the Right Thing' and it'll give you that very entry-level groundwork for what we're talking about and what we're yelling about and what we're in the streets about,\" says Thompson.\n\nContributing: Grace Hauck, Deborah Barfield Berry, Jenna Ryu, USA TODAY\n\nMore:Looking for books about racism?

The day after he was inaugurated, more than two million people across the world called for a \"revolution\" as a bulwark against the new administration they feared would roll back reproductive, civil and human rights.\n\nThe year that followed was no less dramatic.\n\nFormer National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was ousted from the White House over his Russian contacts. NFL players continued to kneel. There were multiple data breaches, but none larger than Equifax, which compromised the personal information of nearly half of all Americans.\n\nInevitably, there was tragedy. The catastrophic 2017 hurricane season brought us Harvey, Irma and Maria, which Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico will spend years recovering from. New York City saw its worst terrorist attack since 9/11. In Las Vegas, 58 people died in the worst mass shooting in American history.\n\nBut there was also wonder. For the first time in almost 100 years, a total solar eclipse spanned across the country. We celebrated the news that one of our own, California native Meghan Markle, is set to wed Prince Harry and become the first divorced, biracial, Jewish American actress to join the British royal family.\n\nIn the end, 2017 closes with hope. Women punctuated the year with the powerful rallying cry #metoo, prompting a national reckoning on a culture of sexual violence that has persisted unabated for far too long.\n\nAfter another eventful year, USA TODAY revisits one story from each state — the big news, the best investigations and the moments we can't stop talking about.\n\nAlabama: Roy Moore and America’s reckoning on sexual violence\n\nThe eyes of a nation were fixed on Alabama this December to see who the state would choose to take over its open Senate seat in an election that was seen not only as a referendum on President Trump — who supported embattled Republican candidate Roy Moore — but also on the country's tolerance of predatory sexual behavior. Trump was elected in spite of more than a dozen allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him. But Moore, who was accused in November of sexually assaulting and harassing multiple teenage girls when he was in his 30s, was defeated by Democrat Doug Jones. It is the first time in 25 years that Alabama has elected a Democrat to the Senate.\n\nThe Alabama special election came during what America has come to refer to as its \"post-Weinstein moment,\" a reckoning on powerful men who have abused women with impunity, and who, until recently, rarely faced consequences. Since the reports Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein harassed, abused and assaulted more than 80 women over several decades, women around the country who have long suffered in silence flooded social media under the hashtag #metoo and made public statements about the sexual misconduct they've endured. For many Americans, this reckoning is complicated by Trump's presence in the White House. Trump's accusers have revived calls for a congressional investigation into his misconduct. Some say Jones’ victory will embolden Democrats to do just that.\n\nAlaska: Fear of climate change rises after U.S. leaves Paris Accord\n\nIn 2017, America became the only country on Earth not part of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement after President Trump decided to leave the pact in June. The Paris agreement, negotiated by former president Barack Obama, aims to combat global warming by gradually reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In Alaska, climate change is always front-of-mind. Many residents of Sarichef Island and an Iñupiaq village of 650 blame human-caused climate change for accelerating the island’s erosion and fear leaving the Paris agreement will supercharge destruction that's already occurring.\n\nArizona: McCain, battling brain cancer, stops Obamacare repeal\n\nIt was a tense July night on the Senate floor when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. — roughly a week after announcing his brain cancer diagnosis — sunk the GOP-backed \"skinny repeal\" of Obamacare with a dramatic \"thumbs down.\" Before the vote, congressional leaders had struggled to reach consensus on a plan to replace former president Barack Obama's signature health care law, which the GOP had promised for seven years to expunge the law from the books. Republicans ultimately scrapped a vote on a last-ditch Obamacare repeal effort in September, which McCain also opposed. As for his health, McCain said in September he would continue treatments for brain cancer while also doing his job on Capitol Hill.\n\nArkansas: Controversial Ten Commandments monument destroyed after less than 24 hours\n\nAfter years of fierce debate, Arkansas built a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the state capitol building. Less than 24 hours later, the monument was razed. Michael Tate Reed, 32, plowed his car through the statue while filming the incident on his cellphone and posting the video on Facebook, authorities said. The 6-foot, 6,000-pound memorial drew the ire of opponents like the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas and the Temple of Satan, who said the monument was an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. Supporters saw it as a way to celebrate the role the Ten Commandments played in this country’s law. State Sen. Jason Rapert, who led the push to initially erect the monument, vowed to raise funds to build its replacement.\n\nCalifornia: Meghan Markle, America's fairy-tale royal bride\n\nRoyal wedding bells are ringing yet again. Suits actress and California native Meghan Markle is set to wed Prince Harry, the world's most eligible royal bachelor. The couple announced their engagement in November. Markle, who was raised in Los Angeles, will make history as the first divorced, biracial, Jewish American actress to join the British royal family. After they wed, Harry will likely receive a new royal title as a duke from his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and Markle will, like Duchess Kate, be known as a titled royal duchess, HRH Meghan, Duchess of so-and-so. Also in royals: Prince William and Kate Middleton announced they are expecting their third child. Sister Pippa Middleton's May wedding was the A-list event of the year.\n\nColorado: Baker's confections vs. gay couple's affections\n\nIn 2012, Charlie Craig and David Mullins went into baker Jack Phillips' Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colo., to buy a cake for their wedding. But Phillips doesn't do cakes for same-sex weddings. Craig and Mullins said Phillips' refusal violated a Colorado anti-discrimination law. Five years later, their disagreement over a cake went all the way to the Supreme Court in a case testing the Constitution's guarantee of free speech and religion against state laws prohibiting discrimination. The court, bolstered in April by the addition of stalwart conservative and fellow Coloradan Neil Gorsuch, appeared split down the middle when the justices heard oral arguments Dec. 5. The decision, which will likely hinge on Justice Anthony Kennedy, isn't expected until next year.\n\nConnecticut: Hate crime, or roommate feud gone too far?\n\nIn late October, former University of Hartford student Briana Brochu was charged with breach of peace and criminal mischief for tampering with items that belonged to her roommate, who is black. Brochu admitted she licked Chennel \"Jazzy\" Rowe's eating utensils and smeared bodily fluids on her backpack. Rowe posted a Facebook video about the incident, which quickly viral, and prompted backlash on social media as many questioned whether Brochu's actions were racially motivated. The Connecticut NAACP and others called on Hartford prosecutors to file a hate crime charge against Brochu, but Brochu's lawyer, Thomas Stevens, told the Hartford Courant he does not believe the charge will be added. Stevens told the paper there was nothing \"racial that motivated\" the incident, and said they were simply roommates who did not get along.\n\nDelaware: Beau's death convinced Joe Biden not to run for president\n\nHad he run for president, Joe Biden believes he would have taken the oath of office Jan. 20 rather than the train home to Wilmington. The former vice president and Delaware senator, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom days before leaving office, revealed in his emotional book that he originally considered staying out of the 2016 race to pave the way for his son Beau's budding political career, and Beau’s death following a brutal bout with cancer ultimately convinced him it wasn’t the time to make the run. So what about a 2020 push? He hasn’t ruled it out quite yet.\n\nFlorida: Irma devastates the Gulf coast\n\nHurricane Irma sawed up Florida's Gulf coast in early September, the strongest hurricane the Sunshine State had faced in a decade. Its slow crawl toward Florida caused a run on hardware store and grocery essentials, while evacuation orders threw the state's highways into a standstill. After it pummeled Key West, the storm struck the Naples area, taking down trees and causing flooding across the state. All told, millions lost power and dozens died, including 14 people at a Hollywood nursing home, where a power outage left residents in sweltering conditions for three days. It sparked a criminal investigation in which 12 of the deaths were deemed homicides. Now, state lawmakers seek laws requiring assisted living facilities to have generators.\n\nGeorgia: Equifax data breach leaves millions of consumers vulnerable\n\nAtlanta-based company Equifax, once trusted to handle our credit scores, has become a pariah of the financial world since hackers stole the vital information of 145 million Americans in Equifax’s system. The breach announced this September included Social Security numbers, names, addresses and dates of birth. How did Equifax get into the mess? A security patch for a known system bug was issued but Equifax hadn’t installed it. Lawmakers asked questions, the CEO resigned, and a good chunk of America freaked out. One way consumers tried to protect themselves was by freezing their credit, but since everyone tried to do it at once, there were problems. Here's how to protect yourself from a breach.\n\nHawaii: Trump travel ban found trouble in paradise\n\nThe Aloha State was not a welcoming place for President Trump's plans to ban travel from a group of predominantly Muslim countries. The administration issued three versions of the ban in 2017 and all three were blocked by a federal judge in Hawaii. But despite the Hawaii bench’s best efforts to thwart the ban, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled this month that Trump’s order can take full effect while legal challenges against the latest version are still tied up in courts. By allowing the full travel ban to take effect for now, the justices may be signaling that they are likely to uphold it on the merits at a later date.\n\nIdaho: Bergdahl avoids jail time for disappearing from Afghanistan base\n\nSgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the U.S. Army soldier who disappeared from his base in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban, avoided jail time despite pleading guilty to desertion and misbehavior in front of the enemy. Former president Barack Obama won freedom for the Idaho native in 2014 by negotiating a prisoner swap with the Taliban militants. His case even became the subject of the second season of the podcast Serial. Bergdahl faced a life sentence for abandoning his post, but a military judge ruled to reduce him in rank to private and dishonorably discharge him. President Trump slammed the decision in a tweet, calling it, \"a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military.\"\n\nIllinois: Conspiracy, obstruction charges in Laquan McDonald killing\n\nThe dash cam footage was chilling. Sixteen shots fired at Laquan McDonald as the 17-year-old walked away from police. Now prosecutors say three Chicago police officers were trying to \"conceal the true facts\" in McDonald's death. A Cook County grand jury indicted the officers in June with state charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and misconduct. \"These defendants did more than merely obey an unofficial 'code of silence,'\" special prosecutor Patricia Brown Holmes said of the alleged coverup. Officer Jason Van Dyke previously pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trail on first-degree murder charges.\n\nIndiana: A canceled wedding, but love prevails\n\nWhen an Indiana couple called off their $30,000 wedding a week before the big day, they were stuck with a non-refundable reception. What did would-be bride Sarah Cummins do? She invited guests from four area homeless shelters. Her generosity inspired a local man to donate suits for guests, his tailor donated a few more and another local business contributed dresses and accessories. The July dinner, which included chicken, salmon, wedding cake and even a late-night snack of pizza, turned a painful situation positive, Cummins said. She now volunteers for a center for homeless families in Indianapolis.\n\nIowa: A giant wave connects sick kids to the outside world\n\nThe new children's hospital practically hangs over the University of Iowa's Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City. Before the season kicked off, a fan named Krista Young had an idea: \"Kinnick should hold a 'wave to the kids' minute during every game.\" The Facebook post went viral and on Sept. 2, when the Hawkeyes' football team hosted the Wyoming Cowboys, 68,000-plus fans rose, turned to the hospital and offered a long, sustained wave to sick children — some of whom haven't left in months — gathered near the windows to watch the game. Kristen Brown, a nurse at the Stead Family Children's Hospital, said the now-regular waves connect kids to the outside world. \"Anytime we can make them feel normal and a part of something, it's very meaningful,\" she said.\n\nKansas: Principal resigns after student newspaper questions her credentials\n\nA team of high school journalism students in Kansas published an investigative story questioning their incoming principal's qualifications. And then she resigned. The student reporters received national recognition after they revealed that Amy Robertson, their would-be new principal, received her master's and doctoral degrees from Corllins University, an unaccredited online school. Robertson, who currently works with an education consulting firm in Dubai, said she received her degrees before the university lost accreditation. The Pittsburg School Board accepted Robertson's resignation in April.\n\nKentucky: Passenger's removal from United flight sparks uproar\n\nOn April 9, Kentucky doctor David Dao was shown on video being forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Louisville. Dao was among four passengers scheduled to be removed to accommodate crew members. The footage of Dao screaming as he was pulled from the plane went viral. Days later, Dao's lawyer said he suffered a concussion and broken nose. The incident prompted United to make changes to its passenger policies. Two security officers involved in the incident were fired.\n\nLouisiana: 'I'm back': Steve Scalise returns to Congress after shooting\n\nWith two words, \"I'm back,\" Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise tweeted his remarkable return to the U.S. Capitol after a gunman critically wounded him during a congressional baseball team practice on June 14 outside Washington, D.C. Four others were shot before the gunman was killed. Scalise was discharged from the hospital six weeks later to begin a process of intensive rehabilitation. On September 28, Scalise got back to work, tweeting a photo of him and his wife Jennifer looking out at the National Mall from the Capitol. His return to the House floor was met by a standing ovation. \"You have no idea how great this feels to be back here at work in the people's House.\"\n\nMaine: Thousands send Christmas cards to dying boy\n\nJacob Thompson just wanted to celebrate one more Christmas. The 9-year-old from Maine, who had been diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma in February 2014, made a simple request when he was admitted to the hospital in October and was told he had only a month to live: Send Christmas cards. Tens of thousands of cards flew into Jacob's small hospital room as the boy's story captured the hearts of people across the nation. Having a love for penguins, he even got a special visit when the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut brought the tuxedo birds to meet their young fan. Thompson died Nov. 19.\n\nMaryland: The day the NFL took a knee\n\nNFL players responded in full force on a Sunday in September after President Trump repeatedly called for punishing players who didn’t stand during the national anthem. In the first game that day, a number of teammates from the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars either knelt or locked arms at a high-profile game in London. Landover, Md.-based Washington Redskins players stood with arms locked, though some players chose to kneel. And across the league demonstrations spread, as many players broke out of their routine by joining the protests or engaging in team-wide displays of unity. The protests first began in the 2016 season, when then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick said it was his way of speaking out against racial injustice and police brutality.\n\nMassachusetts: Michelle Carter gets 15 months in prison for texting boyfriend to commit suicide\n\n\"You can't think about it. You just have to do it. You said you were gonna do it.\" Michelle Carter, 20, sent dozens of texts like this encouraging her boyfriend Conrad Roy III, 18, to commit suicide, which Roy eventually did after Carter instructed him to get back in a truck filling with carbon monoxide. Carter was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison, of which she'll serve 15 months. The case was the first to determine the legality of telling someone to commit suicide. Legal experts are concerned that it could set a bad legal precedent.\n\nMichigan: '90s grunge lost an icon in Chris Cornell\n\nSoundgarden singer Chris Cornell's distinctive, nearly four-octave wail was nearly synonymous with the grunge-music era of the 1990s. Just hours after performing for a Detroit crowd in May, the 52-year-old was found unresponsive in his hotel room. The Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office ruled the death a suicide by hanging, although his family questioned the findings. Cornell was just one among many celebrities we lost this year.\n\nMinnesota: #MeToo movement hits Minnesota hard\n\nDemocratic Senator Al Franken announced his resignation in December after more than a half dozen women said he touched them improperly or made unwanted sexual advances. Franken disputed some accusations and suggested he was being held to a different standard than President Trump. Franken became the second member of Congress to announce his resignation due to sexual harassment allegations in 2017. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., a civil rights icon first elected to the House in 1964, stepped down after several women accused him of harassment. Franken's fellow Minnesotan Garrison Keillor, the iconic Prairie Home Companion host, was fired in November after allegations of \"inappropriate behavior.\"\n\nMississippi: Bringing 'insane asylum' dead back to life\n\nUp to 7,000 dead bodies are buried underneath the University of Mississippi Medical Center campus. They are former patients of the state's first mental institution, called simply the Insane Asylum, built in 1855. Underground radar shows the coffins stretch across 20 acres of the campus. UMMC discovered 66 coffins while doing construction on the campus in 2013, but has since detected thousands more. UMMC is now teaming up with a professor from Millsaps College in Jackson for a possible National Endowment of Humanities grant that would fund a study of the asylum and its history as well as engage families whose ancestors lived there. The center is looking at exhuming the bodies, and preserving as well as studying the remains.\n\nMissouri: Girl mistakes elk for deer, shoots it dead, story goes viral\n\nAbby Wilson, 14, was hunting alone when she said she spotted a very large white-tailed deer and pulled the trigger. The problem? It wasn't a deer. It was an elk. Her father, Donald White, immediately called the conservation department upon realizing his daughter's mistake. Because there's no elk hunting season in Missouri, the animals are protected and wildlife officials are determining whether to issue any citations or warnings to the young hunter. After the story went viral, White said comments directed at her, including that she should be locked up, amounted to bullying.\n\nMontana: Body slam shows just one of many threats facing journalists\n\nThe first year of the Trump era was a tough one for American journalists. On top of competing with \"alternative facts\" and being labeled the \"enemy of the American people\" by the president, some reporters were physically stopped from doing their jobs. In May, wealthy businessman Greg Gianforte, who was running for Montana's open House seat, was arrested for assaulting Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs on the eve of the election. Gianforte won over Montana voters but apparently lied to investigators after the body slam.\n\nNebraska: Sasse sasses Trump\n\nIt's no secret that Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse took his fair share of jabs at President Trump this year. The young Republican from Plainview recently asked the president if he was \"recanting\" his oath of office following an apparent threat of the freedom of the press. He also called out Trump for his Twitter attack on the hosts of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" saying \"it's beneath the dignity of your office.\" Sasse's and other GOP legislators', well, sass, highlights Trump's struggle to make nice with Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nNevada: Deadliest year for mass killings in more than a decade\n\nOn Oct. 1, America changed forever when a gunman shattered his hotel windows at the Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegas and opened fire on 22,000 country music fans at the outdoor Route 91 Harvest Festival. Fifty-eight would die in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Nearly 500 were injured. The gunman's motive remains a mystery. A wounded country came together again in November when a gunman killed 25 people, including a pregnant woman whose unborn baby also died, during a church service in Sutherland Springs, Texas. With that, 2017 earned a bitter honor of being the most deadly year for mass killings in the U.S. in more than a decade. Three of the five largest mass killings — in Sutherland Springs, Las Vegas and at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. — have taken place since June 2016.\n\nNew Hampshire: Voter fraud or bogus claims?\n\nFollowing the 2016 election, President Trump called for a crackdown on voter fraud. Trump claimed he lost New Hampshire because thousands of Massachusetts residents were bused to New Hampshire to cast illegal votes against him. The solution? A voter fraud election commission was set up to investigate the matter. To date, legal experts and the New Hampshire deputy secretary of state said there is no evidence of voter fraud and the commission itself seems to have gone dark in recent weeks, with the last meeting held Sept. 12 in the Granite State.\n\nNew Jersey: Chris Christie feels the heat over 'beachgate'\n\nJust before the Fourth of July, Governor Chris Christie was spotted lounging outside his residence on Island Beach State Park. The only problem? He'd just closed that beach to the public — and all the other state parks in New Jersey — thanks to a state government shutdown. The photo became the source of endless memes, and New Jersey residents told the governor to \"get the hell off the beach!\" A few weeks before \"beachgate,\" a poll found Christie's approval ratings had sunk to 15%, making him the least popular governor in any state in the past 20 years. After legislators struck a deal in ending the three day shutdown in time for the holiday, Christie announced he was headed right back to the beach.\n\nNew Mexico: Plague found, and this isn't the first time\n\nThe plague, once called the Black Death, wiped out nearly half of the European population in the Middle Ages. And while it sounds like a disease that should have no place in modern times, each spring and summer cases pop up, often in Western areas. In late June, New Mexico confirmed a total of three cases of the plague in Santa Fe County. According to the New Mexico Department of Health, all three were hospitalized and later released. So, how does one get the plague? It’s typically transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas, and while terrifying sounding, it can be treated if the symptoms are recognized early.\n\nNew York: Terror in NYC\n\nIt was New York City's worst terrorist attack since 9/11, and occurred just a few blocks away from where the iconic twin towers crumbled. This November, Sayfullo Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan with ties to the Islamic State, ran down cyclists and pedestrians on a busy bike path before crashing into a school bus, killing 8 people and injuring 12. Saipov's killings occurred mere hours before the city's annual Halloween parade was to kick off, but revelers were undeterred. Amid heavier police presence, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio joined a million people who marched and danced down 6th Avenue in defiance of terror. De Blasio said, \"What New Yorkers showed already is we will not change, we will not be cowed, we will not be thrown off by anything.\"\n\nNorth Carolina: Gerrymandering case struck down case, but what’s next?\n\nThe United States Supreme Court in June struck down dozens of state legislative districts in North Carolina because they disadvantaged black voters. Then, federal judges rejected a request by North Carolina voters to hold special elections next March in new districts once lines are redrawn to eliminate illegal racial gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is the deliberate process of redrawing lines to sway electoral outcomes in favor of a certain political party. As Karl Rove once said: \"He who controls redistricting can control Congress.\" The issue has also been disputed in other states across the USA this year, particularly Wisconsin, which has a gerrymandering case before the Supreme Court with far-reaching national implications.\n\nNorth Dakota: Dakota Access Pipeline flows amid controversy\n\nAfter months of protests from environmental groups and Native American activists, the Army said it would allow the $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline to cross under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota, completing the disputed project. The 1,200-mile pipeline began transporting crude oil on June 1 from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a distribution hub in Illinois. Activists renewed calls to shut it down after a federal judge ruled the Army Corps of Engineers complied with some, but not all, requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act before issuing a permit. The developer of the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, has since filed a $1 billion federal lawsuit against several environmental groups accusing them of fraud, eco-terrorism and participation in a criminal enterprise.\n\nOhio: Otto Warmbier's death, and a year of high-stakes tension with North Korea\n\nThe death of Ohio native Otto Warmbier was a heartbreaking moment in a year of marked tensions with North Korea. Warmbier, a college student at the University of Virginia, was arrested in North Korea on charges of trying to steal a poster. The 22-year-old was returned home in June in a coma; he died shortly thereafter. Pyongyang denied it tortured or mistreated him, claiming Warmbier contracted botulism and was given a sleeping pill. Throughout 2017, President Trump and Kim Jong Un, whom Trump dubbed \"Little Rocket Man,\" exchanged ever more heated threats over North Korea's rapid development of nuclear weapons that could strike the U.S. mainland.\n\nOklahoma: Another blow to Black Lives Matter\n\n\"Hands up, don't shoot,\" became a rallying cry after Michael Brown was killed in 2014 in Ferguson, Mo. Terence Crutcher had his hands up. Police shot. In May, a jury acquitted of first-degree manslaughter white Tulsa officer Betty Jo Shelby, who says she fired out of fear last year when she killed 40-year-old Crutcher. His family burst into tears at the verdict. In a video of the incident, the Tulsa Police Department can be heard saying Crutcher \"looks like a bad dude.\" Crutcher's twin sister later said, \"That 'big bad dude' was a father ... a son.\" The controversial verdict led to protests from Black Lives Matter. Shelby has since resigned from the Tulsa Police Department.\n\nOregon: The Great American Eclipse captivates a nation\n\nFor the first time in almost 100 years, a total solar eclipse spanned across the country. Americans paused and enjoyed some unity as the moon passed between the sun and the Earth. Many traveled to the path of totality to experience the eerie darkness. From coast to coast, Americans watched — hopefully while wearing eclipse glasses — as the moon's shadow traced its 67-mile wide path across the country starting in Oregon. Those 2-3 minutes of darkness brought millions of tourist dollars to hotels, campgrounds, restaurants and museums in cities in the eclipse path.\n\nPennsylvania: They gave him 18 drinks. Then, left him to die\n\nThe horrifying death of a 19-year-old fraternity pledge captured on video exposed dangerous hazing rituals by members of Penn State University's Beta Theta Pi. After frat brothers gave Timothy Piazza 18 drinks in less than one hour and 22 minutes, his blood-alcohol content was about four times the legal limit for driving. Piazza was found unconscious in the basement the next day and later died. At least two dozen face charges in the case. Three other pledges across the nation died this year in Greek-related drinking incidents.\n\nRhode Island: Michael Flynn, and the role of Russia in the 2016 election\n\nDespite being one of the most vulnerable figures in special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn remained beloved in his Rhode Island hometown in 2017. Flynn was ousted from the White House just weeks after President Trump's inauguration over his Russian contacts, and in December, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Flynn is among four campaign aides charged so far in Mueller's investigation. Flynn is the only one who served in Trump's administration. The only other guilty plea is George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign associate Rick Gates have been charged and pleaded not guilty. In addition to Mueller's investigation, three Congressional committees are looking at Russia.\n\nSouth Carolina: Governor stands by Trump amid sanctuary city crackdown\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster made it clear in October that the Palmetto State would not tolerate any cities acting as sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants. The governor's strong condemnation of sanctuary cities came months after President Trump's executive order cracking down on cities that limit cooperation with immigration agencies. Following the order, leaders of some of the nation's biggest cities, including New York City, Chicago, and Boston, flatly stated they would not cooperate with the president. In November, a federal judge permanently blocked Trump's executive order on sanctuary cities.\n\nSouth Dakota: Old gold mine might hold treasured info on why we exist\n\nResearchers are in search of a different kind of treasure in a rural South Dakota gold mine: potential secrets explaining how the universe was created. The mine in Lead, S.D., that once hosted gold rushes in the 1800s will serve as home to scientists participating in the largest U.S.-based particle physics experiment. The experiment will determine whether particles called neutrinos help explain our existence. Over the next 10 years, workers will remove more than 870,000 tons of rock and install a four-story, 70,000-ton neutrino detector. The collaboration will involve 1,000 scientists from more than 30 countries.\n\nTennessee: Tuition-free community college\n\nTennessee students can put away their checkbooks if community colleges are in their future. In May, the southern state became the first to offer a tuition-free education to nearly every resident without a degree. Even though Tennessee was the first state to pass the measure, it isn't without precursors. New York legislators passed a budget in April that covered tuition for families making less than $100,000 a year. In February, San Francisco voters passed a tax measure that would cover community college tuition for anyone who lived in the city for more than a year, though the state of California did not follow suit.\n\nTexas: Hurricane Harvey hit hard\n\nHurricane Harvey's historic downpour brought destruction to the Texas Gulf coast. Harvey killed dozens, dumped more than 50 inches of rain and drove thousands from their homes. Its effects will be felt for months and years into the future. Amid the destruction, people stepped up to help. There was Houston Texans star J.J. Watt raising more than $37 million in online donations, human chains pulling people to safety and an impromptu gospel singing performance at a shelter. Watt perhaps put it best: \"When times are the toughest, humanity stands at its strongest.\"\n\nUtah: Outcry over nurse's arrest for refusing to draw unconscious patient's blood\n\nA Utah police officer was fired after he arrested a nurse who refused to let him draw blood from an unconscious patient without a warrant. Body cam footage of the arrest shows Detective Jeff Payne dragging Alex Wubbels from University Hospital while she sobs \"this is crazy.\" An investigation was opened after video of the arrest went viral, and Wubbels received a $500,000 settlement from the city and the university that runs the hospital. She said she would give a portion of the settlement to the nurses union and help lead a campaign to stop physical and verbal abuse of nurses on the job.\n\nVermont: This 13-year-old wants to be governor\n\nEthan Sonneborn, 13, has some lofty political ambitions. The young Democrat announced this summer that he's running for governor in 2018, and with Vermont's founders imposing no age requirement for its highest office, his path to power is a little easier. The Bristol resident follows the news closely, chooses his words deliberately and sees his age as an asset, not a liability. \"We elected our oldest president ever,\" Sonneborn said, \"and he tweets like a kindergartner.\" His views on the president echo those of prominent Vermont progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, who told USA TODAY one year after the election that Trump's presidency is an \"unprecedented disaster.\" A hot topic Sonneborn would have to address if elected: recreational marijuana. Gov. Phil Scott vetoed a legalization bill in May, a decision with which Sonneborn took issue.\n\nVirginia: White supremacy in Charlottesville\n\nIt's 2017, and there were neo-Nazis in the streets. In August, hundreds of white nationalists, white supremacists and neo-Nazis descended upon Charlottesville, Va., for a \"Unite the Right\" rally to protest the removal of a Confederate statue of Robert E. Lee. The rally turned violent when James Alex Fields, Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, who had expressed support for neo-Nazi positions, drove his car at high speed into a crowd of protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. President Trump was reticent to condemn the white supremacists, saying \"many sides\" were to blame for the violence. After his comments, Heyer's mother said she wouldn't take phone calls from the president. The rally was headlined by far-right white nationalist Richard Spencer, who returned to the city for another protest in October. Here's why Charlottesville has become ground zero for white supremacists.\n\nWashington: Amazon's new dome home\n\nAmazon joined Apple and Google in the race to build futuristic tech headquarters, introducing the Spheres, three (you guessed it) spheres that will \"round\" out the Seattle cityscape. The tallest of the glass and metal orbs rises 90 feet and is more than 130 feet in diameter, with two smaller spheres on each side. The space will host up to 800 employees for potential meetings, meals and mingling. It will also feature plenty of plant life, along with tree-house meeting rooms, a river and waterfalls, and a green \"bird's nest\" conference room. The rest of the public can visit through shops located near the entrance or by signing up for tours once it opens next year.\n\nWest Virginia: Coal country digs Trump\n\nWest Virginia, once a Democratic stronghold, is now Trump country. West Virginia’s conservative shift has been so pronounced that Gov. Jim Justice changed his political stripes in August and flipped from Democrat to Republican after just seven months in office. The state hasn't gone Democrat in a presidential election since 1996, and Hillary Clinton lost there by more than 40%. President Trump, who promised to bring coal mining jobs back, also got 77% of the vote in the Republican primary there. Trump took a lot of heat for politicizing the Boy Scout Jamboree held in West Virginia in July (prompting an apology from the Boy Scouts) but he was right back in the state the following week to rally the base and tout an end to \"war on beautiful clean coal.\"\n\nWisconsin: Blacked-out vacationers suspect tainted booze\n\nAbbey Conner went on a family vacation to an all-inclusive Mexican resort in January, but shortly after arriving, she was found face down in the pool, brain dead. Connor's death days later sparked a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation that found 100-plus people saying they blacked out from moderate to light drinking at Mexican resorts. Some were robbed. Others were raped. Few ever found justice. The State Department issued an alert about possibly tainted or counterfeit alcohol. Mexican officials swept tourist spots and claimed to seize 10,000 gallons of illegal booze from a shoddy distributer. They reported no such evidence at the resort where Connor drowned.\n\nWyoming: Trump national parks moves met with backlash\n\nThis year may have been your last chance to visit Yellowstone without doling out $70 to do so. The Trump administration in October proposed a price increase for the Wyoming landmark and 16 other national parks. Trump also faced criticism — and legal action — for his decision to shrink federally protected land by about two million acres in Bear Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah earlier this month. In April, Trump signed an executive order to review more than a dozen national monuments across the USA.\n\nWashington, D.C.: Nation's capital becomes epicenter of the #resistance\n\nHome to the most massive manifestations of opposition to the Trump agenda in a year that saw #resistance protests and marches against the administration across the country, Washington, D.C., became a hotbed for public demonstrations countering the president. The Women's March on Washington was the first and fiercest, coming the day after Trump's inauguration (which did NOT draw the biggest crowd to the National Mall in history, despite some claims to the contrary) and drawing an estimated 500,000 people angered at a president accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct. Huge crowds also gathered for the March for Science, the People's Climate March and the March for Truth. Forgot about September's pro-Trump, Mother of All Rallies? It's understandable. Only a thousand folks turned out and it was held the same day as the historic Juggalo March.\n\nPuerto Rico: Maria devastates Puerto Rico, fueling feud with Trump\n\nHurricane Maria pounded Puerto Rico in late September, causing unprecedented devastation to the island of 3.4 million people. The storm knocked out the majority of Puerto Rico's power and sparked a feud between the island and President Trump. For those unclear, Puerto Rico is indeed part of the United States — it's a commonwealth — and yes, its residents are U.S. citizens. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz took shots at Trump for the government's response to Maria, which she called \"inadequate.\" Trump publicly bashed Cruz, saying she had \"poor leadership ability.\" Months after the storm, large parts of the island remained without power, prompting Washington to seek efforts to modernize Puerto Rico's power grid.\n\nGuam: Priest sex abuse cases shatter faith on Guam\n\nThe predominantly Catholic island of Guam was rocked when a Pacific Daily News investigation unearthed decades of sexual assault, manipulation and intimidation against children reared on the remote U.S. territory by some of its most revered men, the Catholic clergy. At least 143 cases of child sexual abuse have been reported against Catholic priests tied to Guam. Of those cases, 87 involve a single former priest and scoutmaster, Louis Brouillard, who allegedly committed horrendous sexual crimes against children, including accounts of rape, drugging and even tying up a boy before forced sex acts. Also among the accusations: a boy fondled on the way to his grandmother's burial, and another molested for the first time on his seventh birthday, then raped or assaulted 100 more times.\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands: Ravaged by back-to-back hurricanes\n\nBefore Hurricanes Irma and Maria made their way to Florida and Puerto Rico, they tore through the U.S. Virgin Islands, a cluster of American islands in the Caribbean. Weeks after the back-to-back September storms, Virgin Islanders – who are Americans by birth – were in the grips of a long and painful recovery. Thousands went without power, and telephone and internet coverage remained spotty. Many fled – perhaps never to return. When USA TODAY reporter Fredreka Schouten returned home, she found family and friends' houses torn apart, and her former school with windows blown out and metal littered about. The destruction brought back memories of past devastating storms – Hugo in 1989 and Marilyn in 1995.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nRemember when?\n\nThis is a compilation of stories from across USA TODAY and the USA TODAY Network.

This past year \"has been a really cool reminder that our heroes unite us,\" she says. \"When we look at our heroes, we agree and that matters.\" One of those heroes, for her, is Garland, and Zellweger paid tribute to \"her legacy of unique exceptionalism and inclusivity and generosity of spirit.\"\n\nBest-dressed at the Oscars:Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Mindy Kaling rule the red carpet\n\n'Acting legend':Laura Dern makes mom Diane Ladd cry during heartwarming Oscars speech\n\n11:06: \"Joker\" star Joaquin Phoenix finally gets his first Oscar for best actor. He gives a long and impassioned acceptance speech touching on injustice, honoring the natural world and letting love and compassion be \"our guiding principles,\" he says. \"We're at our best when we support each other and (do) not cancel each other out. That is the best of humanity.\" Choking up, he quotes a lyric by his late brother River: \"Run to the rescue with love and peace will follow.\"\n\n10:55: Grammy winner Billie Eilish takes the stage to sing an emotional cover of The Beatles' \"Yesterday\" for the \"In Memoriam\" segment, which opened with Kobe Bryant and ended with Kirk Douglas, who died this week.\n\n10:52: \"Parasite\" snags its third Oscar as Bong Joon-ho is named best director. The crowd goes wild, including Martin Scorsese. \"After winning best international feature, I thought I was done for the day and was ready to relax,\" says Bong, who then quotes Scorsese, who earns his own standing \"O.\" \"Just to be nominated is a huge honor. I never thought I would win.\" Bong also thanks Quentin Tarantino for championing his films and jokes he wants to take a \"Texas chainsaw\" to the Oscar so he can share it with his fellow nominees.\n\n10:45: Elton John and Bernie Taupin take the original song Oscar for \"(I'm Gonna) Love Me Again\" from \"Rocketman.\" \"Wow, this doesn't suck,\" Taupin says of his first Oscar. (John won for \"The Lion King.\") \"Being here with this guy, I don't have words for it. This is justification for 53 years of hammering it out and doing what we do.\" John calls Taupin \"the constant thing\" in his life and says, \"Daddy loves you\" to his kids in Australia.\n\n10:42: \"Joker\" composer Hildur Guðnadóttir wins for best original score and gets a standing ovation. \"This is so touching. Thank you to the Academy for welcoming me so warmly,\" she says. Guðnadóttir thanks director Todd Phillips \"for taking me on this journey and listening to me along the way\" and ends with an empowering note: \"To the girls, to the women, to the daughters who hear the music bubbling within, speak up.

Honoree Kazu Hiro thanks star Charlize Theron. \"You are an amazing actor and producer. Your passion and love and care made this film possible,\" he says as the camera pans to a teary Theron.\n\n10:13: \"Cats\" stars James Corden and Rebel Wilson come out in furry outfits to present the best visual effects Oscar, obviously having some fun with their maligned movie's infamy. \"Nobody more than us knows the importance of good visual effects,\" Corden jokes. The award goes to \"1917,\" marking the third win for the World War I thriller.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix:Read new Oscar winner's full acceptance speech for best actor\n\nOscars:Janelle Monae, Chris Rock, Steve Martin skewer Academy for lack of diversity\n\n10:04: \"Harriet\" best actress nominee Cynthia Erivo is accompanied by a chant ensemble in a rousing rendition of original song contender \"Stand Up.\"\n\n9:52: Roger Deakins picks up his second best cinematography Oscar for \"1917,\" as widely expected.

(Martin Scorsese, however, sits still and rather stone-faced.)\n\n9:38: \"Ford v Ferrari\" wins its first Oscar, for sound editing. Award winner Donald Sylvester points out his director James Mangold should have been nominated. The award for sound mixing goes to \"1917.\"\n\n9:17: No surprise: Laura Dern wins her first Oscar, as supporting actress for \"Marriage Story.\" \"This is the best birthday present ever,\" Dern says, paying tribute to \"my acting heroes,\" her parents Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern. \"You got game; I love you.\"\n\n9:09: Best documentary feature is awarded to \"American Factory,\" and \"Leaning to Skateboard in a Warzone (If You're a Girl)\" wins the Oscar for documentary short subject.\n\nRed carpet statement:Natalie Portman wears cape embroidered with names of snubbed female directors to Oscars\n\nBrutally honest rankings:Every Oscars 2020 musical performance, from Eminem's shocker to Elton John\n\n9:01: Chrissy Metz (of \"This Is Us\" fame) gets a backup choir when singing \"I'm Standing With You,\" the original song nominee from \"Breakthrough.\"\n\n8:56: \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" snags its second Oscar, for production design, and \"Little Women\" wins for costume design. \"Women\" costumer Jacqueline Durran praises director Greta Gerwig: \"She was an inspiration for all of us, for her courage and brilliance.\"\n\n8:48: Best live-action short goes to \"The Neighbors' Window.\"\n\n8:45: Taika Waititi wins adapted screenplay for \"Jojo Rabbit.\" \"This is really light.

Cherry says his short was done \"because we wanted to see more representation in animation.\" He dedicated the Oscar to the late NBA star Kobe Bryant: \"May we all have a second act as great as his was.\"\n\n8:14: The first award of the night, supporting actor, goes to Brad Pitt for Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" It's his first acting Oscar. \"Wow,\" he says, \"This is really incredible. Thank you, Academy, for this honor of honors.\" He gets a little political, saying his 45 seconds is 45 seconds more than John Bolton had to speak at President Donald Trump's impeachment trial. \"I'm thinking Quentin does a movie about it and in the end, the adults do the right thing.\" Pitt also shouts out stunt coordinators and say he's been \"gobsmacked\" by thinking about his career \"to stand here. Once upon in Hollywood? Ain't that the truth.\"\n\n8:06: Steve Martin and Chris Rock come out to do a bit. Martin asks why the Oscars don't have a host anymore and Rock quips, \"Twitter.\" Martin points out Brad Pitt and jokes, \"It's like looking in a mirror.\" And Rock mentions Mahershala Ali is here and has won two Oscars: \"You know what that means when the cops pull him over? Nothing.\" The twosome jokes about Jeff Bezos, Joker and the female director snubs. \"Do you know what was missing from this year's Oscars?\" Martin says, and Rock responds, \"Vaginas.\"\n\n8:00: Janelle Monae opens the show with a tribute to Mr. Rogers, changing into a red sweater and singing the theme song to \"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\" star Tom Hanks. (She also gives him her bowler hat!) She then returns to the stage to perform her song \"Come Alive\" with backup dancers, including a couple dressed up as the Joker, and Billy Porter joins her as it shifts into a duet of \"I'm Still Standing.\" Wearing a \"Midsommar\"-inspired flower ensemble, she gives a shoutout to women directors and says she \"stands here as a proud queer black woman telling stories.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/07/14/sag-strike-what-to-know-tv-soaps-game-shows-emmys/70413456007/", "title": "Game shows, soaps and British actors: What TV will look like during ...", "text": "The strike by 160,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) has left Hollywood at a virtual standstill: Production on most scripted TV series and movies that weren't already shuttered by a 10-week-old writers strike was halted Thursday night, and actors hit the picket lines Friday.\n\nThat followed an impasse with the Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers, a group that represents 12 media conglomerates in negotiations over labor contracts, which expired June 30.\n\nThis marks the first time since 1960 that both unions are on strike simultaneously, and SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher (\"The Nanny\") told USA TODAY that members are in it for the long haul. \"It's major. But we also see that we have no future and no livelihood unless we take this action.\"\n\nPlenty of shows are still in the pipeline, and movies are produced even further in advance. Streaming platforms like Netflix operate with longer lead times and won't feel the pain until late this year or early 2024. We answer your burning questions about how the Hollywood strikes affect your favorite TV shows.\n\nWill I survive without 'Survivor'?\n\nYou won't have to. Reality shows, from CBS' stalwart to NBC's \"The Voice,\" are unaffected by the strike. That's why the broadcast networks have already blanketed their fall schedules with them in response to the writers strike. Besides, several – including \"Survivor\" and \"The Amazing Race\" ‒ have already completed production on their upcoming seasons. NBC will continue to air \"America's Got Talent,\" and ABC is ready to unveil its new \"Golden Bachelor,\" featuring a 71-year-old contestant, in September. But other shows that rely on celebrities, such as Fox's \"The Masked Singer,\" might be hamstrung if SAG members among them feel pressure to stay away.\n\nAre TV news anchors on strike?\n\nNo. While many are SAG-AFTRA members, their work is covered by the union's News & Broadcast division and are not part of the labor action that affects TV and theatrical workers. The same goes for the \"Today\" show, \"The View\" and other news-adjacent programs.\n\nWhat happens to late-night talk shows and 'SNL'?\n\nNothing; they're already dark. The major shows, from NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" to CBS' \"Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and HBO's \"Last Week Tonight With John Oliver,\" were shut down May 2 by the writers strike. Both labor actions would need to be settled for them to resume production, especially since the actors most talk shows rely on to promote their new projects are expressly prohibited from doing so. During the last writers strike, in 2007-08, the late-night hosts eventually returned with unscripted monologues, but there's no sign that will happen soon.\n\nAre daytime soap actors on strike?\n\nNo. While they are SAG-AFTRA members, stars of the four remaining daytime soaps (\"General Hospital,\" \"The Young and the Restless,\" \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" and \"Days of Our Lives\") fall under a different contract, the same one that covers shows like \"Good Morning America\" and \"The View.\" Deadline reports that nonunion writers continue to churn out scripts, so the year-round serials are expected to remain in production.\n\nWill my favorite game shows still go on?\n\nIt depends. Some, like \"Jeopardy!,\" employ WGA members, so new seasons this fall will either be delayed until the writers strike is settled or use nonunion writers, even if Ken Jennings can work. But shows hosted by or featuring actors, like ABC's \"Celebrity Wheel of Fortune\" and Elizabeth Banks' \"Press Your Luck,\" may have a tougher time, network executives say. Even if SAG members are technically allowed to work on these shows, they may not want to risk the ire of the union, or they might simply choose to walk out in sympathy with their striking brethren. That situation remains fluid. Another caveat: Such shows are often taped well ahead of time, so networks have banked episodes or full seasons of some.\n\nEmmy nominations just came out. Will the awards still happen?\n\nNot soon. While the TV Academy stuck to its planned Sept. 18 Fox telecast in announcing nominations Wednesday, nobody expects that date will stick. Although the Tony Awards won a waiver from the WGA to continue in June, the walkout by both TV writers and actors will delay the ceremony, at least until November and perhaps into January, when it would compete with the Golden Globes and other awards shows for attention. Under strike rules issued Thursday by SAG-AFTRA, actors are prohibited from campaigning for Emmys at events, in interviews or even on social media. Final voting was expected to happen in mid-August.\n\nAre British actors in SAG?\n\nUnited Kingdom performers belong to a different union, Equity, and other international actors also are members of other guilds. Equity, in a statement on its website, said it \"stands full square behind our sister union,\" but British actors will continue to work. That means American shows that employ them, including HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" spinoff \"House of the Dragon,\" will remain in production. Expect networks and streamers to ramp up production (and promotion) of international shows as the pipeline for American-made fare dries up.\n\nWhat about actors in Broadway shows?\n\nUnion members' appearances in Broadway shows aren't affected by the strike, so theater performances can go on uninterrupted. That means Ben Platt (\"Parade\") and Sean Hayes (\"Goodnight, Oscar\"), among others, can play on.\n\nMore strike news:What the Hollywood actors' strike means for anyone who loves movies and TV shows", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/opinions/liz-cheney-seat-loss-wierson-honan/index.html", "title": "Opinion: In Cheney's loss, Biden has an opportunity | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Arick Wierson is an Emmy Award-winning television producer and former senior media adviser to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

View more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nWith Tuesday’s defeat of Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming, some might argue that former President Donald Trump’s hostile takeover of the GOP is now nearly complete. And they might be right. But Liz Cheney made it clear in her barn burner of a concession speech that she is not planning to ride off quietly into the sunset; rather, she plans to “do whatever it takes to ensure that Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office, and I mean it.”\n\nArick Wierson Tunheim\n\nNo longer chained to a party whose leaders have abandoned its core values and principles, Cheney is now poised to become the Obi-Wan Kenobi of American politics. Like Kenobi’s famous line in “Star Wars,” “If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine,” uttered moments before he’s killed by Darth Vader, the same can now also be said about Cheney.\n\nBradley Honan c/o Bradley Honan\n\nBut with her rejection from Republican voters in Wyoming comes an unparalleled opportunity for President Joe Biden and the Democrats, and one they should not squander.\n\nAs a conservative with a dynastic last name who, in this hyper-partisan climate, wields uncommon and genuine respect on both sides of the aisle, Cheney would be a valuable addition to the Biden administration. The President should appoint her as a cabinet-level czar on election integrity and the preservation of democracy once her term is up in January. Creating this post would allow her to continue the work she so adroitly began as the co-chair of the January 6th Committee and empower her to fight against the violent and pseudo-autocratic undercurrents that have seeped into conservative politics and pose a real existential threat to our democracy.\n\nWe don’t agree with much, if any, of Cheney’s politics, but at this point, when our democracy is hanging on by a bare thread, principles trump policy, and we commend Cheney for sticking to her guns amid a hail of incoming fire.\n\nSadly, Cheney was one of the last Republicans standing among those who voted to impeach Trump. Regardless what anyone thinks of her political stances, Cheney has displayed courageous leadership in the face of staunch opposition and even threats to her physical safety. She has proven her mettle as an unapologetic defender of democracy and the rule of law.\n\nIn her concession speech on Tuesday, Cheney made no formal commitments about what the future may hold for her beyond her work as co-chair of the January 6th Committee, but her speech left the door wide open for any number of moves down the road.\n\nShe invoked the name of President Abraham Lincoln, a Republican who lost a US Senate bid only a few years before winning the presidency – a move that surely added to already rampant speculation that she too might seek the nation’s highest office.\n\nBut should Trump declare himself a presidential candidate for 2024, a Cheney run in a Republican primary would likely be nothing more than a constant irritant. She would likely use the megaphone that comes with a national profile to blanket the media with strong anti-Trump messaging and truth telling in the hopes of chipping away at the former President’s support among those who might be on the fence about backing him a third time.\n\nBut primarying Trump is not Cheney’s best play. Nor is running as an independent, a move that might actually serve Trump’s interests by splitting the conservative anti-Trump vote. And certainly, what the country does not need is another ex-pol turned TV pundit.\n\nCheney’s smartest move would be to join the Biden administration in a bespoke senior-level role where her mandate is clear: coordinate the fight for free and fair elections and wage all-out war against the anti-American and undemocratic forces that Trumpism has unleashed. Cheney is the ideal crusader in this fight.\n\nStay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion and follow us @CNNOpinion on Twitter. We welcome your ideas and comments.\n\nSuch a move by Biden certainly has ample precedent. Both Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama appointed notable Republicans to serve in their Cabinets. The symbolism of bringing members from an opposing party into an administration is a strong signal of bipartisanship, putting the country ahead of party. Placing a high-profile conservative like Cheney in a senior-level position would be a powerful signal to our nation’s shared, bipartisan commitment to the rule of law and the right to free and fair elections.\n\nThis is a perilous time for our democracy, and Biden should recognize that Cheney can be a national force for good by taking the helm of our nation’s fight to push back the dark, homegrown forces and ideologies that threaten our future. It’s clear that, despite her Tuesday night primary defeat, her star continues to shine brightly.\n\nBiden would be well-served to act decisively and harness her star power.", "authors": ["Arick Wierson Bradley Honan", "Arick Wierson", "Bradley Honan"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/12/13/world-leaders-celebrities-athletes-death/94676192/", "title": "Deaths of these famous faces stunned world in 2016", "text": "Compiled by Jessica Durando, USA TODAY\n\nTheir lives were filled with unparalleled accomplishments, fame and some tough times to overcome.\n\nTake a look back in memoriam of 16 world leaders, celebrities, athletes and other notables who died in 2016:\n\nMuhammad Ali (Jan. 17, 1942 - June 3, 2016)\n\nMuhammad Ali was widely hailed as the greatest heavyweight boxer in the sport’s history. Born Cassius Clay, Ali changed to a Muslim name and refused, on religious grounds, to be drafted into the military during the Vietnam War. His opposition to the war cost him the belt and led to a three-year ban from boxing. His conviction for dodging the draft was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1971.\n\nAli's prowess in the ring and his personality and social activism make him one of the most recognizable sports figures of the last century. He secured an Olympic gold medal in the 1960 Summer Games and became one of the youngest heavyweight champions of all time, stunning the boxing world with a knockout of Sonny Liston to claim the title in 1964 at age 22.\n\n30 of Muhammad Ali's best quotes\n\nIt marked the first of three times Ali would win the heavyweight title. He became the only heavyweight to win the crown on three occasions. Ali retired from boxing in 1981 with a 56-5 record, three of the losses coming in his final four fights. He had 37 knockouts. After his retirement, he concentrated on philanthropy and social activism. He died of medical complications related to Parkinson's disease at age 74.\n\nDavid Bowie (Jan. 8, 1947 - Jan. 10, 2016)\n\nBowie was a transformative figure and an ever-evolving one, a shape-shifter who remained constant in his dedication to exploring, and defining, new forms of expression.\n\nOn tour and through his music, the legendary singer slipped in and out of various personas and alter egos: most famously, the androgynous Ziggy Stardust, eccentric Aladdin Sane and drug-fueled The Thin White Duke, created during his mid-'70s Young Americans era. After hitting critical and commercial highs in the 1980s with albums such as Tonight and Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), Bowie continued to reinvent himself artistically to varying degrees of success.\n\nFrom Bowie to Prince, America lost some great musicians in 2016\n\nUnlike many of the myriad performers he influenced — among them female superstars such as Madonna and Lady Gaga — Bowie remained an elusive figure, as private in personal matters as he was charismatic as an entertainer. By turns androgynous and dapper, rugged and ethereal, he kept admirers guessing in a way that would be unimaginable for an icon coming up in the age of social media. He died of cancer just days after his 69th birthday.\n\nFidel Castro (Aug. 13, 1926 - Nov. 25, 2016)\n\nDuring his nearly half-century in power, Fidel Castro helped bring the world to the brink of nuclear war, tormented 11 American presidents and exerted almost total control over the last remaining communist government in the Western Hemisphere. Few other world leaders in history could boast the longevity or influence of the iconic bearded, cigar-chewing Cuban dictator.\n\nFor 47 years, Castro maintained his grip over the island nation by forging close bonds with the Soviet Union, Venezuela and China, inspiring a wave of anti-American leaders throughout Latin America along the way. Despite years of economic difficulties following the fall of the Soviet Union, Castro still held extraordinary sway over many of his people. “Fidelismo,” or a kind of personality cult around Castro, managed to survive. Raúl Castro succeeded his older brother as Cuban president in 2008. After years of failing health, Fidel Castro died at age 90.\n\nPatty Duke (Dec. 14, 1946 - March 29, 2016)\n\nPatty Duke, who died at age 69, will be remembered as the teen who won an Oscar for The Miracle Worker and later played \"identical cousins\" in her own TV sitcom.\n\nDuke won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as the blind-and-deaf American icon Helen Keller, first on stage and later in the 1962 film, both of which told the story of how Keller learned to communicate as a child through her tutor Anne Sullivan (Anne Bancroft).\n\nBut Duke really charmed her way into American pop culture in 1963, when she was given her own series.\n\nThe Patty Duke Show, which ran from 1963 to 1966, was hard work: She played both characters, Patricia \"Patty\" Lane, a \"typical\" rock 'n roll American teenager who occasionally got into minor trouble at school and home, and Catherine \"Cathy\" Lane, her more well-behaved cousin from Scotland who adores \"a minuet, the Ballet Russes and Crepe Suzette.\"\n\nAcclaimed for her acting (her career dates back to the late 1950s), Duke became known in later life as an advocate for mental health issues, after she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1982 and wrote about it in her 1987 autobiography.\n\nBesides appearing on stage and screen, Duke even had success as a singer, with two Top 40 hits in 1965, Don't Just Stand There and Say Something Funny. She also wrote two books, Call Me Anna, and Brilliant Madness: Living with Manic Depressive Illness. And she served as president of the actors union, the Screen Actors Guild, from 1983 to 1988.\n\nCarrie Fisher (Oct. 21, 1956 - Dec. 27, 2016)\n\nCarrie Fisher, the princess of Hollywood who became a young star playing a princess in Star Wars, died after a heart attack suffered on a flight from London to Los Angeles. Fisher was 60.\n\nThe actress and author had been on tour to promote her latest memoir, The Princess Diarist, based on the diaries she kept as a 19-year-old shooting what is arguably the biggest movie of all time, 1977's Star Wars, playing Rebel Alliance leader Princess Leia Organa, she of the famous double-bun hairstyle.\n\nHer books, whether novels or memoirs, were funny, sharp and revealing. Among other things, her latest revealed her brief affair with co-star Harrison Ford, who was 14 years older and married with kids when they made Star Wars. She was also an outspoken advocate for mental illness, having told the world that she was bipolar.\n\nThroughout her up-and-down movie career, she remained a product of Hollywood who could step back and explain its history and rituals to the outsiders, always ready with a caustic comment or pointed joke.\n\nZsa Zsa Gabor (Feb. 6, 1917 - Dec. 18, 2016)\n\nZsa Zsa Gabor, 99, the former beauty queen and actress, was ahead of her time. In the Hollywood Golden Age, Gabor, or simply Zsa Zsa to most, was perhaps the first celebutante.\n\nAlthough after her television career Gabor had become a punchline or a caricature, known for her run-in with a Beverly Hills cop or for her many marriages, it wasn’t always that way. Gabor was of a time when “socialite” was not yet a term of derision.\n\nDespite a spotty film career, she became a staple on TV. She often appeared as herself and spoofed her active social life with a quip and a “dahlink” that became her signature term of endearment.\n\nShe was glamorous, quick-witted and not afraid to make fun of herself or her nine marriages (including to Conrad Hilton, Paris Hilton’s great-grandfather), seven divorces and one annulment.\n\nJohn Glenn (July 18, 1921 - Dec. 8, 2016)\n\nJohn Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, and later a four-term U.S. senator from Ohio, died at age 95.\n\nTo understand why John Glenn became so important in America, it is important to remember how badly the United States was losing the space race in the early 1960s. The Soviet Union had pulled ahead in this Cold War battle when it launched Sputnik, the first man-made object to be placed into orbit. It then made a mockery of the American program by sending the first human being, Yuri Gagarin, into orbit. Then the Soviets sent a second cosmonaut into orbit.\n\nSo all of America was watching at 9:47 in the morning on Feb. 20, 1962. Sitting in the cramped quarters of the Friendship 7 spacecraft, Glenn took off from Cape Canaveral. Scott Carpenter, the backup astronaut for the mission, famously said: “Godspeed, John Glenn.”\n\nAstronaut Glenn climbed into space, circled the globe three times, and then dropped down into the Atlantic Ocean. The flight took all of 4 hours, 55 minutes and 23 seconds, but it changed the space race and restored American pride.\n\nFlorence Henderson (Feb. 14, 1934 - Nov. 24, 2016)\n\nAlthough her best-known role as the cheerful matriarch of The Brady Bunch ran for only five seasons, it lived on in syndication for decades, cementing Florence Henderson's status as one of TV's most beloved moms.\n\nThere were spinoffs and reunion specials like 1977's The Brady Bunch Hour, 1981's The Brady Brides and The Bradys in 1990, a Fuller House-style outing that featured the marriages and families of the six grown Brady children. She also joined the cast of the 1995 spoof The Brady Bunch Movie, playing Grandma Brady opposite Cheers star Shelley Long as Carol.\n\nAs her TV career blossomed with The Brady Bunch, Henderson also began to make frequent TV guest appearances. She was the first woman to host The Tonight Show for the vacationing Johnny Carson.\n\nAfter The Brady Bunch ended its first run, Henderson alternated her appearances in revivals of the show with guest appearances on other programs, including Hart to Hart, Fantasy Island and The Love Boat.\n\nIn later years she made guest appearances on such shows as Roseanne, Ally McBeal and The King of Queens. Henderson died at age 82.\n\nGwen Ifill (Sept. 29, 1955 - Nov. 14, 2016)\n\nKnown as a trailblazer in many ways, Gwen Ifill was one of the nation's most prominent journalists. She worked as moderator and managing editor of Washington Week, a weekly political discussion television show. Ifill was also managing editor of PBS NewsHour, an hour-long evening newscast she co-anchored with Judy Woodruff. In 2009, she also wrote a book about President Obama, The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama.\n\nIfill covered seven presidential campaigns in her career and was the first African-American female journalist to moderate a vice-presidential debate. In 2004, she moderated the debate between Dick Cheney and John Edwards, and the 2008 debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin. She died at age 61 after several months of cancer treatment.\n\nHarper Lee (April 28, 1926 - Feb. 19, 2016)\n\nNelle Harper Lee grew up to write one of the 20th century's most culture-changing novels: To Kill a Mockingbird. It won the Pulitzer Prize, has sold more than 30 million copies in English, remains in print (selling more than a million copies a year) and in every school in America, and, until last year, was her only book.\n\nAfter Mockingbird was published, after the Oscar-winning movie starring Gregory Peck came out in 1962, Lee stopped talking to the press, went home to Monroeville, Ala., and closed her door. She kept it closed for decades, emerging only occasionally to write something for Oprah Winfrey's magazine, or to receive the 2007 Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George W. Bush in the White House.\n\nAfter years of being left alone, Lee was catapulted back into the public eye in 2015 with the release of Go Set a Watchman, a “newly discovered” novel she wrote in the 1950s and only the second book from her. The controversy over the novel, and worldwide publicity over the re-emergence of the elderly writer, made Watchman an instant best seller. Lee died at age 89.\n\nGeorge Michael ( July 25, 1963 - Dec. 25, 2016)\n\nGeorge Michael, the British singer, musician and founding member of Wham!, died over the Christmas holiday. He was 53.\n\nMichael sold more than 100 million albums globally, earned numerous Grammy Awards, and recorded duets with Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Luciano Pavarotti and John, among others.\n\nFew teen idols have made critics eat their words more handily than Michael did back in his late-’80s heyday, when the former Wham! frontman emerged as one of the most successful and admired singer/songwriters of that decade. But in the years that followed, Michael made news more frequently for his professional struggles and personal scandal, even as he continued to record and tour profitably and inspire younger acts.\n\nArnold Palmer (Sept. 10, 1929 - Sept. 25, 2016)\n\nArnold Palmer became one of the best known sports figures. He was a telegenic golfer who burst out of black-and-white television sets in the late 1950s and into the 1960s and took the game to the masses.\n\nPalmer, who died at age 87, was the accessible common man who became one of the sport's best players, as well as a successful businessman, philanthropist, trailblazing advertising spokesman, talented golf course designer and experienced aviator.\n\nPalmer won the Vardon Trophy for lowest scoring average on the PGA Tour four times, played on six Ryder Cup teams and was captain twice.\n\nHe received virtually every national award in golf and was the \"Athlete of the Decade\" for the 1960s in a national Associated Press poll. Palmer, who helped found the Golf Channel decades later, also helped usher in the Champions Tour, where he won 10 times, including five majors.\n\nPrince (June 7, 1958 - April 21, 2016)\n\nLike all great artists, Prince was himself a synthesizer of influences; his ranged from Sly Stone to Joni Mitchell to Todd Rundgren.\n\nThe music he produced as a result — as a singer, songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist — defied genre, blending a mastery of pop hooks and funk grooves on singles that could be as lush as the gospel-tinged Purple Rain, as muscular and rocking as Let's Go Crazy and as ferociously propulsive as When Doves Cry — and that was just on one album, 1984's commercial behemoth Purple Rain.\n\nPrince, a 2004 Rock Hall of Fame inductee, won seven Grammy Awards. He also won a best-original-song Oscar for his 1984 film Purple Rain.\n\nMore recently, the social consciousness that had figured into his music became prominent. His 2015 song Baltimore responded to the death of Freddie Gray and related, racially charged events with a defiantly positive spirit. The prodigy and provocateur died at age 57 at his Paisley Park compound in the Minneapolis suburb of Chanhassen.\n\nNancy Reagan (July 6, 1921 - March 6, 2016)\n\nFormer first lady Nancy Reagan will be remembered as the indispensable partner and protector of the Ronald Reagan, the nation's 40th president, who became a fierce advocate in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAfter the frugal Carter years of turned-down thermostats and cardigan sweaters, Nancy Reagan moved into the White House determined, as she later wrote, \"to reclaim some of the stature and dignity of the building.\"\n\nThe first lady raised money to renovate the executive mansion, which had grown shabby. She ordered the first complete set of White House china since the Truman administration. She hosted lavish parties and 57 state dinners, inviting old Hollywood pals like Frank Sinatra and close friend Merv Griffin. Top fashion designers like Halston, Adolfo and Galanos provided her size 4 evening gowns, often in her signature \"Reagan Red.\"\n\nFirst take: Nancy Reagan was a huge influence on her husband's presidency\n\nAfter a second term that saw the president survive colon cancer surgery and the first lady undergo a mastectomy for breast cancer, the Reagans retired to their California ranch. When she watched her soulmate taken \"to a distant place where I can no longer reach him,\" Nancy Reagan spoke out in favor of embryonic stem cell research and its promise in treating Alzheimer's. That put her at odds with many, including President George W. Bush, in what had become \"the party of Reagan.\" She died at age 94, nearly a dozen years after her husband passed away.\n\nJanet Reno (July 21, 1938 - Nov. 7, 2016)\n\nJanet Reno, who died at age 78, was the first woman to serve as U.S. attorney general. Her tenure spanned some of the most tumultuous periods in American life.\n\nThe second-longest serving attorney general in history, Reno’s Justice Department was thrust into a nearly unending series of tests, from the government’s deadly raid on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, and the first World Trade Center attack investigation to the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building and the international custody battle for a Cuban boy named Elian Gonzalez.\n\nHer improbable political survival during a grueling eight years in office, while also battling Parkinson’s disease, may be the most striking aspect of her tenure.\n\nReno's quiet, no-nonsense manner ultimately was celebrated with a regular parody on Saturday Night Live, called “Janet Reno’s Dance Party.’’ The skit featured Will Ferrell, dressed in a Reno standard royal blue dress and pearls. She embraced the parody and joined the cast to share in the fun.\n\nReno, who unsuccessfully ran for Florida governor in 2002, never enjoyed dealing with reporters, though when she did it often featured references to her deceased mother, Jane Reno, known as a coarse character who built the family home at the edge of the Florida Everglades.\n\nAsked once how her mother would assess her performance as attorney general, Reno said: \"After scoffing, she would have said she was very, very proud of me.\"\n\nDebbie Reynolds (April 1, 1932 - Dec. 28, 2016)\n\nDebbie Reynolds' celebrated career in Hollywood lasted more than 65 years. The Oscar-nominated actress starred in memorable films including 1952's Singin' in the Rain, 1962's How the West Was Won and 1956's Bundle of Joy.\n\nThe outspoken Reynolds made a specialty playing offbeat mothers onscreen, alongside Albert Brooks in 1996's Mother and on the sitcom Will & Grace (1999 to 2006) as Debra Messing's screen mom.\n\nBut the most famous is her true-life role as Carrie Fisher's mother, the subject of Fisher's semi-autobiographical novel and 1990 film Postcards From the Edge. Reynolds, who was 84, died a day after her daughter Carrie passed away.\n\n\"She's now with Carrie and we're all heartbroken,\" Reynolds' son, Todd Fisher, said from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.\n\nAntonin Scalia (March 11, 1936 - Feb. 13, 2016)\n\nSupreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was the loquacious leader of the Supreme Court's conservative bloc and a leading force in American life for three decades.\n\nScalia's sharp intellect and acerbic opinions made him a hero to conservatives and a target for liberals. Yet he also was a close friend to a leader of the court's liberal wing, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nThe first Italian-American to serve on the court when he was named by President Reagan in 1986, “Nino” Scalia established himself as a firm opponent of abortion, gay rights and racial preferences.\n\nDuring his three decades on the court, Scalia managed to steer the federal judiciary toward his twin theories of “originalism” and “textualism” — strictly reading the Constitution and federal statutes to mean what their authors intended, and nothing more. He died at age 79.\n\nPat Summitt (June 14, 1952 - June 28, 2016)\n\nLegendary coach Pat Summitt won more games than anyone in college basketball history.\n\nThe Tennessee native drew upon her early experiences of learning to expect the most out of herself as a guidepost to her coaching career.\n\nThe coach who never had a losing record in 38 seasons, shocked the sports world in May 2011 when she announced she would continue at the University of Tennessee despite the diagnosis of early onset dementia, Alzheimer's type.\n\nPresident Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012, recognized, with the Congressional Gold Medal, as the nation’s highest civilian awards. She died at age 64.\n\nAlan Thicke (March 1, 1947 - Dec. 13, 2016)\n\nAlan Thicke achieved widespread fame as Dr. Jason Seaver on the 1980s ABC sitcom Growing Pains, playing the psychiatrist dad opposite Joanna Kerns.\n\nAside from his popular '80s patriarch, Thicke also had a career as a game show host and songwriter, composing memorable theme songs for classic shows including Diff’rent Strokes, The Facts of Life and Wheel of Fortune.\n\nHe was nominated for three Emmy Awards for TV-show writing in the 1970s and nominated for a Golden Globe award for Growing Pains in 1988. The Ontario-born actor, 69, died after suffering a heart attack.\n\nElie Wiesel (Sept. 30, 1928 - July 2, 2016)\n\nElie Wiesel made Holocaust education his mission in life after surviving the Auschwitz and Buchenwald death camps.\n\nThe Wiesel family was deported in 1944 to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where Elie, 15, was separated from his mother and sisters.\n\nHe managed to stay with his father for most of World War II as they worked at an Auschwitz sub-camp and were transferred to the Buchenwald camp in Germany in early 1945. But his father died just weeks short of that camp's liberation. His mother and younger sister also did not survive.\n\nSome 11 years after leaving Buchenwald, he wrote Un di Velt Hot Geshvign (And the World Remained Silent), a Yiddish memoir that would become known as Night and be translated into 30 languages. He opted not to let Hollywood touch his book.\n\nIn 1978, Jimmy Carter selected Wiesel to lead the President's Commission on the Holocaust, followed two years later by his appointment as chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council. His work earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986. Wiesel died at age 87.\n\nGene Wilder (June 11, 1933 - Aug. 29, 2016)\n\nGene Wilder brought his deft comedic touch to such unforgettable roles as the charismatic candy man in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and the obsessed scientist of Young Frankenstein.\n\nWilder left an indelible impression through his performances from Wonka to the boozy gunslinger in Blazing Saddles and, in later years, screwball roles in comedies including Silver Streak and Stir Crazy.\n\nEmotional Mel Brooks remembers Gene Wilder in 'Young Frankenstein'\n\nBorn Jerome Silberman on Milwaukee's west side on June 11, 1933, Wilder started entertaining when he was 7 by performing to make his ailing mother laugh. Then he got interested in theater.\n\nThe role of nervous accountant Leo Bloom in Brooks' 1968 comedy The Producers — put Wilder in the front ranks of comic actors, and forever linked him with Mel Brooks. It also earned him an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. In the 2000s, Wilder largely stopped acting, apart from some personal appearances, telling interviewers he'd lost the taste for the modern entertainment industry. He died at age 83.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2023/05/29/biden-cheney-zelenskyy-commencement-addresses-2023/70252833007/", "title": "Joe Biden, Liz Cheney, Volodymyr Zelenskyy: Commencement ...", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nGraduations ceremonies are happening all over the country so we're offering a roundup of some of the more interesting ones that feature celebrities or newsmakers as guest speakers.\n\nWhat did Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tell graduates?

Graduates, you made a noble choice to lead a life of service. Now you also shoulder a great privilege and a mighty responsibility. In the years ahead, your airmen and guardians are going to look to you for guidance and inspiration because the world is going to get more confusing. They’ll put their trust in you. You, in turn, must strive to always be worthy of their confidence. Listen to them. No matter what changes and challenges come, your character, your moral clarity, your capabilities must never waver. The nation needs you. Never forget the sacred oath you swear, and the mission you serve is something far, far greater than any person or president. It’s our Constitution, it’s our country and it’s our enduring American values.”\n\n\"After the 2020 election and the attack of January 6th, my fellow Republicans wanted me to lie. They wanted me to say that the 2020 election was stolen, that the attack of January 6th wasn’t a big deal, and that Donald Trump wasn’t dangerous. I had to choose between lying and losing my position in House leadership. America cannot remain a free nation if we abandon the truth. So as you go out to change the world, resolve that you will stand in truth. Those who are trying to unravel the foundations of our republic, who are threatening the rule of law and the sanctity of our elections, know they can't succeed if you vote. So Class of 2023, get out and vote. This means listening and learning, including – especially – from those with whom we disagree. This means running for office.

While it is still possible to find new deposits of oil or lithium, and if in the future humanity can start mining resources in space, it is still purely science fiction to live longer than has been given. The time of life of all Ukrainians who are forced to live through this terrible Russian aggression, unfortunately, is subject to many factors that are not all in their control. You have to know exactly why you need today and how you want your tomorrows to look like. All of our tomorrows and the tomorrows of our children and grandchildren depend on each of our todays.\"\n\n\"You have perhaps seen me on '9-1-1' during a study break, or in the theater in films like 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' or 'Mission Impossible: Fallout.' But to only see my life in that way would be the equivalent of opening a book to the 10th of 13 chapters and feel like you know the full story. My career did not begin on the location of a glamorous film set or on a reality-defying soundstage. I started acting at the St. Petersburg Little Theater in a production of 'The Great Sebastians' while I was still in high school. The fire that acting ignited in me was so fierce that it fueled me each day as I juggled a busy schedule filled with classes and homework assignments. But that’s what we do when we have goals. We work towards them, despite the challenges, difficulties and sacrifices we might have to make. So now, if someone ever says to you that you are doing too much, you tell them, 'I’m just getting started.' \"\n\n“This moment conjures up the exiting image of a high diver poised to leap into the void. As you know, I am not a lawyer. I can’t even say that I have played one on the screen. So why am I here? Why have I been asked to deliver the keynote speech to you on this pivotal day in your lives as you dive headfirst into a presumably bright, but unpredictable, future? Well, maybe the reason I’m here is because I happen to have some experience leaping off high perches into scary voids. So do allow me to offer some simple pointers that I’ve picked up along the way in my career full of leaps and dives. Stay loose. When falling, the tendency is to tighten up, to brace for impact. But in truth, the safest thing one can do is remain calm, even curious, about the shifting world around you. Learning how to fall teaches you how to land. And learning to land gives you the courage to jump higher.”\n\n\"It’s been truly amazing to see how your generation has rebelled against every bad habit of mine and every generation that came before me. You’ve rejected that whole 24/7, no days off grind. You’ve rejected apathy. You’ve rejected ignoring your mental health. You’ve rejected alienation and cruelty. You rejected not trying to include everyone, and you’ve rejected not looking out for each other – and those are hard things to reject. Because accepting them sometimes makes life way easier. If you just shut off your soul from the world, life is way easier. It’s also way less colorful. It’s way less complicated, way less nourishing and way less memorable. I’ve seen things you people wouldn’t believe. I’ve seen port-a-potties on fire from a helicopter above Woodstock ’99. I’ve seen Charlize Theron glitter in the dark from the backstage wings of the Oscars. All of these moments, and far better ones, are waiting to be experienced and marveled at by every one of you. It’s time to live.\"\n\n\"For me, this school is more than a degree. Adelphi University is my Ellis Island. Imagine it is the fall of 1994. There is a 21-year-old boy on the train to Garden City (New York). And he is terrified. He just arrived in America. He doesn’t know a soul. And he doesn’t speak English. This morning, I took the same train out to Garden City that I took 29 years ago. Looking at all of the other passengers, I couldn’t help but wonder how many of them ate Chobani yogurt this morning? But who would have thought that the yogurt recipe I carried in my bag 29 years ago would one day be welcomed in homes across America? I wonder today what I would say to the 21-year-old boy now. I’d say you were right to leave Turkey when you did. What an amazing country we are living in. There is magic in the soil here. There are things you can do in America that you can’t do anywhere else on earth. We can never forget how fortunate we are to be here. With it comes a responsibility to keep this country’s light alive for future generations, and to make this world a better place.\"\n\n\"I worked to achieve peace with the oldest and most powerful guerrilla group in the Western Hemisphere – the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC. It was not an easy task. In fact, making peace is much more difficult than making war. I know this because I have made both. We face immense challenges ahead, as humanity always has. There are countless conflicts across the planet. Not only the war on Ukraine, but also the wars in Asia and Africa. And now, we have a new existential threat straight out of science fiction. Many experts are warning us about artificial intelligence and its real dangers to humankind. Many scientists have even asked for a moratorium in its development, cautioning us that we must first learn to master AI before it masters us. This threat is so real that one of the godfathers of AI resigned from Google. Of course, AI, like all technological breakthroughs, can be harmful or can be beneficial. It depends entirely on us and on our wisdom in using it. Humanity has overcome existential crises in its hundreds of thousands of years on earth, and I am certain, certain that we will be able to overcome the current ones.\"\n\n\"You stand on the broad shoulders of generations of Americans who have worn the uniform, including many barrier breakers and trailblazer. In fact, this year, you celebrate the 75th anniversary of the integration of women in the military, as well as the desegregation of our military. Looking forward to the future, it is clear you graduate into an increasingly unsettled world where longstanding principles are at risk. Soon, as officers in the United States Army, you will join the ranks of those brave warriors and make your own mark on the world. The power of America's military not only rests on our technology, our weaponry, our hardware. It rests on the character and the resolve of our people.

I’m in the wine business, too! In my experience, whether manufacturing fine wines, negotiating contracts or playing hoops, the only consistent rhythm is start-and-stop, speed up then slow down. Timing is everything! As president of the NBA Players Association, I’ve spent the last two years bargaining for the new CBA (Collective Bargaining Agreement) agreement. In negotiations, both sides need to know when to back off or move the deal forward – to land on a mutually beneficial agreement. It’s a matter of determining the right balance. In an intense and fast-paced sport like basketball, effectively controlling the game’s tempo typically earns critical advantage over the competition. While the world whirls at breakneck speed, patience, flexibility and strategic timing increases the likelihood of success. You’ll find in the next exciting chapter of your life what gets measured matters. But don’t limit how you measure success to titles, salaries or advanced degrees. Factor in your personal growth and happiness as you overcome the inevitable challenges ahead. Calculate the impact you make on others – and positive changes you personally bring to the world.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/29"}]}

The CNN Original Series airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET.\n\nCNN —\n\nOver the past 70 years, media mogul Rupert Murdoch built a small Australian family newspaper company into arguably the most powerful conservative media empire in history. With a market cap of $13.50 billion, News Corp is one of the most influential companies on the planet.\n\nThe story behind the ruthless business tactics, political maneuvering and dynastic family battles that have gone into the making of this media powerhouse would be perfect fodder for one of the News Corp news outlets or TV channels, if it were not about Rupert himself. Now, as the seemingly invincible figure advances into his nineties, speculation through the worlds of business, politics and entertainment about who will succeed him as the leader of News Corp has reached a fever pitch.\n\nHere’s a look at who’s who in the potential line of succession and the wider Murdoch clan.\n\nPatriarch\n\nRupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp and co-chairman of 21st Century Fox, at the Sun Valley Resort in 2018. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nRupert Murdoch\n\nAustralian-born Rupert Murdoch, 91, is the media magnate who grew the small newspaper company he inherited from his father in 1952 into News Corporation, Ltd., the multi-billion dollar global media empire with a presence in cable, film, television, internet, satellite, sports, publishing and other fields. At different points the conglomerate has included the newspapers News of the World, the Sun, the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal; Twentieth Century Fox film studio; the Fox Broadcasting network; Fox News Channel; HarperCollins publishing, and the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nMurdoch has been married four times and fathered six children over the course of his seven-decades long career. Several of Murdoch’s children have followed him into the family business. Murdoch’s penchant for pitting the siblings against each other in a years’ long competition to see who will succeed him as head of News Corp is widely believed to be the inspiration for the popular HBO series, “Succession.”\n\nMurdoch’s ruthlessness extends far beyond his family circle. Early in his career he developed the tactic of confronting competition by buying them or running them out of business. Dealings at his British tabloid papers came under scrutiny in 2011 when it was discovered reporters were hacking the phones of royals, celebrities, and crime victims to get their stories. The Murdoch family brand made headlines again when Fox News Channel CEO Roger Ailes was forced to resign amid sexual harassment allegations in 2016.\n\nMurdoch still holds the top post at News Corp, the second incarnation of the now defunct News Corporation which broke up into two companies in 2013. It is unclear who will lead the company when he passes.\n\nPotential Heirs\n\nLachlan Murdoch in 2018. Stephanie Keith/Getty Images/FILE\n\nLachlan Murdoch\n\nLachlan Murdoch, 50, is Rupert Murdoch’s oldest son with his second wife, Anna. He began learning the family business at a young age through internships at his father’s media outlets. He rose quickly through the executive ranks and by 1997 had become chairman and chief executive of News Ltd. At the time, his father described Lachlan as his heir apparent, “the first among equals.” His ascension continued smoothly until 2005. That year, Lachlan abruptly quit his executive positions at News Corporation after a battle with Ailes over the direction of the cable news network – effectively taking himself off the heir apparent track. Lachlan then launched his own investment company, Illyria Pty, in Australia. After an extended absence, Lachlan returned to the family business in 2014 and resumed his position as a potential heir to the empire, becoming CEO of Fox Broadcasting and executive chairman at 21st Century Fox. Shortly after, Lachlan’s younger brother James was tapped to be CEO of 21st Century Fox in a power-sharing experiment orchestrated by Rupert between the brothers. The experiment proved unsuccessful, and Rupert sold 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019. Lachlan now holds the roles of executive chair and CEO of Fox Corporation and co-chairman of News Corp, as well as executive chairman of NOVA Entertainment, an Australian media company.\n\nJames Murdoch in 2019. Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\n\nJames Murdoch\n\nJames Murdoch, 49, is Rupert Murdoch’s fourth child and second son with his second wife, Anna. James’ early career choices was at odds with his father’s conservative newspaper empire. He dropped out of Harvard in 1995 to start his own hip-hop record label, Rawkus Records. After several years, he transitioned into executive roles within News Corporation and assumed the role of corporate company man. After Lachlan quit Fox in 2005, James was increasingly seen as the new heir apparent to his father.\n\nIn 2007, James became chairman of BSkyB. In 2011, he was named deputy COO of News Corporation, and chairman and CEO of News International. But as James was climbing to new heights within the empire, the company became engulfed in scandal when investigators and journalists discovered staff at some Murdoch tabloids in Britain had been hacking the phones of public figures and crime victims to get their stories. James was forced to step down as chairman of BSkyB as a result.\n\nAfter several years hiatus, he rejoined the family business, eventually becoming chairman of Sky and CEO of 21st Century Fox, co-leading the company with older brother Lachlan, who served as executive chairman. The joint leadership arrangement didn’t work out, and James left 21st Century Fox in 2019 when the company was sold to Disney, and then left Sky when majority control was acquired by Comcast. Long known as the lone liberal of the Murdoch clan, James’ political differences with his family came to a head and he resigned from the board of News Corp in 2020, writing at the time, “My resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.”\n\nElisabeth Murdoch at the British Fashion Awards 2016 in London. Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nElisabeth Murdoch\n\nElisabeth Murdoch, 53, is Rupert Murdoch’s second child, the first he had with second wife Anna Murdoch. Elisabeth began her training in the family business early with internships and entry level jobs at Murdoch properties. In 1996 she became managing director of Sky Networks at BSkyB. But several years later she was passed over for the role of chief executive at Sky.\n\nRupert considers Elisabeth to be most like him, but he has been more dismissive of her attempts to take the throne, saying at one point she’d have to figure out how many children she wanted to have before planning further advancement at the company. In 2000 she left the family business and went on to found Shine, one of the UK’s biggest independent production companies with shows like “The Biggest Loser,” “Master Chef,” and “History Cold Case.”\n\nWhen News Corporation acquired Shine in 2011, Elisabeth attempted to take a seat on the News Corporation board, but scrutiny over the phone hacking scandal prevented that from happening. She left Shine after a merger with two other production companies. In 2019 she established a new production company, Sister, and in 2021 Sister funded the opening of a London branch of Ghetto Film School, a non-profit program geared toward introducing young people of color to the entertainment industry.\n\nWives\n\nPatricia Booker\n\nRupert Murdoch and his first wife, Patricia Booker, a former department store model and flight attendant, married in 1956. She gave birth to his first child, a daughter named Prudence, two years later. The marriage lasted 11 years; they divorced in 1967.\n\nRupert Murdoch with his second wife Anna Maria Torv and their 14-month old daughter Elisabeth at their home in London in 1969. Chris Ware/Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nAnna Murdoch\n\nRupert met Anna Torv at his newspaper The Daily Mirror, in Sydney, where she was working as a reporter. A few months after his divorce from Patricia, Rupert and Anna married. They had three children together, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James, now the main contenders to be heir of the Murdoch empire. Over the years Anna published several novels, one of which featured a family that bore a striking resemblance to her own. She spent three decades raising their family and acting as Rupert’s loyal partner on the world stage. In the mid-1990’s, as Rupert approached conventional retirement age, Anna hoped his relentless drive to build the empire would subside, and he’d spend more time with her enjoying their golden years. Rupert was completely opposed to that idea.

The bipartisan measure passed the Senate by a vote of 63-36, a day after it cleared the US House of Representatives. President Joe Biden said he will pass the measure into law, meaning he will spare the US from a default on its $31.4tn (£25tn) debt. Suspending the debt limit through to 2025 “takes the threat of default off table until after the presidential election”, said CNN.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

As well as his arrest, the police have conducted searches at the home Murrell shares with Sturgeon and the SNP headquarters in Edinburgh.\n\nThe arrest capped an “extraordinary two months” for Murrell and Sturgeon, said Politico’s London Playbook. Sturgeon, “who once looked all-powerful, is no longer first minister, and we have all spent the day following the extraordinary footage from their Glasgow home, suddenly transformed into a crime investigation scene”, the newsletter added.\n\nWho is Peter Murrell?\n\nBorn in 1964 in Edinburgh, Murrell attended school in the city before studying at the University of Glasgow. He “worked his way through the ranks in politics”, including a stint in the office of Alex Salmond, Sturgeon’s predecessor as first minister as SNP leader, said The Sun.\n\nHe became known as “the ultimate backroom operator” during his time as chief executive of the SNP, said The Times, a role he took over from Michael Russell in 1999. Murrell was a “key part of the nationalists’ election-winning machine” and was viewed as a “respected organiser who professionalised and modernised the party”.\n\nHe’s “partly credited with the success at the 2007 elections”, said The Sun, but he’s always “tried to keep a low profile”, added The Times.\n\nMurrell first met Sturgeon while “she was still a teenager during an SNP youth weekend in Aberdeenshire” in 1988, said The Express, but the pair didn’t become a couple until 15 years later in 2003.\n\nThey married in 2010 in Glasgow while Sturgeon was deputy first minister. When she became first minister in 2014 and her public profile grew, she said that Murrell was not the type of man to “feel threatened” by it and that he is “very self-assured”, said the BBC.\n\nIt clearly suited Murrell to “be in the background”, the BBC added, but he found himself at the centre of controversy after Alex Salmond was cleared of sexual assault charges in 2020. The MP Kenny MacAskill called for an investigation after being tipped off that Murrell had sent messages calling “for the police to be put under pressure over the Salmond case”, said The Times.\n\nHe was also accused by Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser of giving a “false statement” under oath to a Holyrood committee about the Scottish government’s handling of the Salmond case. Murrell “absolutely refuted” the claim he lied.\n\nWhy did Murrell resign from the SNP?\n\nMurrell’s role as chief executive came under intense scrutiny after Sturgeon indicated she would resign and a leadership election was triggered. One of the candidates, Ash Regan, said it was a “clear conflict of interest” to have the outgoing first minister’s husband run the election for a new leader, but did not go as far as to explicitly say he should stand down.\n\nIt was a “row over the party’s membership numbers and transparency” that led him to resign on 18 March, said The Herald. Despite remaining “the largest and most dominant political force in Scotland”, according to the paper, the SNP’s membership slipped from 125,000 in 2018 to 72,186 current members who could vote in the leadership election.\n\nIt was a “point of pride” for Murrell that membership had increased under his tenure as chief executive, said the BBC. His press office also denied a report in the Sunday Mail that membership had dropped by 30,000, calling the report “not just flat wrong… wrong by about 30,000”.\n\nAfter succumbing to pressure to make membership figures public, it was revealed the number had dropped by over 30,000 since they were last publicised as 104,000 in 2021, “vindicating the newspaper”, The Times said.\n\nMurrell said the “responsibility for the SNP’s responses to media queries about our membership number lies with me as chief executive” and offered his immediate resignation, but said there was “no intent to mislead”.", "authors": ["Richard Windsor", "The Week Uk", "Catherine Garcia", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Joel Mathis", "Theara Coleman", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Staff", "Jamie Timson"], "publish_date": "2023/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/royals/962335/what-have-we-learned-in-king-charless-first-year", "title": "What have we learned in King Charles's first year?", "text": "King Charles III has released a brief tribute to Elizabeth II to mark the first anniversary of his mother’s death.\n\nThe King recalled the late Queen’s “devoted service and all she meant to so many of us”, and thanked the nation for the “love and support” shown to him and Queen Camilla during the first 12 months of his reign.\n\nA source told Valentine Low of The Times that Charles has enjoyed his first year as King. “Someone who knows him well said to me, ‘He looks ten years younger and he has got a real sense of purpose about him’,” the source said.

Sign up\n\nWhat did the papers say?\n\nThere are “clues to his aspirations” in the “informal formality” of his royal occasions, wrote Caroline Davies for The Guardian. “He has turbo-charged royal receptions, harnessing their soft-power to the maximum… in the knowledge he can no longer speak out publicly on subjects he remains passionate about”, she added.\n\nCharles has shown himself to be a down-sizer. The “slimmed-down” monarchy he is said to have wanted now looks “positively skeletal”, added Davies, and there has also been a “reduction in staff”, with the king reportedly “setting about reducing the number of middle managers in his employ”.\n\nAnother thing we have learned, said Low, is that Charles does not see himself as a “caretaker” monarch who would leave “real changes” until William is on the throne. That suggestion has gathered pace in the media in recent weeks but reportedly “went down badly at Buckingham Palace”, where sources argued that the idea that Charles is a stop-gap sovereign is “fanciful”.\n\n“Slowly but surely” Charles is “stamping his personality” on the role, with “more outings, more emotion and more hard work for courtiers”, Low added.\n\nBut his reign has been “marked more by continuity than transformation”, said The Associated Press, and “by changes in style rather than substance”. He has “focused on building bridges at home and abroad as he embraces the role of diplomat-in-chief”.\n\nDuring his first Christmas Day broadcast, Charles “gave a nod to the changing face of Britain” by “splicing in video of his travels around the kingdom, including scenes of the king meeting with food kitchen volunteers at a Sikh house of worship in Luton”.\n\nHaving asked readers for their verdict on Charles’ first year, The Telegraph found they were “somewhat split” over how he has fared, as he is “seemingly more of a divisive figure than his late mother”. Readers variously described him as “encouraging and steady” and “confident and at ease”, but one said the “great worry” is his “climate thoughts and woke attitudes”.\n\nCharles “isn’t adored, as his mother was”, said The Washington Post, as “even many people who object to the monarchy as an institution felt a fondness for Elizabeth”. A year after her death, a YouGov poll found she is “still the most popular British royal”, followed by Prince William, Princess Anne, the Princess of Wales and then Charles. But the King has been “unexpectedly popular” during the first year of his reign, countered The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWhat next?\n\n“More challenges are to come,” said AP, as the media demands “more information about royal spending and accountability”. He is also facing calls to make the palace staff “more representative of modern Britain” and to “acknowledge the monarchy’s role in slavery and imperialism”.\n\nCharles will pay a state visit to Kenya in the autumn. David Anderson, professor of African history at the University of Warwick, told The Times that the trip “could be a bit ticklish” as there are concerns that activists could raise the issue of Britain’s treatment of the Mau Mau rebels in the 1950s.\n\nAlso this autumn, he will launch his “first big personal project as monarch” in the form of a national initiative to tackle food waste, said Davies in The Guardian. This could offer more clues as to his approach as “you wonder how political that might be”, Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty Magazine, told her.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Catherine Garcia", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Joel Mathis", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Staff", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "Jamie Timson"], "publish_date": "2023/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/europe/962081/locals-put-up-fake-jellyfish-signs-to-ward-off-tourists-in-mallorca", "title": "Locals put up fake jellyfish signs to ward off tourists in Mallorca | The ...", "text": "Fake signs warning of jellyfish and cliff falls have been put up by locals on the island of Mallorca to deter unwanted tourists.\n\nOther bogus signs “tell holidaymakers bays are closed to the public or that it takes two hours and 53 minutes to walk to a beach which is actually 100 yards away”, reported The Sun.\n\nThe signs, the work of a local protest group called Caterva, have appeared across the island of Mallorca, with footnotes written in Catalan explaining: “Open beach.

Last week, Mechichi also sacked the country’s health minister amid a slow vaccination rollout.\n\nFollowing Saied’s announcement that he was sacking Mechichi – an independent politician with no party affiliation – and freezing parliament, supporters took to the streets in celebration with “cheering and honking car horns” recalling the scenes that started the revolution which “triggered the Arab Spring protests across the Middle East”, the broadcaster adds.\n\nHowever, “opponents in parliament immediately accused him of staging a coup”, the BBC says, and security forces “blocked off parliament and streets around the central Avenue Bourguiba” as protesters stormed the offices of Tunisia’s largest political party, Ennahda, “smashing computers and setting fire to its local headquarters in Touzeur”.\n\n‘Save the state’\n\nIn a televised address, Saied said that he had taken the decision to sack Mechichi in order to ensure “social peace returns to Tunisia” and to “save the state”.\n\nSaied, who later joined celebrations on the streets of the capital Tunis, continued that he would respond to any unrest with force, adding: “I warn any who think of resorting to weapons… and whoever shoots a bullet, the armed forces will respond with bullets.”\n\nThe “extent of support” for the move is “not clear”, Sky News says, with Ennahda’s leader, Rached Ghannouchi, calling for Tunisians to take to the streets to end what he described as “a coup against the revolution and constitution”. In a phone call with Reuters, Ghannouchi said: “We consider the institutions still standing, and the supporters of the Ennahda and the Tunisian people will defend the revolution.”\n\nFormer president Moncef Marzouki also described the move as a coup, adding: “I ask the Tunisian people to pay attention to the fact that they imagine this to be the beginning of the solution. It is the beginning of slipping into an even worse situation.”\n\nSaied’s decision to take executive action has triggered “one of Tunisia’s biggest political crises since the 2011 revolution that introduced democracy”, Al Jazeera says, with ongoing anger over “accusations of police violence and the devastation the Covid pandemic” putting “an already weak economy” under further strain.\n\nWhat next?\n\nGhannouchi was yesterday barred from entering the parliamentary building in Tunis when “the army surrounded parliament”, The Guardian reports.\n\n“Dozens of Ennahda supporters” also “faced off against Saied supporters” near the site, the paper adds, with televised images showing the two groups “exchanging insults as the police held them apart”.\n\nUnder the Tunisian constitution “the president oversees only the military and foreign affairs”, the BBC says. However, Saied has now said that he will “govern alongside a new prime minister, with parliament suspended for 30 days”.\n\n“The president cited Article 80 of the constitution for his actions”, arguing that it allows him to suspend parliament if it was in “imminent danger”, the broadcaster adds. “The 2014 constitution calls for a special court to be set up to decide disputes like this, but it has not been established.”\n\nSaied was elected on a pledge to “overhaul a complex political system plagued by corruption”, The Guardian says. The country’s last election, however, “delivered a fragmented chamber in which no party held more than a quarter of seats”.\n\nA decade on from the revolution that overthrew dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia is still racked by “crumbling public services” and a “fractious political class” that “has been unable to form lasting, effective governments”, the paper adds.\n\nSaied has also repeatedly clashed with Mechichi, amid accusations that the president has “blocked ministerial appointments and diverted resources from efforts to tackle Tunisia's economic crisis”, The Telegraph says.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Catherine Garcia", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "Richard Windsor", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/958203/barack-obama-and-the-cancel-culture-problem", "title": "Barack Obama and the 'cancel culture problem' | The Week", "text": "Barack Obama has spoken out against “cancel culture” in his own party, claiming that “buzzkill” Democrats are getting caught up in “policy gobbledygook”.\n\n“Sometimes people just want to not feel as if they are walking on eggshells,” the former president told the Pod Save America podcast, “and they want some acknowledgement that life is messy and that all of us, at any given moment, can say things the wrong way, make mistakes.”\n\nObama “did not give an example, or name anyone”, said The Times, “but the left of his party has been accused of promoting identity politics”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

In 2019, he objected to the prevalence of “call-out culture” and “wokeness”, reported The New York Times.\n\nSpeaking about youth activism at the Obama Foundation Summit, he said: “This idea of purity and you’re never compromised and you’re always politically ‘woke’ and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly.”\n\nThe former president said that, among some young people, “there is this sense sometimes of: ‘The way of me making change is to be as judgmental as possible about other people,’ and that’s enough.\n\n“That’s not activism. That’s not bringing about change,” he said. “If all you’re doing is casting stones, you’re probably not going to get that far. That’s easy to do.”\n\nSpeaking to CNN in 2021, he warned of “the dangers of cancel culture” going too far in American society, saying there were “people going overboard”, noted The Hill.\n\nCancel culture ‘isn’t real’\n\n“His comments hold a lot of gratifying truths,” wrote Sarah Ditum for The Observer, following Obama’s remarks in 2019.\n\nShe added that cancel culture “can spill into lost jobs, broken friendships and public protests; ultimately, it amounts to an effort to declare the victim a non-person, someone intolerable to decent society” and with “no appeals and no rehabilitation”.\n\nHowever, wrote Sarah Hagi for Time in the same year, “cancel culture isn’t real, at least not in the way people believe it is”. Rather, “it’s turned into a catch-all for when people in power face consequences for their actions or receive any type of criticism, something that they’re not used to”.\n\nIndeed, writing for The Independent, author Michael Arceneaux said he was “never quite sure if Obama really thinks this naively or if he’s trying to convince certain sects of the population – notably young black folks, whom he just loves to lecture – that it’s better to coddle white people about their prejudices with the hopes of growth rather than speak our minds as we see fit”.\n\nAnother to take issue with Obama’s opinion was journalist Ernest Owens. In The New York Times, he wrote that “as a millennial who has participated in using digital platforms to critique powerful people for promoting bigotry or harming others, I can assure you it wasn’t because they had ‘different opinions’.\n\n“It was because they were spreading the kinds of ideas that contribute to the marginalisation of people like me and those I care about.”", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Catherine Garcia", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Joel Mathis", "Justin Klawans", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/960981/wine-wars-are-health-warnings-needed-on-alcohol", "title": "Alcohol health warnings: are they needed? | The Week", "text": "A diplomatic spat has broken out over Ireland’s decision to introduce comprehensive new health warnings on alcoholic beverages.\n\nThe stark warnings will highlight the risks of cancer, liver disease and the risk of drinking while pregnant, as well as providing a product’s calorie content and the number of grams of alcohol. The changes will take effect in three years to allow businesses to prepare their products, and “will see new labelling on each bottle and can displayed on shop shelves and, in pubs, signage behind the bar”, said Politico.\n\nThirteen EU members, including France, Italy and Spain, have raised fierce objections to the European Commission, but the body declined to block the measure. More than 10 countries have lodged complaints with the World Trade Organization, but Ireland has said it would go ahead with the legislation.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Italian wine producers said that moderate consumption of wine and beer should not be compared to spirits and smoking, and that the move has the potential to do serious damage to the country’s economy. Coldiretti, Italy’s biggest farmers’ association, described the decision as “terrifying” and a “direct attack” in The Guardian.\n\n“We consider Ireland’s action incorrect because it is one thing to inform and invite moderation, which we believe is right; it is another thing to say that a product, no matter how much you take, is bad for you,” said Francesco Lollobrigida, the Italian agriculture minister.\n\nThe warnings will only apply to sales of products in Ireland, and not on exports of Irish whiskey, Guinness or other alcoholic beverages, according to the Financial Times. This has led to accusations that Ireland is breaching EU single-market rules.\n\nAlbiera Antinori, president of Marchesi Antinori, one of the country’s biggest winemakers, told the paper the move undermines the very idea of the European Community. “The issue has to be addressed. They need to find a solution. If not, the whole European idea – which begins in free trade – will be at an end,” said Antinori.\n\n‘No safe amount’\n\nBut Ireland is undeterred. The country was the first nation to ban smoking in enclosed public places, including pubs, in 2004, said The Times, and sees itself as a world leader on public health.\n\nDonnelly says the new law will reduce alcohol abuse in the country and alleviate the burden on the healthcare system. He told RTÉ Radio that one in 20 deaths in Ireland was linked to alcohol and even low levels of alcohol consumption were associated with cancer risks.\n\nThe World Health Organization classifies alcohol as a carcinogen and has said that there is \"no safe amount\" of alcohol consumption. “The science is very clear, alcohol causes cancer,” Florence Berteletti, secretary general of the European Alcohol Policy Alliance, told Sky News. “Two people are killed every minute by alcohol in our region [Europe].”", "authors": ["Felicity Capon", "Catherine Garcia", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Joel Mathis", "Richard Windsor", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2023/05/24"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/954041/a-short-history-of-the-uks-honour-scandals", "title": "A history of the UK's honours scandals | The Week", "text": "The doling out of honours in the UK is never short of controversy.

Here are some of the most bitter disputes over honours in recent UK political history:\n\nLloyd George’s ‘cash for patronage’ scandal\n\nDavid Lloyd George enjoyed an illustrious political career, including serving as prime minister from 1916 to 1922.\n\nBut the Liberal PM found himself embroiled in a major “cash for patronage” scandal over his resignation honours list in 1922. Although the purchase of peerages was not illegal, Lloyd George was accused of raising funds for his party through the sale of peerages, as well as using the honours system to (unsuccessfully) avoid criticism from newspapers.\n\nIt was the brazenness of Lloyd George’s “price list for peerages” that caused a scandal. They were arranged through political fixer Maundy Gregory, who sold peerages “ranging from £10,000 (more than £400,000 today) for a knighthood up to £40,000 for a baronetcy”, according to The Guardian.\n\nFrom 1917 to 1922, more than “120 hereditary peers alone were created”, said The Spectator. So many knighthoods were given out in Cardiff – Lloyd George had grown up in Wales and spoke Welsh as his first language – that “it became known as the ‘city of dreadful knights’”, said the magazine.\n\nThe scandal led to the passing of the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act in 1925, and Gregory would eventually become the only person to be convicted under the act, continuing to falsely offer honours to the wealthy and connected into the 1930s.\n\nWilson’s Lavender List\n\nAllegedly handwritten on pastel-hued paper by Harold Wilson’s closest aide Marcia Williams, later Lady Falkender, the so-called “Lavender List” has become an infamous document in modern political history.\n\nThe list named businessmen Wilson had chosen to honour to mark his 1976 resignation, making way for James Callaghan as the next prime minister. The list was controversial as many felt it “sanctioned the ennobling and knighting of crooked and dubious businessmen”, according to The Times – many of whom held views antithetical to the values of the Labour Party.\n\nNames included a knighthood for Joseph Kagan, later convicted of false accounting, and businessman Eric Miller, who committed suicide while his firm was being investigated.\n\nBut further controversy was fuelled by the suggestion that Lady Falkender was either the principal author of the list or had sought to add to the list in order to reward her friends and financially benefit from the list herself. The list was seen as “an indication of the sway she held over Wilson, her alleged lover”, reported the paper.\n\nLady Falkender denied any involvement in compiling the list, maintaining she had “merely copied it from another list, on pink”, said the Financial Times in her 2019 obituary. And in 2007, the BBC was forced to pay her £75,000 in libel damages after a BBC Four docu-drama claimed she had conducted an affair with Wilson and had undue influence over the list.\n\nBlair’s ‘cash-for-honours’ scandal\n\nIn 2006, Tony Blair became the first prime minister to be questioned by police as part of a political corruption inquiry that would drag on for 16 months, and overshadow the last days of his premiership.\n\nAn investigation was launched after SNP MP Angus MacNeil complained that four wealthy businessmen were nominated by Tony Blair for peerages after lending the party a total of £5m.\n\nAll four of the peerages were blocked by the House of Lords appointments commission, and MacNeil’s complaint launched a police investigation into whether laws banning the sale of honours had been broken.\n\nThe police inquiries would lead to 136 people being interviewed, according to the BBC, and Blair himself would be questioned three times, although not under caution and “as a witness rather than a suspect”.\n\nLabour’s chief fundraiser Lord Levy – nicknamed “Lord Cashpoint” by the tabloid press – was arrested twice on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.\n\nIn 2007, the police would hand a 216-page report on the scandal to the Crown Prosecution Service – which later announced it had insufficient evidence to bring charges against anyone.\n\nCameron accused of cronyism\n\nDavid Cameron was accused of cronyism when he nominated almost 50 close aides, political allies and Conservative donors for honours as part of his resignation honours list.\n\nIn an unusual move, four serving cabinet members were honoured in Cameron’s list: Philip Hammond, who had recently taken on the role of chancellor; Michael Fallon, the defence secretary; David Lidington, the leader of the House of ­Commons; and Patrick McLoughlin, the Tory party chairman.\n\n“Normally politicians can expect to be honoured at the end of their time in office, not in mid-career or when they have just taken on a new cabinet job,” The Sunday Times noted in a critical leader.\n\nKnighthoods were also given to two Tory Party donors who gave significant contributions to the “Remain” campaign, and a CBE was awarded to Will Straw, the campaign’s director, leading the newspaper to accuse Cameron of handing out honours as “consolation prizes” and “rewards for failure”.\n\nNewspapers also balked at the award of an OBE to Samantha Cameron’s stylist, Isabel Spearman, as well as to other close aides and assistants who worked with cabinet members. One Whitehall source remarked to The Sunday Times: “They must have gone through the No. 10 staff list when they were compiling the nominations. I’m surprised Larry [the Downing Street cat] is not in there.”\n\nCBE fixed by Prince Charles' aides\n\nIn another scandal over honours, The Sunday Times said billionaire businessman Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz was given a CBE by Prince Charles in a private ceremony at Buckingham Palace in 2016 after he paid “tens of thousands of pounds to fixers with links to the prince who had told him they could secure the honour.”\n\nMahfouz donated millions to restoration projects of interest to Charles, including Dumfries House and the Castle of Mey in Scotland. The Saudi national was keen to secure British citizenship or residency through a so-called “golden visa” for investment, and “had been advised that securing as many honorary roles and awards as possible would help his cause”, said the paper.\n\nIt is alleged that Michael Fawcett, a former valet to the prince and an indispensable aide, helped to co-ordinate Mahfouz’s application for British citizenship and even helped to “upgrade” the proposed honour from OBE to CBE.\n\nThe Sunday Times claimed that leaked correspondence shows that Mahfouz’s aides were “explicit about the transactional nature of the arrangement”, and that large sums of money were being given to Charles’s charities to secure the honour.\n\nAccording to leaked emails from William Bortrick, the owner of Burke’s Peerage and a paid adviser to Mahfouz, he told colleagues that once Mahfouz was honoured, “then more money will flow”.\n\nThe allegations pose “serious questions about the conduct of those close to the prince”, said the newspaper, and will also prompt a “renewed scrutiny of the honours system and whether it is open to monetary influence”.\n\nArise, Sir Gavin\n\nThe decision to honour Williamson, who was “responsible for the Covid exams fiasco” in 2020, has been described “as an insult to parents, teachers and children”, The Times said.\n\nThe former education secretary “played an integral role in [Boris] Johnson’s successful leadership campaign and was regarded by some as a potentially dangerous opponent on the Tory back benches”.\n\nBut the knighthood is also “controversial” as Williamson was sacked as defence secretary by Theresa May in 2019 after a Whitehall probe “concluded that he had leaked sensitive information from a meeting of the national security council”.\n\nSome Tory MPs were also “scathing about the knighthood”, the Daily Mail reported, “suggesting it was a reward for remaining loyal” to the prime minister. “It will do nothing to enhance the public’s view of our discredited honours system,” one MP said. “He knows where the bodies are buried, and Boris has locked his shovel away.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Catherine Garcia", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Joel Mathis", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet"], "publish_date": "2021/09/06"}]}

And it also is \"rizz.\" The Oxford University Press announced Monday it has deemed \"rizz\" as the 2023 Word of the Year. A slang word popularized by social media, rizz was chosen from a pool of eight words by language experts with input from the public. \"Given that last year, ‘goblin mode’ resonated with so many of us after the pandemic, it’s interesting to see a contrasting word like rizz come to the forefront, perhaps speaking to a prevailing mood of 2023,\" president of Oxford Languages Casper Grathwohl said in a press release. Do you have rizz? Here's what to know.\n\n📖 What does it mean? \"Rizz\" is basically short for \"charisma,\" and describes someone's ability to flirt and attract someone romantically. It can be used as a noun or a verb, depending on the context.\n\n'No safe area' for fleeing Gazans\n\nSafety options for civilians in southern Gaza continued to diminish Monday as Israeli forces paired an expanded ground attack with repeated airstrikes in their attempt to eradicate Hamas militants from the strip. Israel had told Palestinians in Gaza's second-largest city, Khan Younis, to head south toward the border town of Rafah in anticipation of heavy bombardment and the approach of ground forces. That led to massive displacement, in many cases of the same people who had fled the battered north, further deteriorating the enclave's humanitarian crisis. \"They tell you it is a safe area, but there is no safe area in all of the Gaza Strip,\" said Salah al-Arja, whose house was destroyed. 👉 Follow our live coverage.\n\nReal quick\n\nThe Short List is free, but several stories we link to are subscriber-only.

Manuel Rocha, who was arrested Friday and appeared in federal court on Monday, is accused of \"serving as a covert agent\" to support Cuba's \"clandestine intelligence-gathering mission against the United States,\" a complaint filed in U.S. District Court states. Investigators say Rocha, 73, provided the U.S. with false and misleading information \"to protect his secret mission\"; traveled outside the U.S. to meet with Cuban operatives; and made false statements to obtain travel documents. 🔎 Take a closer look at the allegations.\n\n2024 election chaos has some 'preppers' prepping\n\nCollapse of society? No problem for the relatively small – but growing – segment of Americans who consider themselves \"preppers\": People prepared to survive without government assistance during disasters. As the 2024 election approached, more Americans say they're ready should disaster strike.

Kwarteng was swiftly sacked as chancellor and replaced by Jeremy Hunt, who in a final blow to so-called Trussonomics, scrapped almost all of her tax cuts.\n\nHunt’s bid to steady the markets succeeded in stabilising the pound. And the pound rose further against the dollar this morning, after Boris Johnson ruled himself out of the Tory leadership race. But “analysts reckon that markets will need some time to thoroughly shake off the political risk premium built over recent weeks”, reported Reuters.\n\nGovernment bonds – which “determine ordinary people’s mortgage bills and the government’s borrowing costs” – are still “nowhere close to bouncing back to where they started”, said the Financial Times’s markets editor Katie Martin.\n\n“The fact that yields are still elevated despite Truss’s departure is a warning sign to her successor,” Martin wrote. “Clearly, the new prime minister will have to work hard to regain the market’s trust. In other words, markets will have a lot of sway on the direction government takes.”\n\nGet the economy back on track\n\nSunak “will face a long list of economic challenges”, said The New York Times’s London-based business reporter Eshe Nelson. The cost-of-living crisis is being driven by soaring energy prices and 40-year-high inflation compounded by rising interest rates. With a £40bn hole in the public finances causing further misery, the UK economy is expected to be in recession until the middle of 2023.\n\n“The country has been getting poorer,” the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, “and the public are feeling it.”\n\nNikhil Sanghani, managing director of research at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, told Vox that voters were likely to face further suffering. “Whoever takes over, they’ll probably have to enact some sort of prudent fiscal policy, which probably means some form of austerity,” Sanghani said.\n\nHunt has reportedly told government departments apart from health and defence to reduce their budgets by as much as 15% already, and has put an April 2023 deadline on energy support payments, in what pundits say effectively amounts to “austerity 2.0”.\n\nFormer Bank of England governor Mervyn King delivered what The Guardian called “a stark message for consumers” yesterday, warning that Britons face years of financial hardship that could be “more difficult” than during the age of austerity a decade ago.\n\nRescue public services\n\nAmid speculation about widespread cuts to public services, “the NHS is braced for its toughest ever winter”, said Wearmouth in The New Statesman. Covid cases are climbing, waiting lists and A&E delays are at record highs, and around 100,000 NHS jobs are vacant.\n\nAt the same time, UK workers are experiencing the biggest falls in real pay adjusted for inflation since 1977, which has led to widespread industrial action by groups ranging from transport and postal staff to barristers.\n\nYet “strikingly”, none of the Tory leadership candidates “have faced scrutiny over what they plan to do with power”, said Wearmouth. She questioned whether Sunak would “look to, say, the defence budget (due to rise to 3% of GDP by 2030), levelling-up projects or foreign aid for savings? If he plans to break the promise he made as chancellor to raise benefits in line with inflation, there is no way for the public to hold him accountable.”\n\nUnite the Tory party\n\nAs the Conservatives prepare to elect their third leader of 2022, “senior Tory figures are asking whether their party is now broken beyond repair”, said PoliticsHome’s political reporter Adam Payne.\n\nSee more\n\n“I’ve never seen such division within the party,” wrote Iain Dale in The Telegraph. Tory MPs need to unite “behind a new leader who will appeal not just to all groups within the parliamentary party, but also who will reach out to members and voters with a positive, optimistic message of renewal and hope”.\n\nYet having disposed of four leaders in six years and descended into a state of near-constant civil war, “there is widespread belief in Westminster that the Conservative Party as it stands may now be ungovernable, and can only be retrieved after a time out of power, during which it can locate a common purpose”, said PoliticsHome’s Payne.\n\nWin back the public\n\nWhile uniting the Tory party seems like a mammoth task, winning back voters may prove even harder. Politico’s latest polling aggregator puts Labour on 53%, more than 30 points ahead of the Conservatives on 21%.\n\nThe next general election does not have to take place for another two years, but as the country prepares for the arrival of the second unelected leader of this parliament, the next PM is likely to “come under pressure to secure a mandate”, said Sky News. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP and Greens have all called for an early general election.\n\nAnd a YouGov poll last week of more than 2,000 people found that 63% also believed that voters should be given a say immediately.\n\nYet for all the challenges facing the next PM, there may still be cause for hope, according to Tony Travers, director of LSE London.\n\n“It would be genuinely shocking if the Conservative Party didn’t survive,” Travers told Vox. “It’s an incredibly long-established and durable political party, one of the longest-established and most durable in the world, and it has incredible capacities to adapt and change and revive itself and move on.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Becca Stanek", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Joel Mathis", "Jamie Timson", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Sorcha Bradley", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/961024/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-27-may-2023", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 27 May 2023 | The Week", "text": "1. Sunak warned of recession\n\nRishi Sunak has been warned the UK economy could be in recession next year, ahead of the general election. Economists predicted the Bank of England could be “forced to drive Britain’s economy into a recession to tame inflation”, said The Guardian. Financial markets have driven up UK government borrowing costs to the highest level since Liz Truss’s reign, putting into doubt the prime minister’s ability to deliver on his promise to halve inflation this year, one of five central pledges of his premiership.\n\n2. Post Office sorry for racist terms\n\nThe Post Office has apologised after it was revealed that it used racist terms to describe postmasters wrongly investigated as part of the Horizon IT scandal. An internal document shows investigators were asked to group suspects based on racial features, including “Chinese/Japanese types”, “Dark Skinned European Types” and “Negroid Types”. Hundreds of sub-postmasters were prosecuted for false accounting based on information from a flawed system in an episode that has been described as “the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history”.\n\n3. Schofield admits ‘unwise’ affair\n\nPhillip Schofield has quit ITV after revealing he had an affair with a younger male ITV employee and lied to cover it up. In a statement to the Daily Mail, the 61-year-old said the relationship with his junior colleague was “unwise but not illegal”. The former This Morning host said he “met the man when he was a teenager and was asked to help him to get into television”. Writing on Twitter, former colleague Eamonn Holmes said: “Schofield has finally been caught out”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Ukraine ready for counter-offensive\n\nUkraine is ready to launch its much-anticipated counter-offensive against Russian forces, said one of the country’s most senior security officials. Speaking to the BBC, Oleksiy Danilov declined to name a date but said an assault to retake territory from President Vladimir Putin’s forces could begin “tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or in a week”. Meanwhile, Russia’s deputy security council chair, Dmitry Medvedev, has said the conflict in Ukraine could last for decade.\n\n5. Foreign teachers ‘a sticking plaster’\n\nForeign teachers are being offered £10,000 to work in English schools, reported The Times. In a major recruitment effort by ministers to fill classroom vacancies, hundreds of maths, science and language teachers will be brought in from countries such as India and Nigeria this year. Applications for teacher-training courses from outside Europe have surged this year, “highlighting tensions in the government’s approach to immigration”, said the paper. Unions have criticised a “desperate” attempt to use overseas staff as a “sticking plaster”.\n\n6. Covid probe to quiz Osborne\n\nGeorge Osborne has been called to give evidence to the Covid public inquiry, reported the inews site. As part of its review of the UK’s resilience, preparedness and planning for pandemics, Lady Hallett’s inquiry will explore whether Osborne’s austerity cuts left the country less able to cope. The former chancellor will join David Cameron and Jeremy Hunt as a formal witness when the inquiry begins next month. Critics said tighter spending on the NHS, low investment in social care, and budget cuts to public health, had a negative effect during the pandemic.\n\n7. DeSantis ‘takes off the gloves’\n\nRon DeSantis has accused Donald Trump of “destroying millions of people’s lives” by “turning the country over to [Anthony] Fauci”, his medical adviser, who advocated lockdowns and social distancing. The Times says the claim that Trump’s approach harmed jobs and schools means the Florida governor “finally took the gloves off to try to fight his way back into the Republican race for the White House”. DeSantis is “facing a huge polling gap and chastened by a botched campaign launch on Twitter”, it added.\n\n8. Johnson ‘painfully on the rack’\n\nBoris Johnson is sitting on a “ticking timebomb” over new Partygate claims being examined by police, said Tory grandee Michael Heseltine. Writing for The Independent, Heseltine said: “Never in my lifetime have I seen an ex-prime minister so nakedly and painfully on the rack to the extent that Boris Johnson is.” Cabinet Office officials have referred the former PM to police over further possible lockdown violations at Chequers and Number 10. Cleo Watson, Johnson’s former deputy chief of staff, said the latest claims could end Johnson’s career.\n\n9. Papua fighters threaten hostage\n\nFighters in Indonesia’s Papua region have threatened to shoot a New Zealand hostage if independence talks are not held. Phillip Mehrtens, a pilot, was taken hostage in February. In a new video released by the fighters on Friday, he is seen “looking emaciated” and “holding the banned Morning Star flag - a symbol of Papuan independence”, said Sky News. Papua became part of Indonesia in a contentious 1969 vote and there has been an insurgency ever since, added the outlet.\n\n10. Farmer attacked by his crocodiles\n\nA crocodile farmer was torn to pieces by 40 of his own reptiles after he fell into their enclosure. Luan Nam, 72, was trying to move one animal out of its cage when it grabbed the stick he was using as a goad with its jaws and pulled him in. He was the set upon by the crocodiles in Siem Reap, Cambodia. “Other crocodiles pounced, attacking him until he was dead,” police chief Mey Savry told the AFP news agency.

Global immunity to the illness is rising, thanks to either vaccination or, less fortunately, people having contracted the virus.\n\nBy mid-December, around 4.5 billion people across the globe had had at least one jab, while more than 3.5 billion were fully vaccinated. As The Economist said in November: “Together with those who have caught the disease, around half the world’s population has some level of immunity.” Eventually, the disease will become endemic, helped along by a “glut” of new vaccines as well as other treatments like molnupiravir, an oral anti-viral drug.\n\nVaccination inequality will continue to hamper the recovery of poorer nations, but in the developed world it is likely to start to fade into a non-life-threatening illness. Of course, “looming over these positive developments is the prospect of mutation”, the paper continued. And as the world nervously watches to see how the new Omicron variant will affect the course of the pandemic, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) has warned the UK government that the new variant could “trigger a surge in virus infections bigger than previous waves in the UK”, said Sky News.\n\n(Image credit: Clive Mason/Formula 1 via Getty Images)\n\nFifa World Cup in Qatar\n\nThe 2022 Fifa World Cup is set to take place in Qatar this year from 21 November to 18 December. It will be the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world, but footballing fever in the nation has been tempered by the “shadow of abusive labour practices and workers’ deaths” in the run-up to the tournament, said The Guardian. Some 6,500 migrant workers are thought to have died since the country was awarded the tournament a decade ago, many of them thought to be employed on World Cup infrastructure projects, said The Guardian in another report.\n\nAlthough still almost a year out, bookmakers have already begun making their predictions over which teams could emerge as potential winners of the tournament. England are currently third favourites at 7/1, while Brazil and France are joint favourites at 6/1, Bet365 told The Telegraph.\n\nThe Queen’s Platinum Jubilee\n\nThe Queen is set to mark 70 years since she ascended to the throne, aged just 25, in 1952. She will be the first British monarch to reach the milestone, having celebrated her Gold, Silver and Diamond Jubilees. The occasion will be marked with celebrations that will continue throughout 2022, culminating in a four-day-long bank holiday weekend in June, as detailed on the Royal Family’s official website.\n\nIn 2020, Oliver Dowden, the then culture secretary, said the jubilee will be “a truly historic moment – and one that deserves a celebration to remember”.\n\n“We can all look forward to a special, four-day Jubilee weekend, when we will put on a spectacular, once-in-a-generation show that mixes the best of British ceremonial splendour with cutting edge art and technology. It will bring the entire nation and the Commonwealth together in a fitting tribute to Her Majesty’s reign.”\n\nUS midterms\n\nThe Democrats are preparing for an electoral battering at the approaching US midterm elections, as the latest polling shows the Republicans have the largest lead at this stage in 40 years.\n\nAccording to one generic poll conducted by The Washington Post and ABC News, 51% of registered voters said they would back a Republican candidate for Congress compared to just 41% who said they would support a Democratic candidate.\n\nABC News noted that it was “the biggest lead for Republicans in the 110 polls that have asked this question since November 1981”, and could herald large losses for the Democrats in the House, where they maintain only a narrow majority.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nFrench presidential election\n\nAlthough he is yet to even declare his candidacy, Emmanuel Macron will almost certainly seek a second presidential term. So far, the polling suggests he’ll win, although analysts have warned the election remains “highly unpredictable”, according to France 24.\n\nPolling shows that the French president is leading the first round and will likely beat off opposing candidates should the elections come to a second-round run-off. He is currently polling at 25% in the first round, Politico reported, followed by Valerie Pecresse, who has won the nomination for the right-wing Les Republicains party, at 17% and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen on 16%.\n\nBut, as Reuters noted, “early favourites lost the 2017 election”, which was won by the “then-outsider” Macron. And while pollsters may have correctly called the 2012 election, they have “spectacularly failed on other occasions”. Meanwhile, voter abstention rates are “nearly impossible to predict so far off” leaving the race still shrouded in “much uncertainty”, the news agency added.\n\nHybrid working\n\nMany predict that 2022 is likely to be the year we transition from working remotely to what has become known as “hybrid” working – spending part of the week in the office, and the rest at home.\n\nThe pandemic forced employers to undergo “a change in their relationship with the idea of a centralized workplace”, said Forbes, and at the height of the pandemic in 2020, almost 69% of large companies in the US expected an overall decrease in the amount of office space they would be using, according to research by KPMG.\n\nAnd a more recent survey from April 2021, conducted by consulting company Gartner, showed that “99% of human resources leaders expect employees to work in some kind of hybrid arrangement moving forward”, reported the Fast Company.\n\nThe work from home experiment has been welcomed by employees, too. According to The Economist, surveys have shown that office workers would like to work from home nearly 50% of the time – up from 5% before the pandemic – with employees wishing to spend the remainder of the time in the office. As we move into 2022, it looks like hybrid working will become commonplace.\n\nRichard Branson cheers with crew members after flying into space (Image credit: Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSpace tourism\n\nThis could also be the year that space tourism starts to gain real lift-off, after commercial projects Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic both successfully made their maiden suborbital flights.\n\nBoth hope to pick up the pace with “regular, predictable, reliable” flights in 2022, Tom Shelley of Space Adventures, a space-tour operator based in Virginia, told The Economist.\n\nAround 700 people have already bought tickets to ride into suborbital space with Virgin Galactic, reported Space.com, with the company hoping to “boost that number to 1,000 by the time it begins commercial operations” in late 2022.\n\nBut getting commercial customers into space is hardly plain sailing – and Virgin Galactic has postponed its first commercial flight as the company conducts “repairs and upgrades” to its next test flight, Unity 23, reported the BBC. Commercial flights had been due to begin in the third quarter of 2022, but are now expected to go ahead in the fourth quarter instead.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "The Week Staff", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Brendan Morrow", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "Devika Rao", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "Peter Weber"], "publish_date": "2022/01/03"}]}

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/17/us/inside-texas-synagogue-hostage-standoff/index.html", "title": "Inside the Texas synagogue hostage standoff | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt started like most any Saturday for members of Congregation Beth Israel.\n\nFamilies of the Reform Jewish synagogue just outside Dallas-Fort Worth had gathered – in person and online – to participate in the Sabbath service, even amid the twin perils of a fresh pandemic wave and a swelling tide of attacks on Jewish people in the United States.\n\nBy day’s end, the community of faith in Colleyville, Texas, would be at the center of a global drama involving a livestreamed hostage-taking, an imprisoned terrorist icon, an elite FBI rescue team, a rabbi’s quick thinking and a final, frantic sprint to freedom.\n\nMore details may yet offer a deeper understanding of why it happened. But already, the tale is one of searing trauma, with the broader American Jewish community now again forced to be resilient as it’s reminded of the ever-present potential for disaster.\n\nA rabbi welcomes a stranger\n\nA stranger arrived that morning at the synagogue.\n\nRabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker welcomed in the man and made him a cup of tea, the rabbi told CBS on Monday.\n\nCytron-Walker may not have known immediately that Malik Faisal Akram, 44, was a British national. Akram had arrived in the US via New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in late December, a US law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nIn the two weeks before he met Cytron-Walker, Akram had spent three nights – January 6, 11 and 13 – at a Dallas homeless shelter, according to Union Gospel Mission Dallas CEO Bruce Butler. He was very quiet and wasn’t there long enough to build any relationships, Butler said.\n\nOver their shared tea, Cytron-Walker and Akram talked, the rabbi said.\n\n“Some of his story didn’t quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that’s not necessarily an uncommon thing,” said the rabbi, who soon that day would lead a religious service for the 157 membership families of his congregation, established in 1999.\n\nThe rabbi pointed Jeffrey Cohen, the vice president on the synagogue’s board of trustees, to their guest that day. Cohen went over and introduced himself, he wrote in a Facebook post describing his experience.\n\n“He was on the phone, but briefly stopped his conversation,” Cohen said. “He said hello, smiled, and after we introduced ourselves, I let him go back to his call. He seemed calm and happy to be in from the frigid 20 degree morning. His eyes weren’t darting around; his hands were open and calm, he said hello, he smiled.”\n\nBecause of the recent coronavirus surge, many of Congregation Beth Israel’s members had stayed home on Saturday to watch the weekly prayers via Facebook or Zoom. Services began at 10 a.m.\n\nAs the rabbi led the prayers – his back turned as he faced toward Jerusalem – he heard a click. It came from the stranger.\n\n“And it turned out, that it was his gun,” Cytron-Walker said.\n\nCohen said he heard that same click, the “unmistakable sound of an automatic slide engaging a round.” The mysterious guest then began yelling something. Cohen dialed 911 on his phone, put the screen side down and moved as commanded, he wrote.\n\nAkram took four people hostage, including the rabbi, authorities said.\n\n‘I’m going to die at the end of this’\n\nPolice got an emergency call at 10:41 a.m.\n\nThey rushed to the synagogue and set up a perimeter, evacuating residents nearby, police said. Soon, nearly 200 members of local, state and federal law enforcement, including the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on hand, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said.\n\nMeanwhile, the livestream – intended for the faithful who’d stayed home to be safe from Covid-19 – appeared to capture some of what Akram was saying.\n\n“I’m gunned up. I’m ammo-ed up,” he told someone he called nephew. “Guess what, I will die.”\n\nThe audio can be difficult to understand, and it’s not clear whom Akram is talking to. But it’s clear he planned to die during the standoff, he repeatedly told people.\n\n“OK, are you listening? I don’t want you to cry. Listen! I’m going to release these four guys … but then I’m going to go in the yard, yeah? … And they’re going to take me, alright? I’m going to die at the end of this, alright? Are you listening? I am going to die! OK? So, don’t cry over me,” the man said to someone else.\n\nCongregation member Stacey Silverman watched the livestream for more than an hour. She heard the suspect ranting, sometimes switching between saying, “I’m not a criminal,” to apologies, she said.\n\nThe man vacillated among languages and was “screaming hysterically,” she said. He claimed to have a bomb.\n\nAkram also “spoke repeatedly about a convicted terrorist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States,” the FBI said in a statement. The convict is believed to be Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani with a PhD in neuroscience who is serving a federal prison sentence in Fort Worth after being found guilty of attempted murder and other charges in an assault on US officers in Afghanistan.\n\nShe was not involved in the Colleyville attack, her attorney said Saturday.\n\n“He wanted this woman released and he wanted to talk to her and he thought – well, he said point-blank – he chose this synagogue because ‘Jews control the world. Jews control the media. Jews control the banks. I want to talk to chief rabbi of the United States,’” Cohen told CNN, adding there is no chief rabbi in the US.\n\nInside the synagogue, Cohen resisted following exactly as Akram commanded, he wrote in his Facebook post. Rather than go to the back of the room as ordered, Cohen stayed in line with one of the exits. When a police officer came to the door and the hostage-taker became more agitated, Cohen moved closer to the exit door, he wrote.\n\nAkram let them call their families, and Cohen called his wife, daughter and son and even posted on Facebook. He also slowly moved a few chairs in front of him – “anything to slow or divert a bullet or shrapnel,” he wrote.\n\nAt one point – at the suspect’s request – the rabbi being held hostage called a well-known rabbi in New York City so the suspect could say Siddiqi was framed and he wanted her released, two officials briefed on investigation said.\n\nAs hours ticked on, law enforcement negotiators had a “high frequency and duration of contact” with the suspect, DeSarno said. The FBI called out its Hostage Rescue Team from Quantico, Virginia, and some 60 to 70 people came to the site, Colleyville Police Chief Michael Miller said.\n\nOne hostage – a man – was released unharmed around 5 p.m., Colleyville Police Sgt. Dara Nelson said. The hostage-taker did not harm the hostages, the rabbi told CBS.\n\nBut, he added, they were threatened the entire time.\n\nA thrown chair activates a bold escape\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Police speak out after synagogue hostages were rescued 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nWith threats and attacks targeting Jewish people growing more common in recent years, Cytron-Walker and his congregation had participated in security courses with law enforcement agencies, he said.\n\nAs Saturday afternoon rolled to the night – and the hostage-taker’s demeanor began to change – that training helped the rabbi and the two others who were still held against their will.\n\n“In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” Cytron-Walker said Sunday in a statement. “Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself.”\n\nCohen helped another hostage move closer to that exit, and whispered to him about the door, he wrote. The third hostage later joined them when they received pizza to eat, putting them all within 20 feet of the exit door.\n\nThey spoke with Akram and asked him questions, trying to buy the FBI time to move into position, he wrote.\n\nYet the situation began to devolve. “At one point, our attacker instructed us to get on our knees. I reared up in my chair, stared at him sternly. I think I slowly moved my head and mouthed NO. He stared at me, then moved back to sit down. It was this moment when Rabbi Charlie yelled run,” he wrote.\n\nCytron-Walker saw his opening when he got the gunman a drink in a glass, he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday.\n\n“As he was drinking, the gun wasn’t in the best position and I thought this was our best chance, I needed to make sure the people who were still with me that they were ready to go,” the rabbi said.\n\n“And so there was a chair that was right in front of me. I told the guys to go, I picked it up and I threw it at him with all the adrenaline,” Cytron-Walker said. “It was absolutely terrifying and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be shot, and I did not hear a shot fired as I made it out the door. I was the last one out.”\n\nThe three hostages burst through the exit door and sprinted away from the building, video taken from outside the synagogue by CNN affiliate WFAA shows. Seconds later, a man in black holding what appears to be a gun stepped halfway through the exit to look outside. He then returned inside the building without shooting, the video shows.\n\nA group of heavily armed law enforcement personnel moved toward another part of the building, the video shows. About 30 seconds later, a series of four bangs erupted, followed by a louder explosive boom that set a number of car alarms to begin wailing. Other armed law enforcement personnel moved into a different position by the building, and another three loud bangs then went off, the video shows.\n\nThe loud boom, heard by a CNN team near the synagogue at about 9:12 p.m., was the result of entry tools used by the hostage rescue team, an ATF spokesperson said.\n\nThe rescue team breached the synagogue, Miller said. The suspect was killed.\n\nNone of the four hostages was harmed, DeSarno said.\n\nMore booms echoed as the tactical team disposed of leftover entry explosives brought by the rescue team. Crime scene investigators recovered one firearm they believe belonged to the suspect, the ATF spokesperson said. An ATF dog found no more explosives, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Facebook, Cohen credited active shooter training he received for his survival and escape.\n\n“We weren’t released or freed,” he said. “We escaped because we had training from the Secure Community Network on what to do in the event of an active shooter.”\n\nThe Secure Community Network describes itself as the “official safety and security organization of the Jewish community in North America.”\n\n“Those courses, that instruction, helped me to understand that you need to act in moments where your life is threatened. I would not have had the courage, I would not have had the knowhow or what to do without that instruction,” Cytron-Walker said. “I want people to understand, it doesn’t matter if you are in a synagogue, if you’re Jewish, if you’re Muslim, if you’re Christian, if you’re religious at all, it can happen in a shopping mall. Unfortunately this is the world that we’re living in.”\n\n‘The time to heal our community has begun’\n\nOn Sunday morning, Cytron-Walker took to Facebook, this time to express his gratitude to those who supported him throughout Saturday’s ordeal.\n\n“I am thankful and filled with appreciation for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support, all of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us,” he wrote in the Facebook post.\n\n“I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the CBI Community, the Jewish Community, the Human Community. I am grateful that we made it out. I am grateful to be alive,” Cytron-Walker said in the post.\n\nNothing suggests the threat posed by Akram is continuing, officials said. The investigation into the case and its motive is likely to be global, DeSarno added, including contacts with Tel Aviv and London.\n\nInitially, the FBI, based on its exchanges, found the suspect to be “singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community, but we’ll continue to work to find motive,” DeSarno said.\n\nOn Monday, the agency called Saturday’s attack “a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted,” according to a statement. The case “is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.”\n\nCongregation Beth Israel held a special service Monday night at which the rabbi spoke about the need to heal after the incident.\n\n“Thank God, thank God,” Cytron-Walker said. “It could’ve been so much worse, and I am overflowing, truly overflowing, with gratitude.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/tech/twitter-whistleblower-peiter-zatko-security/index.html", "title": "Twitter whistleblower Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko raises concerns over ...", "text": "Twitter has major security problems that pose a threat to its own users’ personal information, to company shareholders, to national security, and to democracy, according to an explosive whistleblower disclosure obtained exclusively by CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nThe disclosure, sent last month to Congress and federal agencies, paints a picture of a chaotic and reckless environment at a mismanaged company that allows too many of its staff access to the platform’s central controls and most sensitive information without adequate oversight. It also alleges that some of the company’s senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter’s serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, who was previously the company’s head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter’s leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users’ data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don’t have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk’s attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk’s claims).\n\nZatko was fired by Twitter (TWTR) in January for what the company claims was poor performance. According to Zatko, his public whistleblowing comes after he attempted to flag the security lapses to Twitter (TWTR)’s board and to help Twitter (TWTR) fix years of technical shortcomings and alleged non-compliance with an earlier privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. Zatko is being represented by Whistleblower Aid, the same group that represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.\n\nJohn Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid and Zatko’s lawyer, told CNN that Zatko has not been in contact with Musk, and said Zatko began the whistleblower process before there was any indication of Musk’s involvement with Twitter.\n\nAfter this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, “We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.”\n\nCNN sought comment from Twitter on more than 50 specific questions regarding the disclosure.\n\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN that security and privacy are both longtime priorities for the company. Twitter also said the company provides clear tools for users to control privacy, ad targeting and data sharing, and added that it has created internal workflows to ensure users know that when they cancel their accounts, Twitter will deactivate the accounts and start a deletion process. Twitter declined to say whether it typically completes the process.\n\n“Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance,” the Twitter spokesperson said. “What we’ve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. Mr. Zatko’s allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.”\n\nSome of Zatko’s most damning claims spring from his apparently tense relationship with Parag Agrawal, the company’s former chief technology officer who was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. According to the disclosure, Agrawal and his lieutenants repeatedly discouraged Zatko from providing a full accounting of Twitter’s security problems to the company’s board of directors. The company’s executive team allegedly instructed Zatko to provide an oral report of his initial findings on the company’s security condition to the board rather than a detailed written account, ordered Zatko to knowingly present cherry-picked and misrepresented data to create the false perception of progress on urgent cybersecurity issues, and went behind Zatko’s back to have a third-party consulting firm’s report scrubbed to hide the true extent of the company’s problems.\n\nThe disclosure is generally much kinder to Dorsey, who hired Zatko and whom Zatko believes wanted to see the problems within the company fixed. But it does depict him as extremely disengaged in his final months leading Twitter – so much so that some senior staff even considered the possibility he was sick.\n\nCNN has reached out to Dorsey for comment. A person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at Twitter told CNN the company investigated several claims he brought forward around the time he was fired, and ultimately found them unpersuasive; the person added that Zatko at times lacked understanding of Twitter’s FTC obligations.\n\nZatko believes his firing was in retaliation for his sounding the alarm about the company’s security problems.\n\nThe scathing disclosure, which totals around 200 pages, including supporting exhibits – was sent last month to a number of US government agencies and congressional committees, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The existence and details of the disclosure have not previously been reported. CNN obtained a copy of the disclosure from a senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill. The SEC, DOJ and FTC declined to comment; the Senate Intelligence Committee, which received a copy of the report, is taking the disclosure seriously and is setting a meeting to discuss the allegations, according to Rachel Cohen, a committee spokesperson.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and also received the report, vowed to investigate “and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations.”\n\nThe claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the same panel’s top Republican and an avid Twitter user, also expressed deep concerns about the allegations in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Take a tech platform that collects massive amounts of user data, combine it with what appears to be an incredibly weak security infrastructure and infuse it with foreign state actors with an agenda, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster,” Grassley said. “The claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns as well as privacy issues, and they must be investigated further.”\n\nThe FTC should investigate the claims, and impose fines and individual liability on specific Twitter executives if a probe finds they were responsible for security lapses, Sen. Richard Blumenthal wrote to the agency in a letter on Tuesday obtained by CNN.\n\nThe letter by Blumenthal — who chairs the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection — highlights the pressure Twitter now faces from Washington as a result of the disclosure.\n\n“If the Commission does not vigorously oversee and enforce its orders, they will not be taken seriously and these dangerous breaches will continue,” Blumenthal wrote.\n\nZatko may be eligible for a monetary award from the US government as a result of his whistleblower activities. “Original, timely and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action” by the SEC can earn whistleblowers up to a 30% cut of agency fines related to the action if the penalties amount to more than $1 million, the SEC has said. The SEC has awarded more than $1 billion to nearly 300 whistleblowers since 2012.\n\nTye told CNN that Zatko filed his disclosure to the SEC “to help the agency enforce the laws,” and to gain federal whistleblower protections. “The prospect of a reward was not a factor in Mudge’s decision, and in fact he didn’t even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower.”\n\nThe Whistleblower\n\nZatko first came to national attention in 1998 when he took part in the first congressional hearings on cybersecurity.\n\n“All my life, I’ve been about finding places where I can go and make a difference. I’ve done that through the security field. That’s my main lever,” he told CNN in an interview earlier this month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Twitter whistleblower was on CNN 22 years ago. Here's what he had to say 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\nThe events leading to his decision to become a whistleblower began before he worked at Twitter, with a devastating hack in 2020 in which the Twitter accounts of some of the world’s most famous people, including then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian and Musk, were compromised. Twitter told CNN that in response to the incident, the company began compartmentalizing access to customer support tools.\n\nAfter the attack, Dorsey recruited Zatko, a well-known “ethical hacker” turned cybersecurity insider and executive who previously held senior roles at Google, Stripe and the US Department of Defense, and who told CNN that he’d been offered a senior, day-one cyber position in the Biden administration.\n\nZatko, center, was among a group of hackers who testified before Congress on cybersecurity in 1998. Douglas Graham/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images\n\nWhat Zatko says he found was a company with extraordinarily poor security practices, including giving thousands of the company’s employees — amounting to roughly half the company’s workforce — access to some of the platform’s critical controls. His disclosure describes his overall findings as “egregious deficiencies, negligence, willful ignorance, and threats to national security and democracy.”\n\nAfter the January 6 insurrection, Zatko was concerned about the possibility someone within Twitter who sympathized with the insurrectionists could try to manipulate the company’s platform, according to his disclosure. He sought to clamp down on internal access that allows Twitter engineers to make changes to the platform, known as the “production environment.”\n\nBut, the disclosure says, Zatko soon learned “it was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did…. Nobody knew where data lived or whether it was critical, and all engineers had some form of critical access to the production environment.” Twitter also lacked the ability to hold workers accountable for information security lapses because it has little control or visibility into employees’ individual work computers, Zatko claims, citing internal cybersecurity reports estimating that 4 in 10 devices do not meet basic security standards.\n\nTwitter’s flimsy server infrastructure is a separate yet equally serious vulnerability, the disclosure claims. About half of the company’s 500,000 servers run on outdated software that does not support basic security features such as encryption for stored data or regular security updates by vendors, according to the letter to regulators and a February email Zatko wrote to Patrick Pichette, a Twitter board member, that is included in the disclosure.\n\n[I]t was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did. From Zatko's disclosure\n\nThe company also lacks sufficient redundancies and procedures to restart or recover from data center crashes, Zatko’s disclosure says, meaning that even minor outages of several data centers at the same time could knock the entire Twitter service offline, perhaps for good.\n\nTwitter did not respond to questions about the risk of data center outages, but told CNN that people on Twitter’s engineering and product teams are authorized to access the production environment if they have a specific business justification for doing so. Twitter’s employees use devices overseen by other IT and security teams with the power to prevent a device from connecting to sensitive internal systems if it is running outdated software, Twitter added.\n\nThe company also said it uses automated checks to ensure laptops running outdated software cannot access the production environment, and that employees may only make changes to Twitter’s live product after the code meets certain record-keeping and review requirements.\n\nTwitter has internal security tools that are tested by the company regularly, and every two years by external auditors, according to the person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at the company. The person added that some of Zatko’s statistics surrounding device security lacked credibility and were derived by a small team that did not properly account for Twitter’s existing security procedures.\n\nBut Twitter’s security concerns had come to light prior to 2020. In 2010, the FTC filed a complaint against Twitter for its mishandling of users’ private information and the issue of too many employees having access to Twitter’s central controls. The complaint resulted in an FTC consent order finalized the following year in which Twitter vowed to clean up its act, including by creating and maintaining “a comprehensive information security program.”\n\nZatko alleges that despite the company’s claims to the contrary, it had “never been in compliance” with what the FTC demanded more than 10 years ago. As a result of its alleged failures to address vulnerabilities raised by the FTC as well as other deficiencies, he says, Twitter suffers an “anomalously high rate of security incidents,” approximately one per week serious enough to require disclosure to government agencies. “Based on my professional experience, peer companies do not have this magnitude or volume of incidents,” Zatko wrote in a February letter to Twitter’s board after he was fired by Twitter in January.\n\nThe stakes of Zatko’s disclosure are enormous. It could lead to billions of dollars in new fines for Twitter if it’s found to have violated its legal obligations, according to Jon Leibowitz, who was chair of the FTC at the time of Twitter’s original 2011 consent order.\n\nThe agency now has another opportunity to show the tech industry it is serious about holding platforms accountable, Leibowitz added, after officials opted not to name top Facebook execs including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg in the FTC’s $5 billion privacy settlement with that company in 2019.\n\n[I]f there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order. Jon Leibowitz, former chair of the FTC\n\n“One of the big disappointments in the Facebook order violation case was that the FTC let executives off the hook; they should’ve been named,” Leibowitz told CNN in an interview. “And if there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order.”\n\nTwitter told CNN its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, citing third-party audits filed to the agency under the 2011 consent order in which it said Zatko did not participate. Twitter also said it is in compliance with relevant privacy rules and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems.\n\nZatko’s allegations are based in part on a failure to grasp how Twitter’s existing programs and processes work to fulfill Twitter’s FTC obligations, the person familiar with his tenure told CNN, saying that misunderstanding has prompted him to make inaccurate claims about the company’s level of compliance.\n\nForeign threats\n\nTwitter is exceptionally vulnerable to foreign government exploitation in ways that undermine US national security, and the company may even have foreign spies currently on its payroll, the disclosure alleges.\n\nThe whistleblower report says the US government provided specific evidence to Twitter shortly before Zatko’s firing that at least one of its employees, perhaps more, were working for another government’s intelligence service. The report does not say whether Twitter was already aware or if it subsequently acted on the tip.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter's former chief technology officer, was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nLast year, prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Agrawal — then Twitter’s chief technology officer — proposed to Zatko that Twitter comply with Russian demands that could result in broad-based censorship or surveillance of the platform, Zatko alleges.\n\nThe disclosure does not provide details of Agrawal’s suggestion. Last summer, however, Russia passed a law pressuring tech platforms to open local offices in the country or face potential advertising bans, a move western security experts said was intended to give Russia greater leverage over US tech companies.\n\nWhile Agrawal’s suggestion was ultimately discarded, it was still an alarming sign of how far Twitter was willing to go in pursuit of growth, according to Zatko.\n\n“The fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on U.S. national security,” Zatko’s disclosure says.\n\nThe fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on US national security, From Zatko's disclosure\n\nZatko’s report is becoming public just two weeks after a former Twitter manager was convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi case underscores the gravity of the allegations Zatko now levels at Twitter. His report could further inflame bipartisan concerns in Washington about foreign adversaries and the cybersecurity threats they pose to Americans, ranging from the theft of US citizens’ data to manipulating US voters or stealing technology and trade secrets.\n\nTwitter did not respond to specific questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Musk element\n\nZatko’s disclosure comes at a particularly fortuitous moment for Musk, who is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Musk has accused Twitter of lying about the number of spam bots on its platform, an issue that he claims should let him terminate the deal.\n\nWhile the binding acquisition agreement that Musk signed with Twitter in April did not include any bot-related exemptions, the billionaire claims that the number of bots on the platform affect the user experience and that having more bots than previously known could therefore impact the company’s long-term value. After Musk moved to terminate the purchase, Twitter responded with a lawsuit alleging that he is using bots as a pretext to get out of a deal over which he now has buyers’ remorse following the recent market downturn, and asking a court to force him to close the deal. The case is set to go to trial in Delaware Chancery Court in October.\n\nTwitter employees walk by the company's headquarters in San Francisco. Glenn Chapman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUser numbers are vital information for any social media business, as advertising revenue depends on how many people could potentially see an ad. But figures about how many users a service has, or how many people actually view a given ad on a site, are notoriously unreliable throughout the tech and media industries due to manipulation and error.\n\nAlone among social media companies, Twitter reports its user numbers to investors and advertisers using a measurement it calls monetizable daily active users, or mDAUs. Its rivals simply count and report all active users; until 2019, Twitter had worked that way as well. But that meant Twitter’s figures were subject to significant swings in certain situations, including takedowns of major bot networks. So Twitter switched to mDAUs, which it says counts all users that could be shown an advertisement on Twitter – leaving all accounts that for some reason can’t, for instance because they’re known to be bots, in a separate bucket, according to Zatko’s disclosure.\n\nThe company has repeatedly reported that less than 5% of its mDAUs are fake or spam accounts, and a person familiar with the matter both affirmed that assessment to CNN this week and pointed to other investor disclosures saying the figure relies on significant judgement that may not accurately reflect reality. But Zatko’s disclosure argues that by reporting bots only as a percentage of mDAU, rather than as a percentage of the total number of accounts on the platform, Twitter obscures the true scale of fake and spam accounts on the service, a move Zatko alleges is deliberately misleading.\n\nZatko says he began asking about the prevalence of bot accounts on Twitter in early 2021, and was told by Twitter’s head of site integrity that the company didn’t know how many total bots are on its platform. He alleges that he came away from conversations with the integrity team with the understanding that the company “had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots,” in part because if the true number became public, it could harm the company’s value and image.\n\nJack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I’m still performing that mission. Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former Twitter head of security\n\nExperts on inauthentic behavior online say it can be difficult to quantify “bots” because there isn’t a widely agreed upon definition of the term, and because bad actors constantly change their tactics. There are also many harmless bots on Twitter (and across the internet), such as automated news accounts, and Twitter offers an opt-in feature to allow such accounts to transparently label themselves as automated. Twitter told CNN that the claim it doesn’t know how many bots are on its platform lacks context, reiterating that not all bots are bad and adding that to focus on the total number of bots on Twitter would include those the company may have already identified and taken action against. The company also does not believe it can catch every spam account on the platform, Twitter said, which is why it reports its less-than-5% figure, which reflects a manual estimate, in its financial filings.\n\nBut Zatko told CNN he thinks there would still be value in attempting to measure the total number of spam, false or otherwise potentially harmful automated accounts on the platform. “The executive team, the board, the shareholders and the users all deserve an honest answer as to what it is that they are consuming as far as data and information and content [on the platform … At least from my point of view, I want to invest in a company where I know what’s actually going on because I want to invest strategically in the long-term value of an organization,” he said.\n\nTwitter says that it allows bots on its platform, but its rules prohibit those that engage in spam or platform manipulation. But, as with all social media platforms’ rules, the challenge often lies in enforcing its policies.\n\nElon Musk is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe company says it regularly challenges, suspends and removes accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation, including typically removing more than one million spam accounts each day. Twitter said the total number of bots on the platform is not a useful number. The company declined to answer questions about the total number of accounts on the platform or the average number of new accounts added on the platform daily as context around its daily bot deletion figure.\n\nBut in casting doubt on Twitter’s ability to estimate the true number of fake and spam accounts, Zatko’s allegations could provide ammunition to Musk’s central claim that the figure is much higher than Twitter has publicly reported.\n\nBy going public, Zatko says, he believes he is doing the job he was hired to do for a platform he says is critical to democracy. “Jack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I’m still performing that mission,” he said.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy Brian Fung Zach Wasser Logan Whiteside", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy", "Brian Fung", "Zach Wasser", "Logan Whiteside"], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/komando/2023/04/30/how-enable-life-saving-settings-your-iphone-and-apple-watch/11747387002/", "title": "How to enable life-saving settings on your iPhone and Apple Watch", "text": "Kim Komando\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nI was a Boy Scouts leader (long story), so I know you always need to be prepared.\n\nOn your smartphone, the right apps can make a world of difference.

Kay Ivey will end the state’s participation in federal unemployment programs geared to the pandemic, including supplements to jobless benefits and a suspension of a work-search requirement. The state will withdraw from the program June 19, the governor’s office said in a statement Monday. Applications for the pandemic-related benefits will be processed until then. The decision means the state will withdraw from programs that provided an additional $300 weekly payment in unemployment insurance; extended benefits to self-employed, gig workers and part-time workers; extended benefits for those who’ve exhausted regular benefits; and provided an additional $100 benefit to people with mixed earnings. “Among other factors, increased unemployment assistance, which was meant to be a short-term relief program during emergency related shutdowns, is now contributing to a labor shortage that is compromising the continuation of our economic recovery,” Ivey said in a statement. Studies have suggested the increased unemployment benefit has not affected job searches. Economists and staffing officials say individuals caring for family members with illness or supervising children learning from home may be contributing to the shortage of workers for advertised positions.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Alaska House passed a version of the state operating budget Monday that leaves for later debate over how much to pay residents from the state’s oil-wealth fund for this year’s dividend. Time to resolve that debate is running out in the current legislative session, set to end May 19 unless lawmakers vote to give themselves up to an extra 10 days. The process is playing out later than usual: Often the House, which traditionally gets first dibs over the Senate on reworking the governor’s budget proposal, passes its version of the budget in March. But it took the House a month to organize after the session started in January. The bipartisan coalition in control of the House has the bare minimum needed for a majority, 21 members. Another factor has been funds from a federal pandemic relief aid package that the state is expecting. Guidance on use of the funds was released Monday. Jeff Turner, a spokesperson for Gov. Mike Dunleavy, said it will take time to review the material “and determine the best path forward.” Dunleavy had proposed an initial outline for the expected $1 billion. The House version of the budget proposed spending 70%; both proposals came before the guidelines were issued.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A legislator is likening state messages encouraging residents to get a COVID-19 shot to communism. COVID-19 vaccines are not mandatory in Arizona. But on digital billboards situated on state highways, the government has been urging residents to get vaccinated as a way of returning to normal life. State Sen. Kelly Townsend, R-Mesa, shared on social media last week that she thinks the signs are government overreach and similar to China, which has a one-party government – the Communist Party of China. “Want to return to normal? Get vaccinated,” says the digital billboard message that Townsend photographed and included in a tweet Thursday. “Seen in Communist China today,” Townsend wrote in the tweet accompanying the photo. “Oops, I mean Arizona.” The Oxford Dictionary defines “communism” as a political theory derived from Karl Marx that advocates class war leading to a society where property is publicly owned, and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: Tyson Foods says it’s raising wages to combat absenteeism and worker turnover at its plants as U.S. demand for chicken soars. The Springdale-based company, which processes 20% of U.S. beef, chicken and pork, said Monday that absentee rates are about 50% higher than they were before the pandemic. Government stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits have made it harder to keep some workers, the company said. Health concerns and child care issues have also been a factor. “It takes about six days right now to get five days’ worth of work done,” said Donnie King, Tyson’s chief operating officer, during a conference call Monday with investors. To combat COVID-19, Tyson began vaccinating workers in February through clinics at more than 100 sites. The company said Monday that it has vaccinated more than 42,000 employees, or about one-third of its workforce. Tyson said it’s also offering vaccines to team members’ families when possible. Tyson said it’s raising wages and implementing more flexible scheduling in order to keep its plants staffed. Executives did not elaborate on the percentage pay hikes workers were being given, and a company spokesman was unable to provide further details. “There’s not a magic bullet here. We’re looking at all kinds of things, trying to generate worker-driven solutions,” King said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Aided by an astonishing nearly $76 billion budget surplus, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday proposed tax rebates of up to $1,100 for millions of households and more than $7 billion to help people affected by the pandemic cover rent and utilities. It was Newsom’s first in a weeklong rollout of pandemic recovery proposals totaling $100 billion, which could boost his political fortunes as he faces a likely recall election later this year. His opponents accused him of pandering and said the state would be better served by broader tax reforms. “Direct stimulus checks going into people’s pockets and direct relief – that’s meaningful,” Newsom said from a community organization in a disadvantaged Oakland neighborhood. Under his plan, roughly 11 million low- and middle-income Californians would see direct, one-time payments. Taxpayers making between $30,000 and $75,000 a year would get a $600 payment. Households making up to $75,000 with at least one child would get an extra $500 payment. The proposal builds on earlier payments to the lowest-income Californians and immigrants who pay taxes but did not get federal stimulus payments, including those living in the country illegally. The projected $75.7 billion surplus is largely due to taxes paid by rich Californians who generally did well during the pandemic.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state already had some of the hottest real estate markets in the nation. Now, lumber prices – up 250% compared to a year ago – are contributing to a price surge that shows no sign of slowing. Predictions of a pandemic-related housing slowdown never came to pass. Instead, the opposite happened. “The combination of the lockdowns and more time spent at home made people realize they wanted to live in a home that met their evolving needs,” economist Ali Wolf, with the housing market research firm Zonda, told The Denver Post. By December, new home contract sales were 43% above the same period a year earlier, according to Zonda. Now, 86% of builders report major lumber supply disruptions, and 96% report recent price increases associated with lumber costs, according to Zonda. The lumber price surge is also affecting remodeling. Deborah Cowles, of Centennial, put off replacing an old fence during the coronavirus pandemic, only to have contractors increase their price quotes by $1,000 or more a year later. Contractors also couldn’t guarantee they could get the type of wood she wanted, Cowles said. “It’s really caught us off guard,” she said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont announced Monday that 71% of adult residents have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The state tops the nation when it comes to the percentage of fully vaccinated adults and is among the top five states in getting at least one shot in arms, the governor’s office said. About half of Connecticut’s 16- and 17 year-olds have gotten a shot, putting the vaccine rate for the total population at 57%, Lamont said. The numbers are much higher for those 45 and above (80%) and 65 and older (92%), he said. “What that means is that 45 and above, we’re very close to what they call herd immunity,” Lamont said. “I know that’s a moving target. But you add that 80% who have been vaccinated along with those who were previously infected over the last year or have some antibodies, we’re in pretty good shape.” The state did record 17 more COVID-19-related deaths over the weekend, bringing the total to 8,154 throughout the pandemic. But Lamont said hospitalizations fell by 29 patients to 280, the lowest total in more than seven months. He said that if the metrics continue to trend in the direction they are now going, Connecticut could be “back to normal” within a matter of months. “The fall, we’ll see if there are variants or anything that make us worry, but right now I think it’s a good summer,” he said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Firefly Music Festival is planning to reduce capacity by about half of the usual level to about 45,000 fans this fall, state officials said – a reduced capacity that would make it the smallest since the festival’s 2012 debut. But details about other possible COVID-19-related precautions and restrictions have largely been undecided. State health officials will begin the detailed planning process with festival organizers later this month. Firefly dropped its 93-act lineup Monday for the Sept. 23-26 camping-and-music event, featuring headliners Billie Eilish, The Killers, Tame Impala and Lizzo. The Delaware Division of Public Health’s Jamie Mack said he and other health experts will be examining several factors including the state’s vaccination rate, new coronavirus cases and hospitalizations when determining what precautions will be in place. With cases dropping – the state’s seven-day average of new cases has decreased 44% from 304 to 169 in the past month – there is reason to be hopeful. “Over the last couple of weeks, we’ve seen a lot of these factors moving in a positive direction, and we’re optimistic they will continue that way through the summer, especially as we see more people get vaccinated,” said Mack, the state’s environmental health director. Nearly 40% of the state is fully vaccinated.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The city is emerging from its pandemic quarantine. With coronavirus numbers dropping, officials in the nation’s capital have announced a reopening timeline that would see all indoor capacity limits eliminated by early June, but with mask requirements still in place. Mayor Muriel Bowser unveiled a two-stage plan Monday, with capacity restrictions on most indoor activities lifting May 21, with the exception of bars, nightclubs and entertainment venues. Those final categories would see their capacity limits removed by June 11. The two dates represent a pair of major crossroads moments for Washington, both for the daily lives of its residents and for its hospitality-heavy economy, driven by tourism and conventions. “We are quickly and enthusiastically approaching containment level of the virus in our jurisdiction,” said Health Department Director Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt. “But in the ensuing weeks, we continue to need to remain vigilant.” Virus metrics show daily case rates are down to levels not seen since last summer. Nesbitt said contract tracing for new cases “would remain a 24/7 operation.” Bowser also announced that the overflow field hospital that took over Washington’s convention center last year would be dismantled. “I’m grateful we never had to use it,” she said.\n\nFlorida\n\nNaples: The number of variant cases of the coronavirus is rising in Southwest Florida, heightening concern among some medical officials that there will be a summer spike. While the daily number of new COVID-19 cases is dropping, Florida still leads the nation in new infections as those caused by mutated strains of the coronavirus skyrocket, according to the latest reports from state health officials. The number of people in Florida infected with a variant strain of the virus increased 77% in the past three weeks, and the number of deaths nearly tripled to 73, state health officials report. Lee County has seen 204 variant cases; that’s up 26% from 162 cases since April 27, according to the latest state data through May 5. The county ranks 12th among the 67 counties in the state for its number of variant cases, the data shows. Collier County ranks 16th in the state with 153 variant cases, up 28% from 120 cases in late April. All but a handful of the Southwest Florida cases have been the B.1.1.7 strain out of the United Kingdom that is the dominant one among the six circulating in Florida. Of the 12,242 people in the state who have tested positive for one of the variants, 6,175 are in Palm Beach, Broward or Miami-Dade counties, the state’s three most populous counties.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: After announcing last week that he plans to require people receiving unemployment benefits to resume searching for work, the state’s labor commissioner now says he’s considering cutting federal benefits to the jobless in an effort to push them back into the workforce. Kersha Cartwright, a spokesperson for elected Republican Mark Butler, said Butler and Gov. Brian Kemp met Monday and discussed possibilities such as cutting the $300-a-week federal supplement to unemployed workers or cutting off special federal benefits to people not usually eligible for state unemployment. “I think the governor’s office and the commissioner are agreed that a major reduction in some programs, if not all programs, is needed,” Cartwright said. “Everything’s on the table for discussion.” Mallory Blount, a spokesperson for Kemp, said residents could “expect final decisions on timing and other specifics in the coming days.” Butler has the legal authority to reject the benefits but is consulting with Kemp. Butler could also decrease the amount of money someone can earn and still qualify for benefits. Butler set that amount at $300 a week when the pandemic began, meaning people who are working reduced hours can still qualify for the $300-a-week federal boost.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s vaccine passport program for interisland travel has begun. The program launch allows people who received their COVID-19 shots in Hawaii to skip coronavirus testing and quarantine rules for travel between the islands, Hawaii News Now reports. Officials have easy access to state vaccination records that can be quickly verified, so only those who have been fully vaccinated at clinics in the islands can participate. The governor said he hopes to open the program to out-of-state visitors and trans-Pacific travelers later this year. “We don’t have a firm timeline on trans-Pacific. The challenge is about verification – about vaccination done in other states,” Gov. David Ige said. “We’ve been working with a couple of other private-sector partners about working to get access to the state vaccination records, and we believe that that would help them to get vaccination records in other states as well.” People participating in the program must be more than two weeks out from their final COVID-19 vaccine shot. Health officials report about 40% of Hawaii’s population is fully vaccinated. Anyone flying into the state still has to produce a negative coronavirus test to bypass a 10-day quarantine rule.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will receive $1.1 billion in the latest round of coronavirus relief money in two separate payments, the U.S. Treasury Department announced Monday, with state officials saying the money could be used to substantially bolster water, sewer and broadband infrastructure. The $350 billion program is part of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that became law in March. Administration officials say payments could begin going out in the coming days. In addition to the money coming to the state, Idaho’s nine largest cities will get a total of $124 million, while 190 cities with populations of typically less than 50,000 will get $108 million. Counties will get another $314 million. The distribution is based on population. Alex Adams, Republican Gov. Brad Little’s budget chief, said his initial take on the announcement and a 150-page document outlining how the money can be spent contained two surprises. First, Adams said, is that the plan allows the money to be allocated by December 2024, with the projects complete by the end of 2026. The second surprise is that Idaho is getting about $90 million less than expected, apparently the result of its economy improving, as a portion of the federal money distribution is based on Idaho’s unemployment rate.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state, working with business and labor organizations, plans to offer COVID-19 vaccinations to workers at offices, officials announced Monday. The initiative is being prompted by the return to offices of thousands of workers forced home by the pandemic. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Monday that having vaccines available where people are working makes getting a shot very convenient. The effort will launch in mid-May with the opening of 10 vaccination sites in Chicago, Schaumburg and Rockford. The clinics, staffed by Walgreen pharmacists, offer two-dose vaccinations and will also take walk-ins. State officials are encouraging Illinois building operators interested in hosting additional clinics to contact the Illinois Department of Public Health directly or to contact the Building Owners and Managers Association. “With enhanced air quality and ventilation, advanced cleanliness procedures, and reconfigurations, our buildings have been prepared to welcome tenants back to the office for over a year,” Building Owners and Managers Association executive director Farzin Parang said in a statement. While announcing the vaccination plans at a Chicago bank, Pritzker acknowledged Illinois has reached a vaccination plateau, as most people eager to be vaccinated have already received their shots.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The city will remain under a mask mandate and other COVID-19 restrictions as local officials endorsed those measures after the Legislature nullified such orders previously issued by county health officers. The new state law that took effect immediately Monday allows local COVID-19 restrictions tougher than those issued statewide only upon approval of elected county commissioners or city councils. The Democratic-controlled Indianapolis council voted 19-5 along party lines Monday night to keep the mask mandate and rules that restrict restaurants to 75% indoor capacity and bars to 50% capacity. Democratic council member Maggie Lewis said it was important for the council to support Marion County’s health officer as the expert on what precautions should be taken. Republican legislators overrode a veto by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb to enact the new law, arguing that it provides a “check and balance” protecting the rights of business owners. Local elected officials must now endorse restrictions for other cities including South Bend, Elkhart and Bloomington that have been in place since Holcomb rescinded the statewide mask order in early April. County commissioners in northern Indiana’s Elkhart County have said they don’t intend to endorse the tougher rules ordered by the county health officer.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds announced Tuesday that Iowa will join a bevy of Republican-led states ending pandemic-related federal programs that give extra cash to unemployed workers. The state will end the federal boosts, including an additional $300-a-week unemployment payment, Reynolds said in a news release. That benefit was scheduled to run through early September. Reynolds said in the announcement that the benefits are causing a labor shortage in the state and hindering its economy. “Now that our businesses and schools have reopened, these payments are discouraging people from returning to work,” the Republican governor said. “Our unemployment rate is at 3.7%, vaccines are available to anyone who wants one, and we have more jobs available than unemployed people.” But supporters of the federal unemployment programs point to other factors, including parents who don’t have child care and people reluctant to take jobs in service industries that require contact with the public for fear of contracting COVID-19. The federal benefits will end June 12, Reynolds said. Regular, pre-pandemic unemployment benefits will remain available.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: More than 2 million COVID-19 shots have been administered in the state, officials reported Monday, as the federal government detailed plans to distribute nearly $1 billion in aid to Kansas’ cities and counties. The state health department said 39.5% of residents had received at least one vaccine dose. Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury Department spelled out for the first time how it would distribute a majority of the aid from a federal coronavirus relief measure that became law in March. The state will receive $1.6 billion from the allocation. Its 105 counties will receive a total of $566 million, distributed $194 per resident. Another $427 million go to cities, with 10 major cities sharing $260 million. Meanwhile, Kansas State University is altering its mask policy for outdoor settings, citing recent guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that Americans don’t need to cover their faces anymore when they’re outdoors unless they are in a big crowd. WIBW-TV reports that starting May 17, people who are fully vaccinated can participate in outdoor campus activities and recreation without a mask, except in crowded settings and venues. The university in Manhattan said masks still will be required in all indoor spaces on university property.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Starting May 28, bars and restaurants will no longer need to abide by a curfew, and bar seating will be allowed, Gov. Andy Beshear announced Monday. Bars and restaurants have had several curfews during the pandemic to help keep crowds down and COVID-19 at bay. In August, Beshear set a 10 p.m. last call curfew and closing time of 11 p.m. On Sept. 15, that curfew was moved to 11 p.m. with a closing time of midnight. In March, he announced a last call curfew of midnight and a closing time of 1 a.m. “I want everybody to remember that we have been and we’re going to be loosening these restrictions,” the Democratic governor said. “But be reasonable. ... Just because you can doesn’t mean you should. Look at your own facilities, look at the ability for air to move in and out, look at what your vaccination rates are in your county and what your incident rates are, and try to make good decisions. I know everybody wants to protect their clientele, those that they serve.” Also on May 28, maximum capacity for events with 1,000 or fewer people is increasing to 75%, and the limit is rising to 60% for more than 1,000.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Consumers could get wine shipped directly from manufacturers under a bill that narrowly won passage Monday in the state House. Current law prohibits wine manufacturers from shipping wine directly to a consumer unless the purchase is made in person at the winery, or unless the manufacturer doesn’t have a wholesale agreement to sell in the state through stores and other sites. Rep. Joseph Orgeron, R-Larose, said 44 other states allow similar direct shipments of wine without such conditions. He said his proposal would increase consumer access. Opponents suggest the change could damage wholesalers and the retailers that sell wine. Lawmakers sent the proposal to the Senate with a 53-40 vote – exactly the minimum it needed to pass. The vote was unanimous for a second alcohol measure that would let restaurants sell prepackaged, pre-measured, “ready-to-drink” alcoholic beverages for delivery. Rep. John Illg, R-River Ridge, said the measure would help the state’s ailing restaurant industry as it struggles to recover amid the pandemic. A 95-0 vote sent that bill to the Senate for debate.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A Republican lawmaker has been barred from inviting guests into the Maine State House after violating rules by hosting an out-of-state activist who spread conspiracy theories about the coronavirus. Rep. Shelley Rudnicki, of Fairfield, was disciplined by legislative leaders after bringing Naomi Wolf and a camera operator into the State House on April 28 while lawmakers were convened at the Augusta Civic Center, the Bangor Daily News reports. They approached Gov. Janet Mills’ office suite and were told to leave by the governor’s chief of staff. Wolf has been touring the country to advocate for the end of pandemic restrictions. She has questioned the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and suggested they could be used to implant microchips in people. The Legislative Council voted 6-4 to revoke Rudnicki’s guest privileges, and a letter from House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, a Democrat, said she “explicitly disregarded” the policy put in place during the pandemic. The policy, adopted in February, permits lawmakers to bring two constituents into the State House to meet in their offices as long as they check with staff to ensure space is free. Rudnicki said she has been trying to meet with Mills through other channels. She disagreed that Wolf should not be allowed in the building because she does not live in her district.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Businessman Mike Rosenbaum announced Tuesday that he’s seeking the Democratic nomination for governor. Rosenbaum, 49, is the founder of the companies Catalyte and Arena. He has focused on building systems using data to project how well people will perform in a specific position or company. He said Maryland needs a governor to build a more inclusive post-COVID-19 economy. Rosenbaum served in the U.S. State Department, where he worked on trade issues. He also served in the White House under former President Bill Clinton as an economist focusing on tech, labor, urban and rural policy for the Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Red Sox, Celtics and Bruins can now welcome more fans as the state continues to ease restrictions aimed at thwarting the spread of the coronavirus. Indoor and outdoor stadiums, arenas and ballparks, which had been limited to 12% capacity, are allowed to increase capacity to 25%. Amusement parks, theme parks and outdoor water parks are also allowed to welcome more visitors, up to 50% capacity, as long as they have a safety plan approved by the state Department of Public Health. Road races and other outdoor organized amateur or professional sporting events can also resume. Supermarkets and other retailers are no longer required to maintain special hours for seniors, and singing is allowed indoors with strict distancing requirements in place. Restrictions are being relaxed as more people get vaccinated against COVID-19. As of Sunday, more than 2.9 million people in Massachusetts had been fully vaccinated, according to the health department. More than 3.8 million residents have received at least first doses. To make getting a shot easier, the state will allow walk-up vaccinations at six mass vaccination sites.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state on Monday surpassed a 55% COVID-19 vaccination rate, reaching a milestone that will lead to the automatic easing of in-person work restrictions in two weeks. Employers currently must prohibit on-site work if employees’ jobs can feasibly be done remotely. The state anticipates lifting the rule May 24, said COVID-19 workplace safety director Sean Egan. The 55% benchmark is the first of four under a plan outlined by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer less than two weeks ago. “If you’ve gotten your safe, effective vaccine, thank you. And if you haven’t yet, I encourage you to speak to your doctor or your friends or family who’ve been vaccinated to learn about their experiences,” the Democrat said in a video. At a 60% vaccination rate, capacity at sports stadiums, banquet halls, conference centers and funeral homes will rise to 25% after two weeks – and 50% at gyms. Restaurants and bars will no longer have an 11 p.m. curfew. All indoor capacity limits will be lifted after 65% of eligible people have one shot, though social distancing will remain. At 70%, the state will rescind its mask and gatherings order and stop imposing broad mitigation measures barring unanticipated circumstances, such as vaccine-resistant coronavirus variants. The state could delay eased restrictions in regions with high case rates.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Suburban police are investigating the theft of COVID-19 vaccines after a man recorded and posted videos on social media of him walking away with vials of what he called “poison” and said he had plans to have the vaccines tested at a lab. Allina Health told police the man, who has been identified by law enforcement as Thomas Humphrey, took a vial of the Pfizer vaccine from a clinic in Oakdale on May 4 and left before officers arrived. The 32-year-old St. Paul man recorded the alleged theft, as well as one the next day at a CVS pharmacy, the location of which is not known, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. The videos were on Humphrey’s Facebook page early Monday, before they were either deleted or removed from public view. The videos generated hundreds of comments on Humphrey’s page. One of the videos shows him sitting down with a nurse at the Allina clinic, then grabbing the Pfizer vaccine before he stands up and yells at others not to get the vaccine because it would kill them. In the CVS pharmacy video, Humphrey takes a vial of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine from a box that a worker handed him, then walks out of the store, despite pleas from workers not to leave.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State legislators are not in session now, so it could be months before they start deciding how to spend $1.8 billion in the latest round of pandemic relief from the federal government. Mississippi will receive part of the money this year and the rest next year. “I think it’s going to take some time to fully inspect and understand what’s included,” Mississippi Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Briggs Hopson said Monday. The U.S. Treasury Department said state and local governments may use the money for public health, including efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. They may use it to address economic problems that the pandemic has caused for workers, households, small businesses, industries and government. They also may use some of the money to replace tax revenue that was lost because of the pandemic and to provide extra pay for essential workers. Other acceptable uses are for improvements to water and sewer systems and expansion of broadband access, the Treasury Department said. States are not allowed to use the money to cut taxes, shore up pension funds or rainy day funds, make payments on long-term debt or pay off legal settlements. Mississippi legislators’ next regular session begins in January. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves could call them into special session, if he wants.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt on Tuesday filed a lawsuit challenging St. Louis County’s COVID-19 restrictions, citing concerns about their impact on religion, education and the freedom of residents. The lawsuit filed in St. Louis County Circuit Court names Democratic County Executive Sam Page, the county’s health department and its director, Dr. Faisal Khan. It seeks an injunction to end the restrictions. “From requiring a mask outdoors to subjecting citizens to government pre-approval for private events, enough is enough,” Schmitt said in a news release. “The seemingly unending control over people’s lives must end. Vaccines are widely available to all adults – it’s past time for St. Louis County to lift these restrictions, and that’s why I filed suit today.” Page’s spokesman, Doug Moore, said litigation related to public health orders is common across the country, “and St. Louis County has been successful in defending every legal challenge around public health orders. Our legal foundation is sound.” The lawsuit is the latest of several filed by Schmitt, who announced in March that he will seek the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate in 2022. His announcement came weeks after incumbent Republican Sen. Roy Blunt announced he would not seek reelection.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The state on Tuesday reported 167 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of active cases to 1,028. There have been 1,593 deaths from COVID-19 and 107,486 recoveries. Hospitals across Montana have 69 COVID-19 patients out of 5,122 total hospitalizations for the disease since the pandemic began. The state administered 2,764 new coronavirus tests since Monday. Cascade County on Tuesday reported 36 new cases. The county has administered 50,691 total doses of COVID-19 vaccine, and 24,276 residents have been fully immunized. Great Falls Public Schools as of Monday had 17 active COVID-19 cases. The state has administered 750,025 doses of COVID-19 vaccine, and 352,991 Montanans have been fully immunized. Gallatin County reported 37 new cases, Yellowstone County reported 29, Lewis and Clark added 11, and Flathead County added six.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The pace of vaccinations in the state has slowed significantly over the past month. The state said 49,016 COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered in Nebraska last week. That continues the steady decline seen in recent weeks, when roughly 70,000 and 93,000 doses were administered. The latest weekly total of vaccine doses is less than one-quarter of the mid-April peak of 211,057 doses in a single week. Health officials said 49.9% of the state’s population over the age of 16 has now been vaccinated, and 1.55 million doses have been administered statewide since December. But demand for the shots has weakened across the state. The state reported 411 new coronavirus cases and one death Tuesday to give Nebraska a total of 221,911 cases and 2,247 deaths since the pandemic began. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska decreased over the past two weeks, going from 317.00 new cases per day April 25 to 182.14 new cases per day Sunday.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The casino long known as the Stratosphere announced Monday that it has lifted most coronavirus pandemic restrictions and moved to 100% capacity on its casino floor after meeting Nevada Gaming Control Board requirements. STRAT Hotel, Casino & SkyPod owner Golden Entertainment Inc. said it provided COVID-19 vaccinations at on-site casino clinics for employees and their families. Property Vice President and General Manager Stephen Thayer said masks still will be required for workers and guests at the iconic tallest tower on Las Vegas Boulevard. Golden Entertainment bought the 2,427-room STRAT in late 2017 and has been renovating the 25-year-old property. The tower is 1,149 feet high and features sightseeing, a restaurant with a 360-degree rotating dining room and several thrill rides. The Wynn Las Vegas, Encore and Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas got approval last week from regulators to lift capacity and physical distancing limits and remove clear plastic separators from gambling tables. They showed the Gaming Control Board that at least 80% of their employees had received at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A recent COVID-19 outbreak at the Sullivan County nursing home has led some officials to consider compensation changes for staff and mandatory vaccinations for employees. The outbreak, which started last month, has affected staff and residents at the home in Unity, including some who were fully vaccinated. Last year, the county instituted a compensation program for employees in quarantine, paying them two-thirds of wages for a missed day of work. The Eagle Times reports that under a new proposal, only vaccinated employees will still be eligible for this compensation, said Derek Ferland, county manager. Unvaccinated employees who contract the coronavirus will have to use their sick or vacation days to continue getting paid. “It’s not that we’re trying to be mean about it,” Ferland said. “(But) as long as there are hosts, the virus continues to do its thing. And the number of hosts is directly proportional to the number of people who are not vaccinated.” Currently, 92% of the county home’s residents and 75% of staff are fully vaccinated.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s daily rate of COVID-19 vaccinations has plummeted so much in recent weeks that it’s casting doubt on whether Gov. Phil Murphy will meet his goal to fully vaccinate 4.7 million adults by the end of June, and he says bribing residents to get a shot isn’t out of the question. New Jersey needs to administer 280,000 first doses each week in May to reach its goal, which is key to ushering in a return to normalcy this summer, said Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli. But in the first seven days of May, only 121,000 first doses of Pfizer and Moderna were administered, according to a review of state data. That represents a 64% decline from the first week of April, when 340,000 first doses were administered. “We’re going to have to scrap to get there, almost certainly,” Murphy said of his goal at a briefing Monday. NJ Transit unveiled a plan last week to offer two free round-trip rides to vaccination sites. More than 30 breweries are offering a free beer to those who get their shots in May. And in what may be the most lucrative incentive, Rowan University in South Jersey took the unprecedented step last week of giving vaccinated students $1,000 off their fall tuition and housing bills. “Are we willing to bribe people to get vaccinated? Everything is on the table,” Murphy said Monday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Transportation officials say roadside litter has become a persistent issue for the state, compounded by new types of debris amid the pandemic, so they’re reviving the “Toss No Mas” campaign with a new twist. State Transportation Secretary Mike Sandoval said Monday that his agency has nearly 900 boots on the ground picking up trash and debris year-round. The day after a stretch of road is cleaned, he said, new trash shows up. “During the pandemic, the problem seemed to get worse. PPE was found everywhere,” he said, referring to personal protective equipment used to curb the spread of the coronavirus. “We are asking for everyone’s help.” The campaign will include the messages “Can the Trash” and “Tie it. Tarp it. Pick it up.” Officials said they found that the largest litter accumulations come from people not tying up their garbage bags, tarping their loads, or picking up dropped debris or litter. The “Toss No Mas” campaign was created in the ’90’s by Cooney-Watson Productions. Santa Fe songwriter Jim Terr wrote a memorable song with an anti-litter public service message. Taos musician Michael Hearne was then brought on to sing a soulful version of the song, and it became a well-known anthem across New Mexico. The modernization of the campaign includes a new jingle for the radio.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: As the pace of vaccinations has slowed, officials are trying a mix of mandates and incentives to overcome hesitancy, including free subway rides. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state can’t mandate COVID-19 vaccines until they get full approval from the federal government. If that happens, New York will require students of the state’s and New York City’s public university and college systems to get vaccinated to attend in-person classes this fall, Cuomo said in a Monday press conference in New York City. “If you must have a vaccine, get it now,” Cuomo said. “If you have to get it anyway.” And anyone who gets vaccinated at one of six New York City subway stations from Wednesday through Sunday will receive a free seven-day MetroCard, New York City Transit Interim President Sarah Feinberg said. Feinberg said subway ridership reached a recent high of 2.23 million riders Friday. The Long Island Railroad and Metro-North are also offering vaccination sites at two stations in Ossining and Hempstead. Those who get inoculated can receive two free one-way trips. Cuomo and transit officials said they hope pop-up sites will increase vaccination rates and ease riders’ minds as New York City’s subways prepare to resume 24/7, around-the-clock operations next Monday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: State House members on Monday approved a plan to curb the governor’s ability to mandate COVID-19 vaccines through executive action – a power Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has shown no desire to exercise. The measure put forward by Rep. Keith Kidwell, R-Beaufort, would also bar state public health authorities and licensing agencies from requiring North Carolinians to get vaccinated in order to obtain a license. It’s perhaps the most mild of a string of anti-vaccination proposals brought forward by Republican state lawmakers. The measure passed 75-38 with support from 10 Democrats and all GOP members present and now heads to the Senate. Cooper has strongly encouraged residents to get vaccinated but has been reluctant to mandate it or turn it into a hot-button political issue. He and his health secretary, Dr. Mandy Cohen, have instead promoted a message of a quicker return to summer activities once more people get vaccinated. They have also vowed to ease pandemic restrictions, such as the indoor mask mandate, once two-thirds of adults in the state have gotten at least one COVID-19 dose. Still, some GOP lawmakers say they wish Kidwell’s proposal would have gone further, preventing schools and child care facilities from requiring the vaccines.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum announced Monday that the state will terminate its participation in the federal government’s pandemic-related unemployment assistance programs, effective June 19. Burgum said in a statement that ending the $300 weekly federal supplemental benefit is meant “to help address the ongoing workforce shortage across the state.” North Dakota had 16,396 online job openings in April, which was nearly 50% more than the same period in 2020 and represents the state’s largest number of online job openings since July 2015, according to Job Service North Dakota. Burgum said more than 8,300 people are claiming unemployment benefits under the programs North Dakota is terminating June 19. He said the programs have paid out more than $700 million in unemployment benefits, though 29% of federal program claimants live out of state. “Federal funds provided a safety net to our unemployed workers during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and now that open jobs are surpassing pre-pandemic levels, we believe that reemployment is the best recovery plan for North Dakota‘s economic health,” said Bryan Klipfel, executive director of Job Service North Dakota.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state will receive nearly $5.4 billion in aid as part of Democratic President Joe Biden’s larger $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, with another nearly $6.6 billion going directly to counties, cities and townships, the U.S. Treasury Department said Monday. Thirty-seven cities and townships and all 88 counties will receive the payments. State and local governments can use the money for relief from the public health crisis. The funding also can be used to offset harm to workers, small businesses and affected industries; to invest in water, sewer and broadband systems; and to replace lost public-sector revenue, according to guidance from the Treasury Department. Essential workers also can qualify for premium pay under the program. What officials can’t do with the money is use it to cut taxes, pay down debt or bolster the state rainy day fund. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, a Republican, called Treasury’s directives on the money akin to “fantasy fiction.” GOP Gov. Mike DeWine has recommended to the Legislature using a portion of its the relief dollars to pay off the unemployment compensation insurance loan the state owes to the federal government. Under Treasury guidelines, states can use the money to replenish their unemployment insurance trust funds up to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials are preparing to offer COVID-19 shots to adolescents, now that children ages 12 through 15 can qualify for the Pfizer vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine for use in that age group Monday afternoon. Before shots begin, a federal vaccine advisory committee will meet to discuss whether to endorse the move, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will decide whether to adopt the committee’s recommendation, according to the Associated Press. Once approval is official, the Oklahoma State Health Department plans to be able to start giving vaccinations to children in that age group immediately, said Keith Reed, deputy commissioner of health. The state will turn on registration access for the younger age group through the state vaccine scheduling portal once the federal vaccine advisory committee makes its recommendation to the CDC, Reed said. Some individual providers, like Clyde Pharmacy in Oklahoma City, are already scheduling appointments for teens in anticipation of the vaccine being approved for the younger age group. The Oklahoma City-County Health Department plans to work with Oklahoma City Public Schools to survey families about how and whether they plan to vaccinate their children.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: The University of Oregon and Western Oregon University say students will be required to get COVID-19 vaccines by this fall, joining other colleges in the Northwest that have made the same announcement. “The requirement will help us to reach the highest level of protection possible, reduce infections and protect the health and safety of our university community and the communities we serve. Individuals will be able to request exemptions for medical and non-medical reasons,” the University of Oregon said in a tweet Monday. The state’s flagship public university, located in Eugene, has about 18,000 undergraduate students. Meanwhile, WOU officials announced during a virtual session Monday that vaccinations will be required for students and employees who either study or work in person at the university’s Monmouth or Salem campuses for the fall term. Oregon State University is among the other institutions of higher education that will require COVID-19 vaccinations this fall.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: As the Philadelphia Flyers put shots on goal Monday night, they were also pushing shots into arms. The Flyers and Penn Medicine teamed up to offer COVID-19 vaccines to fans attending Monday’s regular season finale against the New Jersey Devils at Wells Fargo Center. Anyone getting the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine also received a voucher for two free tickets to a Flyers game next season. Meanwhile, about 750,000 Pennsylvania children are expected to become eligible for Pfizer’s COVID-19 shot after U.S. regulators expanded the use of the two-dose vaccine to 12- to 15-year-olds, state health officials said Tuesday. Health providers in Pennsylvania could begin vaccinating people in that age group later this week after a federal vaccine advisory committee signs off as expected. The state Health Department said vaccine providers should follow their existing policies for vaccinating minors, which requires parental consent in Pennsylvania. The administration of Gov. Tom Wolf has said it will lift a statewide mask mandate once at least 70% of adult residents are fully vaccinated. Statewide, about 45.6% of people age 18 and older had been fully vaccinated as of Tuesday, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state expects to start offering Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine to children ages 12 to 15 later this week now that the Food and Drug Administration has authorized its use for that age group, state officials said Tuesday. The announcement came during a news conference at Rhode Island Hospital to celebrate the fact that more than 1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the state. The state’s first vaccine against the disease caused by the coronavirus was given at the hospital in mid-December. “I don’t think anyone would have ever thought on Dec. 14 that we would have 1 million shots in the arms on May 11,” Gov. Daniel McKee said. Eligible children, with parental consent, were expected to be able to sign up for a shot at the state’s current vaccination sites later Tuesday, and there are also plans to bring vaccination clinics to schools, officials said. “We are so excited that we can expand to this younger age,” said Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott, director of the state Department of Health. “Because children could not get vaccinated and because we are seeing these more contagious variants of COVID-19, we have seen an increase in our proportion of cases in children. So the timing right now is perfect.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state and local governments are getting nearly $2.5 billion in new federal coronavirus aid, as South Carolina begins to phase out a different federal jobless benefit the governor says is disincentivizing people to return to the workplace. The funds announced this week are part of a $350 billion allocation being distributed to state and local governments, a piece of President Joe Biden’s larger $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that became law in March. All of South Carolina’s 46 counties and some cities will get the money, which could soon begin arriving in state and local hands, according to the White House. Treasury Department guidance listed broad categories for spending the funds, like public health costs, or offsetting harm from the downturn to workers, small businesses and affected industries. Money can also replace lost public sector revenues and be invested in water, sewer and broadband internet. The distribution comes as South Carolina phases out its participation in another federal coronavirus aid component. Last week, Gov. Henry McMaster announced that, beginning June 30, the state will opt out of the federal unemployment programs that have been providing extra money to jobless residents, in light of “unprecedented” workforce shortages across the state.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The average number of new coronavirus infections in the state fell to its lowest level since July, with 125 new cases reported Tuesday. Those cases were recorded over the weekend and brought the seven-day average to 66 cases per day, the lowest number since July 25. No new deaths were reported, leaving the statewide total of people who have died with COVID-19 at 1,981. Minnehaha County residents accounted for 26 new infections. Lincoln County had 13 positive cases. Brown County reported 10 new infections and Codington County four. Active infections decreased to 1,100 as the state reported an additional 236 people recovered from COVID-19. The number of people in state hospital beds with COVID-19 fell to 66. Of those, 21 were receiving intensive care, and 15 were on ventilators. Out of the 123,435 people in the state who have tested positive for the virus, about 6% have received hospital care. A total of 335,301 people in the state have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine through the South Dakota Department of Health’s immunization program and the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program. That number does not include immunizations through Indian Health Service or Veterans Affairs.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state is withdrawing from a $300 weekly unemployment supplement program, a decision by Gov. Bill Lee that comes as many Republicans argue the additional funds allow low-wage workers to make more money while staying at home. Lee informed the U.S. Department of Labor of the decision Tuesday, joining several other Southern states in refusing the additional payments for unemployed people. “We will no longer participate in federal pandemic unemployment programs because Tennesseans have access to more than 250,000 jobs in our state,” Lee said in a statement about the decision. The federal unemployment assistance programs will end July 3, Lee wrote to Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh. Tennessee pays up to $275 weekly for unemployed individuals, ranking it among the lowest in the country and significantly below the national average of $387. Combined with the current $300 federal supplement – a drop from a $600 a week offered last year – Tennesseans receiving unemployment benefits are now receiving about $575 weekly, the equivalent of $14.38 per hour for a 40-hour week. The federal minimum wage, which hasn’t been raised in more than a decade, is $7.25 per hour, though many argue a living wage would be in the $15-$20 range.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state House gave final approval Tuesday to a bill that would curb the governor’s powers during a pandemic, a response to criticism from both Republicans and Democrats over Gov. Greg Abbott’s use of disaster powers during the coronavirus pandemic. The Pandemic Response Act, approved 104-39, would create an oversight committee with powers to strike down any order, waiver or suspension. It now heads to the Senate. “We must now take what we have learned this past year in dealing with a pandemic and set a different framework in dealing with future pandemics,” Rep. Dustin Burrows, R-Lubbock, an author of the bill, told members as he introduced the legislation Monday evening. “As a baseline in a pandemic, you will not government your way out of it. Government does not have the solutions and doesn’t have the expertise to find all the solutions to fix all the problems.” Under the bill, the governor would still have the ability to suspend state laws and trump decisions by local officials, which kept some Democrats from voting in favor of the bill. Abbott has received criticism from Democrats and local officials throughout the pandemic for not giving mayors and county judges more authority to issue their own orders, including the ability to mandate masks and reduce occupancy rates at businesses.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Head Start, a free, federally funded program that promotes early childhood development and education for low-income families, is expanding its presence to the St. George area thanks to a local family. SUU Head Start is affiliated with Southern Utah University and helps low-income families prepare their children for kindergarten. Even those who don’t meet the low-income bracket can use the program for free. SUU Head Start offers preschool services in Beaver, Iron, Millard and Washington counties, with a history in Cedar City that goes back about 30 years and about 15 years in St. George. But Head Start had to leave its old River Road location and hasn’t been back in St. George for a few years, said Tina Baker, the local Head Start Enrollment and Recruitment specialist. As a federally funded program, Head Start can’t own its buildings, so it relies on others in the community to help. So members of the local Staheli family volunteered to build Head Start its own place at a new site located in Washington City at the Staheli Cottontown Village. The pandemic posed an issue for some of the families who use the program in Cedar City. “We had to go virtual, but it’s so important to have that connection,” Baker said.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: With new precautions in place and after a sharply curtailed 2020 season, sailors and paddlers of all ages and skill levels can once again converge at the Community Sailing Center. A phased reopening has been announced, in accordance with pandemic precautions. For another few days, the action is only open to high school racing teams, the nonprofit reported. Sailing camps and “floating classrooms” begin this week; the introductory “First Sails” program casts off in mid-June. Adult group activities and courses will gradually be reintroduced over the summer, catching a full wind by July 12. Schedules and programming follow or exceed current state health guidelines and are subject to changes, the center said. Among the new rules: Pickups and drop-offs will be staggered. Everyone must wear a mask at all times through June 18. And all adults must wear masks through July 11. In addition to its new schedule, the center announced this year its first-ever Sailing Diversity Access scholarships for 10 campers whose racial or ethnic background has historically excluded them from the sport.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Taxpayers have just days left to file their individual income taxes with the state. The filing and payment deadline for submitting tax returns is Monday, May 17. The typical May 1 deadline was extended this year to match the new Internal Revenue Service deadline for federal tax filings. Tax Commissioner Craig Burns said in a news release that the state is encouraging taxpayers to file electronically and request refunds via direct deposit. It typically takes up to four weeks to process an electronically filed return and up to eight weeks to process a paper return. State officials said that this year, due to COVID-19 protocols, it will likely take even longer for a paper return to move through the system. For those who miss the filing deadline, Virginia has an automatic, six-month filing extension. No application is required. Taxpayers still need to pay any taxes owed on time to avoid additional penalties and interest.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Seattle-Tacoma International Airport is piloting a new virtual queuing program and touchless check-in kiosk system in order to streamline the travel experience, improve physical distancing and reduce congestion at peak travel times. The new SEA Spot Saver program will allow travelers to make digital reservations for Transportation Security Administration general screening security checkpoints either at their terminal or 24 hours ahead of the flight online. Once in the virtual queue, passengers can drop off bags, grab a coffee or say goodbye to loved ones while awaiting a notification that it’s their turn for screening, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports. The new service, free for all passengers, will only be available at at checkpoints 2 and 5 from 4 a.m. to noon daily. At checkpoint 2, passengers will scan a QR code with their phone and follow text message prompts that will give them their estimated wait time. At checkpoint 5, Alaska Airlines passengers can either sign up ahead of time online or on site for a screening appointment. The program can serve up to 50% of passengers going through general security screening, airport officials said. Sea-Tac is one of the first in the country to test the new queuing technology. The pilot program will run through Aug. 31.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University is holding its Jazz Camp through virtual sessions again this year, for students ages 13 and up. Jazz-MU-Tazz camp is usually a six-day camp for high school musicians, but due to the coronavirus pandemic and safety guidelines, the university said the sessions will be offered virtually at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily. The sessions will be livestreamed through the Marshall University Jazz Facebook page. The event will be held June 14-18. The university’s jazz studies program hosts the camp. Topics to be covered include jazz improvisation, jazz theory, listening skills and instrument/section master classes by members of the Marshall jazz faculty. Registration is $75. Students can register online.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state will receive $700 million less than initially expected in federal coronavirus relief money, and it will arrive in two payments a year apart – news that Gov. Tony Evers and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said Tuesday was problematic. The state was informed Monday of the split in payments and the total it would receive. Evers and Baldwin asked U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday to reconsider breaking the funding into two. “This will significantly reduce the funding that will be available for Wisconsin’s current pandemic response operations and to continue to meet immediate needs and restore economic well-being,” Baldwin and Evers wrote. The Democratic governor has emphasized wanting to spend the money quickly to help those most hurt by the pandemic. He has cited that desire for speed in vetoing GOP-authored bills that dictated how the money would be spent. The governor has sole authority in deciding how to spend the money. Republicans who control the Legislature have called on Evers to meet with them to discuss how the money should be spent. Rep. Mark Born, co-chairman of the Legislature’s budget committee, renewed that call Tuesday.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Officials in the Natrona County School District have asked the state health department to exempt it from a requirement that masks be worn in K-12 schools, the Casper Star-Tribune reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/26/medal-push-prince-fbi-bus-driver-livestreaming-news-around-states/119083930/", "title": "Medal push for Prince, FBI bus driver: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDecatur: A man being booked into jail wound up at a hospital rather than behind bars after a scan revealed a shotgun shell in his abdomen. Prisoners entering the Morgan County Jail routinely undergo a body scan when being admitted, and a recent image showed what appeared to be a shell from a .410-gauge shotgun that had been swallowed inside a person, spokesperson Mike Swafford said Thursday. “He was never booked in,” Swafford said. “When our medical staff saw that, they said, ‘He has to go to the hospital.’ ” The man, who had been arrested by another law enforcement agency in the county, was later released on his own recognizance, Swafford said, and it was not clear what happened to the shell. Authorities did not release the person’s name or the reason for the arrest. The Morgan County Sheriff’s Department posted an image of the scan on its social media account to let people know about the screening process at the jail, Swafford said. While baggies or other containers holding drugs are sometimes uncovered inside prisoners, he said, finding ammunition was unusual. “We don’t see a shotgun shell very often,” he said. “We speculate it had drugs in it, but we don’t really know.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Officials at museums across the state have condemned repeated acts of antisemitic vandalism this year targeting the Alaska Jewish Museum in Anchorage. During instances in May and September, someone placed swastika stickers on the building or carved the symbol associated with the Nazis into the museum door, the Juneau Empire reports. “Alaskan museums are appalled by the attacks, and they are eager to show support for the Alaska Jewish Museum and the Alaska Jewish Campus as they seek to address these crimes and ensure the safety of their facilities and community,” Dixie Clough, director of statewide museum association Museums Alaska, said in a statement. The September acts of vandalism came as the Anchorage Assembly held public hearings about instituting a mask mandate for 60 days as COVID-19 cases spiked. Many opponents packed the Assembly chamber to protest, including some wearing yellow Star of David stickers, similar to the patches Holocaust victims wore, to compare the mandate to what Jews faced under the Nazi regime in Germany. Anchorage Mayor Dave Bronson, who opposes all COVID-19 mandates, initially defended the use of the stars but apologized the next day, saying that “I understand that we should not trivialize or compare what happened during the Holocaust to a mask mandate.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A new organization calling itself a nonpartisan school board association is headed by GOP activists, including the first vice chair and treasurer of the Republican Party of Arizona, as well as the daughter of the chairwoman. The Arizona Coalition of School Board Members was launched Oct. 12 as an alternative to the Arizona School Boards Association, with the goal of fostering “a public education environment in Arizona that prioritizes freedom in education, parental rights and educational excellence,” the Arizona Capitol Times reports. “For too long, school board members in Arizona have been left without a choice,” the coalition’s announcement video said. Currently, every school district in the state is a member of ASBA, which dates back more than 70 years and provides advocacy, legal resources and training for member districts. But some parents and conservative groups have voiced opposition to ASBA in recent years over the organization’s positions on issues like Empowerment Scholarship Accounts and, more recently, “critical race theory” and the handling of COVID-19. For instance, ASBA is currently a plaintiff in a case before the Arizona Supreme Court challenging Arizona’s mask mandate ban and other Republican policies tucked into this year’s budget reconciliation bills.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Supreme Court on Thursday said the endorsement required for a casino license must come from elected local officials in office at the time of the application, a key victory for the Cherokee Nation’s efforts to build a casino in the state. Justices upheld an Arkansas law and state Racing Commission rule on the requirement, reversing a lower court’s decision that they were unconstitutional. Voters in 2018 approved an amendment requiring the state to allow four casinos. Since then, casinos have opened at racetracks in Hot Springs, West Memphis and Pine Bluff. One of the applicants for the casino, Mississippi-based Gulfside Casino Partnership, submitted its application in 2019 with a letter of support from Pope County’s former judge. Oklahoma-based Cherokee Nation Businesses submitted an application with the county’s current judge. “Today’s ruling is exciting and greatly appreciated,” former Attorney General Dustin McDaniel, legal counsel for Cherokee Nation Businesses, said in a statement. “I know CNB is ready to put an end to litigation and start building. We anticipate CNB’s license will be issued as soon as the mandate is effective, and we will work quickly to bring final resolution to any remaining lawsuits.” Gulfside, however, said the legal fight over the license was not yet over.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThree Rivers: In the wake of California wildfires, upward of 10,000 trees weakened by fires, drought, disease or age must be removed – work that will keep a nearby highway closed to visitors who seek the world’s two largest sequoia trees. The hazard trees could potentially fall onto people and cars on the section of State Route 180 known as Generals Highway, or they could create barriers for emergency and fire response, the Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks said Friday. The highway is closed due to the KNP Complex blaze, which was 60% contained after burning 138 square miles of forest, and will remain blocked off to visitors after the fire is out while saw crews cut down trees and trim branches. The road connects Giant Forest – home to the General Sherman Tree, considered the world’s largest by volume – and Grant Grove, home to the General Grant Tree, the second-largest tree in the world. The trees along the highway include sequoias, pine and conifer trees, said fire spokeswoman Kimberly Caschalk. The KNP Complex has been burning since Sept. 9, and forest officials said earlier this month that it may have killed hundreds of giant sequoias, but the full extent of the damage has not been determined. Firefighters took extraordinary measures to protect the most notable trees. Forest staff unwrapped the base of General Sherman on Friday.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A private ranch with ponds, springs and rare wetland plants will be part of a new state park, Sweetwater Lake. Joined by state and federal parks officials Wednesday, Gov. Jared Polis announced the 488-acre ranch near Sweetwater Lake, in a mountainous northwestern county that borders Utah, will also become part of the White River National Forest. The ranch land near the Flat Tops mountain range was acquired in the federal park service’s Land and Water Conservation Fund purchase Aug. 31. The area was among the federal program’s top-priority purchases to increase public recreation and protect the area’s wildlife, cultural and scenic values, the governor’s office said in a statement. In an effort to increase the area’s public recreation, a new boat launch will be available next June. The state also plans to consult with the public and develop a long-term plan to expand and manage recreational activities while preserving the undeveloped nature of the property, Polis said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont has submitted a request for a major disaster declaration to the Biden administration, seeking federal funds to help the state recover from damage caused by the remnants of Hurricane Ida. The Sept. 1 storm dumped as much as 8 inches of rain on parts of Connecticut, resulting in heavy flooding and an estimated $7.2 million in damage to homes, businesses and infrastructure, Lamont said. It also resulted in the death of State Police Sgt. Brian Mohl, whose vehicle was swept away in floodwaters. Lamont’s request would allow homeowners in Fairfield and New London counties, as well residents of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation and the Mohegan Tribal Nation, to receive federal reimbursements for the costs of uninsured damage to their housing and personal property. According to Lamont’s request, just 8% of damaged homes in New London County and 23% in Fairfield County had flood insurance. The proposed declaration also would allow municipalities in Fairfield and Middlesex counties to receive up to 75% federal reimbursement of the costs of uninsured damage to roads and other infrastructure, as well as costs for emergency response. The governor’s office said public assistance damage assessments in Litchfield, New Haven and New London counties had not yet been completed.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A federal lawsuit has been filed against a police officer seen on social media repeatedly slamming a man’s head during an arrest last month inside a convenience store. In addition to using “excessive force,” the lawsuit filed in Wilmington’s U.S. District Court claims Patrolman Samuel Waters used a racial slur when arresting 44-year-old Dwayne Brown, who is Black. Waters is white. “Such racial statements are reflective of his state of mind and discriminatory intent in this incident,” says the lawsuit, filed by the Jacobs & Crumplar Law Firm. The Wilmington Police Department, which placed Waters on administrative duty as video of the Sept. 21 incident went viral, could not be immediately reached for comment Monday. The agency has said its Office of Professional Standards immediately launched an investigation into what the video captured. Wilmington Police Department has not released the officer’s name but said he has been on the force for three years. The lawsuit, which only names Waters as a defendant, claims Brown’s constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable seizures guaranteed to him by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments were violated. Earlier this month, civil rights activists called for Waters’ firing and arrest.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In an effort to relieve some of the frustration caused by Metro’s rail service reduction, Capital Bikeshare is offering free 30-day memberships to D.C. residents, WUSA-TV reports. Residents can go on the Capital Bikeshare or Lyft Mobile apps and, under the “Ride Plans” section, select “Pricing” to choose a 30-day membership for $0. Users need a valid credit card and phone number to register. Riders will be able to take unlimited free, 45-minute rides on the red classic Capital Bikeshare bikes with no unlocking or travel fee. Longer rides will cost $0.05 per minute for a pedal bike and $0.10 per minute on e-bike rides. “The service disruptions at Metro are deeply troubling for D.C. and the region,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said. “D.C. is open, and we need a fully functioning transit system to get workers, students and visitors across the city. We have been intentional, over the past several years, about making Capital Bikeshare more accessible and convenient for D.C. residents, and now we are proud to be able to offer this free one-month membership to every Washingtonian who might need it.” Capital Bikeshare has more than 5,000 bikes available at over 650 stations in the region. That includes a 20-bicycle pilot of new adaptive bikes for people with disabilities.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: The names of three police officers involved in the fatal shooting of a knife-wielding man won’t be released because they’ve invoked their right to remain anonymous under a 2018 amendment to the state’s constitution. The West Palm Beach officers were trying to take Allan Lorenzo Robb, 33, into custody early Oct. 17 when he showed the knife. One of the officers fatally shot Robb after “less lethal” weapons used by two other officers were ineffective, officials said. The police department cited Marsy’s Law as the reason to keep the officers’ names private. The voter-approved Marsy’s Law allows crime victims or their families to request their names be withheld from public documents. A state appeals court ruled in April that the amendment could be used to shield the identities of law enforcement officers involved in use-of-force incidents. Since the ruling, the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, the Boynton Beach Police Department and the Boca Raton Police Department have cited the amendement in such cases. The three officers have been placed on administrative leave while the Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigate the shooting.\n\nGeorgia\n\nDublin: Federal prosecutors say more than $57,000 in pandemic relief funding was spent on one Pokemon card. Court records show a Dublin man is charged with lying on an application for an economic relief loan about the number of people his business employed and the company’s gross revenue. He faces one count of wire fraud. According to the court filing, he received $85,000 in August 2020 and used the money to buy a Pokemon card for $57,789. The Telegraph reports defense lawyers issued a statement declining to talk about the case. Rare Pokemon cards can sell for thousands of dollars. Collectors have been bidding up prices for trading cards, video games and other mementos. Dublin, a city of about 16,000 people, is located about 130 miles southeast of Atlanta.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: More than half of first responders who applied for exemptions from the city’s vaccine mandate cited religion as their reason for not getting inoculated against COVID-19. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports 57% of all exemption requests among first responders pointed to faith. The city requires all government employees to be vaccinated unless an exemption is granted. Exemptions include religion or medical conditions, and only those who qualify may use regular coronavirus testing to bypass the vaccine requirements. City officials said those applying for medical exemptions must provide a letter from a doctor, and religious exemption applications must include a written statement as to why their religion would prevent vaccination. A federal judge dismissed a complaint last week that sought to stop state and county employee vaccination rules. The court said there are options for testing and exemptions, and the workers are therefore not being forced to take the vaccine, as the lawsuit alleged. The 12 first responders who filed the lawsuit claimed they were being forced to take an “experimental” vaccine. The Honolulu Police Department had the most exemption requests, with over 300 applications. City officials said about 90% of all employees were fully vaccinated as of Oct. 8.\n\nIdaho\n\nMoscow: Students at state colleges and universities will be able to opt out of some fees under a plan approved by the Idaho State Board of Education on Thursday. The new fee structure allowing students to opt out of fees for activities, clubs and on-campus organizations goes into effect in the 2022-23 school year, the Moscow-Pullman Daily News reports. Students who decide to opt out of those fees will receive a refund from their school. Student fees – particularly the ones that go to support extracurricular activities, clubs and cultural events – have long been a source of debate in Idaho as lawmakers and administrators struggle to keep the state’s higher education institutions affordable and robust. Officials spent the spring and summer evaluating which student fees could be optional and how all the fees should be labeled. The new plan breaks the fees into four categories. The student enrollment, engagement and success category goes partly toward scholarships, and the institutional operations, services and support category helps fund maintenance. The student health and wellness category of fees helps cover the cost of fitness centers and counseling. The last category – student government fees – pays for student government and helps subsidize student clubs, organizations and activities. A portion of the latter is now optional.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A North Carolina man who moved to Chicago was one of the victims of John Wayne Gacy, who was convicted of killing 33 young men and boys in the 1970s, authorities said Monday. Francis Wayne Alexander would have been 21 or 22 when Gacy killed him sometime between early 1976 and early 1977, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart said at a news conference in announcing the identification of Alexander’s remains. In a statement, Alexander’s sister, Carolyn Sanders, thanked the sheriff’s office for giving the family some level of “closure.” “It is hard, even 45 years later, to know the fate of our beloved Wayne,” Sanders wrote. “He was killed at the hands of a vile and evil man.” Alexander’s remains were among 26 sets police found in the crawl space under Gacy’s home just outside the city. Three victims, meanwhile, were found buried on Gacy’s property, and four others whom Gacy admitted killing were found in waterways south of Chicago. In 2011, Dart’s office exhumed the remains of eight victims who had been buried without police knowing who they were. Dart called on anyone who had a male relative disappear in the Chicago area in the 1970s to submit DNA. Alexander is at least the third identified from that batch. The effort also has helped police solve at least 11 cold cases of unrelated homicides and helped families find loved ones who had gone missing but were alive.\n\nIndiana\n\nStinesville: The town is offering to sell a set of vacant downtown buildings for $1 in hopes of finding new life for its tie to southern Indiana’s once-thriving limestone industry. The cluster of four one-story limestone buildings was built in the Monroe County town of Stinesville between 1886 and 1894. The Indiana Landmarks historic preservation group is working with the 200-person town about 10 miles northwest of Bloomington and has suggested the buildings could become an events venue, a restaurant, or a workspace for artisans or craftspeople, WRTV reports. The landmarks group described Stinesville as a boom town in the 1890s with nearly 1,000 residents as stone workers and carvers arrived for jobs at nearby limestone quarries. “The buildings embody the rich history of the local limestone industry and subsequent growth in the town in the late nineteenth century,” the preservation group said. Indiana Landmarks is accepting development proposals through Nov. 15. The town and Indiana Landmarks will then review the submissions based on “experience, qualifications, financial responsibility, capacity to undertake the project, and the appropriateness of the rehabilitation plan.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two decisions handed down Friday by the state Supreme Court promise to limit prosecutors’ ability to file amended charges close to trial, but a dissent warns that prosecutors may be forced to overcharge defendants to avoid having to refile cases from scratch. Under Iowa court rules, prosecutors have 45 days after someone is arrested to file a formal indictment or trial information specifying the charges against them. After that date, prosecutors can ask the court for permission to amend the charges, but not if the amendment would charge a “wholly new and different offense” or otherwise infringe on the defendant’s rights. In two cases decided Friday, James Vandermark and Jameesha Allen both argued a district court had wrongly allowed prosecutors to upgrade their charges at the last minute. The high court split 4-3 in favor of the defendants. In both cases, a court approved the amended charge over objections by the defense, finding the new charges were “substantially similar” to their original charges. Both trial courts were mistaken, Justice Christopher McDonald wrote, as the new charges each involved different elements to be proved and a substantially greater potential sentence. In his dissents, Justice Edward Mansfield wrote that the majority disregarded a number of precedents but agreed the law is “somewhat murky.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Law enforcement agencies across the state have received hundreds of complaints of bias over the past 10 years, but records available to the public show only two alleging racial bias resulted in consequences for officers, an Associated Press examination of the data shows. Advocates for racial equality question how that could be the case and suggest that law enforcement investigating complaints against other officers and a lack of transparency are problems. “We have the police policing the police,” said Sheila Officer, chairwoman of citizens group Racial Profiling Advisory Board of Wichita. She said independent citizen panels should conduct investigations of complaints. Law enforcement agencies and groups interviewed by the AP would not comment on the low overall rates at which bias complaints have been sustained but said that in their own departments, complaints are thoroughly investigated by officers independent of those accused. Kansas defines biased policing as an officer’s “unreasonable” use of a person’s race, ethnicity, national origin, gender or religion when enforcing laws. Lawmakers in 2011 required agencies to submit to the attorney general’s office annual reports outlining how many complaints they’d received and what they did about them.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Repeated waves of COVID-19 cases, long hours and chronic staff shortages are taking a severe toll on the state’s nurses, with many citing stress, burnout and distress over encounters with hostile patients and family members. Further, as the pandemic drags on, nurses once viewed as health care heroes have found themselves confronted by some critics who claim COVID-19 isn’t real or are angry about measures such as vaccines and mask-wearing. “Now nurses have to change out of their scrubs to go to the grocery store,” said Delanor Manson, CEO of the Kentucky Nurses Association, which on Friday released a survey of nurses statewide about the state of their profession. Meanwhile, COVID-19 continues to place immense demands on nurses, who account for about 53% of the state’s health care workforce, she said. A chronic shortage of nurses in Kentucky – also a national problem – has left nurses working long shifts in understaffed facilities, leaving them stressed, exhausted and burned out, found the survey from the nurses’ group. About 25% said they expect to leave their jobs within the next three months, which officials said would further worsen the shortage.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A critically endangered Sumatran orangutan at the city’s zoo is pregnant with twins. “We are very excited about this pregnancy,” Bob MacLean, senior veterinarian at the Audubon Zoo, said in a news release Thursday. “Twinning is extremely rare in orangutans – there is only about a 1% chance of this happening.” The births in December or January will be the first for Menari, 12, but the third and fourth sired by Jambi, a male orangutan brought to New Orleans in late 2018 from a zoo in Germany. It may be six years or more before the group’s next babies. Sumatran orangutans wean their offspring at about 7 years old and have the longest period between births of any mammals – 8.2 to 9.3 years, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The great apes with long red hair have been decimated by hunting as well as the destruction of the forests and peat swamps where they spend nearly all their time up in trees. About 13,500 are believed to exist in sustainable wild populations, and “overall numbers continue to decline dramatically,” according to the IUCN.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Motorists traveling through the state will pay more in tolls starting next month, as Maine looks to make up for revenue lost during the pandemic. The state faces a $60 million financial shortfall caused by less traffic during the pandemic, The Sun Journal reports. The Maine Turnpike Authority is increasing toll prices for the first time in nine years. About half of the nation’s toll roads increased their fees during the pandemic, said Peter Mills, the authority’s executive director. The authority estimates that about 71% of the higher tolls will be paid by people and companies from other states. The increase is estimated to generate more than $17 million annually. The changes take effect Nov. 1. Among them, the toll for passenger cars going through the new toll booths in York, Maine, will be $4 instead of $3. That change alone is expected to generate more than $14 million of the revenue. The authority had planned to increase tolls in 2028.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan on Monday urged all eligible residents to get COVID-19 booster shots, especially those with health conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes, and the governor said the state will begin vaccinating children as soon as the federal government approves. Nearly 1.4 million Maryland residents are now eligible to receive a booster, Hogan said. People who received their second dose of a Pfizer or Moderna shot six months ago who are 65 and older, 18 and older with underlying conditions, or 18 and older and work in high-risk settings are eligible. People who are 18 and older who received a Johnson & Johnson shot two months ago also are eligible. “We have a robust network of vaccination providers, including pharmacies, primary care providers, mobile clinics, local health departments and community health centers, and we have both the supply and the capacity to provide a booster shot to anyone who needs one,” Hogan said. To help residents determine their eligibility for a booster, state health officials have launched a new portal on covidvax.maryland.gov where residents can enter their information and learn next steps. The state has administered about 280,000 booster shots so far.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city is joining other communities across the U.S. with large numbers of university students in planning to challenge the results of the once-a-decade head count, saying the 2020 census undercounted students as well as jail inmates and foreign-born residents. Mayor Kim Janey said in a letter to the U.S. Census Bureau this month that officials believe about 5,000 college students were missed in the city that is home to Boston University, Northeastern University, Suffolk University and the University of Massachusetts Boston. The city made its estimate based on records Boston schools are required to give to the city with addresses for students living off campus. The 2020 census began just as the pandemic took hold and as students were told to leave campuses. The results put Boston’s population at 675,647 people. The county’s corrections department estimates 500 jail inmates were missed, and city officials believe neighborhoods with large numbers of foreign-born residents were undercounted as well, the mayor said. “Issues such as language barriers and government mistrust, particularly with a possibility of a citizenship question, may have resulted in an undercount of these traditionally difficult populations to count,” Janey said.\n\nMichigan\n\nSt. Joseph: A county health officer frustrated with the “politicization of public health” in the COVID-19 era is quitting her job. Courtney Davis has been the interim health officer in Berrien County since July, when she was promoted from deputy. Communications manager Gillian Conrad is also resigning, The Herald-Palladium reports. Davis ordered masks in local schools to reduce the spread of COVID-19, though the order was dropped Sept. 29 when the health department believed its state funding would be in jeopardy. Davis said at the time that it was “appalling” that money was tied to mask policies. Davis said it’s been an honor to work for the department for nearly five years. “However, with the politicization of public health during the pandemic, I can no longer effectively do my job and serve the community with its health and safety always at the forefront,” she said. Davis’ last day is Nov. 3. In stepping down, Conrad said the pandemic had taken a “significant toll” on her mental and physical health. County Administrator Brian Dissette said there has been only one applicant for the job of permanent health officer, a role in which Davis was serving on an interim basis. He said he informed the state health department about the vacancies to try to add more “horsepower” to the search.\n\nMinnesota\n\nChanhassen: The state’s congressional delegation on Monday introduced a resolution to posthumously award the Congressional Gold Medal to pop superstar Prince, citing his “indelible mark on Minnesota and American culture.” The medal is one of the nation’s highest civilian honors, and past recipients include George Washington, the Wright Brothers, Rosa Parks, Mother Teresa, the Navajo Code Talkers, the Tuskegee Airmen and the Dalai Lama. “The world is a whole lot cooler because Prince was in it – he touched our hearts, opened our minds, and made us want to dance,” U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said in a statement. “With this legislation, we honor his memory and contributions as a composer, performer, and music innovator. Purple reigns in Minnesota today and every day because of him.” Prince, whose many hits include “Little Red Corvette,” “Let’s Go Crazy” and “When Doves Cry,” died April 21, 2016, of an accidental fentanyl overdose at age 57 at his Paisley Park estate in Chanhassen. The resolution is led by Klobuchar and U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., with the state’s full delegation co-sponsoring. “Prince is a Minnesota icon,” Omar said in a statement. “He showed that it was OK to be a short, Black kid from Minneapolis and still change the world. He not only changed the arc of music history; he put Minneapolis on the map.”\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: Local leaders honored a homecoming queen who gave her crown to a friend whose mother had just died of cancer. Forrest County Sheriff Charlie Sims presented Nyla Covington a citizenship award, and the county Board of Supervisors voted to pay her community college tuition and declared Oct. 18 to be Nyla Covington Day. “I think her act really gave people hope there are still good folks in the world,” Sims said. Covington, 18, was crowned homecoming queen Sept. 24 at Forrest County Agricultural High School. During a ceremony on the football field, Covington immediately walked over to senior homecoming maid Brittany Walters and placed the crown on her head. Walters’ mother, A.J. Walters, an administrative assistant at the school, died the day of homecoming but had made her daughter and husband promise Brittany would take part in festivities that night. Covington told WDAM-TV that Walters started to back away as she extended the crown to her. “I was like, ‘No, come here, get it. You’re your mom’s queen,’ ” she said. “I wanted her to know that, and then I hugged her.” Walters said she felt her mother’s presence through act of kindness. “I can see my mom through Nyla,” Walters said. “They have the same exact caring, giving spirit, and it’s really fulfilling.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The state’s largest utility has set up a data center at the site of one of its coal-fired power plants that it is using to mine the internet for bitcoins. Ameren Corp. officials say the data center could also help stabilize demand for electricity that could help it avoid ramping production down and back up again, which is inefficient. Ameren officials told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch they believe the utility is one of the first regulated U.S. utilities mining cryptocurrencies. The company has already collected more than 20 bitcoins, valued, as of Friday, at more than $60,000 apiece. But critics question the $1 million project because they say it serves to artificially heighten demand for energy from coal, and the utility could put the resources to better use elsewhere such as by pursuing technology like battery storage or electric vehicle charging stations. “This really increases demand on the system and, therefore, demand for coal energy,” said local Sierra Club official Andy Knott, part of the group’s Beyond Coal Campaign. “I think what they’re trying to do is avoid having to ramp down their generators.” Officials with the utility say they envisioned the high-powered computers as a flexible and controlled way to help manage the electrical load.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Democratic leaders in the Legislature are asking for an investigation into whether the state’s attorney general abused his power by sending a Montana Highway Patrol trooper to a hospital over a complaint from the family of a COVID-19 patient. St. Peter’s Health said three public officials threatened to use their positions to force doctors and nurses to treat the patient with ivermectin, a drug used for parasites that is not federally approved for the respiratory disease, the Montana State News Bureau reports. Attorney General Austin Knudsen’s office acknowledged getting involved but has said it was to investigate a report that the woman’s family was not allowed to contact her and that legal documents were not being delivered. The hospital’s statement said otherwise. State Senate Minority Leader Jill Cohenour and House Minority Leader Kim Abbott wrote to Senate President Mark Blasdel and House Speaker Wylie Galt on Thursday and asked them to appoint a special counsel to investigate Knudsen’s actions and those of any other public officials who involved themselves in the complaint against the hospital. The patrol’s involvement raised jurisdictional issues. Helena police are usually called for security issues at the hospital.\n\nNebraska\n\nBeatrice: Homestead National Historical Park rangers and volunteers have helped harvest seeds in the region’s tallgrass prairie to be used to restore disturbed areas of the prairie and increase species diversity. “We are always working on the oldest restored tall grass prairie in the National Parks Service, and this particular year we had to do some work along one of our trails, which did disturb the area, so we need to reseed it with our native plants,” said Jessica Korgie, a park guide at Homestead. The Beatrice Daily Sun reports that in order to restore the prairie, those in attendance walked through the trails near Homestead’s Education Center and collected flower and grass seeds that were ready to be harvested. They also wore tape around their waists and knees, which Korgie said was an experiment to see how seeds are propagated in the prairie. “If you think about the animals that are traveling through the tallgrasses, you have tall animals like deer, and you have small animals like the thirteen-lined ground squirrel,” Korgie said. “So we’re going to put tape up high and tape down low to see what kind of seeds we’re collecting at those heights, and let’s determine what kind of animals might be helping to redistribute this seed to other areas.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The school board for the metro area plans to consider whether to terminate Superintendent Jesus Jara’s employment contract this week. An agenda posted Friday for the Clark County School District trustees includes discussion and possible action Thursday on “termination of convenience” of Jara’s contract. Three board members requested the agenda item on Jara’s contract, which the board last May voted 4-3 to extend. It wasn’t immediately clear why the three trustees wanted to discuss Jara’s contract. He has faced criticism over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the decision to operate with 100% distance learning for about a year beginning in March 2020, as well as the school reopening process, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Regarding the board’s intention to consider his contract, Jara said Friday that he intends to focus on working for students and educators until he’s directed otherwise. The board also is scheduled to consider removing Linda Cavazos as its president. Jara has been superintendent since 2018, and his annual salary is $320,000.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nFranconia: A fish ladder for trout breeding is being planned at the lake on the site where the Old Man of the Mountain once stood. The project is organized by a fund dedicated to helping to preserve a memorial to the Old Man of the Mountain. The massive, naturally formed granite profile attracted tourists to Franconia Notch for about 200 years before it crumbled in 2003. The memorial project was completed last year. The idea for a fish ladder to restore the natural trout breeding at the lake was first discussed years ago, when the Franconia Notch Parkway along Interstate 93 was built. “It’s a fish ladder leading from Profile Lake through all of the new development we did relating to wetlands and up to what is known as the old breeding pond,” Brian Fowler, president of the Old Man of the Mountain Legacy Fund, told the Caledonian-Record. “Profile Lake’s regional trout breeding area was this pond area, opposite of I-93. … The construction of the interstate cut off this natural breeding cycle.” Since the highway was built, the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department has stocked the lake with trout. The legacy fund is partnering with the department, Trout Unlimited and the state parks division.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPaterson: Thanks to technological advances over the past decade, people in dire circumstances such as an active-shooter situation can text 911 and get a link back from emergency dispatchers in Bergen and Passaic counties to give authorities permission to see a streaming video recorded by their cellphone camera. “They can watch in real time what’s happening,” said Officer Jonathan Klos, commander of the Passaic County sheriff’s communications division. “And the officers can prepare themselves, which makes everyone a little bit safer – now they know what they’re walking into.” The cellphone video streaming technology, named 911eye, was originally developed in the United Kingdom by Capita, a digital services business that helps first responders. The program allows authorities to do recon of a given area through the caller’s phone camera. “When the dispatcher can see live what’s going on, you’re going to get the right resources quicker,” said Brian Higgins, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the former chief of the Bergen County Police Department. “This compresses the timeline, and responding officers have a heads-up about what’s going on.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Legislators are drafting a plan to ease restrictions against retired police officers coming back to work, in an effort to add law enforcement officers across the state in the midst of a labor shortage. At a legislative committee hearing last week, retired police officer and state Rep. Bill Rehm outlined a proposal for changes to retirement provisions for police that would incentivize a return to work. He said officers might continue to draw pension benefits while working and contributing to the pension fund, or they could delay retirement benefits for a bigger payout later. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is calling for the deployment of 1,000 additional police officers across New Mexico amid public frustration with crime. She said she will ask lawmakers for $100 million to underwrite the initiative. New Mexico amended rules at the Public Employees Retirement Association in 2010 to halt so-called double-dipping in response to concerns about fairness and the long-term solvency of the public pension fund for state and local government employees. Opponents of retired police rehiring plans say it can hurt morale by limiting career advancement opportunities for ambitious younger officers and threaten efforts to modernize law enforcement agencies.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Workers facing layoffs now have a right to ask their employers instead to trim all workers’ hours and have unemployment insurance help offset the losses for everyone, under a law that Gov. Kathy Hochul signed Saturday. The measure is meant to increase awareness of what is known as the “shared work program.” It already exists in New York but hasn’t been very widely utilized, though there has been an uptick during the coronavirus pandemic. Newsday reported in March that nearly 2,700 employers statewide newly enrolled in the program during the pandemic’s first year. The new legislation says workers can petition employers to launch shared work instead of laying people off or rehiring only some of the workforce after a prior layoff. The employer has to respond to the request but doesn’t have to grant it. The law, which took effect immediately, also prohibits retaliating against workers who ask for the arrangement. Proponents say shared work programs help employees keep their jobs, help businesses keep people they’ve trained and make particular sense now. “We need to make sure our recovery efforts focus on supporting workers,” Hochul, a Democrat, said in a release.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nManteo: An abandoned vessel that ran aground on a beach more than a year ago will finally be removed. WRAL-TV reports the removal process is starting just in time for Halloween. Initially, most of the former scallop boat was visible along the shoreline. But it has been slowly sinking into sand along the beach south of Cape Hatteras National Seashore’s Oregon Inlet Campground. Now, more than half of it is buried. The haunting 72-foot-long shipwreck became a popular lure for tourists after it ran aground in March 2020. The crew was rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard. The National Park Service has been warning people to stay away, saying exploring the vessel is dangerous because of unstable sand shifting beneath it. Also, while the wrecked vessel is visible during low tide, it becomes completely surrounded by the ocean during high tide. Officials must remove the vessel before it disappears beneath the sand. The removal project is expected to cost about $295,000. It was expected to begin Monday and take roughly a month to complete.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nNew Town: A college on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation is offering an incentive for students to get COVID-19 vaccines. Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College in New Town announced that students who can verify they are fully vaccinated will receive $500. The shots must be completed by Nov. 4. “We are seeing a resurgence in the number of positive (coronavirus) cases in the Fort Berthold area and across the state of North Dakota and determined it was time to act,” said Twyla Baker, NHSC’s president. “The financial incentive rewards those who have prioritized their health and the health of others. It is also meant to motivate those who have not yet been vaccinated to act.” The Three Affiliated Tribes college offers in-demand certificate programs and associate degrees as well as three bachelor’s degrees.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: For the first time in its history, the state recorded more deaths than births last year – a development experts say was expedited by COVID-19. Roughly 143,661 Ohioans died last year, while 129,313 were born, according to data from the Ohio Department of Health. So far in 2021, the state has logged 107,462 deaths and 100,781 births. In the 112 years since statewide record-keeping began in 1909, data compiled by the Columbus Dispatch along with the Ohio History Connection shows deaths never previously surpassed births despite countless wars, economic downturns and disease. Ohio’s birthrate has been declining for years, while the number of deaths across the state has risen, meaning the two metrics were likely to swap places at some point. But data shows the pandemic rapidly hastened the switch. The coronavirus killed an estimated 13,927 Ohioans in 2020 alone, according to the state health department. That means the pandemic may account for 97% of the 14,348-person difference in births and deaths in 2020. In 2021, COVID-19 killed more than 9,400 Ohioans, more than the 6,681 difference in births and deaths so far this year. Deaths exceeded births in a record 25 states last year, according to research from the University of New Hampshire. In 2019, just five states saw more deaths than births.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A Republican state senator is drawing criticism for referring to Asian Americans as “yellow families” during a legislative committee meeting on racial inequity. Sen. Dave Rader, of Tulsa, made the comment Wednesday to Oklahoma Policy Institute analyst Damion Shade following Shade’s comments during an interim study on racial inequality in economics and the criminal justice system. “It wasn’t until well into your presentation did you go to yellow families; you left yellow families out for quite a while,” Rader said. “You mean Asian Americans?” Shade replied. “You use black term, white term, brown term, so I was just gonna jump in there with you,” Rader said, before asking questions about Black families. The word “yellow” is considered a derogatory term in reference to East Asians. In the late 1800s, Chinese Americans were deemed the “yellow peril,” despite living in the United States for years. Rader said in a statement to KFOR that he has worked to remove barriers to success for all types of people. “I’ve spent my entire life as a football coach and educator, fostering opportunities for individuals of every race and background,” he said. Oklahoma Democratic Party Chair Alicia Andrews said it’s frustrating Rader would make such a comment during a study on racial inequality.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A glass recycling plant has consented to either shut down or install pollution control technology, according to an agreement announced between the plant’s operators and the state. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality gave Owens-Brockway, a glass recycling facility in northeast Portland, two options after it reached an agreement with the company to resolve the fine of more than $1 million it issued in June. The glass plant was cited for multiple, ongoing air quality violations of particulate matter emissions as well as permitted opacity. “The best thing Owens-Brockway could do to come into compliance and protect the community is to install pollution controls,” DEQ’s Northwest Region Administrator Nina DeConcini said in a statement. “And if the facility decides to install pollution controls, this agreement requires they demonstrate that the controls achieve a 95% reduction in particulate matter emissions.” Under the agreement, Owens-Brockway must either submit a permit application to install pollution controls by June 30, 2022, or shut down. If the company decides to install pollution control technology, it would have to do so within 18 months of DEQ approval of the application.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Workers for the area’s transit system have voted to authorize a strike next month if an agreement isn’t reached on a new contract. The Transport Workers Union Local 234 said a voice vote at a Sunday morning meeting in south Philadelphia approved a motion to allow union leaders to call a strike if an agreement with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority is not reached in a week. The union represents about 5,000 bus drivers, cashiers, mechanics, and other workers providing service for buses, trolleys, the subway and elevated train lines. The current contract expires early Nov. 1, a day before the general election. “Our members are essential workers who have risked their lives and put their own families at risk during this pandemic,” union president Willie Brown told The Philadelphia Inquirer. He said the union was asking SEPTA to address “issues related to health and safety and modest economic improvements.” SEPTA said talks have been productive, and it hopes to avoid disruptions with agreement on a “fair and financially responsible” pact. The agency said it is still losing about $1 million a day in revenues due to ridership declines, with more people working at home during the pandemic and ridership not expected to return to February 2020 levels.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Ninety percent of adults in the state are now at least partially vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Dan McKee said Monday. The Democrat said Rhode Island is also now one of the top states in terms of the percentage of its population that is fully vaccinated. Overall, more than 77% of residents have received one vaccine dose, and more than 70% are considered fully inoculated, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Rhode Island might be small, but we are mighty – especially when it comes to getting shots in arms,” McKee said in a statement. “Thank you to each and every Rhode Islander who stepped up to get vaccinated. It is because of you that we are leading the nation in vaccinations and economic recovery.” The governor said COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots continue to be available at sites across the state, including community centers, local businesses and schools, and more information can be found at C19vaccineRI.org. The state is averaging about 227 new cases of COVID-19 a day, down from about 264 a day two weeks ago. The state has reported 2,872 deaths from the coronavirus since the pandemic started.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s social services agency says it is now paying more money to providers in a program that subsidizes child care for low-income families. The Department of Social Services announced Wednesday that the agency has set up a new reimbursement rate structure for the SC Voucher program. The rates are now set based on the actual age of a child in the program, as opposed to what age group the child is in. That rate increase means families in the program will save money by covering fewer tuition expenses, the agency said in a news release. The new reimbursement structure also puts more money in the pockets of child care providers who may have struggled financially during the pandemic. A top-rated child care provider in the program might now receive $296 a week for full-time care of a child under 1 year old, whereas the previous rate structure would have allowed for a maximum of $205 weekly for any child up to 2 years old. The voucher program pays for more than 11,000 children to attend child care programs each month, according to the agency website. Parents must have an income below 150% of the federal poverty level to qualify.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Computer science students from the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology have built a new dating app, Lafdr, that matches people based on their taste in memes. After testing a prototype, the app for iOS and Android launched last month. Morgan Vagts and Debbie Liknes, who both graduated from Mines in May, channeled their frustration with existing dating apps by creating their own, the Rapid City Journal reports. Lafdr’s algorithm, built by Liknes, connects like-minded users through the memes they enjoy on the app. “Memes are a great conversation starter,” Vagts said. “It keeps the conversation light and lets people be themselves. … If you can laugh at a meme together, you know you have something in common.” Vagts said Lafdr is designed to help people find friendship or romantic connections, or users can simply browse the memes on Lafdr. Vagts and Liknes spent two years developing the app, which is geared toward college-age students but could potentially appeal to ages 18 to 35. “We were just sitting in Debbie’s living room, talking about the perils of online dating, and she joked about the idea of a meme-based app. And I thought, ‘Yes. That’s brilliant, let’s do it,’ and it evolved from there,” Vagts said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s top medical licensing officials are pushing the state government to crack down on doctors and nurses who spread damaging misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines, calling for aggressive probes with the potential to suspend professional licenses and end careers. The Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners and the Board of Nursing instructed the Department of Health to pursue investigations of medical professionals who made disprovable claims to patients or on social media. Board members told investigators to prioritize cases involving the most obvious falsehoods or outrageous lies – that vaccines are poisonous, cause infertility, contain microchips or can magnetize the body. Investigators should focus less on subjective statements, even if they cause harm and worsen vaccine hesitancy, board members said, because the state lacks the authority and manpower to discipline those who merely discourage vaccination. “I don’t know that we can police opinion, even though it’s wrong and even though it’s causing – obviously causing – major problems in this state,” said Dr. Debbie Christiansen, a member of the Board of Medical Examiners. “But we can tell people they cannot say things that are absolutely false.”\n\nTexas\n\nKerrville: A driver lost control during a drag racing event on an airport runway and slammed into a crowd of spectators, killing two children and injuring eight other people, authorities said. A 6-year-old boy and an 8-year-old boy were killed in the crash Saturday afternoon at an event called “Airport Race Wars 2” at the Kerrville-Kerr County Airport, police said in a news release. The organized event was attended by thousands and involved drivers speeding down a runway as they competed for cash. The driver “lost control and left the runway, crashing into parked vehicles and striking spectators who were observing the races,” Kerrville police said. The injured victims were taken to various hospitals, including a 46-year-old woman who was listed in critical condition. The majority of the other injuries were not believed to be life-threatening, although the condition of a 26-year-old man was unknown, authorities said. A 4-year-old boy and a 3-month-old girl were taken to a hospital for precautionary evaluations. The Kerrville Convention and Visitors Bureau’s website promoted the event as an “action packed, family-friendly day” in which fans could watch the “fastest drag cars compete for over $8000 in total prizes.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The top prosecutor in the state’s most populous county says he will no longer offer plea deals to defendants accused of gun-related crimes, in an effort to combat gun violence. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said Wednesday that he was putting people “on notice” that his office will “throw the book at you.” He cited the recently released 2020 Crime in Utah Report, which showed an increase in homicides from 2019 to 2020. Two-thirds of those homicides involved firearms, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. The change means that gun offenders will have to plead guilty to more serious crimes or go to trial, likely resulting in longer sentences behind bars. There would be exception if “evidentiary issues, legal or ethical prohibitions” prevent a conviction, Gill said. Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown and Salt Lake County Sheriff Rosie Rivera said they hope the new policy will send a message to prospective criminals and will help halt the “revolving door” of individuals who are repeat offenders.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Residents are being asked for their input on how to spend about $46.9 million to clean up water pollution in the state. The Vermont Clean Water Board is seeking feedback in an online questionnaire on the funding levels and the board’s proposed prioritization of funding, the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation said. “The $46.9 million available in the 2023 clean water budget is an all-time high in funds available to improve Vermont’s water quality, in part thanks to additional leveraging of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds,” Natural Resources Secretary Julie Moore said in a statement. “This is an exciting milestone and underscores the importance of public input to inform funding priorities.” The funding helps municipalities, farmers and others create projects that reduce pollution washing into waterways, ranging from farmers planting cover crops to reduce soil erosion and improve soil health to municipalities stabilizing roadside erosion, the department said. Water quality projects also help to protect Vermonters from damaging flooding, the agency said. The board’s draft budget is available online. Input can be sent through the questionnaire to the Clean Water Board through Nov. 19. The board will make final recommendations in December.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Mike Mason, once one of the nation’s highest-ranking FBI officials, now drives students to school in a yellow bus each morning and afternoon. It wasn’t the career turn he’d imagined for himself. Mason was once the executive assistant director of the bureau, responsible for overseeing all criminal investigations, among other duties. But in his retirement, he felt a pull to help when there was a shortage of school bus drivers. “Probably half of the FBI’s operational resources fell under me,” said Mason, 63, who lives in Midlothian, Virginia. Since late April, he has been working for Chesterfield County Public Schools as a bus driver. While the work differs drastically from his previous profession, “I feel the same sense of duty,” he said. Each morning about 5:30 a.m., Mason carefully inspects his 24-foot-long bus – examining the interior and exterior – to ensure it’s safe for students to ride. “I get it ready to roll,” he said. “This is not hyperbole: I’m smiling every day I start that bus up.” He collects nine students ages 10 to 18 and drops them off at the Faison Center in Richmond, which offers educational programs for autistic children. Mason grew up in Chicago, was raised by a single dad who was a truck driver for the board of education. “That’s part of what makes me smile every morning as I crank this bus up,” he said. “It’s the connection to my father.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Tens of thousands of people were without power Monday after a strong Pacific storm system downed trees and power lines the day before. Most of those still without electricity were in the Seattle area, where utilities reported about 60,000 customers out. Two people died after a tree collapsed onto their car near Issaquah on Sunday. The Seattle Times reports they were traveling in a white sedan on a densely forested roadway when the tree came down across the car. “It’s a freak accident,” said Sgt. Tim Meyer, a spokesperson for the King County Sheriff’s Office. “Just a moment or two’s difference could have drastically changed how this ended.” About a dozen schools in the greater Seattle area were closed Monday or were on a delayed start due to power outages or other issues from the storm. On Sunday, wind gusts topping 60 mph also downed trees on Interstate 90 east of Seattle and cut power to more than 150,000 customers in the metro area and around Puget Sound.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival held a rally at the state Capitol on Sunday to pressure U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin to support President Joe Biden’s package of social services and climate change strategies, according to a news release. Ahead of the rally, members of the campaign gathered the stories of residents they said would be abandoned by Manchin if he continued to insist on cuts to the package. Rally co-chair the Rev. William J. Barber II, in the release, called the West Virginia Democrat “the new Senator No.” “No to paying home health workers a living wage. No to free community college. No to dental and vision help for senior citizens. No to a $15/hour minimum wage. No to fully protected voting rights,” Barber said, adding that Manchin “still has a chance to say yes.” Also on Sunday, the campaign published full-page and digital ads in four West Virginia newspapers.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans plan to launch another investigation of how the 2020 election was administered in the state, GOP leaders announced Monday. Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu, Senate President Chris Kapenga and Assistant Senate Majority Leader Dan Feyen said in a news release that Republican leaders will authorize the Senate’s elections committee to conduct the probe in the wake of findings legislative auditors released Friday. Auditors didn’t find any widespread fraud in the state but did identify inconsistent administration of election law based on surveys of ballots sampled from across Wisconsin. Auditors made 30 recommendations for the Wisconsin Elections Commission to consider and 18 possible legal changes for the Legislature. The GOP leaders’ news release said they would assess “the full impact of WEC’s deficiencies.” The release did not say when the Senate committee would begin the probe, how extensive it might be or whether the committee will be empowered to subpoena records. Elections Commission spokesman John Smalley said he hadn’t seen the release and had no immediate comment. A recount and court rulings have shown Democrat Joe Biden won Wisconsin, but former President Donald Trump and his followers have refused to accept defeat.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Dozens of U.S. fellow Marines joined hundreds of Wyoming residents over the weekend to bid a final farewell at a memorial for Rylee McCollum, one of 13 U.S. service members killed in a suicide bombing as they guarded a gate at a chaotic Kabul, Afghanistan, airport during the final U.S. evacuation from that country. Many of the Marines were members of the 20-year-old McCollum’s unit serving in Afghanistan when he was killed Aug. 26. McCollum, a Marine lance corporal, grew up, went to school and enlisted for the Corps in the mountain valley area known as Jackson Hole, home to the town of Jackson. He was honored during Saturday’s Jackson service attended by more than 400 people. “We knew his potential. I knew he had the mindset,” said Staff Sgt. Luis Diaz, who recruited McCollum into the Corps. “I knew he had the spirit to accomplish anything he wanted.” McCollum was a dedicated Marine, enthusiastic and funny, said Cpl. Wyatt Wilson. When something had to be done, Wilson told the Jackson gathering, “I always grabbed Rylee because I knew it would be done right the first time,” the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. Gov. Mark Gordon, who attended with U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, said Americans “should rejoice that heroes like Rylee are born.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/01/12/back-class-late-night-shots-library-hero-news-around-states/115283634/", "title": "Back in class, late-night shots: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: The top academic officer at Auburn University is facing a no-confidence vote this week by faculty members over lingering dissatisfaction with his handling of class scheduling around the coronavirus pandemic. The Opelika-Auburn News reports the University Senate is scheduled to meet Tuesday to address complaints against Provost Bill Hardgrave, who is being defended by President Jay Gouge. More than 500 faculty members met in a virtual gathering in November to discuss their concerns about Hardgrave and his insistence on returning to primarily in-person classes in the spring. Economics professor Mike Stern said Wednesday that his concerns still haven’t been adequately addressed. Hardgrave and other officials need to better assess teaching spaces and how to follow health guidelines about social distancing, he said. “I volunteered to teach face-to-face in the fall and spring (of the 2020-21 school year) and they promised it would be safe,” Stern said. “Then, they did the opposite.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The usual transportation difficulties in rural Alaska have presented unique obstacles for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, officials said. Dozens of remote villages lack hospitals and road connections, while ultracold freezers required for storage of specific varieties of the vaccine are essentially nonexistent, Alaska Public Media reports. Tribal health care providers responded by mobilizing a massive effort delivering thousands of doses to remote areas. Providers airlifted vaccine to villages using a fleet of chartered planes, while the medicine also was delivered over choppy seas on a water taxi. Some clinicians were shuttled around villages on sleds pulled behind snowmachines. Dr. Ellen Hodges encountered the unforeseen difficulty of Alaska being too cold in some places to vaccinate front-line health care workers. “It became immediately apparent that the vaccine was going to freeze in the metal part of the needle,” said Hodges, who contended with subzero temperatures on a remote Southwest Alaska airport tarmac. Hodges ultimately kept doses tucked in her shirt until they were injected.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: No individuals in the Phoenix metropolitan area’s 12 largest cities have been cited for violating mask mandates. The laws, which have been in place for six months to halt the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, have not been cited at all by Tucson and Flagstaff law enforcement. The Phoenix area police and the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office have cited or referred fewer than 75 businesses out of more than 3,500 total complaints. The city of Scottsdale has cited the most businesses, followed by Tempe and Phoenix. Avondale, Buckeye, Glendale, Goodyear, Peoria and Surprise have also not cited any person or business for violating mandates. The Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health has received more than 400 complaints related to workplace safety as a result of potential violations of state orders, but the agency has not cited any employers to date as of Monday. Meanwhile, the state has among the highest rates of coronavirus cases in the country, and some Phoenix metro hospitals have begun to refuse emergency transports.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of active coronavirus cases in the state remained above 27,000 on Sunday after hitting a record the day earlier. A state health official has said the record-high number of active cases is likely to signal that hospitalizations will increase in coming days. The Arkansas Health Department’s count of active cases was at 27,492 on Sunday, a decline by 330 from a record high of 27,822 on Saturday. Arkansas reported 3,330 new confirmed and probable cases of the coronavirus Sunday, though Gov. Asa Hutchinson said more than 2,000 of those cases were from late reporting months ago. “Regardless, they reflect how this virus impacts all of us,” Hutchinson wrote on Twitter. Researchers from Johns Hopkins University say there were 1,253.5 new cases per 100,000 people in Arkansas over the past two weeks, which ranks sixth in the country for new cases per capita. One in every 148 people in Arkansas tested positive in the past week. The state’s hospitalizations Sunday were at 1,340. The state reported 33 more deaths, bringing the death toll to 4,043.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The state’s coronavirus catastrophe reached a staggering new level Monday as Johns Hopkins University data showed California has recorded more than 30,000 deaths since the pandemic started. Deaths have exploded since a COVID-19 surge began in October. It took the state six months to record its first 10,000 deaths. But in barely a month, the total rose from 20,000 to 30,000. Over the weekend, state officials reported a two-day record of 1,163 deaths. Hospitalizations also have exploded, and many hospitals are stretched to the limit. Over the weekend, Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said the virus’s “immense” spread reflected unsafe things people did during the holidays, making any activity outside a household much more risky. “This is just not the time to go to the shopping mall or to a friend’s house to watch a basketball or football game,” Ferrer said. Meanwhile, the county announced it will stop using Curative COVID-19 tests at pop-up testing sites after a U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert that the test could produce false negatives. And the city announced Sunday that its huge COVID-19 testing site at Dodger Stadium will be transformed into a vaccination center by the week’s end.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Despite some closures due to the pandemic and price increases, state parks recorded a nearly 23% increase in visitors in 2020, with some data from November and December still yet to be logged. The 18.3 million visitors Colorado state parks have reported were up from the 14.8 million total in 2019, The Gazette reports. The record figure is about 53% higher than the agency’s 2013-14 fiscal year, when 11.9 million visitors were counted at the 41 state parks. At Castlewood Canyon, there were a total of 263,744 visitors through November, up more than 56% from a then-record 2017. Lake Pueblo recorded the most visitors with a record 2.7 million people registered from January through October. The state’s other most popular parks were Chatfield, which logged 2.1 million visitors through October, and Cherry Creek State Park, which is expected to log more than 2 million visitors for the first time in its history.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz is under quarantine after a member of her staff tested positive for the coronavirus. Contact tracing is underway, and all members of Bysiewicz’s staff who had been in close contact with the unidentified staffer will also quarantine, said her chief of staff, Adam Joseph. Bysiewicz tested negative Thursday and will work remotely while self-isolating, Joseph said. This is the first known case of coronavirus within her office. The staffer who tested positive has not exhibited any symptoms and is at home in isolation.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: A county library employee who went above and beyond the call of duty during the COVID-19 pandemic has landed a prestigious honor from Sussex County government. Kristin Cooper, assistant director at South Coastal Library in Bethany Beach, is the county’s 2020 Employee of the Year, as selected by the Shining Star Employee Recognition Committee. Cooper was selected from a pool of seven candidates, all quarterly winners or notable honorable mentions, from the past year. She was an honorable mention in the fourth quarter of 2020. The annual honor was announced by Karen Brewington, Sussex County’s human resource director, during last week’s Sussex County Council meeting. Brewington said Cooper was unanimously chosen by the committee because “she went above and beyond to keep the community engaged, strengthened and hopeful during such unprecedented times of COVID.” Cooper was lauded for, among other things, her efforts to keep library patrons connected through virtual resources and programs. As the 2020 honoree, she receives a one-week vacation bonus.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. Public Schools is gearing up to return some students to the classroom next month, and teachers have already received their assignments via email, WUSA-TV reports. When the term starts Feb. 1, teachers will either remain virtual or be assigned to in-person learning, according to the emails. Educators who cannot or will not return to the classroom can apply for leave either through the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Family and Medical Leave Act, DCPS said in a statement. Parents are expected to find out this week if their child meets the high-need criteria for an in-person seat, according to DCPS. Vaccinations for DCPS staff are expected to begin this month. A December survey from the school district showed parents almost evenly split over whether they want to send their children back to school for in-person learning in the new year.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The state’s coronavirus cases remain at record highs, with more than 11,000 new cases reported Monday, along with 163 deaths. The Florida Department of Health reported 11,576 new cases and said the seven-day average for the state is about 15,000 per day. That is about 40% higher that the previous peak of 11,000 reached in July. There were 7,650 people hospitalized in Florida with COVID-19 on Monday morning, a jump of about 150 from Sunday. The state has reported approximately 140 coronavirus deaths per day over the past week – the weekly average peaked at 183 per day in August but had fallen to 40 in November before the latest rise began. Increases in the death rate usually follow jumps in cases by about a month. For comparison, heart disease and cancer, the state’s two largest causes of death by far, each kill an average of about 125 Floridians per day. The jumps in cases and deaths come as the state tries to roll out its vaccination program. Gov. Ron DeSantis has emphasized immunizing those 65 and older, front-line medical workers and nursing home patients.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s plan to expand access to a COVID-19 vaccine to people over 65 got off to a rocky start Monday, with the websites of at least two public health districts crashing and other districts reporting overwhelming demand for appointments. The state was already struggling with its vaccine rollout before the latest woes. The Coastal Health District, which includes Savannah, stopped scheduling appointments after an “overwhelming response from residents ages 65 and older interested in COVID-19 vaccination,” the district said in a news release. The district – one of 18 in the state – said health officials in the eight counties it covers have enough requests to schedule appointments through February and, in some cases, into March. “We know people are frustrated because the process is moving more slowly than they would like, and if we could vaccinate everyone today, we’d do that,” Lawton Davis, the district’s health director, said in a statement. “But your health departments are stretched thin and doing what they can to move forward.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s doctor shortage has worsened during the coronavirus pandemic, and experts say the chances of a rebound hinge on Hawaii’s ability to help doctors stay in business. More than 400 doctors say COVID-19 has forced them to close their practices, reduce hours or switch to telehealth services, Hawaii Public Radio reports. That brings the state’s overall doctor shortage to more than 1,000, according to the latest Hawaii Physician Workforce Assessment released by the University of Hawaii’s John A. Burns School of Medicine. “So what it means is that if you need a doctor urgently, you might die because you might not be able to access that,” said Dr. Kelley Withy, director of the Hawaii and Pacific Basin Area Health Education Center at the Honolulu medical school. “And if you need a specialist chronically to help you manage your condition, you may have to travel to get to that specialist, and it may be by air travel, which of course is especially difficult right now.” The shortage is greater in the communities beyond Oahu, said Dr. Elizabeth Ann Ignacio, an intervention radiologist on Maui. Hawaii has more than 10,000 licensed doctors, but only about 3,200 are active, Ignacio said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Monday described 2020 like a damaging and deadly tornado but said Idaho is strong heading into the new year with strong finances and a COVID-19 vaccine now available. The Republican governor’s state of the state speech is considered the kickoff to the legislative session and is usually heavy on budget matters. He usually gives the speech to a joint session in the House of Representatives attended by all 35 senators and 70 representatives, as well as members of the Idaho Supreme Court and other statewide elected office holders. But his speech Monday was delivered remotely to avoid spreading the virus. He spent much of it talking about the coronavirus that has killed more than 1,500 residents, and he asked for a moment of silence for those who died. He also championed front-line health care workers and the challenges they’ve faced.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Chicago Public Schools students began their return to the classroom Monday as school doors opened to thousands of pre-kindergarten and some special education students. The nation’s third-largest district, with about 355,000 students, plans a gradual return to in-person instruction after going remote last March due to the coronavirus pandemic. “It is our city’s first day of embarking on our path to returning to in-person learning,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said at a Southwest Side elementary school, where students wore face coverings, and desks had sneeze guard barriers. Nearly 40% of eligible students, about 77,000, expressed interest in returning, with about 6,000 students in pre-kindergarten and special education expected Monday. The Chicago Teachers Union has opposed reopening over safety concerns. Union officials claim the district hasn’t done enough to protect teachers from COVID-19, proposing to continue distance learning until teachers are vaccinated. District officials argue distance learning doesn’t work well for all, particularly many Black and Latino students who make up the majority of the district. The district’s safety plan includes purchasing classroom air purifiers and a testing program.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state has identified a case of a new coronavirus strain, first seen in the United Kingdom, that spreads more easily. The new variant, which is not thought to carry a higher risk of severe disease or death, is behind England’s latest lockdown. Like other states, Indiana has been monitoring testing samples to determine whether this variant is circulating. Indiana Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention laboratories confirmed the presence of the strain in the state, health officials said Monday. “It’s common for viruses to mutate, and we are seeing that occur with COVID-19,” State Health Commissioner Dr. Kris Box said in a statement. “Because this strain of the virus can be transmitted more easily, it’s more important than ever that Hoosiers continue to wear their masks, practice social distancing, maintain good hygiene and get vaccinated when they are eligible.”\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: New clinical trials began last week at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics for a COVID-19 vaccine that officials there hope will be even more viable for global distribution. “To really get (COVID-19) under control, we need the world vaccinated,” said Dr. Patricia Winokur, executive dean at the University of Iowa’s Carver College of Medicine and principal investigator for the UI site of the clinical drug trial. UIHC began enrolling participants in the Novavax trial last Monday, and Winokur said it’s still accepting more. Winokur estimated 30,000 individuals would be enrolled at sites across the country, all told. So far, roughly a sixth of those spots have already been filled. While the Novavax vaccine – like Pfizer’s and Moderna’s – will require two doses, Winokur said she expects it could be easier to distribute around the world because of the temperature at which the vaccine is stored. While early data suggests Novavax can be stored at “refrigerator temperature,” the Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at close to -100 degrees Fahrenheit to remain effective, and Moderna’s must be kept at -4 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Kansas State and Washburn universities will begin the spring semester online as the coronavirus pandemic rages. The plan is for the first two weeks to be virtual at Kansas State, but it isn’t clear when in-person learning will resume at Washburn. Dr. JuliAnn Mazachek, vice president of academic affairs at Washburn, said in a statement that the decision about classes will be reviewed weekly and that “the university will return to face-to-face classes as soon as possible.” Kansas State said in a statement that the goal was to mitigate continued spread of COVID-19. “As we anticipate a surge in positive cases as people return to our campuses, this action will help us keep safety protocols in place,” said Richard Myers, Kansas State’s president.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state House of Representatives will form a committee to consider a petition to impeach Gov. Andy Beshear over his COVID-19-related orders. Speaker of the House David Osborne, R-Prospect, said under law the House doesn’t have a choice but to take action after receiving the petition, which includes multiple allegations that the governor violated both the state and U.S. constitutions in a series of executive orders responding to the pandemic. Osborne said Saturday that he hadn’t read the petition yet and didn’t know if the accusations were serious, but “for someone to propose undoing an election of a state executive ... it’s a very, very serious accusation.” Crystal Staley, a spokeswoman for Beshear, said the action is “silly and completely unjustified,” and “the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled every step the governor has taken is legal.” The petition referenced steps the governor took after declaring a state of emergency in March, including ordering nonessential businesses to close to in-person traffic, instituting a travel ban, ordering churches to close to in-person services and expanding voting procedures to allow mail-in voting during the 2020 elections.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Families are eligible for a 15% boost in their food stamp benefits through June, under a federal coronavirus aid package passed by Congress. The state said any increases due to people receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program started being transferred to benefit cards Friday. The latest federal coronavirus legislation didn’t expand eligibility for food stamps. But The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports that state officials said several key provisions will increase SNAP’s reach. Shavana Howard, an assistant secretary for the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services, said the program will no longer count federal extended unemployment benefits as income, which previously put SNAP out of reach for 44,165 applicants between March and July and ousted 2,185 households receiving benefits. Howard said many students who also did not qualify for food stamps because a portion of their parents’ income was counted against them will qualify this time. Hunger has soared in Louisiana since the onset of the pandemic, and the problem worsened as the state was hit with storm after storm during a record 2020 hurricane season.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The Legislature will consider a proposal that would require insurance companies to cover COVID-19 tests and immunizations and waive any co-payments related to them. Senate President Troy Jackson and Speaker of the House Ryan Fecteau, who are both Democrats, unveiled the “COVID-19 Patient Bill of Rights” on Monday. The proposal will be the first bill of the new session of the Maine Legislature, Democratic leaders said. Lawmakers were sworn in last month. Jackson said the proposal is about making sure patients around the state maintain access to critical health care services during the pandemic. “The COVID-19 Patient Bill of Rights brings us closer to the end of this crisis and the hold COVID-19 has had over our lives,” he said. The proposal also includes provisions that ease requirements for telehealth visits. And it’s designed to allow residents to get larger supplies of their prescriptions to reduce the number of visits to a pharmacy. The Maine Legislature Office of the Presiding Officers said the proposal “is about making sure nothing prevents Mainers from getting the health care they need to protect themselves, their families and loved ones from this serious virus.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, lawmakers will gather for their annual legislative session this week to focus largely on helping the state recover from the pandemic and to take up policing reforms. Gov. Larry Hogan announced a $1 billion COVID-19 relief plan Monday that will require legislative approval. It includes tax relief and payments of up to $450 for individuals and $750 for families in need who have claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit. Hogan also is proposing ending local and state income taxes on unemployment benefits. The plan includes $300 million in tax relief to help Maryland restaurants and small businesses by allowing them to keep up to $12,000 of sales tax over the next four months. On Wednesday, senators will convene for the first day of the 90-day session behind transparent enclosures that have been built around their desks. In the House, a quorum of delegates will convene in the House chamber, while others will gather in a nearby office building and participate remotely. The Capitol will be closed to the public for the session, as delegates who are immune-compromised will sit socially distanced in the gallery where members of the public usually sit.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Thousands of police officers, firefighters and other first responders in the state were scheduled to get their first dose of COVID-19 vaccines Monday. About 60 sites have been set up around the state to vaccinate an estimated 45,000 people over several weeks, state officials said. The city of Worcester has turned its senior center into a mass vaccination site for first responders from the city as well as the surrounding communities of Shrewsbury, Millbury, Leicester, Holden, Grafton and West Boylston. To make sure there are enough qualified people to administer the vaccines, students in UMass Medical School’s Graduate School of Nursing spent Saturday training more than 160 medical school students in intermuscular injection. “With COVID, we haven’t really been able to do that much recently, so having an opportunity like this is great for me to actually learn a skill,” medical student Charles Feinberg said. “It’s also fun to be a part of ending this pandemic that has ravaged our country.” The state so far has limited vaccinations to medical professionals and nursing home residents.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The state is ready to buy 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses directly from the manufacturer, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Monday, in a move she says would help the state ramp up its vaccination efforts. It comes as county health departments and hospital systems say the unpredictable and inadequate supply of vaccines has kept them from getting shots into arms. The request coincides with the state drastically expanding eligibility for the vaccine against the disease caused by the coronavirus. Although all Michiganders 65 and older – along with teachers, police officers and many more first responders – are eligible to receive the vaccine, a litany of challenges at every level of government means it will likely be some time before people seeking an appointment are actually injected. Whitmer sent a letter to Alex Azar, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, asking for permission to buy the doses from Pfizer. Currently, federal health officials coordinate the delivery of doses to every state in the country.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Bars and restaurants were permitted to resume indoor service with capacity limits Monday as COVID-19 cases and deaths across the state continue to fall. The Minnesota Department of Health on Monday reported 980 new infections and four deaths, marking the second time since October that single-day cases dipped below 1,000 and the first time since early November that the state reported single-digit deaths. The state’s totals now sit at 437,552 cases and 5,711 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Deaths and hospitalizations continue to decline, with the seven-day average of daily deaths dropping from 42.43 on Dec. 27 to 39.57 deaths per day Sunday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 numbered about 686 as of Sunday, including 141 in intensive care. Restrictions on bars and restaurants imposed by Gov. Tim Walz in the fall had generated sharp pushback, with some bars and restaurants defiantly reopening in recent weeks, risking fines and losses of their liquor licenses. The state has gone to court against several violators.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: The mayor says he won’t seek reelection this year, citing demands the coronavirus pandemic has placed on his day job as a physician. Dr. Steve Demetropoulos made the announcement on his Facebook page, WLOX-TV reports. “Thank you for all of your support and words of encouragement while I have been in office,” Demetropoulos said in a posted video. “I will continue to work hard on your behalf until my term ends.” For decades, Demetropoulos has worked as a physician and emergency medical director at Singing River Health Services. He was elected mayor of Pascagoula last year in a special election to fill the unexpired term of Dane Maxwell, who left to take office a state public service commissioner.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson began a new term in office Monday with an inaugural ceremony marking the start of Missouri’s bicentennial celebration but without a traditional party because of coronavirus precautions. The Republican governor was sworn in at a midday event on the grounds of the recently refurbished Capitol, with church bells ringing and artillery guns firing a salute – just as they have for past governors. He swore on a Bible given to him by his wife, and a B2 bomber flew low over the Capitol after Parson took the oath. He said he would work to provide the tools needed for doctors and nurses, law enforcement officers, farmers and teachers and said his job is to make life better for every Missourian. “I will care for the unborn to the elderly, the rich to the poor, regardless of the color of your skin,” he said. State officials hope that by August enough people will have been vaccinated against COVID-19 to safely hold a more elaborate celebration. It would coincide with the 200th anniversary of Missouri’s official admittance to the United States on Aug. 10, 1821.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: New data released by the Montana Food Bank Network shows more than 40% of respondents to a survey needed food assistance for the first time in their lives since the coronavirus pandemic began. While in 2019 only 1 in every 10 Montana residents needed food assistance from a pantry in the Montana Food Bank Network, in 2020, that figure could jump at least 29%, the Missoulian reports. “The number of people receiving food assistance for the first time after the COVID crisis was pretty astounding,” said Lorriane Burhop, the chief policy officer of the Montana Food Bank Network. The survey conducted from June to July garnered 917 responses across 30 counties in the state. The report said 70% of adults lost income or were furloughed as a result of the economic fallout from the pandemic. Burhop said that reveals how many people were making ends meet, but “the loss of just one or two paychecks all of a sudden pushes those households into crisis, and they need to turn to a local food pantry for help.”\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state appears to have avoided a post-Christmas spike in coronavirus cases that many had feared, although it’s not entirely clear why, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Monday. It may be because people followed virus safety guidelines warning against attending holiday gatherings, Ricketts said during a news conference. “I think a lot of Nebraskans made modifications to their holiday get-togethers,” he said. “I’d also say there’s also a lot of we don’t know about this virus.” The Republican governor said the decision not to impose a statewide lockdown may also have played a role because it helped avoid pandemic fatigue that leads some people to break the recommendations. Other states, such as California, have reported large increases in cases in December. “We tried to strike a balance in Nebraska,” Ricketts said. Nebraska has imposed restrictions on crowd sizes and public spaces but has never imposed a stay-at-home order or a statewide mask mandate. The state saw a sharp increase in virus hospitalizations in mid-November, raising concerns about bed space and burnout among hospital workers. The numbers have since declined, although public health officials say it’s important for residents to continue following social distancing safety guidelines.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The state has surpassed 250,000 coronavirus cases as of Monday morning, according to recent data from the Nevada Health Response COVID dashboard. Nevada Health Response reported 1,866 new COVID-19 cases Monday. In December, the Department of Health and Human Services first reported more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases, a little over seven weeks after the diagnosis of its 100,000th case Oct. 30. There have also been a total of 3,500 COVID-19-related deaths as of Monday morning. The 14-day test positivity rate is at 21.1%, significantly higher than the World Health Organization’s recommended 5% for economic reopening. Health officials are expecting to see the full impact of the New Year’s Eve related exposure and testing in the coming days, said Julia Peek, deputy administrator of Community Health Service, in a press conference Monday morning.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s failure to provide home health care services to qualifying elderly and disabled people puts them at risk of ending up in nursing homes that have been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic, according to a lawsuit filed against health officials Monday. The lawsuit was filed by New Hampshire Legal Assistance, Disability Rights Center-New Hampshire, AARP Foundation and the Nixon Peabody law office on behalf of four people enrolled in a Medicaid waiver program, called “Choices for Independence,” meant to help participants stay in their homes. “When CFI participants are deprived of the community-based long-term care that the state concedes they need and are entitled to, they face grave health risks,” AARP Foundation Senior Attorney M. Geron Gadd said in a statement. “Failure to properly administer the CFI Waiver not only deprives participants of their right to live as they choose, but also greatly increases their chances of exposure to COVID-19 in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.” Pamela Phelan, litigation director for the disability rights group, said the plaintiffs are “one crisis away” from unnecessary institutionalization.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state opened its second mass testing site for administering the COVID-19 vaccine Monday. Gov. Phil Murphy and Senate President Steve Sweeney, both Democrats, toured the facility at Rowan College in Gloucester County. A similar site opened Friday at a mall in Rockaway, Morris County. The sites, which are designed to vaccinate more than 2,000 people a day, are open now just for health care workers, police and fire officials. More than 100,000 doses of the vaccine of the roughly 400,000 the state has received have been set aside for long-term care staff and residents. Murphy also said Monday that more than 200,000 people have been vaccinated in the state so far, double the number from a week ago. There are also 200 sites at pharmacies, hospitals and urgent cares across the state that are dispensing the vaccine as well, but Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said the state has greater demand than supply of the shot. “We’re asking for your patience as we await a larger supply,” she said. More than 1 million people have signed up for the vaccine on the state’s preregistration site, she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The New Mexico Public Education Department is working with school districts and internet providers to expand broadband access in rural areas struggling with remote learning, according to lawyers for the state. In a response filed in court last week, the lawyers also said school funding hasn’t been cut since the pandemic started. The filing comes after plaintiffs in a landmark education lawsuit argued that the state’s attempts to provide internet access and learning devices were “woefully insufficient.” In a motion filed in December, the plaintiffs asked state District Judge Matthew Wilson to order the state to connect more children to online learning by immediately identifying students who lack laptops or tablets and providing internet vouchers for at-risk households. With in-person learning currently off limits, the inability to access remote classes has been a challenge for many rural and low-income students, particularly Native American children living on tribal lands. Court documents show the Public Education Department distributed about 6,200 laptops and 700 residential hot spots, all of which went to tribal communities.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New Yorkers are rushing to sign up for late-night COVID-19 vaccination slots as the city ramps up efforts to get people inoculated against the coronavirus, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday. Midnight-to-4 a.m. appointments at the two 24-hour vaccination sites the city has set up so far were quickly snapped up, de Blasio said at his daily coronavirus briefing. “So you can see New Yorkers are going to take advantage of this,” the mayor said. “The city that never sleeps, people are immediately grabbing those opportunities to get vaccinated.” More sites are being set up around the city, with the goal of administering 1 million doses this month, he said. De Blasio said the city is speeding up vaccinations, with more than 160 sites now open. He said nearly 101,800 shots were administered last week – about as many as the total from mid-December, when the first COVID-19 vaccine was approved for emergency use, through early January. State officials also announced new vaccination sites Monday, including one at the the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the Manhattan facility that was used as a field hospital last spring, and one at Jones Beach on Long Island.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Reports of sexual assaults against children in Asheville and Buncombe County rose sharply in 2020, and some experts attribute the increase to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a new state mandatory reporting law. The Buncombe County Sheriff’s Office had 35 sexual assault reports involving minors in 2019, which jumped to 65 reports through mid-December of 2020, an 86% increase, said spokesman Aaron Sarver. The Asheville Police Department reported a 55% increase, with 29 cases of sexual assaults on a juvenile in 2019 and 45 through mid-December, said spokeswoman Christina Hallingse. “The new law is resulting in more reports, and we are thankful to have it in place,” Sheriff’s Detective Sgt. Bryon Crisp said. But some experts fear the law has gone largely unnoticed, since it started gaining momentum just as COVID-19 hit and was mostly focused on the removal of the consent aspect of sexual assault. “School personnel are our No. 1 reporters, and if not for COVID and school being out for parts of this year, the numbers would likely have been higher,” Crisp said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s COVID-19 update released Monday showed no deaths for a third straight day – a mark that hasn’t been seen in nearly six months, although health officials noted that virus reports are typically sporadic over the weekend. The two previous days of no fatalities did not change the state’s death toll ranking of sixth-highest per capita in the country at about about 178 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the COVID Tracking Project. A total of 1,352 North Dakotans have died from complications due to the coronavirus. Health officials have confirmed 16 deaths this month, after 272 on December and 494 in November. “I’m cautiously optimistic,” state Health Department spokeswoman Nicole Peske said. “Typically we do have a lag in reporting from over the weekend, so we’ll see what tomorrow brings.” The state reported 121 new positive cases since Sunday, for a total of 94,830 cases since the start of the pandemic. The tracking project ranks that 48th in the country for new cases per capita. One in every 454 people in North Dakota tested positive in the past week.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Another 7,892 coronavirus cases were confirmed Monday – more than the three-week average of 7,410 new cases reported per day, according to the Ohio Department of Health. An additional 75 COVID-19 deaths were reported. So far, the virus has killed 9,702 Ohioans, state data shows. The pandemic has hit older Ohioans particularly hard, with 93% of deaths occurring in people age 60 and older, according to the state. The seven-day average positive test rate remained at 14% Saturday, the most recent day for which data is available. As the vaccine rollout continues, 304,976 Ohioans have received at least their first of two doses, marking an increase of 8,367 over the previous 24 hours. About 2.6% of Ohio’s 11.7 million residents have been vaccinated so far, according to the state. By Monday, 219 more Ohioans were hospitalized with COVID-19, less than the three-week average. There were 4,236 Ohioans hospitalized with the virus Monday, including 1,033 in intensive care units and 632 on ventilators, according to the health department.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Revenue collections for the calendar year 2020 declined by 3.8% as the pandemic swept the state, Treasurer Randy McDaniel said Friday. Oklahoma collected nearly $13.2 billion in taxes and fees for the year, $520.9 million less than the previous year. “The state’s economy declined in 2020,” McDaniel said in a statement. “Hopefully, we will see improvement in the months ahead as the (COVID-19) vaccine becomes widely available.” December collections of $1.16 billion were 0.4% below December 2019, an improvement from the 2% decline in year-to-year numbers reported in November, the treasurer reported. Tax collections on hard-hit oil and gas production for the year fell the most, down $396.3 million, or 38.6%, to a total of $630.1 million.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Two men are accused of converting for personal use more than $2.2 million in loans meant to help small businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. Andrew Aaron Lloyd, 50, of Lebanon, and Russell A. Schort, 38, of Myrtle Creek, are charged with wire fraud, bank fraud and money laundering in federal court in Eugene, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The FBI investigated after receiving information that the men fraudulently obtained Paycheck Protection Program loans. Between April 7 and May 8, financial records showed both applied for and received at least three loan payments using three different entities, according to a criminal complaint filed in court. Lloyd is accused of transferring at least $1.8 million from the loans to a personal online brokerage account and buying securities, the complaint says. His investments increased in value over several months and became worth over $10 million at the time of their seizure, according to prosecutors.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will soon begin vaccinating people 75 years and older and “essential workers” like police officers, grocery store clerks and teachers, the state health secretary said Monday. Pennsylvania remains focused on giving the COVID-19 vaccine to health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities – a group that numbers about 1 million – but is making plans to move to the next stage of its vaccination plan, Dr. Rachel Levine said at a media briefing. She was not more specific about the timing but said that second group, dubbed 1B, will be eligible to receive the vaccine before everyone in the first group has been inoculated. Phase 1B of the state’s coronavirus vaccination plan includes people 75 and older as well as front-line essential workers, a huge and diverse group that includes clergy, first responders, prison guards, school staff, and food, manufacturing, postal, public transportation and grocery store workers. Some providers are already vaccinating people in the second group when they don’t have someone in the first group readily available to receive it. Levine said that’s OK. “We don’t want any vaccine wasted,” she said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state is paying more than three-quarters of a million dollars to help Rhode Island College deal with a $10 million deficit brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. New York-based Alvarez & Marsal was hired by the state Council on Postsecondary Education on Dec. 14 and will earn $76,000 a week until its contract expires Feb. 28, The Boston Globe reports. “The need for this analysis stems from operational and financial challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated structural issues at the college,” according to the contract. The school announced last summer that the deficit would lead to executive pay cuts, layoffs and a hiring freeze. Council Chairman Tim DelGiudice defended the contract, saying the board is “concerned about the magnitude of the deficit at RIC,” and the consultant is getting paid fairly. Democratic State Rep. William O’Brien called the contract “absolutely ridiculous” and said the Legislature struggled to find an extra $600,000 for the school in the last budget. The money should have been spent on student scholarships, he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state will let people ages 70 and older schedule appointments for the COVID-19 vaccine starting Wednesday. Officials said Monday that they were confident the majority of people in the state’s earliest phase who wanted to be vaccinated – health care workers and those living and working in long-term care facilities – had already received their shots or scheduled appointments. “Because we’ve seen a dramatic acceleration in vaccine usage and appointments in the last week, we have decided to speed things up again,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement. “We know that those 70 and older are at the greatest risk of dying from COVID-19. Making sure they have expedited access to the vaccine will help save lives.” Officials estimate about 627,800 South Carolinians are 70 or older, and many have already received the vaccine because they were eligible earlier. Those who meet the age requirement are now eligible regardless of health status or preexisting conditions. Across the state, more than two-thirds of COVID-19 deaths have been among people ages 70 and older.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state is seeing coronavirus infections level off at a time many of its counterparts are experiencing their worst weekly death tolls yet. The South Dakota Department of Health announced 181 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday and 5,102 active cases. No new deaths were reported, with the total number of South Dakotans killed by the disease remaining at 1,585. Hospitalizations statewide increased by five to 242, with data showing just more than 41% of hospital beds and just fewer than 43% of adult intensive care unit beds available. And as many states are stumbling to enact vaccination plans, South Dakota came out of the gate hard, following the Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization for two mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna. At one point last week, more South Dakotans had received vaccinations as a percentage of the population than in any other state, according to tracking done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of Monday, 45,667 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine had been administered to 38,360 people.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee is urging seniors who contract COVID-19 to ask their health care providers about certain drugs that could prevent them from getting so sick that they wind up in the hospital. Lee told reporters Friday that monoclonal antibodies are available and very effective, especially for people who are 65 or older and have underlying health conditions that make them more susceptible to the virus. He said many people do not ask their health care providers about the treatment option. He said the drugs are effective when someone becomes sick but has not deteriorated enough to be hospitalized. State Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey said the therapeutics are 85% to 95% effective at preventing progression to severe disease. “We have not used our entire inventory, nowhere close to that,” Piercey said. “And so we really are trying to get the word out to seek treatment early once you test positive.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic has left a nearly $1 billion deficit in the state budget as the nation’s energy capital remains hampered by a slow recovery and a half-million fewer jobs than a year ago. The forecast Monday by state officials is far brighter than bleaker projections last summer, when Republican Comptroller Glenn Hegar estimated the shortfall could be four times as worse. Still, the deficit could result in cuts to state services as the GOP-controlled Legislature returns to work Tuesday. Lawmakers are coming back to the Capitol at a moment when spread of the virus has never been worse in Texas. More than 13,000 patients with COVID-19 are hospitalized, and the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in Texas is more than 23,000. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has kept some business restrictions in place but has ruled out more lockdowns. Hegar said the hospitality sector has been hardest-hit during the pandemic. He said a rebound in oil prices and production substantially improved the economic outlook in Texas from just a few months ago.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Spencer Cox presented his first budget proposal Monday, focusing on pandemic relief and further developing rural infrastructure. Cox, a Republican, stressed the importance of equity as he unveiled the proposed $21.7 billion budget from his administration’s new rural affairs office at Southern Utah University in Cedar City. The proposal would allocate at least $250 million toward fighting the coronavirus pandemic and $125 million on rural infrastructure, including expanding broadband access and electric vehicle charging stations. “It was critical that everyone in Utah felt like they were represented in this budget proposal, and certainly rural is a big piece of that,” Cox told reporters during a virtual briefing. The budget also includes a boost in education funding for higher education and K-12 schools, as well as spending for rural schools. Cox said he also supports putting $112 million toward providing $1,500 bonuses for all teachers in the state, a measure that has already been endorsed by state lawmakers. The governor’s proposal will be considered by the Legislature during its upcoming session, which starts next week.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: As officials work to gauge the impact of the recent holidays on the state’s COVID-19 trends, residents are once again prohibited from having gatherings among multiple households. Gov. Phil Scott had loosened restrictions to allow Vermonters to gather with one trusted household between Dec. 23 and Jan. 2. “While we’re providing a narrow path to very small holiday gatherings, we’d rather you not do it at all,” Scott said at the time. “But we’ve improved our numbers in Vermont, all other prevention measures will remain in place, and we understand that mental health has to be considered alongside physical health.” Vermont saw some higher coronavirus case numbers last week. On Jan. 6-7, new cases exceeded 200 each day. During the rest of the week, they did not drop below 100 a day, according to Health Department data. Before last week, cases for most days stayed below 100. “The teams are not finding evidence that significant outbreaks have occurred related to the types of gatherings that were allowed for the holidays and far more evidence of isolated cases related to community prevalence,” Levine said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Lawmakers are set to start this year’s legislative session focused on COVID-19 relief efforts and legalizing marijuana. The 2021 session will kick off Wednesday, with legislators meeting away from the Capitol as the state continues to wrestle with the impacts of a global pandemic that’s shut down schools, closed businesses and left more than 5,000 Virginians dead in the past 10 months, including a state senator. The House of Delegates plans to meet remotely, while the Senate will meet at a large conference center near the Capitol. This will be the second regular legislative session controlled by Democrats since they won control of the General Assembly for the first time in a generation in 2019. Republicans, upset that the House is meeting remotely and that lawmakers held an extended special session last year, have signaled they will limit what’s normally a 45-day session to only 30 days. Democrats can extend the the number of legislative working days by having Gov. Ralph Northam call a special session. State Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg said a top priority will be ensuring that schools have “robust” funding, including money for extra counselors, to help teachers deal with the fallout from the coronavirus once students return to the classroom.\n\nWashington\n\nRenton: One person has died in the midst of a coronavirus outbreak at a hotel where more than 200 homeless are sheltered, according to King County officials. A post-mortem coronavirus test found that the person was positive, according to the King County Medical Examiner, the Seattle Times reports. There have only been four deaths of COVID-19 among people staying in shelters, according to a King County online dashboard. The Renton Red Lion experienced an outbreak of 35 cases last month among its homeless guests and housed staff, in the middle of a spike in cases at homeless shelters, housing facilities and day programs across the county. It’s the most seen since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic at any of the hotels the county is using to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among homeless people. The Red Lion Hotel in Renton was opened by the county to keep them out of crowded bunk-bed or mats-on-the-ground shelters where officials feared COVID-19 could spread like wildfire.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new peak in confirmed coronavirus cases and a record 206 COVID-19-related deaths last week. Health workers also administered nearly 40,000 vaccine shots, doubling the pace of vaccinations. As the pandemic hits new deadly peaks, the state is now up to 92,070 vaccine doses administered. It closed the week leading the nation on number of doses per 100,000 residents. It next plans a big push to vaccinate teachers ahead of Gov. Jim Justice’s goal to restart in-person education at as many schools as possible Jan. 19. A record 7,888 positive cases were reported last week, up 4% from the previous week. West Virginia has set weekly virus records in eight of the past 11 weeks. “We’re getting close to really making some real headway with this terrible killer,” Justice said Monday. Urging residents to wear masks and get tested, he told them to “just help yourself and help your loved ones.” Meanwhile, Justice announced that high school basketball practices can start Feb. 15 for counties that have in-person classes. Games can begin on March 3, three months after the season originally was supposed to start.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Police and firefighters will be eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine starting Jan. 18, state health officials said Monday, while Gov. Tony Evers estimated that members of the general public won’t be vaccinated until June. Evers renewed his call for faster distribution of the vaccine from the federal government Monday, and state Republicans introduced a new, scaled-back response bill and scheduled it for a vote Tuesday. While Evers laid blame at the federal government for slow distribution of the vaccine, Republicans amped up their criticism of the midterm Democrat for not acting urgently enough. U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, a Republican from Janesville, accused Evers of having a “stunning lack of urgency in getting people the life-saving help they need.” For now, Wisconsin is focused on vaccinating more than 500,000 health care workers and nursing home residents. As of Monday, 151,502 people had been vaccinated, the state said. Assisted living residents were to be vaccinated starting in two weeks.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Campgrounds at Grand Teton National Park are expected to begin using an online reservation system later this month. Campgrounds on the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway will also begin taking reservations online beginning Jan. 26, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. Campgrounds in the park near Jackson previously operated on a first-come, first-served basis, the National Park Service said in a statement. The change to an advanced reservation system is expected to make accessing the campgrounds and the park easier by allowing visitors to plan their camping experiences without worrying about securing campsites. The system is also expected to mitigate traffic congestion and eliminate long lines. Members of the public had requested a reservation system for the campgrounds, parks service Public Affairs Officer Denise Germann said. “People would come before the break of dawn waiting for someone to leave or wait in line for hours,” Germann said. Grand Teton National Park recorded more than 3 million recreational visitors in 2019, the park service website said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/03/03/dropping-mandates-hiking-stress-opening-stadiums-news-around-states/115522630/", "title": "Dropping mandates, hiking for stress: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Hospitals support an extension of a statewide face mask order, at least until more people become vaccinated against COVID-19, the head of the Alabama Hospital Association said Monday. Gov. Kay Ivey is expected to announce this week whether she will extend the face covering mandate and other health orders that are set to expire Friday. A spokeswoman for the governor expressed optimism about state coronavirus numbers. “All along, Gov. Ivey has made clear that she prefers personal responsibility to government mandates. We are optimistic that our state is heading in the right direction, and we still have some work to be done,” Gina Maiola said Monday. Alabama, like much of the nation, has seen a significant drop in daily COVID-19 cases, but medical officials cautioned that the virus has not gone away, and uncertainty remains about the impact of emerging variants and upcoming events like spring break gatherings. “It just seems to me until we get more people vaccinated, the most prudent thing to do is to stay the course and continue to try to drive these numbers down, especially because we are still worried about the U.K. variant and the South African variant,” said Dr. Don Williamson, the former state health officer who now heads the Alabama Hospital Association.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state Department of Health and Social Services has reported fewer than 100 influenza cases during this flu season, down from close to 400 cases at this time last year. While 13 state residents died with the flu last season, so far this season, only two flu deaths have been recorded in Alaska, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The 2018-19 flu season yielded almost 12 times more flu cases in the state compared to the ongoing 2020-21 season, said Carrie Edmonson, a state nurse epidemiologist who compiles the state’s weekly “flu snapshot” report. During the 2019-2020 influenza season, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that influenza was associated with 38 million illnesses, 18 million medical visits, 405,000 hospitalizations and 22,000 deaths across the country. “This is the lowest flu season we’ve had on record,” according to a surveillance system that is about 25 years old, said Lynnette Brammer of the CDC. Health officials such as Edmonson have said that public health orders aimed at limiting the spread of the coronavirus have also prevented the flu from spreading. Officials also attribute the flu’s decline to less influenza testing and increased flu vaccinations, the newspaper reports.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey and state health officials have announced a new hybrid approach that provides residents 55 and older eligibility along with front-line essential workers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The state Department of Health Services opened 50,000 appointments Tuesday at two state-run sites – State Farm Stadium in Glendale and Phoenix Municipal Stadium – for the lowered age eligibility group. “As more vaccine reaches Arizona, we will continue refining our plan to maximize the benefits of this still-limited resource,” state health director Dr. Cara Christ said in a statement. “Moving to a hybrid approach will allow us to rapidly and efficiently administer the vaccine and provide all Arizonans with a clearer estimate of when they will be eligible to be vaccinated.” Since vaccine distribution began in December, authorities said more than 1.8 million doses have been administered, and about 600,000 Arizonans have received both shots. Meanwhile, Arizona’s COVID-19 death toll surpassed 16,000 on Tuesday as the state reported 81 additional deaths and 849 additional confirmed infection cases, the fewest daily new cases in three months.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Republican lawmakers on Monday proposed overhauling the state’s Medicaid expansion to encourage recipients to work after Arkansas’ work requirement was halted by the courts and President Joe Biden’s administration. Proposed legislation would continue using Medicaid funds to place recipients on private health insurance, but those who don’t work or go to school could be moved to the traditional fee-for-service Medicaid program. More than 300,000 people are currently on the state’s Medicaid expansion. “No one loses health care benefits, but there are incentives to encourage that kind of behavior and that kind of progress in life,” the Republican governor said at a news conference. The work requirement had been approved in 2018 by former President Donald Trump’s administration, and thousands had lost coverage before it was halted. “These dollars are essential to keeping our rural hospitals and our health care infrastructure intact and stabilized,” said Republican Sen. Missy Irvin, a sponsor of the legislation. The proposal includes other changes, including a home-visiting program for at-risk moms and a new program to connect young adults in targeted populations such as veterans and former foster children with community organizations.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Indoor dining, movie theaters and gyms in the city can reopen within 24 hours, an upbeat Mayor London Breed announced Tuesday as the county officially moved into a less-restrictive tier of the state’s coronavirus strategy. San Francisco and Santa Clara counties in the Bay Area join five other counties in moving to the second-most restrictive operating tier. Much of the state’s population remains in the most restrictive purple tier. “This is the beginning of a new day in San Francisco,” Breed said from Pier 39, an area popular with tourists in picturesque Fisherman’s Wharf. But she warned residents to wear masks and maintain proper social distance even as she encouraged them to explore the city. “When your waiter walks up to your table, put your mask on. When you go to the restroom, put your mask on,” she said. Business activity in San Francisco shut down in early December after several Bay Area counties preemptively went into lockdown. Outdoor dining, outdoor museums, and some indoor and outdoor personal services reopened in late January after the state called off its regional stay-home order, but the economic toll has been grim. Rents plummeted as tech workers who could work from anywhere fled for cheaper homes with more elbow room. Tourism has also been dealt a massive blow.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The state has passed its goal of getting 75% of teachers and child care workers a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine by March5. The Colorado State Joint Information Center said Monday afternoon that as of its latest estimates, almost 78% of the 120,000 eligible teachers and child care workers had received a first dose. Pre-K through 12th grade teachers and child care workers were first eligible for the vaccine Feb. 8. At a late January press conference announcing their eligibility, Gov. Jared Polis said all teachers who wanted a vaccine would get one within a three-week period. Polis later said the goal was for 75% of those eligible to have a first dose by March 5. The Colorado State Joint Information Center said the state calculates its percentage based on updates from school districts provided to the Colorado Department of Education. Among educators, just pre-K through 12th grade teachers, support staff and child care workers are currently eligible for the vaccine. Polis announced Friday that student-facing staff in community colleges and universities will be eligible for vaccines when the state moves to Phase 1.B4, likely at the end of March.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A package of tax changes, including a plan to prevent 110,000 commuters with out-of-state jobs from being double-taxed because they’ve been working at home during the pandemic, received final legislative approval Monday. The bill, which also includes provisions to help welfare recipients with liens on their properties and to steer more funding to communities with nontaxable property, cleared the Senate by a bipartisan vote of 28-7. The legislation, which already passed in the House of Representatives, now awaits Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s signature. Supporters of the bill, including senators in the western portion of the state, said it was unfair that many of their constituents who work in New York faced the prospect of having to pay both Connecticut and New York income tax when they were working from home during the pandemic. The issue also affects Connecticut residents who work in neighboring Massachusetts. “These commuters have not benefited from New York services over the last year,” said Sen. Will Haskell, D-Westport, noting that many have “not stepped foot” in New York since many employers told workers to stay home. The underlying issue is ultimately expected to be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: With typical getaway options limited due to COVID-19, many have turned to camping for a safe, socially distanced vacation. Delaware state campgrounds reopened in June with new precautions like increased sanitation and masks required for children kindergarten-age and older. Stephanie Sanford didn’t camp much before the pandemic, but she’s recently planned several trips and found them to be a great antidote to pandemic-related anxieties. She has since been encouraging friends and family to turn to the outdoors as a way to process and relieve the stress of COVID-19. “I remember just feeling so alleviated from this pressure that was mounting from being a mom, being a wife, being a teacher in the house,” she said. The quiet of the outdoors, Sanford said, “really puts your mind at ease.” She has even gotten her friends to join her on her outdoor trips by starting a group called Black Girls Hike Too, which now has more than 1,000 followers. Amid the disproportionate impact of pandemic-related stress and anxiety on Black women, Sanford strongly urged friends and family to challenge the idea that the outdoors wasn’t for them.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The process to book a vaccine appointment has become so strenuous that some are concerned it could create even more hesitancy among residents who are already skeptical or don’t have the technical experience or means, WUSA-TV reports. Katie Wall-Mansen, fearing technical hurdles to sign up online might be pushing more people away, started the group DC Vaccine Coalition in January after reading many comments on neighborhood-based social network Nextdoor about how confusing it was, especially for older citizens, to reserve a slot. “I fear we’re actually creating a new form of vaccine hesitancy, and that’s been so difficult for people to register for a vaccine that I understand people’s plight and that they may sit back and not want to do this again,” Wall-Mansen said. Her group has grown to include about 50 volunteers working to make the process easier by finding appointments online. They start by looking at avenues outside the DC Health portal system to find availability at hospitals or community clinics. Wall-Mansen said volunteers keep a resident’s information populated to quickly enter it into the system, use different browsers simultaneously and ensure they’re on the call line when appointments become available. “We organized chaos, but we are in and willing,” she said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis reflected as much on the past year as on his priorities for 2021 during a State of the State address Tuesday that touted his response to the coronavirus pandemic. DeSantis, a staunch opponent to lockdowns and business restrictions, said Florida is in much better shape than other states because it is open for business. “While so many other states kept locking people down over these many months, Florida lifted people up,” DeSantis said. “Florida’s schools are open, and we are one of only a handful of states in which every parent has a right to send their child to school in person. All Floridians have a right to earn a living, and our citizens are employed at higher rates than those in the nation as a whole. Every job is essential.” DeSantis’ speech marked the first day of the 2021 legislative session. Ironically, while he was talking about keeping the state open, the Capitol was closed to the public because of the pandemic. DeSantis credited his refusal to return to shutdowns and business restrictions for Florida being in a better financial situation than forecasters predicted last year. “Economic lockdowns are a luxury of the largely affluent Zoom class. Many Floridians can’t do their jobs over a computer. They need to show up,” he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: More than 2 million Georgians have received at least the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but the numbers of positive cases and community transmission remain high. The state’s confirmed coronavirus case count rose by 1,214 since Sunday to reach 819,730 on Monday, while the statewide death toll rose by 80 to reach 15,148, according to figures posted Monday afternoon by the Georgia Department of Public Health. As of Monday, the state had administered 2,060,352 doses of COVID-19 vaccine for a rate of 19,388 vaccines administered per 100,000 Georgians, as reported by the state’s new vaccine dashboard. Of Georgia’s 56,089 confirmed COVID-19 cases in patients who were hospitalized when the case was reported to DPH or when interviewed, 50 patients included in that total were added Monday.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Maui Health plans to increase the number of first-dose COVID-19 vaccination appointments it offers, while Kauai has widened the availability of vaccine doses. The nonprofit health care organization for Maui and Lanai said it will raise the number of weekly vaccines to 3,000 beginning this week and 4,000 next week, The Maui News reports. Maui Health was nearing completion of appointments that were rescheduled after clinics closed in January because of vaccine shortages, spokeswoman Tracy Dallarda said late last week. Maui Health opened a satellite vaccine clinic Wednesday at a Kaiser Permanente facility in Kihei that will operate Wednesdays and Fridays by appointment. “What we’re trying to do is really ramp up the number of appointments that we can take,” Dallarda said. The County of Kauai has opened its vaccine distribution to residents 75 and over, The Garden Island reports. The island’s clinics previously focused on vaccinating front-line essential workers. The Hawaii State Department of Health said 59% of Kauai residents in the older age bracket had received at least one dose of a vaccine.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s suicide rate dropped steeply before the pandemic, but the trend may have reversed in 2020, according to federal data. Idaho had the biggest drop of any state from 2018 to 2019, according to the data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The nearly 15% decline in Idaho meant 52 fewer suicides in 2019 compared to the previous year. “Some of the efforts that we had made were starting to show,” said George Austin of the Idaho Suicide Prevention Hotline, referring to statewide efforts to raise awareness and reduce stigma around asking for help. The drop in suicides came after Idaho’s worst reported year for suicide deaths in 2018. Idaho’s 2019 figures still put the state in the top 10 in the U.S. for age-adjusted suicide rates. Based on preliminary data, 2020 may be worse than Idaho’s 2018 peak, Boise State Public Radio reports. Austin said that could be due in large part to the pandemic, which has caused isolation, job loss, death of loved ones and relationship difficulties.\n\nIllinois\n\nChampaign: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that it has authorized the emergency use of a coronavirus saliva test developed by the University of Illinois. Despite the lack of FDA approval until Monday, officials said the test, known as covidSHIELD, has been used more than 1.5 million times at the university’s campuses in Urbana, Springfield and Chicago. University officials also said that because the test had been properly lab-certified, dozens of organizations around the world were sold the test. In a statement, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the emergency-use authorization unlocks federal COVID-19 funding to provide 1 million tests to public universities in Illinois. “Even as we lead large-population states in vaccinations, widespread testing remains a critical tool in combating this pandemic, and I’m dedicating $20 million in CARES Act funding to provide 1 million tests to Illinois’ other public universities under the FDA’s emergency use authorization,” Pritzker said in a statement. There has been interest from school systems, universities and corporations in using the test because the process is less invasive that the nose-swab method, and results can be obtained within 24 hours.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Residents ages 55 to 60 are now eligible for COVID-19 vaccines, health officials announced Tuesday in the latest expansion of the state’s vaccine rollout. The Indiana Department of Health said the expansion is the first step in making the free shots available to the nearly 858,000 Hoosiers in their 50s. Indiana’s vaccine eligibility pool had previously included people age 60 and older, health care workers, long-term care residents and first responders. Additional groups will be added as more vaccine becomes available, officials said. The state’s current vaccine distribution plan indicates Hoosiers ages 50 to 55 are next in line to receive shots, although there are no specific timelines in place for when new eligibility expansions will take effect. The state health department also announced the opening of three mass vaccination sites through partnerships with the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the University of Notre Dame and Ivy Tech Community College in Sellersburg. A fourth mass vaccination site is being planned in Gary, officials said. The clinics will offer the Johnson & Johnson one-dose vaccine, which was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Saturday. To schedule a vaccine, Hoosiers can visit ourshot.in.gov and select a location from one of nearly 400 clinics around the state.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Meatpackers will be vaccinated this week as newly approved shots from Johnson & Johnson arrive. The Iowa Department of Public Health announced Monday that the state will receive 33,400 doses of the single-shot vaccine among the 100,000 shots it’s getting this week and will send the new version to communities with a large numbers of workers in the food, agricultural, distribution and manufacturing sectors “who have been disproportionally affected by the virus.” Meatpacking workers, at the center of the state’s largest initial COVID-19 outbreaks last spring, will get vaccines beginning Wednesday at Tyson Foods’ Waterloo and Perry plants. The company said employees in Columbus Junction, Council Bluffs, Independence and Storm Lake will receive shots later in the week. JBS announced that its Marshalltown employees will get the shots Friday, and its Ottumwa workers will get vaccinated March 12. Both Tyson and JBS are offering incentives to workers to get the shot, with Tyson giving four hours’ pau to workers who have to come in on a day off and JBS offering a $100 bonus. Five Republicans have introduced a bill in the Legislature that includes a ban on extra payments for workers receiving the vaccine, contending companies should not treat workers differently based on willingness to be vaccinated.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A local hospital has raised its minimum hourly wage to $15. The University of Kansas Health System said in a news release that the change will be reflected in paychecks beginning Friday. The announcement came nearly a year into a global pandemic that has hit hospital staffs around the country particularly hard and as President Joe Biden’s administration has been pushing for an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The hospital has not laid off or furloughed staff during the pandemic, it said in the release, adding that hourly employees who were already making $15 per hour or more also saw increases to account for experience and responsibility-based pay differences. “This pay increase is another step to support frontline workers and the critical role they play in providing care in our communities,” the release said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Legislation that would provide broad protections to shield businesses from coronavirus-related lawsuits won approval from the state Senate after a long debate Monday evening. Republican Senate President Robert Stivers described the measure as a necessary step to help businesses recover from pandemic-related setbacks without the fear of potential virus-related lawsuits. “We cannot afford to put another straw on that camel’s back that may break it,” said Stivers, the bill’s lead sponsor. “Because many are already broken, we don’t need to see any more become broken because they are in fear of litigation.” The proposal passed the chamber on a 24-11 vote and now goes to the House, which passed its version of virus-related liability protections for businesses in January. Republicans dominate both chambers and will try to reach agreement on a final version before this year’s session ends in late March. The Senate measure ran into resistance from some lawmakers who said it’s too broadly written and favors some Kentuckians over others. Republican Sen. Phillip Wheeler said the bill “devalues certain lives” by “creating a class of people who are protected and sacrificing other people who don’t receive protections but yet may be injured by the actions of the protected class.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Bars can reopen indoors, restaurants can hold more customers, and churches won’t have capacity limits for worship services, under loosened coronavirus rules announced Tuesday by Gov. John Bel Edwards. The eased Phase 3 restrictions – which come as Louisiana’s new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have continued to drop – will take effect Wednesday across the state, unless a local mayor or parish president enacts tougher limits. A statewide mask mandate in place since July will remain. The new requirements will stay in place until March 31. “We’re currently moving in the right direction and have been for several weeks now, and certainly we’re all gratified by that,” the Democratic governor said. “We know, however, we still have a lot of work to do before we get out of this pandemic.” Restaurants, cafes, spas, salons, movie theaters and other nonessential businesses that had been limited to 50% of their occupancy limit can move to 75% capacity. The exception is for gyms, which Edwards is requiring to stay at 50% capacity. Music will be allowed at indoor locations again, though with a long list of requirements for venues from the fire marshal’s office and no dance floors allowed. Conferences and other gatherings can restart at convention centers, if the events get fire marshal approval.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A new emergency rental assistance program designed to help tenants has started accepting applications. MaineHousing said the program launched Monday and is funded by the federal coronavirus stimulus package that passed in December and provided $200 million in rental assistance funding to the state. The agency said the program allows applicants to apply for funds to cover rent and utilities owed back to March 13, 2020. Saying it expects high demand at the beginning of the program, MaineHousing is asking tenants and landlords to communicate in advance of applying. Daniel Brennan, director of MaineHousing, said tenants are in need of the assistance. “We are all living under the direction to stay ‘safe at home.’ We need to make sure that every Mainer has a stable home for themselves and their families,” he said. Meanwhile, city officials said an updated outdoor dining and retail permitting program will be in effect from April 2021 to April 2022. Portland officials said in a statement that the program will allow retailers and restaurants to “apply to expand into public spaces, including closed streets, parklets, the public right-of-way, and parks.” City Manager Jon Jennings said the changes will allow businesses to operate safely for the coming year.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Officials announced a plan Monday to improve equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in Baltimore amid continuing criticism about the state’s rollout, particularly in its largest city. The Baltimore Convention Center Field Hospital – a public-private partnership of the state health department, the University of Maryland Medical System and Johns Hopkins Medicine – will put an emphasis on vaccinating the most vulnerable communities in Baltimore, Gov. Larry Hogan’s office announced. Leadership at the field hospital has been working closely with hospital-based community health teams to encourage eligible individuals who live in high-vulnerability ZIP codes to register for vaccinations, the governor’s office said. Meanwhile, lawmakers on a panel holding weekly hearings on Maryland’s vaccine rollout continued to criticize aspects of it. Sen. Mary Washington, D-Baltimore, asked the acting health secretary, Dennis Schrader, about a comment the governor made last week that Baltimore had received more vaccine than the city was “entitled to,” and she asked Schrader how he planned to address “the negative damage” caused by Hogan’s comment that outraged city officials. Schrader said Washington was asking him a political question, and he was staying focused “on process and facts.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Residents have increasingly been going online during the COVID-19 crisis to purchase nearly everything under the sun – including alcohol. State alcohol regulators have seen a 300% uptick in direct-to-consumer alcohol deliveries throughout the pandemic, state Treasurer Deborah Goldberg said during a virtual hearing on the state budget Tuesday. Under state law, a direct wine shipper may send up to 12 cases of wine per year to a Massachusetts resident. As treasurer, Goldberg oversees the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, which helps enforce liquor laws and has also been enforcing the state’s COVID-19 protocols. Since last August, inspectors visited more than 21,000 licensed alcohol businesses in the state and found 98% in compliance with Gov. Charlie Baker’s pandemic-related executive orders, Goldberg said. The Democrat also oversees the state lottery, which she said took a hit in the early months of the pandemic. Overall sales last March, April and May fell by a combined $244 million compared to the same period in 2019. “Since then, our revenues have stabilized and improved,” said Goldberg, who also said the use of contactless payment options has soared during the pandemic, and the lottery also needs to have the flexibility to expand cashless transactions.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Tuesday announced the further loosening of Michigan’s coronavirus restrictions, easing capacity limits in restaurants and a host of other businesses while also allowing for larger indoor and outdoor gatherings. The revised state health department order takes effect Friday. The Democratic governor also said families will be able to visit nursing homes after being tested for the coronavirus. Restaurants and bars, now limited to 25% capacity inside, will have a 50% restriction. A 10 p.m curfew will shift to 11 p.m. Venues such as movie theaters, bowling alleys, banquet halls and casinos will have higher capacity limits, too.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: More than 45,000 doses of the newly approved Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine should arrive this week, state health officials said Monday. Minnesota Department of Health spokesman John Schadl said the order for the first shipment of the single-dose vaccine was placed Sunday night. It usually takes a couple of days for processing and shipping, he said. “More doses of safe and effective vaccine in the state means more people can get protected more quickly,” the Health Department said in a release Monday. “The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a game-changer that will help us quickly provide immunity to even more Minnesotans.” Last week, Gov. Tim Walz said the state plans on vaccinating 70% of seniors in the state with at least one dose by the end of March before expanding vaccine eligibility. He said it could be done in less time with the new vaccine. “That was not factored in, and again the good thing on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is it’s one dose,” Walz said. Health officials on Monday confirmed 636 new COVID-19 cases and three new deaths, increasing the state’s totals to 485,230 positive tests and 6,486 fatalities since the start of the pandemic.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said as of Wednesday, he is getting rid of most mask mandates that he had imposed to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. He is also lifting most other restrictions, including limits on seating in restaurants. “The governor’s office is getting out of the business of telling people what they can and cannot do,” the Republican governor said during a news conference Tuesday. Until now, most of Mississippi’s 82 counties had been under a mask mandate for months. Reeves said the number of people hospitalized because of the virus has decreased in recent weeks, and vaccination numbers are increasing. Reeves said rules for K-12 schools are not changing. Schools will still require masks where social distancing is not possible. There are also still limits on seating at K-12 school events: 25% capacity indoors and 50% outdoors. The new capacity for seating at indoor arenas for colleges is 50%. Club areas in arenas are limited to 75% of their seating capacity. Reeves said he is encouraging mask-wearing but not requiring it and is asking people to follow recommendations from the state health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs. Dobbs said it’s still a good idea for people to avoid large, unmasked gatherings. “There’s no way in heck I would go sit in a crowded bar right now,” he said.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Residents wouldn’t have to repay millions of dollars in federal unemployment benefit overpayments under legislation advanced in the GOP-led state House on Monday. At issue are mistakes by the state’s Labor Department as it was struggling to quickly handle a huge influx of unemployment claims during the coronavirus pandemic. The agency ended up doling out $146 million to 46,000 Missourians who didn’t qualify. Now Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s administration is trying to get those overpayments back. Republican bill sponsor Rep. J. Eggleston said many of the workers who got the federal aid spent already spent it on rent, mortgage payments, utilities and other needs and don’t have the money to repay the government. “What the financial recipients thought was a lifeline of survival has now become an anchor of debt,” he said. The House bill, given initial approval in a voice vote, would stop the state from collecting federal unemployment overpayments. The measure would only give amnesty to people who applied for unemployment help in good faith and received it because of a mistake by the state Labor Department. People who committed fraud would still have to pay the federal funding back. Missourians also would still be on the hook to repay unemployment aid received from the state.\n\nMontana\n\nBrowning: The Blackfeet Nation on Tuesday began offering COVID-19 vaccines to people 18 and older. The tribe is holding two clinics this week. The Blackfeet Community Hospital is offering vaccines Tuesday through Friday, and the Southern Piegan Clinic was offering immunizations Tuesday. Both said they were accepting walk-ins, but vaccinations at the hospital can also be scheduled by appointment. The tribe expects to receive a shipment of the new Johnson and Johnson vaccines next week. The tribe on Monday reported eight active coronavirus cases on the reservation and has recorded 1,383 total cases since March. Forty-seven tribal members have died from the respiratory illness caused by the virus. More than half of Blackfeet Reservation’s 10,000 residents have received a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the tribe’s Public Information Officer Jim McNeely. “We’re moving along quite fast – faster than we expected,” said McNeely, who credits the successful vaccine rollout to the state and the Indian Health Service. “At the rate we’re going, it may be possible for our community to be fully vaccinated by mid-May.” He said the Blackfeet Nation is still encouraging people to get tested for the coronavirus by offering incentives at test sites, including food, cleaning supplies and gift cards.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: More than 84,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered across the state last week. As of Sunday, more than 428,031 doses have been given to those in Phase 1 priority groups, according to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Additionally, as of Sunday more than 145,000 Nebraskans have completed vaccinations, which represents 9.8% of Nebraskans 16 and older. For more information and to register for a vaccine, residents can visit Finish Strong Nebraska, the state’s official vaccination campaign, at FinishStrong.Ne.Gov. Once registered on the portal, Nebraska residents will be notified when COVID-19 vaccination begins in their area. A Spanish translation of the website is also available. As of Monday, more than 220,409 Nebraskans have registered to receive the vaccine at vaccinate.ne.gov.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Officials are preparing to cede decision-making power over the state’s coronavirus measures to county officials. In the five rural counties that have passed resolutions condemning the restrictions, it’s unclear how much will change. “We just plan to continue as we’ve been. We want to be smart, but we want to protect freedom. In the resolution we passed, we give businesses restrictions as they see fit,” White Pine County Commissioner Ian Bullis said of the state’s plan to let counties control some guidelines starting May 1. To prevent deaths and keep hospitals from reaching capacity, Nevada has limited the number of people who can gather at places like churches, casinos and restaurants. Officials have mandated face coverings and, for most of the past year, not allowed conventions, trade shows and live entertainment. The restrictions, though not as stringent as those in some neighboring states, have stirred up anger in rural counties suspicious of government overreach, prompted debate about the extent of the governor’s powers and raised questions about consistent enforcement of coronavirus containment measures. In November, White Pine County became the first of five counties to declare an economic state of emergency rebuffing Gov. Steve Sisolak’s containment measures.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: New businesses that opened just in time to be slammed by the coronavirus pandemic would be eligible for more help under a bill before a state Senate committee Tuesday. The state distributed more than $400 million in federal funding through its Main Street Relief Fund for small businesses, but only those that were established before May 26, 2019, were eligible. “This cut out a large segment of new small businesses which fill new needs in our communities and create the most new jobs at a time when they were really struggling,” said Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, D-Portsmouth. Her bill would remove the cutoff date for future funding. “The newer the business, the more critical supporting it is,” she told the Senate Commerce Committee. Lizabeth Tompkins had worked at the Puttin’ on the Glitz boutique in Portsmouth for several years before becoming the owner in September 2019. While she was able to get a loan to help recover from being shut down for three months during the pandemic, she wasn’t eligible for the grant funding. “I don’t like asking for help. That’s not how I got here, but this is my only source of income,” she said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: NJ Transit will receive 300 vaccines this week to distribute to its front-line workers at the agency’s vaccination sites in Maplewood and Camden thanks to an agreement struck with the state Department of Health. The vaccine will be available to NJ Transit workers who are currently eligible – including those 65 and older, those with chronic medical conditions and smokers – but have not gotten it yet. The workers must also be customer-facing employees, such as bus operators, ticket collectors, train conductors and police officers. Eligible agency employees can begin signing up for appointments Wednesday, and the first doses will be given Thursday in Maplewood and Friday in Camden. “We are grateful to the DOH for providing 300 doses,” NJ Transit spokesman Jim Smith wrote in an email. “We feel this is a great opportunity to initiate the vaccination process for eligible transit workers.” NJ Transit, which employs nearly 12,000 people, became an approved state vaccine distributor in January after securing freezers, getting its two vaccination sites set up and developing its own appointment system.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state Senate has advanced a bill that would require public schools to extend the academic calendar next year in an effort to help students catch up from the loss of learning during the pandemic. If passed, the bill would stretch the school calendar next year by 25 days for K-5 students and 10 days for most 6-12 schools by requiring them to participate in extended learning programs already paid for by the Legislature. Schools had been slow to embrace the programs, citing staffing issues, despite the fact that more work would increase teacher take-home pay by 6% to 14% depending on the grade level. Then the programs were canceled because of the pandemic. “Extending the school year is shown to be one of the best things you can do for student achievement,” said Democratic bill sponsor President Pro Tem Sen. Mimi Stewart, citing legislative research that drove the passage of the programs in 2019. The mandate for next year would only take effect if Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s current health order curbing in-person schooling is lifted, and it would only last for the 2021-2022 school year. On the other side of the Capitol Complex, the House is considering a measure that would allow for longer school days to use the funds without extending the school calendar.\n\nNew York\n\nOlean: St. Bonaventure University President Dennis DePerro died Monday from complications of COVID-19, according to the university. He was 62. DePerro was hospitalized since late December after testing positive for the coronavirus on Christmas Eve. The university said it’s unknown how he contracted it. He had been on a ventilator since mid-January. “Words simply can’t convey the level of devastation our campus community feels right now,” said Joseph Zimmer, provost and vice president for Academic Affairs. Zimmer was named acting president of the private Franciscan university late last month in DePerro’s absence. The university flag will fly at half-staff through the end of March on the western New York campus, where the spring semester began Jan. 25 with about 85% of classes taking place in person. DePerro became president June 1, 2017, and implemented new strategies that increased freshmen enrollment. He launched the “A Bolder Bonaventure” capital campaign to fund the university’s School of Health Professions and last year reconstituted a presidential commission to improve diversity, equity and inclusion on campus. “What I’ll miss more than anything was his uncanny ability to make you feel better even on your worst days. He had a unique gift,” university spokesman Tom Missel said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper announced Tuesday that the state will more quickly open up COVID-19 vaccine eligibility to those who are front-line essential workers or have serious underlying health issues. The state had been set to allow a broad group of workers ranging from mail carriers to elected officials to begin receiving vaccines March 10. But with approval of a single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine and more than 80,000 doses arriving soon, public health officials will now allow front-line workers to get shots starting Wednesday – a week earlier than anticipated. Meanwhile, North Carolinians under 65 with high-risk medical conditions that put them at greater risk of severe illness if they become infected with the virus will become eligible March 24. “We’ll open group 4 first to people with medical conditions that put them at a higher risk for severe risk to COVID-19 illness,” Cooper said in a news conference. “The third vaccine and improving vaccine supply of the two we already are getting will help us get more people vaccinated more quickly.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state is rolling out another round of grants to help communities prevent suicides, and state officials say there’s more urgency with this funding, given the pandemic and its added stresses for many residents. The Department of Human Services’ Behavioral Health Division will award $750,000, to be shared by up to 19 community groups, local and tribal governments and nonprofits to develop or increase suicide-prevention strategies. While more people already may have reached out for help, division director Pamela Sagness said history shows that for others, it can take longer for the effects of a crisis to surface. “This is the time for us to be gearing up to really not only support individuals that are already feeling the mental health impact but those that will potentially be feeling those impacts for several years,” she said. The deadline for groups to apply for grant funding is Friday. Sagness said the most recent state data, from last spring, found nearly 70% of respondents reported an increase in mental health struggles. Nationally, the group Mental Health America reported nearly 180,000 Americans had frequent thoughts of suicide and self-harm last year – the largest number in its reporting history.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: An outdated reporting system that led to the undercount of more than 4,200 COVID-19 deaths will now be retired, the state’s health department director said Tuesday. The Ohio Department of Health will retire the manual system it used to provide a real-time death toll from the pandemic over the past year after a breakdown in the system led to a massive adjustment last month to the documented death toll. “We have been building the plane as we fly it,” Health Director Stephanie McCloud said Tuesday. “And unfortunately, we weren’t given all new parts to build it well. We did not have time to stop the plane to land it, get the new parts that we need and then take off again.” The department was switching Tuesday to relying exclusively on a slower but more reliable and accurate system to count virus-related deaths, McCloud said. The agency had used this slower process as a quality check to reconcile the data from the manual system that failed. The slower system is based on death certificates sent to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s infectious diseases database, which are confirmed as COVID-19 deaths before being added to the state’s database. The shift will result in only confirmed deaths being listed every few days instead of probable deaths listed daily.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association said Tuesday that he is encouraged and happy that the State Department of Health will begin using U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 death reports, which show about 2,500 more deaths due to the coronavirus than the department has reported. “As physicians we want to make sure that these numbers are accurate and timely, and certainly one of the best ways to look at COVID deaths is to look at death certificate information,” which is prepared by doctors and used by the CDC to report deaths, said Dr. George Monks. “I was encouraged by … our state epidemiologist, that he addressed that issue, that there was a big discrepancy.” State epidemiologist Dr. Jared Taylor said Monday that the state health department would begin work to present the death toll reported by the CDC National Center for Health Statistics. “The difference in death counts is that the CDC values they are citing are derived from death certificates,” Taylor said. “OSDH counts are derived from people who are first diagnosed as COVID positive, then die, and we do a full investigation” into the cause of the death.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: State health officials said Monday that they expect to receive 34,000 doses of the newly approved Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine this week. The two vaccines that Oregon has had on hand – Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna – both have reported efficacy rates around 95%, require two doses and need ultra-cold storage. Johnson & Johnson’s is a single-dose vaccine and can be stored in a refrigerator for months but has a lower efficacy rate. “Having access to a third highly effective COVID-19 vaccine is a game changing development for Oregonians,” said Paul Cieslak, the medical director for communicable diseases and immunization for the Oregon Health Authority. “We believe this vaccine is effective against the virus, and a one-dose regimen will allow us to vaccinate more Oregonians more quickly.” For the past month, health officials have reiterated that although the vaccine supply is increasing, it’ll take time for everyone who wants to be vaccinated to move through the process. As of Monday, people who are 65 years and older became eligible to receive doses of the vaccine, joining other elderly residents, people in long-term care facilities, adults in custody, educators and health care workers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Fans will soon return to pro sports venues whose stands have been empty for a year or more after the state on Monday eased restrictions on large gatherings to reflect a sustained slide in new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Under the relaxed gathering limits announced by Gov. Tom Wolf, outdoor venues are now allowed to host events up to 20% of their maximum capacity, while indoor occupancy will be 15% of maximum capacity, regardless of venue size. The Pittsburgh Penguins said the ice hockey team would allow 2,800 fans into PPG Paints Arena for Tuesday’s game against the Philadelphia Flyers. It will be the Pens’ first home game with fans since a victory over Montreal on March 8, 2020. Pittsburgh Pirates President Travis Williams said opening day at PNC Park “will be much more than a game. It will mark a significant step in overcoming this pandemic.” In Philadelphia, the Wells Fargo Center said it would quickly allow fans into Flyers and 76ers games if city officials give the go-ahead.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city has received permission from state health officials to start vaccine registrations for residents 50 and older who live in the hardest-hit neighborhoods, the mayor announced Tuesday. Those eligible will get their vaccinations at neighborhood clinics, Mayor Jorge Elorza and City Council President Sabina Matos said in a statement. “The city is working closely with the Rhode Island Department of Health and community partners to reach residents in communities that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19,” Elorza said. State-run mass vaccination sites and retail pharmacies will continue vaccinating eligible residents 65 or older. The city’s Clinica Esperanza has been granted authority to vaccinate residents 18 and older provided they also help register and bring an older adult 65 or older to be vaccinated, they said, but only if they live in certain hard-hit ZIP codes within the city. Clinica Esperanza primarily serves the city’s immigrant communities and saw a coronavirus positivity rate of 23% at the clinic in February. Appointments are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Vaccines are available to all eligible residents of any immigration status. Eligible residents can sign up on the city’s registration portal.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The majority of the state’s residents will be eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine starting next week, officials announced Tuesday. The state will move to Phase 1B of its vaccine plan beginning Monday, Gov. Henry McMaster said at a news conference. Teachers, grocery store employees and people with certain medical conditions can sign up for appointments then. Officials estimate 2.7 million people will be newly eligible for the vaccine in the state with a population of about 5 million. People 55 and older and those with increased risk for severe COVID-19, including people with certain developmental disabilities and individuals with medical conditions such as heart disease or sickle cell disease, will become eligible. Front-line employees who work in-person jobs that put them at increased risk of exposure also will be eligible. Those workers include day care and grocery store employees, manufacturing workers, and law enforcement officers. People who meet the age requirement can show vaccine providers an identification card, South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control Director Dr. Edward Simmer said. Otherwise, providers will have to rely on the honesty of South Carolinians who attest that they meet one of the other qualifications. “Please don’t jump ahead,” Simmer said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: After nearly a year of being barred from visiting the incarcerated, families and friends will soon have the chance to visit their loved ones in the state’s prison facilities. Phased scheduling with COVID-19 screening procedures will start Monday and roll through March 15, according to a memo by the South Dakota Department of Corrections. Visits will be limited to allow for social distancing, and “several new restrictions” will be used to “protect the health and safety of offenders and staff during the public health crisis,” the memo said. Visits could be halted again should the facilities see an increase in cases. Approved visitors must pass a temperature check and wear a face mask when entering the building, after which they will be given a new mask. Two visitors will be allowed per inmate, and no children under 12 will be permitted. Visitations and many group activities at all of the state’s prisons and work centers were suspended March 12, 2020, including powwows and sweat lodges, which the men at the South Dakota State Penitentiary and Jameson Annex hold a few times each year. In January, the Lakota/Dakota/Nakota Spiritual Group at the South Dakota State Penitentiary donated what money would have been spent on a powwow to the Children’s Inn.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: More than 1 million Tennesseans will become eligible Monday for the COVID-19 vaccine after the Department of Health announced Tuesday that it was expecting a large supply of the immunizations. According to Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey, the new eligibility will apply to people 16 and older who have high-risk health conditions – including cancer, hypertension, obesity and pregnancy – as well as caregivers and household residents of medically fragile children. “This is a massive population,” Piercey said. “There are a lot of people who will qualify.” Tennesseans should check with their counties to learn more about eligibility and registration. Residents in metropolitan areas may have different instructions. The age limit to receive the vaccine will remain 65 or older for people who don’t fall into other high-risk groups. Separately, state Health Department investigators are looking into whether anyone received expired vaccine doses in Shelby County, which encompasses Memphis. There was no indication Tuesday that anyone had received an expired dose, said David Sweat, the county’s chief of epidemiology.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state is lifting its mask mandate, Gov. Greg Abbott said Tuesday, making it the largest state to end an order intended to prevent the spread of the coronavirus that has killed more than 42,000 Texans. The Republican governor has faced sharp criticism from his party over the mandate, which was imposed eight months ago, as well as other COVID-19 restrictions on businesses that Texas will also scuttle starting next week. The mask order was only ever lightly enforced, even during the worst outbreaks of the pandemic. The repealed rules include doing away with limits on the number of diners or customers allowed indoors, said Abbott, who made the announcement at a restaurant in Lubbock. He said the new rules would take effect March 10, although leaders in Houston and other big Texas cities were already reacting with alarm. “Removing statewide mandates does not end personal responsibility,” Abbott said in a crowded dining room where many of those surrounding him were not wearing masks. “It’s just that now state mandates are no longer needed.” The top county leader in Houston, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, called the announcement “wishful thinking” and said spikes in hospitalizations have followed past rollbacks of COVID-19 rules.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced it has donated $20 million to help a program aimed at distributing COVID-19 vaccines to poor countries around the world. The donation from the humanitarian arm of the Utah-based faith is going to UNICEF as part of the organization’s work with the United Nations-backed COVAX initiative, which last week sent its long-awaited first deliveries to Ghana and Ivory Coast. More than half of the 16.5 million church members of the faith known widely as the Mormon church live outside the United States, including 666,500 in Africa. Many serve faith outreach missions around the world aimed at recruiting new members. Church officials hope the program helps children in these countries, where programs run by other organizations that provide children with health, nutritional and educational services have been disrupted by the pandemic, Gerald Causse, presiding bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saint Charities, said in a statement. The faith doesn’t disclose information about its finances but commonly announces donations made through the humanitarian arm of the religion that has helped more than 1,000 coronavirus relief projects in 152 countries, according to the church.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is expanding eligibility for COVID-19 vaccines to teachers next week, Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday. The expansion comes as the supply of available vaccine increased by the federal approval over the weekend of the vaccine from Johnson & Johnson, which only requires one shot and can be stored with regular refrigeration. “Our first allocations in the month of March for the Johnson & Johnson will be … dedicated to the teachers, school employees and child care providers,” Administration Secretary Mike Smith said. While the first allocation of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine this month will be reserved for educators, teachers will be able to choose if they’d prefer the two-dose vaccinations. Gov. Phil Scott said he felt some people will prefer the easier-to-use and distribute Johnson & Johnson vaccine and worried the demand for it could exceed the supply. The state is also expanding eligibility to include people 16 to 64 who have preexisting medical conditions that put them at higher risk of complications or death from COVID-19. Starting Monday, people with those conditions in the 55-to-64 age group will be able to make appointments. The younger group will be able to register the week after that.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Lawmakers have approved a loosening of the state’s ABC laws to help businesses and local governments recover from the impacts of the pandemic. One measure would allow distillers and restaurants to continue offering cocktails to go. That’s been allowed for a while under an executive directive Gov. Ralph Northam issued in April. But the new legislation would allow sales to continue even if the governor’s executive order declaring a state of emergency due to the pandemic expires. The bill would allow a limit of two cocktails per meal and a total of four maximum, said Eric Terry, president of the Virginia Restaurant, Lodging & Travel Association. He said the to-go provisions have been a “lifeline” for restaurants during the pandemic, when some customers have been reluctant to dine indoors. The bill as passed would sunset July 1, 2022. Terry said he hopes lawmakers might extend it in the future. Another measure would effectively allow local governments to seek state approval to create open-container zones. The bill expands a code section that previously dealt with special events. It will allow localities to seek approval from the state ABC board for an “outdoor refreshment area license.”\n\nWashington\n\nRenton: Public school teachers continue to resist returning to classrooms during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the urging of Gov. Jay Inslee. Educators in Renton voted not to return to in-person teaching. KIRO reports the Renton School District had planned for preschool, kindergarten and self-contained elementary special education teachers to return to school classrooms Wednesday. The teacher’s union said the district failed to address safety concerns from school nurses, special education teachers and staff considered to be high-risk. But the district said the union had already approved an agreement that said teachers would return Wednesday. There are about 15,000 total students in the Renton district. Earlier, teachers in Seattle – the state’s largest district with more than 50,000 students – had balked at plans to return some students to classes early in March. The Seattle public teachers’ union filed unfair labor practice complaints against the city school district over actions it took to try to return some students to classrooms. After getting authorization from the Seattle School Board last week, the district designated some 700 educators as “essential” to speed up the process of in-person instruction for special education students.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state expects to receive a surge in vaccine doses this week after the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine gained emergency use authorization. On top of the 15,500 doses from Johnson & Johnson, the state’s allocation of vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna will mean the state receives nearly 93,000 total doses this week, Gov. Jim Justice said Monday. The state administered more than 60,000 total first and second doses last week. With the vaccine supply now increasing, it will test West Virginia officials’ claims that the state has the capacity to administer 125,000 shots a week. They have said vaccinations have already driven down deaths linked to COVID-19. There were 39 deaths reported last week, the first time with fewer than 40 deaths reported statewide since late October. On Monday the state reported no additional deaths. “I am so delighted by this it’s unbelievable,” Justice said. “We have lost nobody in the last 24 hours.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Teachers will be prioritized to receive the first shipment of about 48,000 doses of the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine coming to the state next week, a bolster in supply that won’t be matched again for several weeks, the state’s deputy health secretary said Tuesday. About 30% of Wisconsin public school districts – 131 out of 421 – will be done vaccinating teachers by March 15, said Julie Willems Van Dyke, deputy secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. The state originally planned to prioritize schools for vaccine distribution but didn’t need to do that because initial supply met the plans for distribution submitted by schools, she said. “We feel really great about the way this all timed out,” Willems Van Dyke said. “The good news is we’ll get our teachers vaccinated quickly, and by doing that, it opens the vaccine pipeline for others in this eligibility group.” Republicans who control the Legislature continue to put pressure on Gov. Tony Evers to force all schools to resume in-person classes. Evers has left opening decisions up to the schools and said Tuesday that he can’t force the change. “I cannot order schools to open,” Evers said. “It’s not part of my ability as governor.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The governor announced a goal Tuesday to capture more carbon dioxide than the nation’s top coal-mining state emits, as he criticized plans taking shape under President Joe Biden intended to limit climate change. “They claim to follow the science, but they adopt policies that resemble science fiction,” Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican, said in his State of the State address. Prioritizing renewable energy over technology to keep carbon dioxide from power plants out of the atmosphere is a “crazed pursuit,” Gordon said about Biden’s plans. A tumultuous year of the pandemic and low oil prices has forced Wyoming to make steep spending cuts, but better days lie ahead, Gordon said. He praised Wyoming’s response to the pandemic that has kept schools open and businesses viable and said vaccine distribution was going smoothly. Wyoming could see a tourism “bonanza” if pent-up demand for travel brings visitors to the state this summer, he said. Still, Wyoming isn’t out of the woods yet with the virus and economic turmoil, Gordon said. He urged lawmakers meeting in Cheyenne over the next month to find a way to fund public education amid declining revenue from the state’s coal, oil and gas extraction industries.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/03/12/covid-scams-big-easy-buzz-nurses-protest-news-around-states/115550822/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Its 2021 Mardi Gras celebration all but a bust because of the coronavirus pandemic, the city is considering staging a Carnival-style parade in May after the state’s mandatory mask rule expires. Mayor Sandy Stimpson discussed the possible parade with City Council members during a meeting Tuesday, news outlets reported. The event would be held May 21 to coincide with the commissioning of the USS Mobile, a Navy ship built in the city. Gov. Kay Ivey has said she would let the statewide mask order expire on April 9 because cases of COVID-19 have fallen dramatically and the pace of vaccinations is increasing, although health officials said everyone – particularly people who haven’t been fully vaccinated – should continue wearing masks. Ivey’s office announced Wednesday that Alabama’s Capitol and Governor’s Mansion were reopening immediately in Montgomery for tours, but masks still would be required.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state Senate voted Wednesday to allow leadership to restrict access to the Capitol by Republican Sen. Lora Reinbold, who fellow lawmakers said has refused to follow measures meant to guard against COVID-19. The 18-1 vote, allowing leadership to enforce COVID-19 mitigation policies on members “until they are fully compliant” came 51 days into a legislative session throughout which Reinbold has worn a clear face shield that legislative leaders said runs afoul of masking rules. This week marked the first apparent public signs of pushback against the face shield by leadership. Senate Rules Chair Gary Stevens, a Kodiak Republican, said Reinbold also is not following testing protocols or submitting to temperature checks and questions that are standard for admittance to the building. “Inordinate” amounts of time have been spent “trying to reason” with her or provide masks that meet U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, he said. Reinbold of Eagle River did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. On social media, she said she is under “intense pressure by Senate leadership to follow controversial and arbitrarily applied” rules, and said she does not like “anyone to be forced to disclose health issues or test results,” citing privacy concerns. She said she took a coroanvirus test this weekend “under pressure” and conveyed, “begrudgingly,” the negative result to leadership. Her actions “are to protect my constitutional rights, including civil liberties and those who I represent, even under immense pressure and public scrutiny,” she said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Dr. Joshua LaBaer, director of the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, said laboratory data showed a recent rise in the rate of positive tests that have a coronavirus variant first identified in Britain. It peaked on March 8, with 20 out of every 100 positive tests showing a genetic pattern for that variant.Public health experts said the variant first found in the United Kingdom is more contagious and might carry a higher risk of death. LaBaer said the variant is not predominant in Arizona but it’s a minority strain that’s growing. “It’s a little bit of a race between getting vaccines in arms and seeing that variant emerge,” LaBaer told reporters. He said the latest figures indicated only about 10% of Arizona’s population has been fully vaccinated. But with vaccine supply ramping up, LaBaer said he thinks it’s possible that by mid-July the state could reach “herd immunity,” when enough people are protected through infection or vaccination to make it difficult for the virus to keep spreading.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization fell to its lowest number Wednesday since the summer as the state reported 317 new cases. The Department of Health said COVID-19 hospitalizations in the state dropped by 16 to 301. It’s the lowest number of such hospitalizations the state has reported since 285 on July 3. The state’s total COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began rose to 325,700. The state’s active cases, which don’t include people who have died or recovered, dropped by 234 to 3,227. Arkansas’ COVID-19 deaths rose by 25 to 5,382, but Gov. Asa Hutchinson said 16 of the deaths occurred in January and were reported late. The department said nearly 772,000 of the roughly 1.3 million coronavirus vaccine doses allocated to the state had been given so far.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Two U.S. Postal Service window clerks were arrested Wednesday on charges that they misused their positions to secure about $200,000 in pandemic unemployment benefits in a scam using debit cards obtained from the state with stolen identities. Christian Jeremyah James of Los Angeles and Armand Caleb Legardy of Inglewood are accused of using 10 debit cards issued in other people’s names by the California Employment Development Department. The Bank of America cards were obtained from the state by unnamed people who filed phony claims of joblessness stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, authorities said. The arrests of James, 31, and Legardy, 32, are the latest sign of California’s failure to screen out fraudulent claims as it has paid out more than $120 billion in unemployment assistance in the year since the pandemic devastated the state’s economy. The state estimates that it paid at least $11.4 billion in fraudulent benefits, including hundreds of millions in claims improperly filed in the names of prison inmates. James, a clerk at Culver City’s main post office, and Legardy, who worked at the La Tijera post office in Los Angeles, used their positions to buy and cash postal money orders with the fraudulently obtained debit cards, according to Ana Ptaszek, an agent with the Postal Service’s inspector general’s office. James’ attorney, Neha Christerna, declined to comment. Legardy’s attorney, Charles Brown, could not be reached.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver : Gov. Jared Polis and state lawmakers said Wednesday they plan to spend $700 million on job-creating transportation projects, sustaining a multibillion-dollar agriculture industry and delivering crucial aid to small businesses battered by the coronavirus pandemic. Polis and top Democratic and Republican lawmakers outlined their spending vision at a news conference. The $700 million comes from unexpected state revenue that surpassed expectations after lawmakers cut more than $3.5 billion from the state budget last year. The one-time spending over the next 18 months is intended to sustain small businesses, a farming economy battered by uncertain markets, the pandemic and sustained drought, worker training for those losing jobs in fossil fuel industries and in long-delayed infrastructure projects, Polis said. It follows $300 million in emergency spending the legislature authorized during a special session last year. It doesn’t take into account – for now – billions of dollars worth in federal funds that are forthcoming to Colorado under a $1.9 trillion relief package passed by Congress on Wednesday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: More than 100 workers at long-term care facilities blocked traffic in Hartford on Wednesday to demand better wages and benefits, as well as a solution to the staff shortages that are affecting an industry hit hard by the pandemic. According to the health care union District 1199 New England, SEIU, 18 unionized long-term care workers have died from COVID-19 and more have lost loved ones to the disease or have suffered permanent damage. Meanwhile, workers continue to risk death or serious illness on a daily basis, the union said. “Returning to normal is simply not an option,” said the union, which is demanding the state set aside more funding in the new two-year state budget to ultimately provide the workers with higher wages they can live on, access to affordable health insurance, retirement options and paid time off. “Long-term workers have gone beyond the extra mile to continue providing services during COVID-19 at great risk to themselves and their families,” the union added. The workers blocked traffic outside the Department of Social Services offices.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state Delaware is expanding COVID-19 vaccinations to more essential workers. The Delaware State News reported Tuesday that the Division of Public Health will add in the coming weeks front-line workers in food manufacturing, agriculture and grocery stores. The state will also add front-line workers in public transit, postal service, higher education and pharmaceutical manufacturing. DPH Director Dr. Karyl Rattay said the state is focusing on workers in those industries who are unable to socially distance from fellow workers or members of the public. Workers in the Phase 1B distribution group who are already eligible for the vaccine include first responders, correctional officers, teachers, education staff, child care providers and poultry workers. Delaware has reported that an estimated 104,000 residents are fully . That’s about one-tenth of the state’s population. Roughly 170,000 other people have received their first of the two-dose vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna. And about 5,000 Delawareans have received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Dr. Rattay said DPH will continue to work its way through a vaccination waiting list. “We know that you’re there, we know that you’re getting tired of waiting on the wait list and we know we have individuals who are in their seventies still on the wait-list,” Dr. Rattay said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:After weeks of neighbors advocating, D.C. is adding a Ward 6 zip code to the vaccine priority list this week, according to council member Charles Allen, WUSA-TV reported. For the past month, D.C. has been releasing some of its weekly round of vaccine appointments based on priority zip codes -- which have focused on wards 5, 7 and 8. Ward 6 falls in the middle of the pack when it comes to the number of COVID-19 cases it has reported. The zip code now added to the list, 20003, encompasses the southeastern portion of Capitol Hill, Hill East and Navy Yard. D.C. Health data reported 5,454 coronavirus cases in Ward 6. Capitol Hill residents accounted for 492 of those cases, and Hill East had 513. However, D.C. data showed a disparity in each of those neighborhood's vaccinations. According to data last updated on Saturday, 697 adults 65 or older who live in Capitol Hill have been fully vaccinated. That's more than three times as many older adults in Hill East, which has 196 residents fully vaccinated.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A couple claiming to be farmers working the land on two tiny suburban lots as they raked in federal COVID-19 relief funds pleaded guilty Monday to a fraud scheme. Latoya Stanley and Johnny Philus hauled in more than $1 million in Small Business Administration loans while lying that they were struggling to operate not only a couple of nonexistent suburban farms but also a beauty supply store and an auto leasing business, according to authorities. Their SBA loan applications were a fiction, the North Miami couple admitted in federal court. Each faces up to five years in prison when they are sentenced June 2 in front of U.S. District Judge Marcia Cooke. Stanley, 38, and Philus, 33, were arrested in August and charged with committing wire fraud and making false statements when they applied for SBA loans under a federal program that provides financial assistance to businesses ailing from the impact of pandemic.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgia will expand COVID-19 vaccine criteria starting Monday to everyone 55 and older, plus younger adults who are overweight or have serious health conditions, making more than two-thirds of Georgians who are 16 and older eligible for vaccination. Gov. Brian Kemp made the announcement Wednesday as Georgia continued to post worst-in-the nation vaccination rates, raising questions about the effectiveness of the state’s efforts to put shots in arms. “We will continue to encourage all eligible Georgians not to wait to get their dose,” the Republican governor said. “This vaccine, as we have said many times, is safe, is effective, and it’s our ticket back to normal.” Only 17.5% of Georgia’s population has been given at least one dose of the vaccine, the worst in the nation, according the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The same data showed Georgia has administered the lowest share of doses delivered among states, with more than one-third of doses still awaiting injection. Georgia disputes that second number, saying it has given 74% of doses shipped.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Senate on Tuesday passed legislation that would increase the income tax paid by Hawaii’s top wage earners to 16%, which would give the islands the highest state income tax rate in the nation. The Senate voted 24-1 in favor of the bill, which cited a need to maintain essential government services at a time when the pandemic and subsequent drop in tourism led state tax revenue to shrink. There was no discussion or debate on the Senate floor regarding the measure. The legislation also hikes the capital gains tax, corporate tax and taxes on luxury real estate sales. The bill will now go to the House for consideration. House lawmakers have passed their own legislation raising the capital gains tax. California is currently the state with the highest income tax rate in the nation, at 13.3% for individuals earning more than $1 million a year. Hawaii’s 16% rate would apply to those earning more than $200,000 a year. The rate would revert to the existing rate of 11% after 2027. Lawmakers said they want to avoid budget cuts recommended by Gov. David Ige to cope with the shortfall, including those that would subtract funds from public schools, sex abuse treatment, plant and pest disease control and family planning services.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: At least a hundred people gathered at the front of the state Capitol on Saturday to burn masks in a protest against measures taken to limit infections and deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Some groups said mask mandates are a restriction of their freedoms. Health experts said they help slow the spread of the disease. Videos posted on social media showed adults encouraging children to toss masks into a fire. Gov. Brad Little has never issued a statewide mask mandate, but seven counties and 11 cities have such mandates in place. Visitors to the Capitol are asked to wear masks, but they're not required and few Republican lawmakers wear them. A Republican lawmaker on Wednesday introduced legislation to prohibit mask mandates. More than 170,000 Idaho residents have been infected with the virus, and nearly 1,900 have died.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot warned the city’s aldermen on Wednesday not to produce wish lists now that Congress has passed a COVID-19 relief package that will send nearly $2 billion to the city. The $1.9 trillion package passed Wednesday by the U.S. House and headed for President Joe Biden’s desk is expected to deliver about $7.5 billion to state government and about $6 billion for local government. Lightfoot said the money headed to Chicago will have strings attached to how it can be spent. “So I want to disabuse people out there and my colleagues in the City Council,” Lightfoot said. “This is not $1.9 trillion of a slush fund that we can use every way that we can.” Lightfoot said she expects the city will get money to help with the cost of vaccinating residents and to address affordable housing and homelessness. She said although the city is likely to also get relief funds next year, it won’t be able to use it to reduce taxes or bankroll city employee pensions.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Teachers and other school employees will be able to get COVID-19 vaccinations through Indiana’s shot clinics across the state starting next week. State health officials said Wednesday that the eligibility expansion comes at the direction of the Biden administration, which earlier allowed teachers to be vaccinated at pharmacies taking part in a federal program. Indiana is allowing anyone aged 50 and older and those with at-risk health conditions to make vaccine appointments. The expansion for teachers starts Monday and includes other school workers such as classroom aides, bus drivers, cafeteria workers and substitute teachers. Gov. Eric Holcomb and top state health officials had repeatedly said they believed that targeting vaccinations to older age groups and health care workers, rather than school employees, was more effective at preventing serious illnesses and deaths.\n\nIowa\n\nJohnston: As Iowa ramps up vaccinations to include everyone between age 16 to 64 with underlying health conditions, state officials acknowledged Wednesday they would rely on an honor system with no validation required when someone claims to qualify for a shot because of a health issue. The state is allowing adults to get vaccinated if they have any one of several conditions the U.S. Centers For Disease Control and Prevention considers higher risk for severe illness if they get infected. The list includes cancer, heart conditions, lung disease, pregnancy, Type 2 diabetes and obesity. Smokers also qualify. Iowa Department of Public Health Director Kelly Garcia acknowledged Wednesday the system is relying largely on Iowans being honest about their health conditions when scheduling a vaccine. Gov. Kim Reynolds was asked Wednesday why the state doesn’t allow all adults to get vaccinated since the current system has no way to confirm whether someone has a qualifying health issue, making it possible for anyone willing to be untruthful to get a shot. “I think we have a good process in place. As we see those numbers continue to increase and we continue to open up and vaccinate more and more Iowans we’ll take that next step,” she said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Senate Health Committee Chair Richard Hilderbrand, R-Galena, outlined a measure Wednesday that would overturn Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s policy of withholding doses of COVID-19 vaccines from counties wanting to move to a new phase of inoculations before the rest of the state. Hilderbrand called the policy “blackmail or extortion.” The state Department of Health and Environment called withholding vaccine doses an “enforcement mechanism” and Kelly said the goal is to “keep the train running as smoothly as we possibly can.” Hilderbrand’s bill would allow counties to set their own vaccination schedules. It follows several months of widespread criticism of Kelly from the GOP-controlled Legislature over what they viewed as a slow administration of shots. “Counties that are doing it right and doing it the right way should be able to have some leeway,” Hilderbrand told the Associated Press.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky’s government is forecast to receive about $2.4 billion from the latest round of federal pandemic relief, state Budget Director John Hicks told lawmakers Tuesday. The state’s share gives lawmakers more funding opportunities but little time to decide how to incorporate any of it into the state budget for the coming year starting July 1. Top lawmakers are putting together a final spending plan to be presented to the legislature in coming days. A separate infusion of about $1.6 billion from the federal aid package is expected to go to local governments in Kentucky, and Kentuckians are expected to receive about $5 billion in direct payments under the relief measure, legislative budget negotiators were told. The massive package could be approved by congressional Democrats by midweek over Republican opposition.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Live indoor music can resume in New Orleans beginning this weekend, city officials said Wednesday, but dancing will remain prohibited, and venues, performers and audiences will be under strict requirements to employ measures to control the spread of the coronavirus. The new rules take effect Friday morning, in response to a decline of new coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in the city. It was not immediately known how many bars and other live music venues will be able to meet them and begin holding live entertainment again in a city where music is ingrained in cultural history and vital to tourism. Brian Greenberg, general manager of Tipitina’s, said he thinks the historic music club and bar might be able to pull it off, although not right away. “We have a floor plan that we’ve already mapped out,” he said. “We’re a big room, so we have that advantage.” Dancing is ruled out under the regulations, which also noted that patrons must “refrain from cheering or singing along.” Limits are still in effect. St. Patrick’s Day parades, and block parties remain forbidden in the city even as officials ease limitations on crowds. Starting Friday, indoor gatherings will be limited to 75 people and outdoor gatherings to 150. Most businesses in the city will be open at 75% capacity, and bars and gyms will operate at 50%.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: More than two dozen COID-19 vaccination clinics are set to open in Maine in the coming days. The Department of Health and Human Services said the state is working with more than 25 health care organizations to offer the dedicated clinics. The department said the clinics will be held on Friday and over the weekend, and a few will happen the following week. The dedicated clinics are for school staff and teachers who are age 60 and older. The health department said every school district will notify eligible teachers and staff members about where they can sign up for the clinics. Maine has extended eligibility for coronavirus vaccines to teachers, school staff members and people who are age 60 or older. The health department said teachers and school staffers of younger ages can get the vaccine at Hannaford, Walgreens and Walmart pharmacies dependent on availability.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: The city's annual St. Patrick's Day festivities and parade were canceled in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the nation and into Maryland. For businesses, the holiday would go on to mark the beginning of a year of hardship. Despite the parade being canceled again this year, tourism and hospitality business owners in town are cautiously hoping for a stronger tourism season. St. Patrick's Day is typically a weeklong celebration at Duffy's Tavern, but when the parade was canceled last year, sales slowed dramatically, said owner Matt Bayline, who added he is cautiously optimistic about the spring and summer. Mask-wearing and restrictions might still be in place, but \"we're getting closer to normal,\" he said. On Tuesday Gov. Larry Hogan lifted capacity restrictions on all restaurants, taverns gyms, houses of worships and other facilities. Masks and social distancing will still be required, but Hogan called the move a \"prudent, positive step in the right direction and an important part of our economic recovery.\"\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester:St. Vincent Hospital management touted nurses who crossed a picket line, while the union representing striking nurses at the hospital countered by saying that community support was on their side, as the nurses’ strike at the hospital entered its second day. “We want to thank all our caregivers, including the nurses who made the decision to put patients first by crossing the (Massachusetts Nurses Association union) picket line to take care of our community,” St. Vincent CEO Carolyn Jackson said in a statement Tuesday morning. MNA spokesperson David Schildmeier acknowledged that some nurses crossed the picket line, but pushed back against any suggestion that the strike was weak. “We are still evaluating how many crossed; we expected some nurses to cross,” Schildmeier said in an email Tuesday. “From what we have seen it is minimal, and even their claim makes it clear that the 89% strike vote is holding.” Meanwhile, a second union representing patient care attendants, housekeeping staff and others at the hospital announced that it planned to hold an informational picket on Saturday. Tenet Healthcare and St. Vincent Hospital nurses had been unable to come to an agreement during months of contract negotiations, prompting nurses to go on strike at 6 a.m. Monday. There are approximately 800 nurses at the hospital.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The coronavirus pandemic made 2020 Michigan’s deadliest year, driving a 17.9% increase in deaths over 2019, according to preliminary data. It was the largest annual percentage jump on record, surpassing a 15.6% increase in 1918, when the Spanish flu pandemic struck. More than 115,300 people died in Michigan last year, up from about 97,800 the year before, according to an Associated Press analysis of provisional data kept by the state’s vital records division. COVID-19 has been linked to nearly 16,700 deaths since February 2020. The toll was highest in April and then December.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: A veteran Iditarod musher from Duluth was removed from the race Wednesday after he tested positive for the coronavirus, organizers said. Gunnar Johnson, 52, was withdrawn from the event at the McGrath, Alaska, checkpoint, the organizers said in a news release. Iditarod Race Marshal Mark Nordman, working with epidemiologist Dr. Jodie Guest, made the decision to remove Johnson, who is asymptomatic, based on the rules set in the race’s COVID-19 mitigation plan. Johnson is incredibly disappointed and felt his dog team looked great, the organizers said. Johnson had 14 dogs racing with him. After the positive test, Johnson was removed from the checkpoint area and taken off the trail, the organizers said. Johnson, a former city attorney of Duluth who was participating in his third Iditarod, did not come into close contact with race personnel or community members, and he did not enter any buildings or community spaces in McGrath, the organizers said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:The State Department of Health reported 437 new cases of COVID-19 and 11 coronavirus-related deaths on Wednesday. Since the virus hit the state in March 2020, a total of 298,445 cases and 6,845 coronavirus-related deaths have been reported. There were 50 outbreaks at Mississippi nursing homes as of Wednesday. There have been 10,406 cases of the coronavirus in long-term care facilities and 1,963 deaths reported as of Wednesday. Residents between the ages of 25 and 39 represent the largest portion of the infected population in the state, with 65,745 cases reported Tuesday. Among patients under 18, children between the ages of 11 and 17 have the highest infection rate, with 22,922 cases identified. The 65-and-older age group has the highest total number of deaths with 5,251 reported.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: Weeks after the faster-spreading British variant of the coronavirus was found in 15 Missouri wastewater systems, new testing has found it only in one. The Department of Health and Senior Services has been testing wastewater across the state for clues about the spread of COVID-19. The latest results, released Tuesday, found that testing could be done only at 10 wastewater systems in Missouri because of declining levels of COVID-19 particles. Of the 10 tested, only the Coldwater Creek system in St. Louis County indicated the presence of the U.K. variant, the health department said. In February 15 of 23 systems tested across Missouri showed evidence of the U.K. variant, which was first detected in the U.S. in December.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The state reported 46 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, bringing Montana’s total to 100,959. There are 63 people who are hospitalized, according to the state website covid19.mt.gov. A total of 1,381 deaths related to the respiratory illness have been reported in the state, according to the report. Flathead County topped the state and accounted for nearly 28% of all new cases with 13, bringing the county to 164 active reports out of 11,169 total. The county has the second-most active cases in the state. Missoula County reported nine new cases and now has 106 active reports. To date, a total 308,745 doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered and 115,390 residents are now fully vaccinated.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: More than 250,000 people have signed up for a COVID-19 vaccination on Nebraska’s official registration website, but state officials said Wednesday they want more and urged residents to add their names. State officials asked residents to sign up online or through a toll-free hotline as local health districts prepare to move into their next vaccination phase in the next few weeks. The state is working to vaccinate residents who are at least 65 years and older, but the next phase will focus on people ages 50 to 64 and those with certain underlying health conditions. Lori Snyder, chief information officer for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, said registering on the state’s website, vaccinate.ne.gov, will allow residents to get their shot faster than if they signed up on a local public health department’s website. Residents without internet access can register by calling (833) 998-2275. Nebraska has fully vaccinated 12.6% of its 1.48 million residents who are at least 16 years old, according to the state’s online tracking portal.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Coronavirus management officials said some vaccination appointment slots are going unused in Las Vegas, and that more doses are available than are being administered at the area’s two largest mass vaccination sites. However, state COVID-19 response chief Caleb Cage did not promise immediate changes or say during a conference call with reporters that the recipient pool would soon expand statewide to people 55 and older. People 65 and older became eligible for vaccinations last month, and a group of front-line workers became eligible last week. Cage said the statewide coronavirus playbook is being shaped with local health districts, elected leaders and emergency managers according to the varied economies and workforces in the north, south and rural areas. Public vaccine sites at the Ashman Center conference hall near downtown Las Vegas and at the Las Vegas Convention Center near the Strip can each deliver up to 4,000 doses per day. But Dr. Fermin Leguen, Southern Nevada Health District chief health officer, told the Review-Journal that neither site regularly sees 3,000 appointments a day. Doses are not being discarded unused, Leguen said but volunteers, employees and Nevada National Guard members sometimes sit idle. In Reno, chief health officer Kevin Dick told reporters that vaccination efforts are keeping up with an increase in shipments of vaccines to Washoe County.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: There have been no reported COVID-19 cases from two in-person House sessions held last month, Speaker Sherman Packard said. “Careful and cautious management has led to good results, and that’s exactly what we have done with the legislature,” Packard said in a statement Thursday. “We can lead in a responsible way, and we are getting our business done in a responsible way.” Seven Democratic lawmakers sued Packard, a Republican, last month, arguing that holding in-person sessions without a remote option violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and the state and federal constitutions, and forced them to either risk their lives or abandon their duties as elected officials. They sought a preliminary order requiring remote access, but a federal judge denied their request. The Democrats have filed a notice of appeal to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the 400-member House has met several times at the University of New Hampshire ice arena, outside on a UNH athletic field, and – after former Speaker Dick Hinch died of COVID-19 – from their cars in a parking lot. They met last month in a Bedford sports complex.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Restaurants, gyms, salons and other indoor recreational activities can boost their capacity to 50%, up from 35% starting March 19, Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday. The state’s coronavirus figures have been tracking in the right direction, Murphy said, although hospitalizations ticked up slightly this week. Murphy also said that outdoor gatherings would climb to a 50-person capacity, up from 25. That also takes effect March 19. The 25-person limit didn’t apply to weddings, church services or political events, among a few others. New Jersey has fully vaccinated about 899,000 people or just over 10% of the population. That’s just slightly higher than the 9.9% national rate.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: New Mexico is expected to receive an estimated $9 billion from the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package recently passed by Congress, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and fellow state Democrat leaders said. Beyond the vaccine rollout and grants for small businesses, they said the funding will go toward everything from direct payments for individuals to investments in broadband and clean water projects, debt relief for Hispanic and Native American farmers and an expansion of the child tax credit. Tribal communities and public schools will see more than $1 billion each, and state and local governments will share about $2 billion. The Democrats billed the aid package as an answer to poverty, saying it will address inequities that were brought to light during the pandemic by creating universal benefits and lifelong assistance. Lujan Grisham said about one-quarter of New Mexico families would immediately be “lifted out of poverty” because of the economic assistance and tax credits included in the legislation.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Travelers to New York from other U.S. states will no longer be required to quarantine starting April 1, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, adding the two-week quarantine for domestic travelers will be recommended but no longer mandated. International travelers will still be required to quarantine, he said. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said city officials were not consulted about the move to end the quarantine requirement, and he questioned its wisdom. “I believe in local control, and here’s another case where New York City was not consulted even though we’re one of the biggest cities in the world and 43% of the state’s population,” de Blasio said at a virtual coronavirus briefing. He added, “Of course I have concerns about this.” Dr. Jay Varma, senior health adviser to the mayor, said the city is still “at a very tenuous point” despite rising vaccination levels because highly transmissible variants of the coronavirus now account for more than half of new infections.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Duke University said it is considering ending in-person classes as an uptick in COVID-19 cases over the course of five days worsens and students continue to violate health guidelines. Of the 102 undergraduate students who tested positive for the coronavirus from March 5-9, Duke said most “either have a known Greek affiliation and/or are first-year male students in the Class of 2024.” Duke linked the cases to rush activities and off-campus parties hosted by fraternities, including Greek organizations that recently severed their affiliations with the university. Campus officials warned in a message to students that those who hold parties and flagrantly violate safety protocols could be suspended or expelled as a result of their actions. Duke has been widely praised for its reopening procedures since the start of the pandemic and having fewer cases this semester than some of its nearby peers, including North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials want to use another round of federal stimulus money to continue testing wastewater for coronavirus variants. The wastewater testing began in July 2020 and would end in June if funding isn’t continued. Twenty-one communities are participating in the testing statewide. Wastewater from those cities is analyzed at a North Dakota State University lab where researchers look for the virus contained in the fecal matter of people who are infected. David Bruschwein, director of the Division of Municipal Facilities for the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality, said wastewater analysis is helpful in pinpointing communities that might need more regular virus testing, given that far fewer people are opting for tests now than at the height of the pandemic, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The state House last month approved and sent to the Senate a bill to require a public hearing and a vote before local officials decide to participate in such testing. The House killed a bill to ban wastewater testing.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican lawmakers’ latest in a yearlong attempt to rein in Gov. Mike DeWine’s authority to issue public health orders during the pandemic passed Wednesday in the House and faces a likely veto by the governor. A bill that would allow lawmakers to rescind public health orders issued by the governor or the Ohio Department of Health was fast-tracked out of committee one year to the day from when the pandemic began in Ohio and moved onto the House floor where it passed on party lines. “This body has given the administrative branch of government a lot of power, and it’s time to review that power and it’s time to review it now,” Republican Rep. Scott Wiggam, a supporter of the bill, said before its passing. Wiggam and the majority of his GOP colleagues have reiterated how the actions that were taken by DeWine and the health department over the past year have been overreaching and detrimental to the freedom of Ohioans. In recent committee hearings, GOP lawmakers made several changes to the Senate bill that would close loopholes for future governors and local boards of health to issue emergency orders. Last year, DeWine, a Republican, had indicated he would veto any bill that would make it hard for him or the health department to issue emergency orders to curb the spread of the coronavirus. He made good on that promise in December when a similar Senate bill moved through the House and Senate and landed on his desk. In the past few weeks, it appeared that the governor and members of his party were making compromises on the bill, but none of them appear to be in the final proposal.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of Oklahoma COVID-19 cases has surpassed 430,000, with 818 new cases reported Wednesday by the state health department. According to the Department of Health, there have been a total of 430,250 COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began last year. The state ranked 12th in the U.S. with 21.2% of the population having received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which also reported that 12% of the state’s population had received two vaccine doses. Oklahoma was 26th in the nation in the number of new cases per capita with 233.83 per 100,000 population, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Oregon reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Sunday, adding 1,688 new cases. That's down 39.3% from the previous week's toll of 2,779. Oregon is among the states with the slowest spread of COVID-19 – the state ranks 49th where the disease was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data showed. The worst weekly outbreaks on a per-person basis were in Coos, Lake and Baker counties. Adding the most new cases overall were Washington County, with 189; Jackson County, with 187; and Marion County, with 172. Weekly\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYork:Convenience store chain Rutter’s, which began paying hourly employees a hazard bonus of $2 an hour and store managers an additional $100 a week in April 2020 at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, has decided to make the increases permanent. That means the starting hourly wage sits at $12.50, which increases to $13 after three months. The additional pay, along with performance increases, led Rutter’s to increase total wages by 15% for 2021, according to a company release. Rutter’s, which was recently named one of Forbes’ top midsize employers for 2021, plans to give back to their communities by donating $1 million through Rutter’s Children’s Charities and additional charitable giving.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has fully vaccinated more than 100,000 people, or nearly 10% of its population, the Department of Health said Thursday. About 147,000 other people have received a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The department also reported more than 500 new confirmed cases of the disease and four more virus-related fatalities. Of the new cases, about 430 were first-time positive tests from Wednedsay and about 100 were first-time positive tests from previous days. There have now been more than 130,000 known cases and 2,563 virus-related deaths in the state. The number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 as of Tuesday dropped slightly from the previous day to 141.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State officials updated visitation guidelines Wednesday for nursing homes and residential care facilities. Most of the state’s nursing homes will have to allow in-person, indoor visitation after federal authorities approved the changed guidelines, the Department of Health and Environmental Control said. “Too many South Carolinians have been prohibited from visiting their loved ones in long term care facilities because of overburdensome federal guidelines,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement. “Prioritizing the physical health and safety of our most vulnerable citizens is critically important, but we must also protect their mental and emotional health.” Under the new criteria, facilities must let visitors indoors if community spread of the virus is low in the county where the facility is located, no residents or staff have contracted COVID-19 in the past two weeks, and the facility is following other virus prevention measures. These facilities will continue to require visitors to wear masks and practice social distancing. They also must limit the number of visitors and the length of visits.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Active COVID-19 cases in South Dakota continued to slowly rise Thursday, with another 203 new cases reported by the state health department. One person, a man in his 70s, died from COVID-19, the health department reported, pushing South Dakota's death toll from the disease to 1,905. The man was from Grant County, where there have now been 39 virus-related deaths, according to the state. There have been 89 deaths in Brown County since the start of the pandemic and 77 in Codington County. Active cases statewide increased by 17 to 2,131, and hospitalizations decreased by six to 67.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A state House panel rejected a push to remove a judge for expanding absentee voting in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, siding with prominent attorneys who warned the ouster would be an unprecedented breach of judicial independence. The House Civil Justice Subcommittee squelched the effort by voting down a resolution to initiate removal hearings against Davidson County Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle. The subcommittee didn’t grant a request from Republican sponsor Rep. Tim Rudd to delay consideration of the resolution for several weeks. In the House, 65 of 73 Republicans had signed on in support of the proposal, which called for creating a House-Senate panel to make a recommendation on the judge’s removal. If the panel voted in favor, a two-thirds vote in each chamber would then have been needed to remove Lyle. The prospects looked less favorable in the Senate, where a version of the resolution had not drawn any co-sponsors. Lyle’s ruling in June to expand absentee voting was overturned by the state Supreme Court, but only after the state changed course to promise to allow people at higher risk of COVID-19 complications and their caretakers to vote by mail. Later, Lyle extended absentee voting to all those living with a person at high risk of complications from COVID-19, ruling that the state had promised the Supreme Court that they could vote absentee as well. Lyle’s rulings in the case were harshly criticized by Secretary of State Tre Hargett and Attorney General Herbert Slatery, both Republicans.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: City and Travis County officials have imposed their requirements people wear masks in public in apparent defiance of Gov. Greg Abbott’s order lifting the state mandate, which took effect Wednesday. The mandate announced Tuesday by Austin Mayor Steve Adler and Travis County Judge Andy Brown prompted Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to threaten a lawsuit Wednesday if the Austin-area officials don’t reconsider their move. Adler and Brown announced the new mask mandate Tuesday after consulting their top health officials. Abbott’s order lifting the state mask mandate took effect Wednesday, leaving the decision on requiring masks to property owners.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:The pandemic hasn't stopped local high school students from using their shared love of debate to keep learning and connecting with each other. Their dedication recently led to several local high schools qualifying for the state debate tournament, including Hurricane High School and Cedar High School. The regional debate tournament was held in-person at Hurricane High School from Feb. 26-27, with participants wearing masks, practicing social distancing and being tested for the coronavirus beforehand. \"(Students) learn that we can disagree, fundamentally disagree, and still be friends,\" Hurricane High School debate coach Tara Tanner said. \"We can understand someone else's point of view and build empathy. And that is a gift.\"\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Ten new cases of COVID-19 have been reported at the state prison in Newport, the Department of Corrections said. Testing done Monday found nine new positive cases among inmates at the Northern State Correctional Facility and one new case among the staff, the department said. “We are fully prepared to handle new positive cases at our facilities and it’s encouraging to see the spread slowing in Newport,” said Corrections Commissioner Jim Baker. The outbreak began after testing on Feb. 23. There are 115 cases among inmates and 12 among the staff. By Friday, 106 inmates who tested positive are expected to be medically cleared to leave isolation. At that point, the total number of positive cases among inmates will be 13. The prison remains on full lockdown. All other Vermont prisons are on modified lockdown.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: An estate that holds outdoor weddings has filed a lawsuit over Gov. Ralph Northam’s COVID-19-related restrictions. The Roanoke Times reported Wednesday that the suit was filed by Belle Garden Estate in Franklin County. The venue claimed that it will lose business in the spring wedding season because of limits on the number of people who can gather together for a wedding. A hearing has been scheduled for March 24 at a federal court in Roanoke. A judge will be asked to issue a preliminary injunction that would invalidate the prohibition on outdoor gatherings of more than 25 people at events such as weddings. “Anxious brides trying to have a wedding planned months in advance are being told they cannot have their wedding,” the lawsuit stated. The lawsuit claimed that Northam’s order violates the First Amendment right of free assembly and the 14th Amendment right of equal protection. Northam spokeswoman Alena Yarmosky declined to comment on pending litigation.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle-area leaders on Wednesday touted the opening of a new mass COVID-19 vaccination site at an event center between the city’s two sports stadiums – a site authorities hope can soon be vaccinating more than 20,000 people a day, seven days a week. The site at the Lumen Field Event Center is a partnership between the city, Swedish Health Services and the company that operates the facility, First & Goal Inc. It will open Saturday and initially be operational two to three days a week, distributing about 5,000 doses a week. As more vaccine doses become available, officials said the Lumen site will be able to operate seven days a week and innoculate 22,000 people a day. Mayor Jenny Durkan said when it is operating at full capacity, the operation will be the the largest civilian-run vaccination site in the country. Inslee said the site is designed to help people who have had trouble getting vaccinated – either because they lack access to the Internet or other reasons – get their shots. For now vaccination eligibility is limited to people over 65, teachers and licensed child care providers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Democratic U.S. Sen Joe Manchin told state officials the new federal stimulus package will include $677 million in funding to local governments in the state. The money is broken up into $176 million for metropolitan cities, $153 million for smaller cities and $348 million for the state’s 55 counties. The state government separately will receive $1.25 billion. Manchin said local officials can use funding to pay expenses related to the pandemic, including covering lost revenue and investments in water, sewer and broadband infrastructure. Half of the funds will be distributed within 60 days of the legislation being signed by President Joe Biden, and the second half will go out one year later.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state is expanding COVID-19 vaccine eligibility to at least 2 million more people later this month, including anyone 16 or older with common preexisting medical conditions, such as being overweight, pregnant or having high blood pressure, health officials said. People who don’t have preexisting conditions that would qualify them as of March 29 or who haven’t otherwise qualified yet to get vaccinated are expected to become eligible sometime in May, the Department of Health Services said. The long list of newly qualifying conditions to get vaccinated includes asthma; Type 1 or 2 diabetes; cancer; cerebrovascular disease; chronic kidney disease; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; cystic fibrosis; Down syndrome; heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies; a weakened immune system from solid organ transplant, blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines; liver disease; and neurologic conditions, such as dementia. Those conditions were chosen because they increase the risk for severe illness, hospitalization or death from COVID-19, Willems Van Dijk said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The total number of coronavirus cases in Wyoming grew by 42 on Wednesday, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 37 and the number of probable cases rising by five, according to the Wyoming Department of Health’s daily update. There are new confirmed cases in Campbell, Laramie (16), Lincoln (four), Natrona (two), Sheridan, Sweetwater (three), Teton (nine) and Uinta counties.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/12/20/alaska-america-bathtub-miracle-glamping-opposition-news-around-states/49552231/", "title": "Alaska for America, bathtub miracle: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Nearly two dozen organizations have sent a letter asking the U.S. House Financial Services Committee to investigate the state’s plan to use $400 million in pandemic relief funds to build two super-size prisons. The American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, The Sentencing Project and others signed on to a letter arguing that prison construction is an improper use of money from the American Rescue Plan and asking Chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters to hold hearings on the matter. “Directing COVID relief funds to a massive prison construction plan that long predates the pandemic is an absurd and inappropriate use of (American Rescue Plan) funds,” the organizations wrote. Gov. Kay Ivey signed legislation in October to tap $400 million of the state’s money from the federal plan to help build two super-size prisons. The Republican governor at the time called the construction plan “a major step forward” for the prison system, which faces various federal court orders and a lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department. Republican legislative leaders and Ivey have said they are confident they can use the pandemic money for prison construction because the American Rescue Plan says states can use the money to replace revenue lost during the pandemic to strengthen support for vital public services and help retain jobs.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The newly crowned Miss America has made history, becoming both the first Korean American and the first Alaskan to hold the title in the competition’s 100-year history. “I never could have imagined in a million years that I would be Miss America, let alone that I would be Miss Alaska,” a beaming Emma Broyles said Friday. In fact, she was sure they had it wrong. The final two contestants were Broyles and Lauren Bradford, Miss Alabama, and Broyles said she was thinking Bradford was going to make an amazing Miss America. “And then they said Alaska, and I said, ‘No way. Are you sure? Do you want to check that card again?’ ” she said. “I am so, so grateful to everybody back at home who’s been supporting me for so long, and I’m so glad that I’m able to bring home the title of Miss America to the state of Alaska for the first time in history.” Broyles, 20, said her grandparents immigrated to Anchorage from Korea about 50 years ago, before her mother was born. Her mother is a special education teacher at Service High School in Anchorage, the same school Broyles attended. Broyles has chosen the Special Olympics for her social impact initiative. Besides her mother’s position, her older brother, Brendan, has Down syndrome and competes in athletic events with Special Olympics Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey has extended an executive order prohibiting state and local governments from requiring people to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The prohibition includes an exception for hospitals and other licensed health care institutions. It’s a small part of a nine-page order signed Wednesday that largely deals with surveillance and monitoring of health care institutions during the pandemic. Ducey in August issued an executive order barring the state and local governments from requiring vaccines, based on an existing public health law. However, after the outbreak worsened again during the fall, the state university system, the city of Tucson and Pima County decided to require their employees to be inoculated. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero said in a statement Friday that the city will keep its employee vaccine mandate in place. The city says Ducey has no authority to block its immunization rules. Phoenix also mandated employee vaccinations, but it and at least one university have since paused their mandates after a court blocked the Biden administration’s mandate that federal contractors require employee vaccinations. Ducey’s office did not announce the latest order, which was reported by local news outlets.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Friday reported its first case of the omicron variant as the state’s coronavirus cases and COVID-19 hospitalizations continued to increase. The Arkansas Department of Health did not release information about the person’s location, age or gender, nor whether they had been vaccinated. However, department spokeswoman Meg Mirivel said the case was not associated with travel. The variant’s appearance in the state had been expected as it spreads throughout the United States. The variant has been detected in at least 40 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Globally, more than 75 countries have reported confirmed omicron cases. “This was expected, and we expect more cases of the variant to be confirmed in the near future,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted. “This is not a surprise, but it is a compelling reason to get a booster shot now.” The state reported 1,111 new virus cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 542,426. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by nine to 538. The state reported 17 new COVID-19 deaths. Arkansas ranks 35th in the country for new virus cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The California Coastal Commission has approved a plan to poison invasive mice threatening rare seabirds on the Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge. The agency that regulates California’s coastline voted 5-3 Thursday night to approve a plan to drop about 3,000 pounds of poisoned bait from helicopters onto the rocky islands off the San Francisco coast that are home to hundreds of thousands of breeding birds. The move still requires approval from the regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, officials said. The Farallon Islands refuge is home to an estimated 300,000 breeding seabirds, including the rare ashy storm-petrel. But officials say the population is threatened by mice that arrived on the islands aboard ships more than a century ago. In recent years, the mouse population has exploded, attracting burrowing owls that also prey on the ashy storm-petrel, officials said. “This project is necessary and is the right thing to do to stop the ecosystem carnage done by mice: a human-caused problem,” Gerry McChesney, manager of the wildlife refuge, said at the meeting. The proposal has won both support and condemnation from various conservation groups. Critics contend other wildlife could be poisoned by the rodenticide. Famed animal researcher and conservationist Jane Goodall spoke against the proposal at the hearing. “This poison will inflict pain and suffering on a great many sentient animals,” she said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The 110-year prison sentence meted out last week to the truck driver who killed four people when he lost his brakes on Interstate 70 put a renewed spotlight on the state’s mandatory-minimum sentencing laws and on district attorneys’ ability to use such laws to ensure convictions lead to prison time. Rogel Aguilera-Mederos, 26, was sentenced to a prison term twice as long as some Colorado murderers after his convictions triggered provisions in state law that forced District Court Judge Bruce Jones to lay down a minimum 110-year sentence. The judge said during the sentencing hearing that he had no discretion to set a lesser prison term but wished he could. One family member of a man who died in the fiery 28-car pileup in Lakewood said he did not want a life sentence for the truck driver. And the day after the sentencing, First Judicial District Attorney Alexis King – who pursued the convictions that led to the 110-year sentence – said in a statement that she would “welcome” a reconsideration of the prison term. Aguilera-Mederos’ sentence stretched to more than a century because under Colorado law, first-degree assault and attempted first-degree assault are so-called crimes of violence in which prison sentences must run consecutively, not concurrently, when they spring from the same incident.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: An appeals court ruled Friday that a local historical society cannot try to impose its conservation rules on a congregational church that dates back to 1700 and is located on the celebrated Lebanon Town Green. The ruling by the state Appellate Court is the latest chapter in years­long legal proceedings over who owns the mile-long green and how to shield it from development that would harm its historic character. As a result of those proceedings, the Lebanon Historical Society has conservation authority over 95% of the green, meaning any construction and property improvements must adhere to its building rules and restrictions. But the First Congregational Church of Lebanon is on the 5% of the green the society does not control. In a lawsuit filed in 2019, the historical society is seeking authority to regulate the remaining 5%, saying it needs to be protected like the rest of the green. The church argued that just because the society controls adjacent property doesn’t mean it has legal standing to try to impose that authority on the property where the church buildings stand. Three judges on the Appellate Court on Friday upheld a lower court ruling in favor of the church, saying the case has implications for property owners statewide. The historical society intends to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court, a lawyer said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A lawsuit filed Friday on behalf of two men who claim they were unjustifiably beaten by officers at Sussex Correctional Institution aims to investigate what the filing describes as an “ongoing and egregious pattern of the use of excessive force” against people housed in the prison. The lawsuit was submitted to U.S. District Court in Wilmington on behalf of William “Bill” Davis and Isaac Montague. Both claim that they were beaten as pretrial detainees and that officers deployed pepper spray directly into their noses and mouths as they were held down in two separate incidents this fall. “Justice? I think they definitely need to be charged criminally because eventually they are going to kill somebody,” said Davis, a resident of Bear and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The lawsuit follows other litigation against the Delaware Department of Correction in which people imprisoned by the state claim that officers engage in violence and other violations of basic rights with impunity. Both Davis and Montague are being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Delaware. It is the first time the organization has represented prisoners in recent years and the first such lawsuit since hiring Susan Burke, who took over as the chapter’s legal director earlier this year. “We intend to do a lot of prison litigation,” Burke said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new mural honoring civil rights icon John Lewis now decorates the walls of the barbershop where the late congressman was a regular customer, WUSA-TV reports. The artwork was officially unveiled at HIS grooming Thursday afternoon. Posts on the shop’s Instagram page show that the piece depicts Lewis in the chair getting his head shaved. After Lewis’ death in 2020 of pancreatic cancer, shop owner Jared Scott spoke about the first time Lewis came into his business for a hot shave with a straight razor. “My heart skipped a few beats,” Scott said. “My hands were trembling.” Lewis continued to visit HIS Grooming nearly a dozen times over the course of a year. The art project honoring Lewis has been in the works for a while, but a special event for its unveiling will have D.C. Council members in attendance, as well as U.S. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district’s delegate to Congress.\n\nFlorida\n\nGulf Breeze: A man who was rewarded by the Planters peanut company for being a good Samaritan is continuing to help others in his Panhandle city. Over the previous two Christmas seasons, Mike Esmond donated about $12,000 to pay off utility bills for people in Gulf Breeze who needed some extra help. Then, in March, Planters sent Esmond a check for $104,000 for his good works as part of the company’s “A Nut Above” campaign. Since then, Esmond has continued helping with past-due utility bills, paying off balances for 677 accounts. “In other words, I paid everybody’s past-due account for a while, about March to August, like six months straight,” Esmond said. Last week, he donated funds to pay off 29 accounts, putting his total donations at about $85,000 this year and more than $96,000 over three years. He said he’s continuing his effort in hopes of inspiring others, and it’s been touching to hear how the donations have helped older residents who may need additional assistance. “I’ve had some older, retired people call me crying on the phone because I paid their bills, because they live on Social Security, and they don’t know what’s going on,” Esmond said. The U.S. Army veteran said he was inspired to help with utility bills because of his own experience in the 1980s, when he couldn’t afford to pay his winter gas bill.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Johnny Isakson, an affable Republican politician who rose from the ranks of the Georgia Legislature to become a U.S. senator known as an effective, behind-the-scenes consensus builder, died Sunday. He was 76. Isakson’s son John Isakson said his father died in his sleep before dawn at his home in Atlanta. John Isakson said although his father had Parkinson’s disease, the cause of death was not immediately apparent. “He was a great man, and I will miss him,” John Isakson said. Johnny Isakson, whose real estate business made him a millionaire, spent more than four decades in Georgia political life. In the Senate, he was the architect of a popular tax credit for first-time home buyers that he said would help invigorate the struggling housing market. As chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, he worked to expand programs offering more private health care choices for veterans. Isakson’s famous motto was that “there are two types of people in this world: friends and future friends.” That approach made him exceedingly popular among colleagues. In a farewell Senate speech, he pleaded for bipartisanship at a time of bitter divisions between Republicans and Democrats. He cited his long friendship with U.S. Rep. John Lewis, an Atlanta Democrat and civil rights hero, as an example of two men willing to put party aside to work on common problems.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A working group tasked by the Legislature to come up with recommendations for a new management plan for the state’s tallest peak and its affiliated telescopes released the first draft of its proposal Friday. Mauna Kea is the proposed site for what would be the world’s largest optical telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope. The giant telescope project has sparked a cultural movement among Native Hawaiians who believe the mountain is sacred. Construction of the massive instrument has been blocked by opponents. The group suggested a new governing entity for the mountain, which is managed by the University of Hawaii. The group recommended the school not have a seat on the board of the new governing body. The university’s lease expires in 2033. “The University of Hawaii was represented at the table during the working group discussions,” said the group’s chairperson, Rep. Mark Nakashima, a Democrat whose Hilo district includes Mauna Kea. “One of the premises of the resolution was that the university failed in some of its duties and responsibilities to the Native Hawaiian population, and so it was not included in the final management structure.” The group could not come to a consensus on whether someone from the astronomy field should participate and recommended any such involvement be in an advisory capacity.\n\nIdaho\n\nKuna: Lawmakers are looking at a $400 million tax relief package for the upcoming legislative session that includes a $200 million income tax cut, a top Republican House member said. House Assistant Majority Leader Jason Monks said Friday that the income tax cut involves lowering the top income tax bracket from 6.5% to 6%. Monks spoke at a legislative district town hall meeting in Kuna with several other lawmakers. Monks said Republican Gov. Brad Little is behind the income tax cut plan, as is the House Revenue and Taxation Committee chairman. “They’re greasing the skids pretty good on this,” Monks said. He said the other $200 million would come from a one-time tax relief package. Republican lawmakers last year passed nearly $400 million in tax relief that Democrats said mainly benefitted the wealthy. Idaho’s budget surplus is estimated at $1.6 billion, much of that attributed to the $5 billion the federal government has sent to Idaho in coronavirus relief money. The Legislature is scheduled to meet in Boise on Jan. 10, and lawmakers will look at setting state agency budgets. Republican Gov. Brad Little earlier this month hinted at possible tax cuts stemming from the projected surplus.\n\nIllinois\n\nHoffman Estates: Sears plans to sell the sprawling suburban Chicago corporate headquarters that’s been the struggling retailer’s home for three decades. Transformco, Sears’ parent company, confirmed last week that in early 2022 it plans to market the 273-acre corporate headquarters in the northwest suburb of Hoffman Estates. Transformco has been downsizing Sears’ operations and corporate staff for several years. “These changes have reduced our needs for a corporate campus that was built 30 years ago for the needs of a more centralized business,” Transformco spokesman Larry Costello said in a statement. Costello said employees have been operating under a hybrid structure during the pandemic, with a mix of in-office and remote work. He declined to say how many employees are based out of Hoffman Estates or where a future headquarters might be located. The Hoffman Estates campus was home to more than 4,000 Sears employees as recently as 2017, according to company filings. The site features a 2.3 million-square-foot corporate office and 273 acres, including 100 acres of undeveloped land.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: More than half of the state’s population remains unvaccinated against COVID-19, and its largest hospital system is so strained that it has asked the Indiana National Guard for assistance. A new WalletHub report adds another dire distinction to the resume: Indiana is the least safe state in the country during the pandemic – not just one of the worst or the worst in the Midwest but the absolute worst. Indiana ranked 51st on the list of “Safest States During COVID-19,” which includes all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The rankings came from the following data, according to WalletHub: vaccinations, deaths, hospitalizations, transmission rate and positive testing rate. All five categories were averaged together and graded on a 100-point scale, with 100 being the most safe. Indiana received a score of 17.67 out of 100. Hoosiers fared poorly in each individual category. When looking at vaccination rates, Indiana ranks No. 48. For COVID-19 hospitalizations, it ranks No. 46, tied with South Dakota, Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan. As of Thursday, the state reported more than 3,000 hospitalized patients, according to the Indiana State Department of Health’s dashboard. The state’s latest average positivity rate was 13.8%, as of Dec. 10. Nearly 18,000 Hoosiers have died of COVID-19 throughout the pandemic.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Property owners who ask to remove their names from online property searches to conceal their address may keep their names confidential under a ruling the state Supreme Court published Friday. Des Moines Register reporter Clark Kauffman filed a complaint with the Iowa Public Information Board against Polk County Assessor Randy Ripperger in 2017 after Ripperger refused to release a list of people who had requested their names be removed from the county’s online search-by-name property search database. The list includes police officers, prosecutors, judges and crime victims who want to make it harder for criminals or harassers to find out where they live. There are more than 3,500 property owners on the list. Kauffman alleged that Ripperger was violating the state’s open records law by refusing to provide the list of names. Kauffman said in a hearing that he sought the disabled name list to determine who opts in to the policy and find out if developers, landlords or slumlords are trying to keep their names from public disclosure. The board, which under Iowa law is empowered to enforce the state’s open records law, found in 2018 that Ripperger had violated the law. An administrative law judge and a state court judge affirmed that conclusion, and Ripperger appealed. The court concluded the list of names fits within an exception the Legislature allowed in the state law.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A moratorium on voluntary admissions at Osawatomie State Hospital will be lifted in January to provide more space for adults with long-term mental health issues. The Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services announced Thursday that the ban, which has been in place since 2015, will end as of Jan. 3. The hospital, one of two state-run hospitals for the seriously mentally ill, stopped taking voluntary admissions after receiving citations for not doing enough to help suicidal patients and routinely housing three patients in rooms meant for two because of capacity issues. The policy caused problems for other mental health providers, law enforcement and health care facilities who struggled to place people with serious mental health issues. The department also has created a new classification for mental health providers called State Institutional Alternative, which allows private psychiatric facilities to accept mentally ill patients who have been approved for admission to state hospitals. Currently, eight hospitals in the state are classified as SIAs, and they have cared for 122 adults and 291 youth since September. The agency is also planning renovations on the Osawatomie campus that will eventually increase capacity to 72 certified beds and 110 licensed beds.\n\nKentucky\n\nMadisonville: Two babies survived a tornado that ripped the bathtub in which they were sheltering out of the ground and tossed it with them inside, their grandmother said. Clara Lutz told WFIE-TV she put 15-month-old Kaden and 3-month-old Dallas in the bathtub Dec. 10 with a blanket, a pillow and a Bible. Then the house in Hopkins County started shaking. “Next thing I knew, the tub had lifted, and it was out of my hands,” Lutz said. “I couldn’t hold on. I just – oh my God.” Lutz, who had been hit in the back of the head by the water tank from the tub, said she began looking everywhere among the wreckage for the children. Her house was stripped to the foundation. “All I could say was, ‘Lord please bring my babies back safely. Please, I beg thee,’ ” she said. The bathtub was found in her yard, upside down, with the babies underneath. Authorities from the sheriff’s office drove to the end of her driveway and reunited her with the two children, she said. Dallas had a big bump on the back of his head and had to go to Vanderbilt University Medical Center Nashville because his brain was bleeding, but the bleeding stopped before Lutz got to the hospital, she said. Lutz said the parents of the children live on the north end of the county, and their home was nearly untouched by the tornado.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A man convicted in a killing has been exonerated and freed after being locked up for 12 years. Kendall Gordon walked out of the criminal courthouse in New Orleans a free man Thursday, days after local prosecutors asked a judge to void his conviction and release him, news outlets report. Gordon was serving a life sentence in the shooting death of a young woman during a 2009 home invasion and robbery. But the justice advocacy group Innocence Project New Orleans and the District Attorney’s office said DNA collected from the crime scene linked someone else to the crime. Also, a key witness recanted. “Darceleen Comadore consistently described the intruders that entered her home as an older man and a younger man, explicitly pointing out that the younger intruder had been shot and wounded while in her home by his accomplice,” the IPNO said in a news release. “Ms. Comadore believed she recognized the younger wounded intruder and identified him as Kendall Gordon.” However, she changed her story after learning that another man, Jessie Bibbins III, 18, had been shot and killed with the same weapon as the victim in her home. Bibbins was found dead less than 3 miles from the crime scene, wearing clothes matching those worn by the younger intruder, IPNO said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: New England’s commercial shrimp fishery will remain shut down because of concerns about the health of the crustacean’s population amid warming ocean temperatures. The cold-water shrimp were once a winter delicacy in Maine and beyond, but the fishing industry has been shut down since 2013. A board of the regulatory Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission voted Friday to keep the fishery shuttered for at least three more years. The shrimp prefer cold water, and their population health is imperiled by the warming of the ocean off New England. The Gulf of Maine, in particular, is warming faster than most of the world’s oceans. Scientists have also said recently that warming waters led to increased predation from a species of squid that feeds on shrimp. The board last voted to extend the existing moratorium on commercial fishing of the shrimp in 2018. The board could have decided to reopen the fishing industry Friday but chose not to do so in the face of discouraging news from scientists. Recent surveys of the shrimp show far less of them than historical averages, and there have been seven consecutive years of low abundance, said Maggie Hunter, a scientist with the Maine Department of Marine Resources. Warming waters remain a problem, Hunter said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state’s Public Service Commission on Friday awarded offshore wind renewable energy credits to two developers who have proposed two projects off Maryland’s coast. The decision will support plans by US Wind Inc. and Skipjack Offshore Energy to build separate projects that would produce more than 1,600 megawatts of energy, the PSC said in a news release. The new proposed projects are in addition to the 368 megawatts of offshore wind already being developed by both companies off Maryland’s shore and whose offshore wind renewable energy credits were approved by the commission in 2017. In the second-round application period that ended in June, US Wind submitted three bids, and Skipjack submitted two bids. The proposals were evaluated on a number of criteria, including impacts to customer electric bills; Maryland’s health, environmental and climate interests, including progress toward lowering the state’s greenhouse gas emissions; and economic development benefits, the PSC said. The second-round projects are both expected to be operational before the end of 2026. They are subject to review by the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Nurses at St. Vincent Hospital have reached a tentative agreement to end one of the longest nurse strikes in state history. The deal between the Massachusetts Nurses Associates and Tenet Healthcare, the Dallas-based company that owns the Worcester hospital, was announced late Friday. Union members will vote on the proposal at a later date. The hospital said in a statement that 700 nurses will be able to resume their old jobs, and the nurses hired to replace them will also be able to retain their current positions. “We are glad to finally end the strike and put our sole focus back on patient care,” Carolyn Jackson, the hospital’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We will be setting a new tone at Saint Vincent Hospital: We are one team with a common purpose. Not striking nurses versus replacement nurses. Not nurses versus management.” U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, a former Boston mayor and labor leader in Massachusetts, helped broker the accord during an in-person meeting Friday, the union said in a statement. Federal mediators have been working for two weeks with both sides to reach an accord. The nurses walked out in March complaining that staffing levels were too low and that they had too many patients to care for safely.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The University of Michigan and Michigan State University will require all students, faculty and staff to receive a COVID-19 booster vaccination for the next semester in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The two universities, with the two largest student enrollments in the state, released statements Friday announcing the requirement, noting the omicron variant being found in the state. MSU said in its release that the deadline to get a booster shot is the beginning of the spring semester Jan. 10, while Michigan’s release said Feb. 4. Both schools already require vaccination against COVID-19 and have set their policies to reflect access and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to receive a booster for anyone who is 18 or older and six months out from the last vaccine in their initial series. In July, both university presidents announced vaccines would be required for the fall semester due to spread of the highly infectious delta variant. The first case of the omicron variant was found in Kent County earlier this month. The CDC says the omicron variant may be even more contagious than the highly spreadable delta variant.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Hennepin County’s sheriff has pleaded guilty to drunken driving. Dave Hutchinson entered the plea Thursday to the misdemeanor charge and said he has enrolled in an outpatient treatment program to address his issues with alcohol. Hutchinson crashed his SUV on Interstate 94 near Alexandria on Dec. 8 at 2:30 a.m. after attending a state sheriffs conference. Hutchinson’s blood alcohol level was 0.13%. The legal limit to drive is 0.08%. The sheriff said in a statement that the crash was a “wakeup call” for him. He suffered three broken ribs and head and hip injuries when he rolled the SUV. “I understand the seriousness of my actions, for which I take full responsibility,” Hutchinson said. Hutchinson entered his guilty plea to fourth-degree driving while intoxicated via a plea petition. Douglas County Attorney Chad Larson said a plea agreement calls for a stayed jail sentence of 90 days, up to two years of probation, a $500 fine, a chemical-use assessment and a requirement that he follow the assessment’s recommendations. Hutchinson also must abstain from alcohol and nonprescribed controlled substances and submit to random testing. Larson said it’s a standard misdemeanor sentence for anyone with a first-time drunken-driving conviction.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Five universities are receiving nearly $10 million from the state to cover tuition for aspiring educators. The Mississippi Teacher Residency Program is part of an effort to address the state’s teacher shortage. There were 3,036 certified teacher vacancies in Mississippi’s public schools from Aug. 21 to Oct. 11, 2021, according to a Department of Education survey. The grants will cover tuition and expenses for up to 240 people seeking a graduate degree in elementary and secondary education and are being paid for with American Rescue Plan relief dollars. The money is being split among Delta State University, Jackson State University, Mississippi State University, University of Southern Mississippi and William Carey University. Anyone accepted into the program will receive full scholarships, testing fees, books and mentor stipends. The grant includes training alongside a mentor teacher, testing support, professional development, and a commitment to teaching in a district serving low-income children, racial and ethnic minorities, and children with disabilities.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The state treasurer will no longer help schools refinance bond debt unless superintendents promise not to enforce face mask requirements and other COVID-19 safety measures issued by local officials. Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick this month began requiring school districts trying to refinance bond debt to certify that they’ll obey Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s warning against coronavirus-related mandates, Missourinet reports. Schmitt this month threatened to sue school districts and local health departments that require masks. He cited a November ruling from Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green. “These schools received certification forms because their bond deals were scheduled to close after the Attorney General communicated with schools about the court decision and we were made aware of several schools which did not intend to comply with the order,” Treasurer’s Office spokeswoman Mary Compton said in a Friday email. Fitzpatrick’s policy puts more pressure on districts to ditch mask and quarantine requirements. Without help from the Treasurer’s Office, districts face higher interest rates on debts.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Federal wildlife officials say two species of rare insects in the Rocky Mountains will need several thousand acres of glaciers and snowfields if they are to survive a warming world that’s threatening them with extinction. The western glacier stonefly and the meltwater lednian stonefly live in streams that flow from melting glaciers and snowfields. Scientists say the insects are not doing well and face continued declines as they lose a projected 80% of their habitat in Glacier National Park by 2030. The stoneflies’ peril underscores the threat climate change poses worldwide to mountaintops that are “biodiversity hot spots” – home to a rich variety of plants, animals and insects about which scientists are still learning. The two species live in and around Glacier National Park in Montana; Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, Canada; and Native American tribal lands in western Montana. More recently, they’ve been found in streams in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park and the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness in Montana and Wyoming. A new draft recovery plan from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service suggests the possible transplant of some of the insects to new areas, exploring ways to artificially propagate populations and research into the stoneflies’ heat tolerance.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Even in normal times, the state has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation, with fewer than 2 million residents and plenty of jobs to go around. But with some workers slow to return to work after COVID-19 shutdowns, the state has hit new depths, recording the country’s lowest-ever state unemployment rate of 1.8% in November. Now Gov. Pete Ricketts, who frequently expounds on the value of work, is confronting an intriguing question: Can a governor force citizens to work, even if they apparently aren’t eager or able to do so? Options he’s trying include requiring people to confer with job coaches before seeking unemployment benefits. “There’s going to be a lot of different things we’re going to have to do to reach each individual and, if they’re not working for whatever reason, get them back into the workforce,” Ricketts said recently. “Jobs help create great financial independence for Nebraskans and their families, giving them the dignity to achieve their dreams,” said the Republican governor, whose family’s estimated $4.5 billion in wealth originated with the creation of online brokerage Ameritrade. Nebraska has about 49,000 job openings listed on a state website and 19,000 working-age residents who are not working. About 4,300 people are receiving unemployment benefits.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Fireworks that were called off last year because of the coronavirus pandemic are returning to the Las Vegas Strip on New Year’s Eve, with a theme pointed toward 2022 – Deuces Wild – and the addition of an eighth hotel-top launching place, tourism and elected officials announced Thursday. “Aside from last year, ‘America’s Party’ has been the culminating event of the entire year for more than 20 years,” said Pat Christenson, president of Las Vegas Events, a nonprofit agency created to produce and support big events. Thousands of revelers still congregated on casino-lined Las Vegas Boulevard last year despite the canceled fireworks. There was no mention during a news conference previewing this year’s event of the possible effect of the emergence and spread in recent weeks of the omicron variant of the virus. Fireworks were first held on the Strip on the last night of 2000. The display has helped make New Year’s Eve one of Las Vegas’ biggest events, drawing more than 300,000 revelers, according to tourism officials, and filling the tourism-dependent city’s more than 250,000 hotel rooms. “Being able to host this event again is so special because it allows us to close out the year in a memorable way,” Christenson said in a statement accompanying Thursday’s announcement.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nGreenland: The town has resoundingly rejected a proposal to ban the use of voting machines and return to counting ballots by hand. Voters in the town of Greenland on Saturday defeated a citizen petition that would have stopped the use of voting machines in all local, state and federal elections. The vote was 1,077 against to 120 in favor of the proposal. Town Clerk Marge Morgan said turnout was higher than expected, and officials had to print more ballots. Greenland has a little over 4,000 residents, according to the 2020 U.S. census. Similar attempts to ban voting machines are under way in Hampton and Kensington, and a bill calling for a statewide ban was filed in the Legislature. Interest in banning the machines grew following an audit of a legislative race in Windham. The audit was requested after a losing Democratic candidate asked for a recount, which showed that Republican candidates got hundreds more votes than were originally counted. The discrepancy drew the attention of former President Donald Trump and his supporters in their effort to find evidence of his wider, unfounded claim of election fraud from 2020. But the audit showed the cause of the discrepancy yielded not from the AccuVote machine but from a separate letter-folding machine used to send out absentee ballots.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Marriage equality may soon be better protected as a bill moves on to votes in the state Senate and Assembly. A 2013 court ruling legalized same-sex marriage in New Jersey, but it has not been cemented in a statute. The New Jersey Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee on Thursday voted almost unanimously to move forward the bill that would codify marriage equality into law. Legislators will consider the bill Monday. If it passes both chambers, it heads to Gov. Phil Murphy for his likely approval. He has vocally supported LGBTQ rights during his tenure. The momentum in Trenton arrives at an important time, said Christian Fuscarino, executive director of Asbury Park-based Garden State Equality. “With a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, we cannot afford to sit by in hopes the justices will leave Obergefell v. Hodges intact,” Fuscarino said, referring to the 2015 ruling that legalized marriage equality at a national level. When marriage equality got the all-clear from New Jersey courts, Amy Quinn and her partner of 10 years, Heather Jensen, were among the first to be wed, exchanging vows on Asbury Park Boardwalk. Nearly a decade later, Quinn is now deputy mayor of Asbury Park, and the fight for marriage equality in New Jersey continues. “I can’t believe we’re still fighting for this, but here we are,” Quinn said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed legislation Friday to redraw the state’s three congressional districts and divide a conservative stronghold into multiple districts over the objections of Republicans. Lujan Grisham, a former three-term congresswoman, said the new congressional map establishes a “reasonable baseline for competitive federal elections, in which no one party or candidate may claim any undue advantage.” Republicans disagree, calling it a power grab by Democrats who have long dominated state politics. “These maps are far from fair representation, and they are a disservice to constituents,” said Steve Pearce, chair of the Republican Party of New Mexico. Consultants to the Legislature say the new congressional map gives Democrats an advantage in all three districts to varying degrees, based on past voting behavior. Republicans need a net gain of five seats in 2022 to take control of the U.S. House and effectively freeze President Joe Biden’s agenda on everything from climate change to the economy. Democrat-backed redistricting plans for the House and Senate also were on their way to the governor’s office Friday after a final House vote. Both plans embrace recommendations from Native American communities for shoring up Indigenous voting blocs in New Mexico’s northwest corner.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Despite soaring COVID-19 case numbers, long testing lines and event cancellations, so far New York City hospitals aren’t seeing a repeat of the surges that swamped emergency rooms early in the pandemic. The state reported Saturday that nearly 22,000 people had tested positive for the coronavirus Friday, eclipsing the previous day’s mark for the highest single-day total for new cases since testing became widely available. More than half the positive results were in the city. The Rockettes on Friday canceled remaining performances of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, citing “increasing challenges from the pandemic,” with lines at some testing sites in the city stretched around the block and at-home tests remaining hard to come by or pricier than usual. But new hospitalizations and deaths – so far – are averaging well below their spring 2020 peak and even where they were this time last year, during a winter wave that came as vaccinations were just beginning, city data shows. Mount Sinai Health System’s emergency rooms are seeing about 20% more patients – with all conditions – in recent days, according to Dr. Eric Legome, who oversees two of the network’s seven ERs. But at least so far, “we’re seeing a lot more treat-and-release” COVID-19 patients than in earlier waves, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Supreme Court ruled Friday that nonprofit charter schools can’t avoid facing civil fraud claims alleging mismanagement of taxpayer money by arguing they are immune from such lawsuits like a state agency. The justices reversed a 2019 Court of Appeals decision that had dismissed claims against Kinston Charter Academy, which closed abruptly to 190 students and their teachers in 2013. A 2016 lawsuit by then-Attorney General Roy Cooper sought financial damages for the state and monetary penalties against the academy, its CEO and the chair of its board. Charter schools are tuition-free public schools that receive state funds on a per-pupil basis and have more flexibility – with instruction and enrollment among them – than traditional K-12 schools. They are overseen by the State Board of Education. Kinston Charter Academy and leaders were accused by Cooper’s office of violating the state’s False Claims Act and deceptive trade laws. State attorneys allege the school provided a bogus upgraded enrollment estimate to state education officials that meant receiving additional funds, even as leaders knew the school would not last the 2013-14 school year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reject an appeal by developers of the Dakota Access oil pipeline who are seeking to reinstate a federal permit for the line’s Missouri River crossing. Early this year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed part of a lower court order that revoked the permit and required a new environmental review of the pipeline. “Though the dispute over the pipeline garnered national attention, the D.C. Circuit’s decision plowed no new ground,” lawyers for Standing Rock and other Sioux tribes fighting the pipeline wrote in a brief filed Thursday. The tribes argued that the high court should decline the developer’s petition to hear the case because appeals courts are not split on the issues surrounding the dispute, which can lead to the Supreme Court taking the case. The tribes say the D.C. Circuit judges applied a “conventional” review of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ permitting decisions and “found no abuse of discretion” in the lower court’s order revoking the permit, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The Corps permitted the pipeline’s river crossing, which is just upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and where tribal members fear a leak could occur and harm their water supply.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: More than 1,000 members of the Ohio National Guard have been ordered into hospitals overwhelmed by patients being treated for COVID-19, the vast majority of them unvaccinated, Gov. Mike DeWine announced Friday. The state is also hiring a staffing agency to help recruit nurses from out of state to assist with patient care, DeWine said. “Twenty-two months of this pandemic has taken its toll on our health care workers,” the Republican governor said, recounting stories of short-staffed hospitals needing workers to return for second shifts after only short breaks. Of the Guard members, 150 are medical workers – mainly nurses and EMTs – who will be assigned beginning Monday to hospitals largely in the Akron, Canton and Cleveland areas, which are seeing the highest hospitalization numbers. Most of those hospitals have stopped elective surgeries, and facilities elsewhere are considering the same, the governor said. The remaining Guard members will serve in as-needed hospital roles in other parts of the state. As of Friday, 4,723 Ohioans were hospitalized with COVID-19 – a figure last seen almost a year ago, the governor said. Nine of every 10 of those patients are unvaccinated.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An Oklahoma County grand jury has indicted a top Republican state House leader on multiple felony counts, alleging he misused his power to change state law so his wife could become a tag agent. House Speaker Pro Tempore Terry O’Donnell, the second-highest-ranking member in the chamber, was charged in the indictment Friday with five felonies and three misdemeanors. “He denies any wrongdoing,” said his attorney, Mack Martin. His wife, Teresa O’Donnell, who was also indicted, faces three felonies and one misdemeanor. Court records don’t indicate the name of her attorney. The most severe offense against the couple is conspiracy against the state, which has a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison and a $25,000 fine. The Catoosa Republican introduced a bill in 2019 that allowed spouses of legislators to serve as tag agents. The Oklahoma Tax Commission appointed his wife to take over the Catoosa Tag Agency on Aug. 1, 2019, three months after Gov. Kevin Stitt signed the bill into law. Terry O’Donnell said last year that his wife had no intention of becoming a tag agent when he sponsored the bill. He said she sought the appointment after her mother died unexpectedly from pancreatic cancer. Her mother, Georgia McAfee, had been in charge of the Catoosa Tag Agency for more than 40 years. Teresa O’Donnell had worked there for more than four years before her appointment. Grand jurors alleged the two submitted a fraudulent application to the Oklahoma Tax Commission.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A weeklong strike is underway, affecting a number of grocery stores across the state less than a week before Christmas Day. The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 555, representing many employees at Fred Meyer and QFC stores, confirmed early Friday morning that it is moving ahead with a walkout at stores in Portland, Bend, Newberg and Klamath Falls, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. The details and specifics of a walkout are complicated. While the UFCW represents roughly 10,000 Fred Meyer employees, not all stores, departments or worker categories are participating in the strike. The union has been in labor negotiations for months with the Kroger-owned supermarket chains. Last weekend, UFCW announced its members had authorized a strike. Union representatives said Fred Meyer has been underpaying certain workers, in violation of contract terms. The grocery chain hasn’t been providing necessary information to the union to refute or verify its concern or to address it through the grievance process, according to the union. Workers are also seeking wage increases. A Fred Meyer statement provided to OPB confirmed that its stores affected by the strike, along with impacted QFC stores, remain open for customers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will no longer impose income taxes on public-sector workers and nurses who receive student loan forgiveness from two major programs, the Wolf administration announced Friday. The change affects participants in the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which provides debt relief to teachers, social workers, military members and other public servants, and the Pennsylvania Student Loan Relief for Nurses Program, a recent pandemic-era initiative to forgive up to $7,500 in student loan debt incurred by state-licensed nurses. Most other states and the federal government do not subject student loan forgiveness to taxation, but Pennsylvania lawmakers who pushed for the change said the state Department of Revenue had considered canceled student loans to be taxable income. That meant that a Pennsylvania resident who owed $50,000 in student loans would be subject to a $1,535 state tax bill once that debt was forgiven. “These people have chosen to serve the public, and often in lower-paying fields, because they want to make a difference. They don’t have thousands of dollars lying around to pay a one-time tax bill. So it’s wrong to take what should be a blessing and turn it into just another burden,” Gov. Tom Wolf said at a news conference Friday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A major theater canceled its performances of “A Christmas Carol” over the weekend because a cast member was dealing with COVID-19 symptoms. The Trinity Repertory Company made the announcement on its Facebook page about half an hour before Saturday’s matinee show. The Providence theater said the unnamed cast member reported feeling sick at home Saturday morning, and the afternoon performance had to be scrubbed because there wasn’t an understudy who could take on the role. The theater said it was canceling the rest of the weekend’s performances out of an abundance of caution. Officials apologized for the abrupt change and said ticket holders would receive a full refund and complimentary access to an online streaming version of the production. “While we never make the decision to cancel a show lightly, our commitment to the health and safety of our artists, staff, and audiences are extremely important to us and made this decision clear,” the theater said in a statement. “A Christmas Carol” runs through Jan. 2 at Trinity Rep. The online streaming version is available until Jan. 16.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nFolly Beach: Three young men on a beach vacation dug up a marked loggerhead turtle nest, causing 71 of the 90 eggs not to hatch, wildlife officials said. The men posted video to Snapchat in September of themselves digging up a nest marked with orange tape and signs on Folly Beach, and the Department of Natural Resources said agents were able to track them down. The three men, all under age 21, met with wildlife agents and admitted what they did. In exchange, the agency said it won’t charge them with a count of unlawful taking of loggerhead turtle eggs for each egg, instead agreeing to two counts for each man who was seen digging up the nest and one count for the person who filmed it. The men will face a fine of up to $2,000 on each charge and community service, the agency said in a statement. Wildlife agents will recommend all three men work with the state Marine Turtle Conservation program so they can find out how much work goes into protecting sea turtles in South Carolina. More than 1,300 volunteers along the coast help protect nests. Female sea turtles don’t lay eggs every year, and their nests are vulnerable if not protected on the beaches. Wildlife agents said 2021 overall was a successful year protecting the turtle eggs, with 5,649 nests recorded.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nCuster: Authorities say numerous fire departments worked through the night to put out a fire at a popular 85-year-old lodge in the Black Hills. Two firefighters received minor injuries in the blaze at Sylvan Lake Lodge in Custer State Park. No guests of the multistory hotel were hurt, according to the Custer Volunteer Fire Department. Firefighters discovered a “free-burning fire” when they arrived at the lodge Saturday night, authorities said. They encountered heavy smoke and flames extending to the roof. The stone-and-timber lodge was built in 1937, funded in part through Depression-era New Deal programs. A wing of additional rooms was added in 1991. The original Sylvan Lake Hotel was a stopping point for adventurers looking to climb Black Elk Peak, the highest point in America east of the Rockies, according to the lodge’s website. Alarms initially went off in the southeastern part of the building, authorities said. Freezing temperatures, narrow roads covered with ice and snow, and darkness added to the difficulty of dealing with the blaze. About two dozen agencies responded to the fire. Thirty-one cabins are nearby, all within close access to Sylvan Lake. Authorities asked people to steer clear of the area, where Custer firefighters said on social media that a massive cleanup effort is required.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The future of Second Avenue, ravaged by a bomb blast nearly a year ago, will feature a life-size mural of the street’s historic buildings, expanded sidewalks and a restored tree canopy. Mayor John Cooper revealed details of the first phase of Second Avenue’s reconstruction Wednesday among a crowd of residents, property owners and first responders. The historic avenue was the site of a bombing on Christmas Day 2020 that crumbled 100-year-old facades and severely damaged dozens of businesses and homes. The bomber, Anthony Quinn Warner, was the only person killed in the explosion. The bombing left Nashville with the task of salvaging as much as possible of the core section of Nashville’s original downtown Market Street, literally brick by brick. In the months since, Cooper’s Second Avenue Task Force and numerous community organizations facilitated nine community workshops to collect input from more than 500 residents on how the street should be rebuilt. The first phase will be funded by a $20 million allocation approved Tuesday by the Metro Council as part of Cooper’s $564 million capital spending plan. The plans focus on creating a “more livable streetscape” with widened sidewalks, increased space for outdoor dining and food kiosks, plant life, and public art.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A group of attorneys and advocates have pledged to seek clemency for 110 Black soldiers who were convicted in a mutiny and riots at a military camp in the city in 1917. The South Texas College of Law Houston and the NAACP’s local branch have signed an agreement to continue fighting for clemency for the soldiers of the all-Black Third Battalion of the U.S. Army’s 24th Infantry Regiment, the Houston Chronicle reports. They plan to ask the secretary of the Army to posthumously grant honorable discharges and urge the Army Board for Correction of Military Records to recommend pardons to President Joe Biden. The soldiers were either executed or given long prison sentences. “We are on a quest to obtain justice for the 24th Infantry Regiment … that organized group of men who died with shameful reputations at the hands of those who had the power of the government, the courts and the power of the media,” said Bishop James Dixon, board president of the NAACP Houston Branch. On Aug. 23, 1917, four months after the U.S. had entered World War I, the regiment mutinied in Houston. It resulted in the largest murder trial in U.S. history, with 110 out of 118 soldiers found guilty. Nineteen were hanged. Law enforcement immediately recorded the events as a deadly, premeditated assault by Black Army soldiers on a white population. Historians and advocates now recognize the riot as part of the regiment’s response to what it believed was a white mob heading for them.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A local group is hoping to welcome Afghan refugees to America through playing soccer. Refugee Soccer organizes teams of those who’ve settled in Utah. It gathers equipment and helps place players on mainstream soccer clubs. “Really the mission is to bridge the gap between mainstream and refugee communities,” Executive Director Adam Miles told KSL NewsRadio. Miles is now leading a group of 10 volunteers to a military base in New Mexico after Christmas to play soccer with Afghans who fled the country this summer and are waiting for placement in homes around the country. Miles and his team will head there after Christmas and stay through the first of the year. “Three weeks of concentrated, intense (soccer) clinics, and getting to know these kids and building some relationships,” Miles said. He said soccer allows them to build those relationships. “It’s creating that bridge between people that don’t look like them, don’t speak their language and probably don’t practice their religion but are connecting over the world’s sport – the beautiful game of soccer,” he said. The group also has another big challenge. Miles said many kids fled Afghanistan with nothing. “They fled for their lives … a lot of these kids don’t have shoes.” So Refugee Soccer is trying to collect 500 to 800 pairs of shoes and cleats for the kids to wear.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The mayor says he hopes to double housing production over the next five years as part of an effort to end chronic homelessness in the city. Mayor Miro Weinberger released a 10-point action plan Thursday to fulfill what he calls the “promise of housing as a human right.” “The path to making good on the promise that decent, stable housing is a human right is to build a lot more homes throughout the city and throughout the region,” Weinberger said. “This will require community change and understanding from us all. Our goal should not simply be to reduce homelessness; it must be to end it.” Mychamplainvalley.com reports Weinberger said the number of people in Chittenden County experiencing chronic homelessness has risen from 35 in 2018 to more than 160 now. The mayor’s action plan includes investing $5 million in COVID-19 relief funds to build new, permanently affordable housing. That would include at least $1 million for initiatives to better serve the chronically homeless population. The plan would also set a goal of creating 1,250 new homes by the end of 2026, with a quarter of those permanently affordable.\n\nVirginia\n\nFairfax: Police say four bodies discovered at two different locations in the state are the work of a serial killer who used a shopping cart to transport his victims’ bodies after meeting them on dating sites. At a press conference Friday, Fairfax County Police Chief Kevin Davis dubbed the suspect, 35-year-old Anthony Robinson, of Washington, D.C., the “shopping cart killer” and said police are working to determine if there are other victims. Davis said Robinson, who was taken into custody in Rockingham County last month, has lived in multiple locations, including New York and Maryland, in recent years. Police in Harrisonburg arrested Robinson last month and charged him with two counts of murder after finding two bodies in a vacant lot in the city. “The good thing is he’s in custody. The challenge that remains is identifying other victims,” Davis said. One body found in Fairfax County has not yet been identified. The three victims who have been identified all went missing in the past few months. Police say they are trying to research Robinson’s life going back many years to see if there might be more victims. “That’s what worries us,” Davis said. “He didn’t suddenly turn into who he is three months ago.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Voters have retained socialist City Councilmember Kshama Sawant, a controversial lawmaker and longtime foe of hometown tech giant Amazon. Sawant had faced a recall effort. King County Elections on Friday officially certified the Dec. 7 recall election, showing Sawant narrowly prevailing with 50.4% voting “no” on the recall question and 49.6% people casting “yes” ballots. Sawant, a 48-year-old economics professor, is the longest-tenured councilmember in Seattle. By surviving the recall, she gave a boost to the beleaguered left wing in liberal Seattle, which was bruised in last month’s general election when business-friendly candidates won the mayor’s office and a council seat. Sawant has had an outsized influence on the tone and direction of Seattle politics since she launched her political career under the banner of the Socialist Alternative party in 2012, when she ran unsuccessfully for state representative. Sawant was elected to the City Council the following year, and her threat to run a voter initiative drive for an immediate $15 minimum wage has been credited with pressuring business leaders and then-Mayor Ed Murray to reach a deal raising the wage to $15 over a few years. Seattle was the first major city in the U.S. to adopt such a measure.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: A former city councilor who is charged with breaching the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot has pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts. Eric Barber, 43, admitted to entering the Capitol and stealing a portable charger from a C-SPAN media station during a remote hearing Thursday, the Parkersburg News and Sentinel reports. “When I entered the Capitol building, I knew we weren’t supposed to be there,” he said after the judge asked if the charges were accurate. The criminal complaint alleged photos and security video showed Barber inside the Capitol wearing a green, combat-style helmet and a green, military-style field jacket. It said that video recorded Barber saying, “They’re giving us the building,” and that he took selfies in the Capitol Rotunda. It also claims he stole a portable power station from a C-SPAN media stand. Barber was elected to the Parkersburg City Council in 2016 as a Democrat. He changed his registration to independent a year later, then changed it again to Republican before losing his reelection bid last November. As part of the plea agreement, other misdemeanor counts will be dismissed. Barber’s sentencing was set for March 31.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The city will soon have a change in leadership. The U.S. Senate on Thursday evening confirmed the nomination of Mayor Tom Barrett to become ambassador to the small European country of Luxembourg. Barrett, who was elected mayor in 2004, did not say when he plans to step down. Common Council President Cavalier Johnson will become acting mayor until a special election can be held to fill the remainder of Barrett’s term, which ends in 2024. Johnson is one of seven candidates who have filed papers to run for the permanent position. Others include Milwaukee County Sheriff Earnell Lucas, Ald. Marina Dimitrijevic and former Ald. Bob Donovan. After his nomination was confirmed, Barrett thanked President Joe Biden, who nominated him, and U.S. Sens. Tammy Baldwin and Ron Johnson. “I’m not running from something; I’m running to something,” Barrett said in a virtual press conference after the vote. “And I think we all recognize that there are different chapters in life, and I’m very, very eager now to start this next chapter.”\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Residents south of the town are sounding the alarm over the possibility that dozens of high-end commercial campsites, roads and related infrastructure could be carved into the lower flanks of Munger Mountain. A Wyoming-owned 640-acre section of land that raises money for the state’s school trust account and is exempted from local zoning regulations could host the development. At the direction of legislators seeking to wring more money out of state lands in exorbitantly priced Jackson Hole, the Office of State Lands and Investments has identified the site as a potential moneymaker and plans to issue an open-ended request for proposals, Jason Crowder, the office’s deputy director, told the Jackson Hole News&Guide. That board, which has the final say, consists of five state officials: Gov. Mark Gordon, Secretary of State Ed Buchanan, Auditor Kristi Racines, Treasurer Curt Meier and State Superintendent Jillian Balow. Although a request for proposals was once expected out by September, Crowder is now assigning no time frame for its release. But a luxury “glamour camping” company, Under Canvas, has already expressed an interest in building another of its safari-inspired glamping compounds on the Munger parcel. That the concept is being met with firm resistance.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/20"}]}

Come on out on Friday, Saturday or Sunday to watch the great play by the best players!”\n\nTrump is benefitting from his professional relationship with LIV Golf, especially after officials at PGA of America pulled the 2022 PGA Championship from Bedminster following the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol. In October, LIV Golf will hold its final competition of the year at another Trump property, Trump National Doral in South Florida.\n\nBut while activists, media outlets and others have expressed concerns that LIV Golf provides international legitimacy to the ruling regime in Saudi Arabia, which has been accused of human rights violations for years, Trump has brushed aside such criticisms.\n\nDuring an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier this week, he spoke approvingly about how the golf tour, which is financed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, has already improved the kingdom’s reputation.\n\n“I think LIV has been a great thing for Saudi Arabia, for the image of Saudi Arabia,” Trump told the Journal.\n\nA spokesman for Trump did not respond to questions from CNN.\n\nHuman rights groups and media organizations have questioned both LIV Golf’s organizers and players over the tour’s connection to Saudi Arabia. Several of those questions have centered around the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nA US intelligence report released last year determined that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the operation to capture or kill the Saudi journalist, confirming reports soon after the murder that the CIA had made the same conclusion. During his presidency, however, Trump publicly downplayed allegations that bin Salman was involved as his administration strengthened US ties with the Saudis.\n\nBut LIV Golf’s event at Bedminster has also raised the ire of some survivors and families of victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Speaking on Tuesday at a press conference near Bedminster, Terry Strada, chair of 9/11 Families United, said the group was “appalled” by the “offensive, disrespectful and hurtful” tournament at Trump’s club, which is just 50 miles from the site of the 2001 New York attack. Strada said she was “very disappointed” in Trump, but noted that he was not the main target of the group’s criticism.\n\nIn an interview with ESPN at his club Thursday, Trump reiterated that he has been “friends” with people in Saudi Arabia for a “long time.”\n\n“Frankly, what they’re doing for golf is so great. What they’re doing for the players is so great,” the former President said.\n\nAsked what he would say to the families of 9/11 victims who are protesting the LIV Golf event, Trump appeared to question whether there was knowledge of the Saudi involvement in the terrorist attacks.\n\n“Nobody’s gotten to the bottom of 9/11, unfortunately, and they should have, as to the maniacs that did that horrible thing to our city, to our country, to the world,” he said. “So nobody’s really been there. But I can tell you that there are a lot of really great people that are out here today.”\n\nFollowing Trump’s remarks, Strada told CNN that the former President “knows full well it was the Kingdom. He did everything in his power to protect the kingdom while in office by reneging on a promise he made to 9/11 families he would declassify FBI reports re: Saudis involvement in 9/11.”\n\nThe new circuit has drawn criticism from the PGA Tour, which has suspended players who have signed on with LIV Golf, as well as from some of golf’s biggest stars, including Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy. The allure of LIV Golf for the sport’s top athletes – including larger purses and guaranteed payouts – threatens the PGA Tour’s dominance and seems to have caught the legacy organization off guard.\n\nTrump himself seems to be relishing the damage to the PGA Tour, with which he’s had a rocky relationship. While his clubs have hosted events for the PGA and other professional golf events in the past, the PGA Tour has not held an event at a Trump property since a March 2016 tournament at Doral. And after stripping Bedminster of the 2022 PGA Championship, the organization has been squarely in Trump’s sights.\n\n“All of those golfers that remain ‘loyal’ to the very disloyal PGA, in all of its different forms, will pay a big price when the inevitable MERGER with LIV comes, and you get nothing but a big ‘thank you’ from PGA officials who are making Millions of Dollars a year,” Trump wrote last week in a post on Truth Social. “If you don’t take the money now, you will get nothing after the merger takes place, and only say how smart the original signees were.”\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has spoken out about professional sports since entering politics. During his presidency, he frequently criticized the National Football League for allowing players to protest during the national anthem. And last year, Trump joined other Republicans in calling on Americans to boycott Major League Baseball after the league moved its All-Star Game from Atlanta following a new Georgia election law.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction.", "authors": ["Michael Warren"], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2022/08/10/liv-golf-david-feherty-explains-why-left-nbc/10290523002/", "title": "NBC's David Feherty explains why he left for LIV Golf", "text": "Cameron Jourdan\n\nGolfweek\n\nDavid Feherty is not one to mince words.

(AP) — Luke Gannon is playing in his first U.S. Open and had one of those moments that made him realize this was a stage unlike any other the Kansan has played. It was a bit awkward, too.\n\nHe looked down 131 yards to the 11th green to find a tiny target on the shortest hole at The Country Club. Off to the left of the green waiting on him to hit was a player wearing white shorts, a black shirt, remnants of a beard, no hat and someone in no hurry.\n\nPhil Mickelson was carrying only a wedge and a putter and waved him through.\n\nThe Sunday before U.S. Open week is rarely more peaceful with only a few dozen players getting a look at the course, some caddies arriving ahead of their players to walk the course and check the yardages.\n\nThe peace won't last long, and this time isn't all about the U.S. Open and its reputation as the toughest test in golf.\n\nOPINION: McIlroy's win - and subtle shot at LIV Golf's Greg Norman - was greatest gift he could give PGA Tour\n\nNEVER MISS A MOMENT: Follow our sports newsletter for daily updates\n\nMickelson had arrived from London where he was among a dozen players at the U.S. Open who took part in the Saudi-funded debut of the LIV Golf Invitational. Half of those players were PGA Tour members a few weeks ago. Mickelson still is, choosing not to resign his membership.\n\nThe first official day of practice on Monday includes Mickelson in the first press conference of the week, where it's likely he'll face more questions about the lucrative LIV Golf renegade circuit than his bid to finally ended 30 years of frustration at the only major he hasn't won.\n\nMickelson didn't want to share any of those thoughts until Monday. He went about his work, placing four hole-sized placards around the green to practice.\n\nThe topic is unavoidable and threatens to overshadow the second-oldest championship in golf held at Brookline, one of the five founding golf clubs when the USGA was formed in 1894.\n\nPGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan only stoked the passion of the debate when he offered his first public thoughts since he announced he was suspending all PGA Tour members who joined. For how long? Monahan wasn't prepared to say.\n\nBut he made pointed remarks during his 12-minute appearance on CBS during the Canadian Open. He referred to LIV Golf as nothing more than a series of exhibition matches. He said true, pure competition was found at the PGA Tour, and it was that stage that created the profiles and presences of players now cashing in on Saudi riches.\n\nAs for the blowback for players taking money provided by the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia, a country known for its abysmal record on human rights?\n\n\"I would ask any player that has left, or any player that would ever consider leaving, ‘Have you ever had to apologize for being a member of the PGA Tour?’” Monahan said.\n\nHe was asked why players like Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Bryson DeChambeau and even the lesser-known players like Talor Gooch couldn't play both tours. He answered with a question of his own.\n\n“Why do they need us so badly?” Monahan said. “Those players have chosen to sign multiyear, lucrative contracts to play in a series of exhibition matches against the same players over and over again. You look at that versus what we see here today.”\n\nThe Canadian Open featured a final group of Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau and wasn't settled until the end. McIlroy birdied his last two holes for a 62 to win by one over Finau (62), while Thomas bogeyed the last two holes for a 64.\n\nOne day after LIV Golf finished its 54-hole event with Charl Schwartzel winning $4.75 million ($4 million for his score, $750,000 as part of the winning team), the Canadian Open had enormous crowds with thousands surrounding the 18th green.\n\n“It's true and pure competition that creates the profiles and presences of the world’s greatest players,” Monahan said. “And that’s why they need us. That’s what we do.”\n\nMcIlroy got into the act. It was the first time he had defended a title on the PGA Tour — he had to wait two years when the Canadian was canceled in 2020 and 2021 by the pandemic — and his TV interview included a dig at Norman.\n\nMcIlroy has said such a “super league” was a bad idea even before Norman got involved. Norman told the Washington Post that McIlroy had been “brainwashed” by the tour.\n\nThe victory was the 21st on the PGA Tour for McIlroy.\n\n\"One more than somebody else,\" McIlroy said.\n\nNorman has 20.\n\nMcIlroy already has four majors, twice as many as Norman, and he will hope to add to that total and get away from questions on why he has gone eight years without one.\n\nWith so much chatter on whether this Saudi-backed league is good for golf, a force for golf or simply a money grab for a majority of players on the back end of their careers, McIlroy probably won't get pestered about when he'll win his next major.\n\nMaybe that will change on Thursday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2022/08/03/pga-tour-liv-golf-lawyers-tee-11-liv-golf-members-challenge-suspensions/10230520002/", "title": "PGA Tour, LIV Golf lawyers are on the tee as 11 LIV Golf members ...", "text": "Todd Kelly\n\ngolfweek.com\n\nGentlemen ... start your litigation.\n\nEleven former PGA Tour members who joined the LIV Golf Series have sued the PGA Tour, challenging their suspensions after they defied the Tour's rules on seeking permission to play outside events.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the suit on Wednesday.\n\nPhil Mickelson, Bryson DeChambeau, Abraham Ancer, Jason Kokrak, Carlos Ortiz, Pat Perez, Ian Poulter and Peter Uihlein are the plaintiffs in the suit.\n\nThree other LIV members, Hudson Swafford of St. Simons Island, Ga., Talor Gooch and Matt Jones are seeking a temporary restraining order so that they can play in the PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup Playoffs, which begin next week.\n\nGooch, Jones and Swafford were qualified for the playoffs before leaving for LIV.\n\nThe lawsuit, obtained by Golfweek, states:\n\n\"As the Tour’s monopoly power has grown, it has employed its dominance to craft an arsenal of anticompetitive restraints to protect its long-standing monopoly. Now, threatened by the entry of LIV Golf, Inc. (“LIV Golf”), and diametrically opposed to its founding mission, the Tour has ventured to harm the careers and livelihoods of any golfers, including Plaintiffs Phil Mickelson, Talor Gooch, Hudson Swafford, Matt Jones, Bryson DeChambeau, Abraham Ancer, Carlos Ortiz, Ian Poulter, Pat Perez, Jason Kokrak, and Peter Uihlein (“Plaintiffs”), who have the temerity to defy the Tour and play in tournaments sponsored by the new entrant. The Tour has done so in an intentional and relentless effort to crush nascent competition before it threatens the Tour’s monopoly.\"\n\nLIV Golf has now staged three events and ahead of each, a new group of PGA Tour and DP World Tour players have joined the upstart circuit backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. And each time, the Tour has suspended them.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been accused of wide-ranging human rights abuses, including politically motivated killings, torture, forced disappearances and inhumane treatment of prisoners. And members of the royal family and Saudi government were accused of involvement in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist.\n\n“I just wish it wasn’t this way. I think wherever you qualify, you have the credentials to play somewhere, you should be able to do so,” Ancer said to Golfweek last week at the LIV Golf Invitational Series event at Trump National Bedminster. He also thinks he’d play in the playoffs if given the chance. “Everything is changing day by day, so I don’t even know what’s happening. I’m committed to LIV, but I’d like to play all over the world. We’ll see what happens.”\n\nMatthew Wolff was unable to give a definitive answer to whether or not he’d compete in the playoffs when asked at Trump Bedminster, but said he’d “absolutely” consider it.\n\nOn the other side of the issue was two-time Players champion Davis Love III of St. Simons Island, who said last week at the Rocket Mortgage Championship in Detroit that PGA Tour players could elect to strike major championships that allow LIV Golf members next season.\n\nLove mentioned the U.S. Open and said on Tuesday at the site of the Wyndham Championship in Greensboro, N.C., that he didn't intend to single out that tournament.\n\nBut he said there could be an action of some kind from PGA Tour members.\n\n\"I didn't try to single out the U.S. Open as the players striking or not -- threatening not to play,\" he said at the Sedgefield Country Club. \"I was saying that if the\n\nLIV guys sue and are allowed to play on the PGA Tour, that the players are enough fed up with it, we understand that we make the rules on the PGA Tour and the commissioner's enforcing our rules and we don't want those guys playing ... come and cherry picking our tournaments, that we hold all the cards.

Those who remained members, such as Mickelson, were suspended.\n\n“These players have made their choice or their own financial-based reasons,” Monahan said in a memo to his membership. “But they can't demand the same PGA Tour membership benefits, considerations, opportunities and platform as you.”\n\nIan Poulter said he would appeal the ruling. McDowell said he wanted to “keep the high moral ground” by resigning to try to keep litigation to a minimum. He thinks suspensions are a healthy way to go about business.\n\nMickelson had nothing to say except that he didn't want to talk about the PGA Tour in his first tournament in four months, only to confirm he will play all eight of the LIV events, five of which will be in the United States.\n\nWhen told that people were interested in his situation, Mickelson replied, “I'm very flattered so many people are interested.”\n\nStill to be determined is whether those players are ever welcome back. For now, Monahan made it clear that the suspensions include the Presidents Cup — the International team (countries outside Europe) is determined by the world ranking.\n\nMonahan said the players who resigned will have their names removed from the PGA Tour standings — FedEx Cup and Presidents Cup — after this week. He said the tour will make sure those who haven’t resigned will not affect rankings on various lists of tour players.\n\nThe USGA already has said eligible players can still compete in the U.S. Open next week. The PGA Tour does not run the majors.\n\nPGA champion Justin Thomas and four-time major champion Rory McIlroy welcomed the decision from the tour stop this week at the Canadian Open.\n\n“I think anybody that’s shocked clearly hasn’t been listening to the message that Jay and everybody’s been putting out,” Thomas said. \"They took that risk going into it, whether they thought it was a risk or not. I have great belief and great confidence in the PGA Tour and where we’re going and continuing to grow to, and those guys just aren’t going to be a part of it.”\n\nTen players have resigned from the PGA Tour, a list that includes Johnson and Sergio Garcia. Mickelson, who has lifetime membership with 45 PGA Tour titles, is among those who has not.\n\nLIV Golf, run by Greg Norman and funded by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, responded to the tour's decision by calling it vindictive and divisive.\n\n“It's troubling that the tour, an organization dedicated to creating opportunities for golfers to play the game, is the entity blocking golfers from playing,” LIV Golf said. “This certainly is not the last word on this topic. The era of free agency is beginning as we are proud to have a full field of players joining us in London, and beyond.”\n\nAt issue is players competing without a conflicting event release from the PGA Tour.\n\nPlayers typically receive three such releases a year for tournaments overseas. Monahan denied releases for the LIV Golf Invitational because it is an eight-tournament series that plans to compete directly with the PGA Tour in the United States.\n\nThe tour does not allow releases for events in North America.\n\n“We have followed the tournament regulations from start to finish in responding to those players who have decided to turn their backs on the PGA Tour by willfully violating a regulation,” he wrote.\n\nLIV Golf has paid enormous signing fees, with The Daily Telegraph reporting $150 million for Johnson and Mickelson declining to dispute reports he was paid $200 million. Both are more than Tiger Woods' career earnings on the PGA Tour.\n\nNorman has said LIV would support the players even if it wound up in the courts. McDowell said some players already have spoken to lawyers.\n\n“We haven’t been issued releases. We feel like we should have been issued releases. We’ve done it for the last 20 years, operated all over the world,” McDowell said. “Listen, we all know the situation is about something bigger. It’s competition and it’s not liked. They are having to play the game the way they feel they have to play it, which is playing hard ball.”\n\nThe European tour has not said whether it would suspend its players. It has an alliance with the PGA Tour commercially, including the first co-sanctioned events this year on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe first test for PGA Tour players figures to be the Travelers Championship in Connecticut, the week after the U.S. Open. Johnson was among those listed in the field.\n\nThe LIV Golf Invitational was being streamed on YouTube and Facebook. Before the opening round, Norman said he was thrilled to see an effort 30 years in the making come to fruition.\n\nHe tried to start a World Golf Tour in the 1990s for only the elite players and had a TV contract lined up until the PGA Tour quashed the moment with support from Arnold Palmer. That circuit never got off the ground.\n\nThis one did, with the backing of riches the likes of which golf has never seen.\n\nEach tournament offers $25 million in prize money, with $4 million for the individual winner. The PGA Tour's richest event is The Players Championship at $20 million. The Canadian Open this week, which has five of the top-10 players in the world, has an $8.7 million purse.\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga-tour/2023/07/11/what-we-know-about-tours-proposed-deal-with-pif-after-senate-hearing/70401975007/", "title": "PGA Tour on The Hill: What we know after officials grilled by Senate ...", "text": "PGA Tour chief operating officer Ron Price and Tour Policy Board member Jimmy Dunne appeared on Tuesday before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Investigations in Washington D.C., to answer questions about the framework agreement between the Tour and the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund and the LIV Golf League, which was announced on June 6.\n\nThe agreement stunned the golf world since the Tour and LIV Golf had engaged in a bitter war of words and litigation since LIV Golf launched in June of 2022.

The final bill he received isn’t cheap, but still represents hella value given the alternative he faced.\n\nFor not much more commitment, top players receive a lot more reward: significantly increased purses, often fewer guys to beat for the money, enormous bonus programs not dependent on performance, and an opportunity to benefit from the substantial adjacent wealth surrounding golf, like owning equity in the innovative digital stadium concept announced today by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.\n\nIt’s been the mantra of every commissioner — admittedly there have only been four — that the PGA Tour is a member-led organization. That’s been nominally true, but only as much as players care to get involved. Most didn’t because they saw no compelling reason to distract themselves from the grind of competition, where their money was made. But when the game’s stars became a sought-after asset class, decisions had to be made. Some opted to cut and run for Saudi money, others to stay and fight — as much against the structure and complacency of their own Tour as against LIV.\n\nWednesday showed that the Tour’s biggest names have cemented their position atop the food chain.\n\n“We all sort of are our own little independent businesses and we sort of try to compete against each other, and I think this is the first time in a long time where we sort of all sat down and were like, let’s try to be business partners,” McIlroy said. “How can we all pull in the same direction here to benefit everyone and to help the entire Tour and to help each other basically.”\n\nMONDAY NIGHT GOLF:PGA Tour stars, including Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy, to compete in virtual TGL\n\nMORE:PGA Tour having 'strongest year in history,' commissioner says\n\nGREAT WITH COFFEE:The biggest stories, every morning. And we deliver. Sign up now!\n\nAs with any workplace, the Tour has always had a schism between the Have Nots and the Have Yachts, with each camp routinely grumbling that money headed in the other direction ought by rights be coming to them instead. The new future that Monahan outlined won’t do much to heal the divide. That was clear in a meeting of the PGA Tour’s board on Tuesday, when player-member James Hahn was the lone dissenting voice to the new structure that was duly ratified.\n\nIn a member-led organization, Hahn’s voice counts as much as that of Woods, no matter how many more fans rush for their remote controls when Tiger plays. But Wednesday’s unveiling was a long-overdue acknowledgement by the PGA Tour that its business cannot be based on mollifying a swath of members who are well-compensated for comparative mediocrity. Every major sports league is built around the stars who drive engagement and revenue. Fans and sponsors expect it. The PGA Tour is finally moving to guarantee the product it provides both.\n\nThere will be griping about the new dispensation, of course, some of it defensible. It creates a caste system of tournaments as those not elevated to star status struggle to draw compelling fields. Using the controversial Player Impact Program to define “top” players eligible for lucrative events throws a lifeline to struggling fan favorites (like Rickie Fowler) that other criteria — the world golf ranking — would not.\n\nTo defuse dissent, there’s a sop to those who labor below deck on the good ship Tiger: a guaranteed minimum of $500,000 a year to meet the costs associated with competing. Manna for some, meaningless to most. You’d have to scroll through 164 names on this season’s money list to find a player who failed to reach that earnings threshold.\n\nBut the gravy doesn’t drip down to the developmental Korn Ferry Tour, the chief pathway to the main circuit. Nor was there news about fast tracking top amateurs onto the Tour. That leaves an opening for LIV to grab the rising talent pipeline, but that would require a strategy of developing talent rather than paying a premium for established stars. There’s no real evidence of that long-term game plan from LIV.\n\nFor all the specifics offered, questions remain. Monahan said none of the Tour stops elevated for stars will be held outside the U.S., which suggests he has abandoned plans for three lucrative overseas events. That risks leaving the world stage to LIV and turning the PGA Tour into essentially an American company that exports content rather than the game. These are issues the Tour will need to address.\n\nThe notion that guys who left for LIV will experience buyer’s remorse and look longingly at the bountiful paradise Monahan promised his stars today is probably overstated. Most simply wouldn’t benefit under the Tour’s new system for reasons of eroded competitiveness, physical frailty or apathy. Not that they’ll have the option. Monahan was asked if he would lift the suspension on a LIV player who wanted to dismount from the Saudis and saddle up again with his old colleagues.\n\n“No,” he said flatly. “As I’ve been clear throughout, every player has a choice, and I respect their choice, but they’ve made it. We’ve made ours.”\n\nIn the case of Cameron Smith, much depends on whether the choice has already been made. Rumors suggest the world No. 2 will soon decamp to LIV. Today’s announcement makes his reported price — $100 million — seem a poor return given what a player of his caliber could earn on the PGA Tour in the coming years, and without the reputational harm that comes with taking guaranteed cash to sportswash Saudi atrocities. But on a single word do such decisions turn. In this case, that word is “earn.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columns/gene-frenette/2022/07/01/gene-frenette-pga-liv-sec-big-ten-jockey-supremacy-and-more/7776061001/", "title": "Gene Frenette's Saturday sports menu: PGA-LIV Golf feud, Pac-12 ...", "text": "The ongoing catfight between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf has reached the point where both parties are better off calling a truce. Just stop lobbing grenades in each other’s direction, which only makes them look like junior high kids in a cafeteria food fight.\n\nObvious narratives — players like Phil Mickelson, Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson, Bryson Dechambeau and Patrick Reed defecting to LIV Golf International for more money and a less strenuous schedule, or the Tour shunning its own members for daring to accept lucrative guaranteed money from a Saudi wealth fund — are getting tiresome and do nothing to advance the game.\n\nGolfers are essentially independent contractors in some instances because the Tour has selectively given them permission to play certain events, like next week’s Scottish Open on the DP World Tour, with which the Tour just formed a stronger alliance.\n\nGene's previous three columns:\n\nBut when players joined LIV, a controversial league because it is funded by a country with multiple human rights issues, the fangs came out.\n\nPlayers who defected were treated like pariahs by commissioner Jay Monahan and Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee, who foolishly called for the removal of LIV leader Greg Norman and Mickelson from the World Golf Hall of Fame.\n\nAs disappointing as it was that LIV defectors made their decision, which came with the predictable cold-shoulder treatment, it still does the Tour no good to keep them suspended for an indefinite period, maybe years.\n\nSeriously, how does it grow the game to not have a dozen top 50 players or so at Tour events?\n\nDoes it not penalize the fans when a deserving LIV golfer can’t get points toward their world golf ranking and may possibly be excluded from majors?\n\nHow about a high-performing LIV competitor who merits a captain’s pick and doesn’t get into the Ryder Cup?\n\nMonahan said publicly last week that the Tour can’t win an “arms race” with LIV, whom he considers an “irrational threat,” but he had no problem counter-punching by upping the ante. He announced purses at eight Tour events would increase by $53.8 million, including The Players Championship getting bumped from $20 million to $25 million.\n\nThe train was heading in that direction anyway, but Monahan sped up the process as a way of protecting his turf, making sure no other big-name players are more tempted to leave.\n\nIt was no coincidence that when Monahan was firing his LIV salvos at the Traveler’s Championship, the rival league announced Koepka — who previously denounced players as “sellouts” for leaving the Tour — changed his mind and joined LIV.\n\nSo back-and-forth it goes, with seemingly no end to the acrimony.\n\nHonestly, just as the Tour can counteract LIV in whatever manner it chooses, so are Tour golfers free to make choices for themselves and their families. Playing on a circuit that offers more money and less time away from home is understandably enticing, though it means accepting the criticism accompanying that decision.\n\nThe question is what happens moving forward. If LIV survives only a couple years, will the Tour welcome back the suspended players? Does anybody think golf is better for the fans with the Tour and LIV engaging in a perpetual cold war?\n\nSooner or later, the Tour and LIV will be better off laying down their swords than acting like bullies. That is, if they genuinely care about growing the game and not just their bank accounts.\n\nSurprise! Pac-12 defections about money\n\nThursday’s media reports that big-brand Pac-12 schools USC and UCLA are leaving for the Big Ten in 2024 might have a bombshell feel to it, but this money move was inevitable after Texas and Oklahoma bolted for the SEC last summer.\n\nWith USC football poised to ascend with the hiring of coach Lincoln Riley, and UCLA still carrying major cachet in the basketball world, this was a natural merger for the Big Ten to close the gap on the SEC. For the Los Angeles-based schools, the chance to more than double their annual $30 million windfall as Pac-12 members is a no-brainer.\n\nThose alarm bells you hear are schools in the ACC (especially Florida State, Miami and Clemson), plus the Pac-12 leftovers and the Big 12, wondering if they can compete on the football field in 5-10 years without maneuvering quickly to get on the SEC-Big Ten train, which may eventually have their own playoff. It’d be a shocker if more dominos don’t fall soon as the Power 5 moves closer to becoming the Power 2.\n\nACC should align Miami, Clemson\n\nThere’s no disputing ACC football has taken deserved criticism for lack of depth in recent years, but it made the right move this week by scrapping its divisions and going to a 3-5-5 scheduling model, ensuring all teams play each other at least twice every four years.\n\nMy only revision for each school’s three permanent opponents would be to replace Boston College as one of Miami’s annual foes with Clemson, thus being on a similar schedule path with Florida State, which has Clemson, Miami and Syracuse. I’m pretty sure first-year Hurricanes coach Mario Cristobal would agree Clemson makes a lot more sense for his attendance-challenged program than B.C.\n\nJU athletics securing its assets\n\nWith Jacksonville University locking in men’s basketball coach Jordan Mincy and several others on long-term contracts, the Dolphins stayed on that path this week by signing athletic director Alex Ricker-Gilbert, who was on an expiring deal, through the 2026-27 season.\n\nRicker-Gilbert, 34, might well be courted for a higher-paying job as an associate AD at a big-name school, but he enjoys JU’s more intimate atmosphere and his aligned relationship with president Tim Cost.\n\n“It’s fun to be part of something being built and is building,” said Ricker-Gilbert. “It’s a really good time to be at JU and the president has shown a lot of belief in us. We’re really just scratching the surface of what we can do, like Mincy in his first year.”\n\nGoing west ideal for Durant\n\nWith Kevin Durant demanding a trade from the Brooklyn Nets, who want to accommodate him, the best thing that could happen for the 12-time All-Star and the NBA would be for him to land with the Phoenix Suns.\n\nSeeing Durant having to battle his former team, the NBA champion Golden State Warriors, and ex-teammates Steph Curry and Klay Thompson for superiority in the Western Conference would be must-see TV.\n\nPhoenix is one of Durant's top destinations and the Suns have the personnel to make it worthwhile for Brooklyn to make a deal. With Durant on the Suns, the league would be hard pressed to have a better rivalry next season than Phoenix-Golden State.\n\nMental block for Lexi Thompson\n\nYou have to wonder how much more distress the psyche of 27-year-old Lexi Thompson, who has a history of not being able to close out majors, can take?\n\nOne of America’s best female golfers wasted another great opportunity Sunday when she failed to hold a two-shot lead with three holes left at the Women’s PGA Championship, losing to In Gee Chun by one shot.\n\nThompson was 30 yards away from the hole in two shots at the par-five 16th hole, but sent her approach over the green and bogeyed the hole (Chun birdied to tie).\n\nAt the 17th, Thompson three-putted for bogey from 16 feet, not even coming close on a five-foot par putt.\n\nA birdie putt at No. 18 to get in a playoff never had a chance.\n\nIt was Thompson’s fourth runner-up major result — she won the 2014 Kraft Nabisco Championship and also has four third-place finishes — because the putter always seems to let her down in big moments. It was rather telling of the burden she feels that Thompson, who hasn’t won since 2019, declined to speak to the media.\n\nSEC baseball rise\n\nThis is a hard-to-believe statistic: no SEC baseball program won a national title before Georgia captured the first one under Steve Webber in 1990.\n\nWith Mississippi stunning the college baseball world by beating Oklahoma to win it all as the last at-large team to get into the tournament, that means six different SEC teams (also Mississippi State, Vanderbilt, Florida, LSU, South Carolina) have dogpiled in Omaha to win a combined eight national championships in the last 13 years.\n\nBack on vacation\n\nI’ll be taking my second of three vacations during the Jaguars’ summer break this coming week, so the column will resume on July 13.\n\nGfrenette@jacksonville.com; (904) 359-4540\n\nGene Frenette Sports columnist at Florida Times-Union, follow him on Twitter @genefrenette", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2022/02/23/saudi-arabia-super-golf-league-timeline/49852223/", "title": "Saudi Arabia-backed tour: What we know about Super Golf League", "text": "When Greg Norman signed on with LIV Golf Investments, a new golf entity backed by the Public Investment Fund which operates on behalf of the Saudi Arabian government, as its CEO and commissioner of the Super Golf League in October, it seemed as if the landscape of men's professional golf was changing right before our very eyes.\n\nRumors and speculation have surrounded some of the game's biggest stars for months, but after controversial comments made by Phil Mickelson, as well as prized targets Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau backing the PGA Tour, Rory McIlroy dubbed the league that planned to rival the PGA Tour \"dead in the water\" last week.\n\nFrom $100 million offers to Donald Trump's Bedminster and Doral properties being used to host events as soon as this summer, here's a timeline of the rise (and potential fall) of the Super Golf League.\n\nProfessional golf in Saudi Arabia\n\nThe first professional golf event in Saudi Arabia - the Saudi International - was held in 2019 as a European Tour event, just months after the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Since its debut, the event has been criticized as a targeted attempt by the Saudi government to \"sportswash\" its controversial human rights record and improve its image. In 2022, the Public Investment Fund, chaired by crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, became the event's title sponsor.\n\nA handful of big names have made the trip to play over the years, including Johnson, a two-time champion in 2019, 2021. Major champions like Mickelson, DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka have also been paid to play the event. After the 2020 tournament, the Saudi International moved from the European Tour to the Asian Tour schedule for 2021. Over the last year, LIV Golf Investments has committed to invest $300 million in the Asian Tour.\n\nBecause of this, Golfweek learned back in July that the PGA Tour would refuse to allow players to compete in the controversial tournament in 2022. Tour members must obtain a waiver to compete on other circuits and, because the Saudi event is no longer sanctioned by the European Tour, the PGA Tour noted to managers that permission would no longer be granted.\n\nThe Tour pivoted in December when it granted permission for 30 of its members-including Mickelson, Johnson and DeChambeau-to play the 2022 Saudi International, held earlier this month at Royal Greens Golf and Country Club in King Abdullah Economic City.\n\nWho's involved?\n\nThat's the $100 million question. No names have ever been officially announced, but a handful of players have previous ties to golf in Saudi Arabia.\n\nMickelson's involvement in a rival, Saudi-backed league dates back to the 2020 Saudi International pro-am, where Lefty reportedly played alongside league representatives.\n\nIn July 2020, the Guardian reported that the league had sent formal offer letters worth \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" to a handful of players including Mickelson, Adam Scott, Henrik Stenson, Justin Rose, Rickie Fowler, Paul Casey and Koepka. Almost a year later on May 4, 2021, a report in the Telegraph stated that multi-million dollar offers, some ranging from $30-50 million, were sent to Mickelson, Johnson, Scott, Koepka, DeChambeau, Fowler and Rose. That same month, player managers and agents met with the league's backers on the Tuesday night before the 2021 PGA Championship at Kiawah, won by Mickelson.\n\nEarlier this month DeChambeau denied being offered $135 million to join the Super Golf League.\n\nOPINION:Apologies are a test of character. Phil Mickelson’s revealed his after 'reckless' comments\n\nMORE:Brooks Koepka believes somebody will 'sell out' and join Saudi Arabia-backed Super Golf League\n\nSTAY UP-T0-DATE:Subscribe to our Sports newsletter now!\n\nPlayer and Tour reactions\n\nRory McIlroy was the first big name to denounce rival leagues with his, \"For me, I'm out,\" quote in February 2020. A month later he would be echoed by Jon Rahm and Koepka. At that time, the players were all ranked inside the top-three in the world.\n\nIn May of 2021 after the news of the $30-50 million offers, McIlroy doubled down, saying, \"I don't see why anyone would be for (the new league).\" The PGA Tour - which created a \"strategic alliance\" with the European Tour to combat any rival leagues - has been steadfast in its stance. In a meeting with players that same month, commissioner Jay Monahan drew a line in the sand with multiple sources telling Golfweek's Eamon Lynch that leaving the Tour for the new league would result in an immediate suspension from the PGA Tour and likely a lifetime ban.\n\nOn top of that, PGA of America CEO Seth Waugh said PGA Tour defectors would be barred from competing in the biennial Ryder Cup against Europe.\n\n\"If someone wants to play on a Ryder Cup for the U.S., they're going to need to be a member of the PGA of America, and they get that membership through being a member of the Tour,\" Waugh said last May. \"I believe the Europeans feel the same way, and so I don't know that we can be more clear kind of than that. We don't see that changing.\"\n\nIn a direct response to rival golf leagues, the PGA Tour also created the Player Impact Program, a $40 million bonus pool designed to compensate players who drive fan and sponsor engagement. In 2022 the pool increased to $50 million. The Comcast Business Tour Top 10-which bonuses top-performing players at the end of the regular season and before the FedEx Cup playoffs-will double its riches to $20 million. The Tour has also created a new bonus scheme from which most members stand to gain. The Play15 program will give $50,000 to every player who makes at least 15 starts.\n\nRecently Tiger Woods, Collin Morikawa, Justin Thomas, Rahm, McIlroy and more all publicly backed the Tour, with Johnson and DeChambeau following suit after Mickelson's controversial comments in which he said the Saudis are \"scary motherf--s to get involved with.\"\n\nWhy Greg Norman?\n\nThis isn't the Shark's first time wading into the waters of a rival golf league.\n\nNorman, the two-time major champion and World Golf Hall of Famer who won 20 times on the PGA Tour and 14 times on the European Tour, attempted to get the World Golf Tour off the ground in 1994, but was unsuccessful. The two-time British Open champion's play was rejected by then-Tour commissioner Tim Finchem, who announced the World Golf Championships three years later in 1997.\n\nGolfweek reported in November how the PGA Tour planned to create a series of lucrative, international tournaments that will offer guaranteed money to the world's best players.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nMcIlroy asked the question we're all thinking: \"Who's left? Who's left to go?\"\n\nWith the game's biggest stars all backing the Tour, the SGL has little-to-no momentum on its side and will now have sway mid-tier to aging Tour players, or recruit from the Korn Ferry, Asian and DP World tours.\n\nInitially hoping for a spring of 2022 debut, No Laying Up reported in October that the 12-event league was looking into a few Donald Trump courses including Doral and Bedminster. A report in the Washington Post last week said that \"at least two of Trump's courses in Bedminster, N.J., and Doral, Fla., could be named as sites for the nascent tour, according to the people familiar with the talks, who like others requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Officials from LIV Golf Investments, the apparatus funded by the Saudis to host the tour, have held conversations with the Trump Organization, these people said.\"\n\nWhile McIlroy claimed the league to be \"dead in the water,\" that might be a bit premature.\n\nNorman went on the offensive on Tuesday, saying in a memo that the PGA Tour engages in \"egregious acts of bullying\" and that the Tour can't legally ban players for playing in the Super Golf League.\n\nLIV Golf has employed an array of industry executives, as well as a longtime PGA Tour rules official, to help get the league off the ground. With seemingly infinite funds at their disposal - even Koepka thinks someone will \"sell out\" - there may still be more to come.\n\nFollow Golfweek's Adam Woodard on Twitter @AdamWoodard.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2022/06/10/ian-poulter-says-hell-appeal-pga-tour-suspension/7581257001/", "title": "Ian Poulter says he'll appeal PGA Tour suspension", "text": "Adam Schupak\n\nGolfweek\n\nIan Poulter won't surrender his PGA Tour membership without a fight.\n\nWhile several of the notable LIV Golf players suspended by the PGA Tour already had informed the Tour that they were giving up their membership - including Kevin Na, Dustin Johnson and Sergio Garcia - Poulter said on Thursday that he elected not to resign his membership.\n\nWhen informed that PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan had lived up to his word and suspended 17 players who had \"willfully violated its regulations\" by playing in this week's LIV Golf Invitational Series debut near London, Poulter told the media, \"I will appeal, for sure.

It has backed and is financing LIV Golf Investments, the parent company of LIV Golf.\n\nMORE: Justin Thomas, Rory McIlroy support PGA Tour suspensions of LIV Golf players\n\nWhile Poulter could be headed down the road of future litigation with the PGA Tour, Graeme McDowell explained that he resigned his membership \"out of an abundance of caution\" and to \"keep the moral high ground.\"\n\n\"I actually resigned about 30 minutes before I teed it up today,\" McDowell said. \"It was a tough decision. I wanted to keep the moral high ground and kind of remain a member of the Tour because I really didn't feel like I needed to resign nor that I should have to resign. It was a very difficult decision. I kind of resigned out of an abundance of caution honestly because I feel like it puts me in a less litigious situation regards getting drawn into anything unnecessarily. But like I say, I didn't want to resign. I love the PGA Tour. It's been great to me. This is not about the PGA Tour is a bad tour. This is about being able to add on additional opportunities to my golf career. Really hard.\n\nOPINION:Teeing off on golfers taking Saudis' cash ignores realities of complicated world\n\nOPINION: McDowell's reputation latest victim of Saudi rent-a-stooge scheme\n\n\"Unfortunately this is going to be short-term pain, but I think all the players that are here this week have only been strengthened in their confidence that we are making the right decisions here because we feel like the execution level that we're seeing here, the passion, the love of the game of golf that these guys have at LIV, that's why we're here. I feel like confidence has been strengthened. Even in the face of consequences which we knew were kind of on the horizon.\"\n\nWhen told of the ban from playing the Tour, including sponsor invites, Sergio Garcia claimed it didn't apply to him because he was no longer a member.\n\n\"That's one of the reasons why I resigned because I didn't want to get into my legal battles,\" Garcia said. \"I'm very happy to be here for many reasons. It's going to allow me to do what I love, which is playing golf. It's going to allow me to see my family more, spend more time with my kids, 4 and 2, spend as much time as I can, and I make a good living doing it. For me it's a win/win. I'm excited for what's coming. Excited to finally be here playing and see the reaction of the people and the players and everything. So it's very exciting.\"\n\nGarica confirmed that he has no intention, however, of giving up his membership to the DP World Tour.\n\n\"Why haven't I? Because I would like to still be a member,\" he said.\n\nAsked if he still hopes to participate in future Ryder Cups, he said, \"Definitely. First of all, I'm European, I love the European Tour. I played it for 23 years. Even though I played on the PGA TOUR, I always made sure that I kept my membership in Europe because I love The European Tour, and that's one of the reasons why I wanted to stay a member of the European Tour.\n\nMORE:Rocket Mortgage ends sponsorship deal with Bryson DeChambeau over LIV Golf\n\nAnd obviously we're going to have to wait and see what the European Tour does. But I definitely would like to keep my membership there, play at least my minimum, and you know, get my - as good a chance as I can to make The Ryder Cup Team because I love that event. But I guess we'll see. We'll wait and see what happens over there.\"\n\nMcDowell shared Garcia's hope that Keith Pelley, who heads the DP World Tour, wouldn't simply follow in lockstep with the PGA Tour and ban the participants in LIV Golf from competing on their home circuit. The second LIV event happens to conflict with the DP Tour's Irish Open.\n\n\"Will Keith follow suit? I hope he doesn't,\" McDowell said. \"I think he has a fantastic opportunity here with a lot of European players and European Tour players that would like to subsidize their schedule with other events, especially if we are not allowed to play on the PGA Tour. I really hope The European Tour makes a good decision. They may have to follow suit with what Jay and the PGA Tour are doing, so watch this space.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/10"}]}

The United Kingdom had the next highest rate, at 146 per 100,000.\n\nThe US also had the highest maternal mortality rate: 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, more than triple the rate of any other country studied. When looking only at Black maternal mortality, the rate jumped to 55.3 deaths per 100,000 live births.\n\nBy comparison, in Norway in 2019, the last year for which data was available, there were zero maternal deaths.\n\n“A high rate of cesarean sections, inadequate prenatal care, and elevated rates of chronic illnesses like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease may be factors contributing to the high U.S. maternal mortality rate. Many maternal deaths result from missed or delayed opportunities for treatment,” the researchers wrote.\n\nResearchers with the Commonwealth Fund pulled data from the fund’s 2020 International Health Policy Survey and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Statistics on health care were compared among Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US.\n\nAmong US women ages 18 to 49, just over a quarter rated their country’s health care system as good or very good. In every other country, a majority of women in this age group gave their health care system a positive rating.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nUS women were “significantly” more likely to report skipping or delaying medical care or to have trouble paying for care. Nearly half of women ages 18 to 49 reported having some cost-related issue in accessing health care, and more than half reported at least one problem with a medical bill.\n\nIn France, the country with the next highest rate, only 38% of women had a problem with a bill, including difficulty paying, spending time on paperwork or disputing a bill or having difficulties with insurance.\n\nThe data also showed high rates of chronic conditions and mental health needs in American women compared with those in peer nations.\n\nThe researchers recommend expanding access to affordable health care and increasing and diversifying the number of physicians in the US as possible ways to address disparities in women’s health care.", "authors": ["Virginia Langmaid"], "publish_date": "2022/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/14/making-weight/25741977/", "title": "Health is more than absence of illness", "text": "Daniel P. Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled read", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/03/12/covid-scams-big-easy-buzz-nurses-protest-news-around-states/115550822/", "title": "COVID-19 scams, Big Easy buzz, nurses protest: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Its 2021 Mardi Gras celebration all but a bust because of the coronavirus pandemic, the city is considering staging a Carnival-style parade in May after the state’s mandatory mask rule expires. Mayor Sandy Stimpson discussed the possible parade with City Council members during a meeting Tuesday, news outlets reported. The event would be held May 21 to coincide with the commissioning of the USS Mobile, a Navy ship built in the city. Gov. Kay Ivey has said she would let the statewide mask order expire on April 9 because cases of COVID-19 have fallen dramatically and the pace of vaccinations is increasing, although health officials said everyone – particularly people who haven’t been fully vaccinated – should continue wearing masks. Ivey’s office announced Wednesday that Alabama’s Capitol and Governor’s Mansion were reopening immediately in Montgomery for tours, but masks still would be required.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state Senate voted Wednesday to allow leadership to restrict access to the Capitol by Republican Sen. Lora Reinbold, who fellow lawmakers said has refused to follow measures meant to guard against COVID-19. The 18-1 vote, allowing leadership to enforce COVID-19 mitigation policies on members “until they are fully compliant” came 51 days into a legislative session throughout which Reinbold has worn a clear face shield that legislative leaders said runs afoul of masking rules. This week marked the first apparent public signs of pushback against the face shield by leadership. Senate Rules Chair Gary Stevens, a Kodiak Republican, said Reinbold also is not following testing protocols or submitting to temperature checks and questions that are standard for admittance to the building. “Inordinate” amounts of time have been spent “trying to reason” with her or provide masks that meet U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, he said. Reinbold of Eagle River did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. On social media, she said she is under “intense pressure by Senate leadership to follow controversial and arbitrarily applied” rules, and said she does not like “anyone to be forced to disclose health issues or test results,” citing privacy concerns. She said she took a coroanvirus test this weekend “under pressure” and conveyed, “begrudgingly,” the negative result to leadership. Her actions “are to protect my constitutional rights, including civil liberties and those who I represent, even under immense pressure and public scrutiny,” she said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Dr. Joshua LaBaer, director of the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, said laboratory data showed a recent rise in the rate of positive tests that have a coronavirus variant first identified in Britain. It peaked on March 8, with 20 out of every 100 positive tests showing a genetic pattern for that variant.Public health experts said the variant first found in the United Kingdom is more contagious and might carry a higher risk of death. LaBaer said the variant is not predominant in Arizona but it’s a minority strain that’s growing. “It’s a little bit of a race between getting vaccines in arms and seeing that variant emerge,” LaBaer told reporters. He said the latest figures indicated only about 10% of Arizona’s population has been fully vaccinated. But with vaccine supply ramping up, LaBaer said he thinks it’s possible that by mid-July the state could reach “herd immunity,” when enough people are protected through infection or vaccination to make it difficult for the virus to keep spreading.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization fell to its lowest number Wednesday since the summer as the state reported 317 new cases. The Department of Health said COVID-19 hospitalizations in the state dropped by 16 to 301. It’s the lowest number of such hospitalizations the state has reported since 285 on July 3. The state’s total COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began rose to 325,700. The state’s active cases, which don’t include people who have died or recovered, dropped by 234 to 3,227. Arkansas’ COVID-19 deaths rose by 25 to 5,382, but Gov. Asa Hutchinson said 16 of the deaths occurred in January and were reported late. The department said nearly 772,000 of the roughly 1.3 million coronavirus vaccine doses allocated to the state had been given so far.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Two U.S. Postal Service window clerks were arrested Wednesday on charges that they misused their positions to secure about $200,000 in pandemic unemployment benefits in a scam using debit cards obtained from the state with stolen identities. Christian Jeremyah James of Los Angeles and Armand Caleb Legardy of Inglewood are accused of using 10 debit cards issued in other people’s names by the California Employment Development Department. The Bank of America cards were obtained from the state by unnamed people who filed phony claims of joblessness stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, authorities said. The arrests of James, 31, and Legardy, 32, are the latest sign of California’s failure to screen out fraudulent claims as it has paid out more than $120 billion in unemployment assistance in the year since the pandemic devastated the state’s economy. The state estimates that it paid at least $11.4 billion in fraudulent benefits, including hundreds of millions in claims improperly filed in the names of prison inmates. James, a clerk at Culver City’s main post office, and Legardy, who worked at the La Tijera post office in Los Angeles, used their positions to buy and cash postal money orders with the fraudulently obtained debit cards, according to Ana Ptaszek, an agent with the Postal Service’s inspector general’s office. James’ attorney, Neha Christerna, declined to comment. Legardy’s attorney, Charles Brown, could not be reached.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver : Gov. Jared Polis and state lawmakers said Wednesday they plan to spend $700 million on job-creating transportation projects, sustaining a multibillion-dollar agriculture industry and delivering crucial aid to small businesses battered by the coronavirus pandemic. Polis and top Democratic and Republican lawmakers outlined their spending vision at a news conference. The $700 million comes from unexpected state revenue that surpassed expectations after lawmakers cut more than $3.5 billion from the state budget last year. The one-time spending over the next 18 months is intended to sustain small businesses, a farming economy battered by uncertain markets, the pandemic and sustained drought, worker training for those losing jobs in fossil fuel industries and in long-delayed infrastructure projects, Polis said. It follows $300 million in emergency spending the legislature authorized during a special session last year. It doesn’t take into account – for now – billions of dollars worth in federal funds that are forthcoming to Colorado under a $1.9 trillion relief package passed by Congress on Wednesday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: More than 100 workers at long-term care facilities blocked traffic in Hartford on Wednesday to demand better wages and benefits, as well as a solution to the staff shortages that are affecting an industry hit hard by the pandemic. According to the health care union District 1199 New England, SEIU, 18 unionized long-term care workers have died from COVID-19 and more have lost loved ones to the disease or have suffered permanent damage. Meanwhile, workers continue to risk death or serious illness on a daily basis, the union said. “Returning to normal is simply not an option,” said the union, which is demanding the state set aside more funding in the new two-year state budget to ultimately provide the workers with higher wages they can live on, access to affordable health insurance, retirement options and paid time off. “Long-term workers have gone beyond the extra mile to continue providing services during COVID-19 at great risk to themselves and their families,” the union added. The workers blocked traffic outside the Department of Social Services offices.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state Delaware is expanding COVID-19 vaccinations to more essential workers. The Delaware State News reported Tuesday that the Division of Public Health will add in the coming weeks front-line workers in food manufacturing, agriculture and grocery stores. The state will also add front-line workers in public transit, postal service, higher education and pharmaceutical manufacturing. DPH Director Dr. Karyl Rattay said the state is focusing on workers in those industries who are unable to socially distance from fellow workers or members of the public. Workers in the Phase 1B distribution group who are already eligible for the vaccine include first responders, correctional officers, teachers, education staff, child care providers and poultry workers. Delaware has reported that an estimated 104,000 residents are fully . That’s about one-tenth of the state’s population. Roughly 170,000 other people have received their first of the two-dose vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna. And about 5,000 Delawareans have received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Dr. Rattay said DPH will continue to work its way through a vaccination waiting list. “We know that you’re there, we know that you’re getting tired of waiting on the wait list and we know we have individuals who are in their seventies still on the wait-list,” Dr. Rattay said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:After weeks of neighbors advocating, D.C. is adding a Ward 6 zip code to the vaccine priority list this week, according to council member Charles Allen, WUSA-TV reported. For the past month, D.C. has been releasing some of its weekly round of vaccine appointments based on priority zip codes -- which have focused on wards 5, 7 and 8. Ward 6 falls in the middle of the pack when it comes to the number of COVID-19 cases it has reported. The zip code now added to the list, 20003, encompasses the southeastern portion of Capitol Hill, Hill East and Navy Yard. D.C. Health data reported 5,454 coronavirus cases in Ward 6. Capitol Hill residents accounted for 492 of those cases, and Hill East had 513. However, D.C. data showed a disparity in each of those neighborhood's vaccinations. According to data last updated on Saturday, 697 adults 65 or older who live in Capitol Hill have been fully vaccinated. That's more than three times as many older adults in Hill East, which has 196 residents fully vaccinated.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A couple claiming to be farmers working the land on two tiny suburban lots as they raked in federal COVID-19 relief funds pleaded guilty Monday to a fraud scheme. Latoya Stanley and Johnny Philus hauled in more than $1 million in Small Business Administration loans while lying that they were struggling to operate not only a couple of nonexistent suburban farms but also a beauty supply store and an auto leasing business, according to authorities. Their SBA loan applications were a fiction, the North Miami couple admitted in federal court. Each faces up to five years in prison when they are sentenced June 2 in front of U.S. District Judge Marcia Cooke. Stanley, 38, and Philus, 33, were arrested in August and charged with committing wire fraud and making false statements when they applied for SBA loans under a federal program that provides financial assistance to businesses ailing from the impact of pandemic.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgia will expand COVID-19 vaccine criteria starting Monday to everyone 55 and older, plus younger adults who are overweight or have serious health conditions, making more than two-thirds of Georgians who are 16 and older eligible for vaccination. Gov. Brian Kemp made the announcement Wednesday as Georgia continued to post worst-in-the nation vaccination rates, raising questions about the effectiveness of the state’s efforts to put shots in arms. “We will continue to encourage all eligible Georgians not to wait to get their dose,” the Republican governor said. “This vaccine, as we have said many times, is safe, is effective, and it’s our ticket back to normal.” Only 17.5% of Georgia’s population has been given at least one dose of the vaccine, the worst in the nation, according the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The same data showed Georgia has administered the lowest share of doses delivered among states, with more than one-third of doses still awaiting injection. Georgia disputes that second number, saying it has given 74% of doses shipped.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Senate on Tuesday passed legislation that would increase the income tax paid by Hawaii’s top wage earners to 16%, which would give the islands the highest state income tax rate in the nation. The Senate voted 24-1 in favor of the bill, which cited a need to maintain essential government services at a time when the pandemic and subsequent drop in tourism led state tax revenue to shrink. There was no discussion or debate on the Senate floor regarding the measure. The legislation also hikes the capital gains tax, corporate tax and taxes on luxury real estate sales. The bill will now go to the House for consideration. House lawmakers have passed their own legislation raising the capital gains tax. California is currently the state with the highest income tax rate in the nation, at 13.3% for individuals earning more than $1 million a year. Hawaii’s 16% rate would apply to those earning more than $200,000 a year. The rate would revert to the existing rate of 11% after 2027. Lawmakers said they want to avoid budget cuts recommended by Gov. David Ige to cope with the shortfall, including those that would subtract funds from public schools, sex abuse treatment, plant and pest disease control and family planning services.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: At least a hundred people gathered at the front of the state Capitol on Saturday to burn masks in a protest against measures taken to limit infections and deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Some groups said mask mandates are a restriction of their freedoms. Health experts said they help slow the spread of the disease. Videos posted on social media showed adults encouraging children to toss masks into a fire. Gov. Brad Little has never issued a statewide mask mandate, but seven counties and 11 cities have such mandates in place. Visitors to the Capitol are asked to wear masks, but they're not required and few Republican lawmakers wear them. A Republican lawmaker on Wednesday introduced legislation to prohibit mask mandates. More than 170,000 Idaho residents have been infected with the virus, and nearly 1,900 have died.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot warned the city’s aldermen on Wednesday not to produce wish lists now that Congress has passed a COVID-19 relief package that will send nearly $2 billion to the city. The $1.9 trillion package passed Wednesday by the U.S. House and headed for President Joe Biden’s desk is expected to deliver about $7.5 billion to state government and about $6 billion for local government. Lightfoot said the money headed to Chicago will have strings attached to how it can be spent. “So I want to disabuse people out there and my colleagues in the City Council,” Lightfoot said. “This is not $1.9 trillion of a slush fund that we can use every way that we can.” Lightfoot said she expects the city will get money to help with the cost of vaccinating residents and to address affordable housing and homelessness. She said although the city is likely to also get relief funds next year, it won’t be able to use it to reduce taxes or bankroll city employee pensions.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Teachers and other school employees will be able to get COVID-19 vaccinations through Indiana’s shot clinics across the state starting next week. State health officials said Wednesday that the eligibility expansion comes at the direction of the Biden administration, which earlier allowed teachers to be vaccinated at pharmacies taking part in a federal program. Indiana is allowing anyone aged 50 and older and those with at-risk health conditions to make vaccine appointments. The expansion for teachers starts Monday and includes other school workers such as classroom aides, bus drivers, cafeteria workers and substitute teachers. Gov. Eric Holcomb and top state health officials had repeatedly said they believed that targeting vaccinations to older age groups and health care workers, rather than school employees, was more effective at preventing serious illnesses and deaths.\n\nIowa\n\nJohnston: As Iowa ramps up vaccinations to include everyone between age 16 to 64 with underlying health conditions, state officials acknowledged Wednesday they would rely on an honor system with no validation required when someone claims to qualify for a shot because of a health issue. The state is allowing adults to get vaccinated if they have any one of several conditions the U.S. Centers For Disease Control and Prevention considers higher risk for severe illness if they get infected. The list includes cancer, heart conditions, lung disease, pregnancy, Type 2 diabetes and obesity. Smokers also qualify. Iowa Department of Public Health Director Kelly Garcia acknowledged Wednesday the system is relying largely on Iowans being honest about their health conditions when scheduling a vaccine. Gov. Kim Reynolds was asked Wednesday why the state doesn’t allow all adults to get vaccinated since the current system has no way to confirm whether someone has a qualifying health issue, making it possible for anyone willing to be untruthful to get a shot. “I think we have a good process in place. As we see those numbers continue to increase and we continue to open up and vaccinate more and more Iowans we’ll take that next step,” she said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Senate Health Committee Chair Richard Hilderbrand, R-Galena, outlined a measure Wednesday that would overturn Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s policy of withholding doses of COVID-19 vaccines from counties wanting to move to a new phase of inoculations before the rest of the state. Hilderbrand called the policy “blackmail or extortion.” The state Department of Health and Environment called withholding vaccine doses an “enforcement mechanism” and Kelly said the goal is to “keep the train running as smoothly as we possibly can.” Hilderbrand’s bill would allow counties to set their own vaccination schedules. It follows several months of widespread criticism of Kelly from the GOP-controlled Legislature over what they viewed as a slow administration of shots. “Counties that are doing it right and doing it the right way should be able to have some leeway,” Hilderbrand told the Associated Press.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky’s government is forecast to receive about $2.4 billion from the latest round of federal pandemic relief, state Budget Director John Hicks told lawmakers Tuesday. The state’s share gives lawmakers more funding opportunities but little time to decide how to incorporate any of it into the state budget for the coming year starting July 1. Top lawmakers are putting together a final spending plan to be presented to the legislature in coming days. A separate infusion of about $1.6 billion from the federal aid package is expected to go to local governments in Kentucky, and Kentuckians are expected to receive about $5 billion in direct payments under the relief measure, legislative budget negotiators were told. The massive package could be approved by congressional Democrats by midweek over Republican opposition.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Live indoor music can resume in New Orleans beginning this weekend, city officials said Wednesday, but dancing will remain prohibited, and venues, performers and audiences will be under strict requirements to employ measures to control the spread of the coronavirus. The new rules take effect Friday morning, in response to a decline of new coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in the city. It was not immediately known how many bars and other live music venues will be able to meet them and begin holding live entertainment again in a city where music is ingrained in cultural history and vital to tourism. Brian Greenberg, general manager of Tipitina’s, said he thinks the historic music club and bar might be able to pull it off, although not right away. “We have a floor plan that we’ve already mapped out,” he said. “We’re a big room, so we have that advantage.” Dancing is ruled out under the regulations, which also noted that patrons must “refrain from cheering or singing along.” Limits are still in effect. St. Patrick’s Day parades, and block parties remain forbidden in the city even as officials ease limitations on crowds. Starting Friday, indoor gatherings will be limited to 75 people and outdoor gatherings to 150. Most businesses in the city will be open at 75% capacity, and bars and gyms will operate at 50%.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: More than two dozen COID-19 vaccination clinics are set to open in Maine in the coming days. The Department of Health and Human Services said the state is working with more than 25 health care organizations to offer the dedicated clinics. The department said the clinics will be held on Friday and over the weekend, and a few will happen the following week. The dedicated clinics are for school staff and teachers who are age 60 and older. The health department said every school district will notify eligible teachers and staff members about where they can sign up for the clinics. Maine has extended eligibility for coronavirus vaccines to teachers, school staff members and people who are age 60 or older. The health department said teachers and school staffers of younger ages can get the vaccine at Hannaford, Walgreens and Walmart pharmacies dependent on availability.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: The city's annual St. Patrick's Day festivities and parade were canceled in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the nation and into Maryland. For businesses, the holiday would go on to mark the beginning of a year of hardship. Despite the parade being canceled again this year, tourism and hospitality business owners in town are cautiously hoping for a stronger tourism season. St. Patrick's Day is typically a weeklong celebration at Duffy's Tavern, but when the parade was canceled last year, sales slowed dramatically, said owner Matt Bayline, who added he is cautiously optimistic about the spring and summer. Mask-wearing and restrictions might still be in place, but \"we're getting closer to normal,\" he said. On Tuesday Gov. Larry Hogan lifted capacity restrictions on all restaurants, taverns gyms, houses of worships and other facilities. Masks and social distancing will still be required, but Hogan called the move a \"prudent, positive step in the right direction and an important part of our economic recovery.\"\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester:St. Vincent Hospital management touted nurses who crossed a picket line, while the union representing striking nurses at the hospital countered by saying that community support was on their side, as the nurses’ strike at the hospital entered its second day. “We want to thank all our caregivers, including the nurses who made the decision to put patients first by crossing the (Massachusetts Nurses Association union) picket line to take care of our community,” St. Vincent CEO Carolyn Jackson said in a statement Tuesday morning. MNA spokesperson David Schildmeier acknowledged that some nurses crossed the picket line, but pushed back against any suggestion that the strike was weak. “We are still evaluating how many crossed; we expected some nurses to cross,” Schildmeier said in an email Tuesday. “From what we have seen it is minimal, and even their claim makes it clear that the 89% strike vote is holding.” Meanwhile, a second union representing patient care attendants, housekeeping staff and others at the hospital announced that it planned to hold an informational picket on Saturday. Tenet Healthcare and St. Vincent Hospital nurses had been unable to come to an agreement during months of contract negotiations, prompting nurses to go on strike at 6 a.m. Monday. There are approximately 800 nurses at the hospital.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The coronavirus pandemic made 2020 Michigan’s deadliest year, driving a 17.9% increase in deaths over 2019, according to preliminary data. It was the largest annual percentage jump on record, surpassing a 15.6% increase in 1918, when the Spanish flu pandemic struck. More than 115,300 people died in Michigan last year, up from about 97,800 the year before, according to an Associated Press analysis of provisional data kept by the state’s vital records division. COVID-19 has been linked to nearly 16,700 deaths since February 2020. The toll was highest in April and then December.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: A veteran Iditarod musher from Duluth was removed from the race Wednesday after he tested positive for the coronavirus, organizers said. Gunnar Johnson, 52, was withdrawn from the event at the McGrath, Alaska, checkpoint, the organizers said in a news release. Iditarod Race Marshal Mark Nordman, working with epidemiologist Dr. Jodie Guest, made the decision to remove Johnson, who is asymptomatic, based on the rules set in the race’s COVID-19 mitigation plan. Johnson is incredibly disappointed and felt his dog team looked great, the organizers said. Johnson had 14 dogs racing with him. After the positive test, Johnson was removed from the checkpoint area and taken off the trail, the organizers said. Johnson, a former city attorney of Duluth who was participating in his third Iditarod, did not come into close contact with race personnel or community members, and he did not enter any buildings or community spaces in McGrath, the organizers said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:The State Department of Health reported 437 new cases of COVID-19 and 11 coronavirus-related deaths on Wednesday. Since the virus hit the state in March 2020, a total of 298,445 cases and 6,845 coronavirus-related deaths have been reported. There were 50 outbreaks at Mississippi nursing homes as of Wednesday. There have been 10,406 cases of the coronavirus in long-term care facilities and 1,963 deaths reported as of Wednesday. Residents between the ages of 25 and 39 represent the largest portion of the infected population in the state, with 65,745 cases reported Tuesday. Among patients under 18, children between the ages of 11 and 17 have the highest infection rate, with 22,922 cases identified. The 65-and-older age group has the highest total number of deaths with 5,251 reported.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: Weeks after the faster-spreading British variant of the coronavirus was found in 15 Missouri wastewater systems, new testing has found it only in one. The Department of Health and Senior Services has been testing wastewater across the state for clues about the spread of COVID-19. The latest results, released Tuesday, found that testing could be done only at 10 wastewater systems in Missouri because of declining levels of COVID-19 particles. Of the 10 tested, only the Coldwater Creek system in St. Louis County indicated the presence of the U.K. variant, the health department said. In February 15 of 23 systems tested across Missouri showed evidence of the U.K. variant, which was first detected in the U.S. in December.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The state reported 46 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, bringing Montana’s total to 100,959. There are 63 people who are hospitalized, according to the state website covid19.mt.gov. A total of 1,381 deaths related to the respiratory illness have been reported in the state, according to the report. Flathead County topped the state and accounted for nearly 28% of all new cases with 13, bringing the county to 164 active reports out of 11,169 total. The county has the second-most active cases in the state. Missoula County reported nine new cases and now has 106 active reports. To date, a total 308,745 doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered and 115,390 residents are now fully vaccinated.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: More than 250,000 people have signed up for a COVID-19 vaccination on Nebraska’s official registration website, but state officials said Wednesday they want more and urged residents to add their names. State officials asked residents to sign up online or through a toll-free hotline as local health districts prepare to move into their next vaccination phase in the next few weeks. The state is working to vaccinate residents who are at least 65 years and older, but the next phase will focus on people ages 50 to 64 and those with certain underlying health conditions. Lori Snyder, chief information officer for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, said registering on the state’s website, vaccinate.ne.gov, will allow residents to get their shot faster than if they signed up on a local public health department’s website. Residents without internet access can register by calling (833) 998-2275. Nebraska has fully vaccinated 12.6% of its 1.48 million residents who are at least 16 years old, according to the state’s online tracking portal.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Coronavirus management officials said some vaccination appointment slots are going unused in Las Vegas, and that more doses are available than are being administered at the area’s two largest mass vaccination sites. However, state COVID-19 response chief Caleb Cage did not promise immediate changes or say during a conference call with reporters that the recipient pool would soon expand statewide to people 55 and older. People 65 and older became eligible for vaccinations last month, and a group of front-line workers became eligible last week. Cage said the statewide coronavirus playbook is being shaped with local health districts, elected leaders and emergency managers according to the varied economies and workforces in the north, south and rural areas. Public vaccine sites at the Ashman Center conference hall near downtown Las Vegas and at the Las Vegas Convention Center near the Strip can each deliver up to 4,000 doses per day. But Dr. Fermin Leguen, Southern Nevada Health District chief health officer, told the Review-Journal that neither site regularly sees 3,000 appointments a day. Doses are not being discarded unused, Leguen said but volunteers, employees and Nevada National Guard members sometimes sit idle. In Reno, chief health officer Kevin Dick told reporters that vaccination efforts are keeping up with an increase in shipments of vaccines to Washoe County.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: There have been no reported COVID-19 cases from two in-person House sessions held last month, Speaker Sherman Packard said. “Careful and cautious management has led to good results, and that’s exactly what we have done with the legislature,” Packard said in a statement Thursday. “We can lead in a responsible way, and we are getting our business done in a responsible way.” Seven Democratic lawmakers sued Packard, a Republican, last month, arguing that holding in-person sessions without a remote option violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and the state and federal constitutions, and forced them to either risk their lives or abandon their duties as elected officials. They sought a preliminary order requiring remote access, but a federal judge denied their request. The Democrats have filed a notice of appeal to the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the 400-member House has met several times at the University of New Hampshire ice arena, outside on a UNH athletic field, and – after former Speaker Dick Hinch died of COVID-19 – from their cars in a parking lot. They met last month in a Bedford sports complex.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Restaurants, gyms, salons and other indoor recreational activities can boost their capacity to 50%, up from 35% starting March 19, Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday. The state’s coronavirus figures have been tracking in the right direction, Murphy said, although hospitalizations ticked up slightly this week. Murphy also said that outdoor gatherings would climb to a 50-person capacity, up from 25. That also takes effect March 19. The 25-person limit didn’t apply to weddings, church services or political events, among a few others. New Jersey has fully vaccinated about 899,000 people or just over 10% of the population. That’s just slightly higher than the 9.9% national rate.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: New Mexico is expected to receive an estimated $9 billion from the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package recently passed by Congress, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and fellow state Democrat leaders said. Beyond the vaccine rollout and grants for small businesses, they said the funding will go toward everything from direct payments for individuals to investments in broadband and clean water projects, debt relief for Hispanic and Native American farmers and an expansion of the child tax credit. Tribal communities and public schools will see more than $1 billion each, and state and local governments will share about $2 billion. The Democrats billed the aid package as an answer to poverty, saying it will address inequities that were brought to light during the pandemic by creating universal benefits and lifelong assistance. Lujan Grisham said about one-quarter of New Mexico families would immediately be “lifted out of poverty” because of the economic assistance and tax credits included in the legislation.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Travelers to New York from other U.S. states will no longer be required to quarantine starting April 1, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, adding the two-week quarantine for domestic travelers will be recommended but no longer mandated. International travelers will still be required to quarantine, he said. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said city officials were not consulted about the move to end the quarantine requirement, and he questioned its wisdom. “I believe in local control, and here’s another case where New York City was not consulted even though we’re one of the biggest cities in the world and 43% of the state’s population,” de Blasio said at a virtual coronavirus briefing. He added, “Of course I have concerns about this.” Dr. Jay Varma, senior health adviser to the mayor, said the city is still “at a very tenuous point” despite rising vaccination levels because highly transmissible variants of the coronavirus now account for more than half of new infections.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Duke University said it is considering ending in-person classes as an uptick in COVID-19 cases over the course of five days worsens and students continue to violate health guidelines. Of the 102 undergraduate students who tested positive for the coronavirus from March 5-9, Duke said most “either have a known Greek affiliation and/or are first-year male students in the Class of 2024.” Duke linked the cases to rush activities and off-campus parties hosted by fraternities, including Greek organizations that recently severed their affiliations with the university. Campus officials warned in a message to students that those who hold parties and flagrantly violate safety protocols could be suspended or expelled as a result of their actions. Duke has been widely praised for its reopening procedures since the start of the pandemic and having fewer cases this semester than some of its nearby peers, including North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials want to use another round of federal stimulus money to continue testing wastewater for coronavirus variants. The wastewater testing began in July 2020 and would end in June if funding isn’t continued. Twenty-one communities are participating in the testing statewide. Wastewater from those cities is analyzed at a North Dakota State University lab where researchers look for the virus contained in the fecal matter of people who are infected. David Bruschwein, director of the Division of Municipal Facilities for the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality, said wastewater analysis is helpful in pinpointing communities that might need more regular virus testing, given that far fewer people are opting for tests now than at the height of the pandemic, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The state House last month approved and sent to the Senate a bill to require a public hearing and a vote before local officials decide to participate in such testing. The House killed a bill to ban wastewater testing.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican lawmakers’ latest in a yearlong attempt to rein in Gov. Mike DeWine’s authority to issue public health orders during the pandemic passed Wednesday in the House and faces a likely veto by the governor. A bill that would allow lawmakers to rescind public health orders issued by the governor or the Ohio Department of Health was fast-tracked out of committee one year to the day from when the pandemic began in Ohio and moved onto the House floor where it passed on party lines. “This body has given the administrative branch of government a lot of power, and it’s time to review that power and it’s time to review it now,” Republican Rep. Scott Wiggam, a supporter of the bill, said before its passing. Wiggam and the majority of his GOP colleagues have reiterated how the actions that were taken by DeWine and the health department over the past year have been overreaching and detrimental to the freedom of Ohioans. In recent committee hearings, GOP lawmakers made several changes to the Senate bill that would close loopholes for future governors and local boards of health to issue emergency orders. Last year, DeWine, a Republican, had indicated he would veto any bill that would make it hard for him or the health department to issue emergency orders to curb the spread of the coronavirus. He made good on that promise in December when a similar Senate bill moved through the House and Senate and landed on his desk. In the past few weeks, it appeared that the governor and members of his party were making compromises on the bill, but none of them appear to be in the final proposal.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of Oklahoma COVID-19 cases has surpassed 430,000, with 818 new cases reported Wednesday by the state health department. According to the Department of Health, there have been a total of 430,250 COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began last year. The state ranked 12th in the U.S. with 21.2% of the population having received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which also reported that 12% of the state’s population had received two vaccine doses. Oklahoma was 26th in the nation in the number of new cases per capita with 233.83 per 100,000 population, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Oregon reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Sunday, adding 1,688 new cases. That's down 39.3% from the previous week's toll of 2,779. Oregon is among the states with the slowest spread of COVID-19 – the state ranks 49th where the disease was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data showed. The worst weekly outbreaks on a per-person basis were in Coos, Lake and Baker counties. Adding the most new cases overall were Washington County, with 189; Jackson County, with 187; and Marion County, with 172. Weekly\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYork:Convenience store chain Rutter’s, which began paying hourly employees a hazard bonus of $2 an hour and store managers an additional $100 a week in April 2020 at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, has decided to make the increases permanent. That means the starting hourly wage sits at $12.50, which increases to $13 after three months. The additional pay, along with performance increases, led Rutter’s to increase total wages by 15% for 2021, according to a company release. Rutter’s, which was recently named one of Forbes’ top midsize employers for 2021, plans to give back to their communities by donating $1 million through Rutter’s Children’s Charities and additional charitable giving.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has fully vaccinated more than 100,000 people, or nearly 10% of its population, the Department of Health said Thursday. About 147,000 other people have received a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The department also reported more than 500 new confirmed cases of the disease and four more virus-related fatalities. Of the new cases, about 430 were first-time positive tests from Wednedsay and about 100 were first-time positive tests from previous days. There have now been more than 130,000 known cases and 2,563 virus-related deaths in the state. The number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 as of Tuesday dropped slightly from the previous day to 141.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State officials updated visitation guidelines Wednesday for nursing homes and residential care facilities. Most of the state’s nursing homes will have to allow in-person, indoor visitation after federal authorities approved the changed guidelines, the Department of Health and Environmental Control said. “Too many South Carolinians have been prohibited from visiting their loved ones in long term care facilities because of overburdensome federal guidelines,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement. “Prioritizing the physical health and safety of our most vulnerable citizens is critically important, but we must also protect their mental and emotional health.” Under the new criteria, facilities must let visitors indoors if community spread of the virus is low in the county where the facility is located, no residents or staff have contracted COVID-19 in the past two weeks, and the facility is following other virus prevention measures. These facilities will continue to require visitors to wear masks and practice social distancing. They also must limit the number of visitors and the length of visits.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Active COVID-19 cases in South Dakota continued to slowly rise Thursday, with another 203 new cases reported by the state health department. One person, a man in his 70s, died from COVID-19, the health department reported, pushing South Dakota's death toll from the disease to 1,905. The man was from Grant County, where there have now been 39 virus-related deaths, according to the state. There have been 89 deaths in Brown County since the start of the pandemic and 77 in Codington County. Active cases statewide increased by 17 to 2,131, and hospitalizations decreased by six to 67.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A state House panel rejected a push to remove a judge for expanding absentee voting in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, siding with prominent attorneys who warned the ouster would be an unprecedented breach of judicial independence. The House Civil Justice Subcommittee squelched the effort by voting down a resolution to initiate removal hearings against Davidson County Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle. The subcommittee didn’t grant a request from Republican sponsor Rep. Tim Rudd to delay consideration of the resolution for several weeks. In the House, 65 of 73 Republicans had signed on in support of the proposal, which called for creating a House-Senate panel to make a recommendation on the judge’s removal. If the panel voted in favor, a two-thirds vote in each chamber would then have been needed to remove Lyle. The prospects looked less favorable in the Senate, where a version of the resolution had not drawn any co-sponsors. Lyle’s ruling in June to expand absentee voting was overturned by the state Supreme Court, but only after the state changed course to promise to allow people at higher risk of COVID-19 complications and their caretakers to vote by mail. Later, Lyle extended absentee voting to all those living with a person at high risk of complications from COVID-19, ruling that the state had promised the Supreme Court that they could vote absentee as well. Lyle’s rulings in the case were harshly criticized by Secretary of State Tre Hargett and Attorney General Herbert Slatery, both Republicans.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: City and Travis County officials have imposed their requirements people wear masks in public in apparent defiance of Gov. Greg Abbott’s order lifting the state mandate, which took effect Wednesday. The mandate announced Tuesday by Austin Mayor Steve Adler and Travis County Judge Andy Brown prompted Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to threaten a lawsuit Wednesday if the Austin-area officials don’t reconsider their move. Adler and Brown announced the new mask mandate Tuesday after consulting their top health officials. Abbott’s order lifting the state mask mandate took effect Wednesday, leaving the decision on requiring masks to property owners.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:The pandemic hasn't stopped local high school students from using their shared love of debate to keep learning and connecting with each other. Their dedication recently led to several local high schools qualifying for the state debate tournament, including Hurricane High School and Cedar High School. The regional debate tournament was held in-person at Hurricane High School from Feb. 26-27, with participants wearing masks, practicing social distancing and being tested for the coronavirus beforehand. \"(Students) learn that we can disagree, fundamentally disagree, and still be friends,\" Hurricane High School debate coach Tara Tanner said. \"We can understand someone else's point of view and build empathy. And that is a gift.\"\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Ten new cases of COVID-19 have been reported at the state prison in Newport, the Department of Corrections said. Testing done Monday found nine new positive cases among inmates at the Northern State Correctional Facility and one new case among the staff, the department said. “We are fully prepared to handle new positive cases at our facilities and it’s encouraging to see the spread slowing in Newport,” said Corrections Commissioner Jim Baker. The outbreak began after testing on Feb. 23. There are 115 cases among inmates and 12 among the staff. By Friday, 106 inmates who tested positive are expected to be medically cleared to leave isolation. At that point, the total number of positive cases among inmates will be 13. The prison remains on full lockdown. All other Vermont prisons are on modified lockdown.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: An estate that holds outdoor weddings has filed a lawsuit over Gov. Ralph Northam’s COVID-19-related restrictions. The Roanoke Times reported Wednesday that the suit was filed by Belle Garden Estate in Franklin County. The venue claimed that it will lose business in the spring wedding season because of limits on the number of people who can gather together for a wedding. A hearing has been scheduled for March 24 at a federal court in Roanoke. A judge will be asked to issue a preliminary injunction that would invalidate the prohibition on outdoor gatherings of more than 25 people at events such as weddings. “Anxious brides trying to have a wedding planned months in advance are being told they cannot have their wedding,” the lawsuit stated. The lawsuit claimed that Northam’s order violates the First Amendment right of free assembly and the 14th Amendment right of equal protection. Northam spokeswoman Alena Yarmosky declined to comment on pending litigation.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle-area leaders on Wednesday touted the opening of a new mass COVID-19 vaccination site at an event center between the city’s two sports stadiums – a site authorities hope can soon be vaccinating more than 20,000 people a day, seven days a week. The site at the Lumen Field Event Center is a partnership between the city, Swedish Health Services and the company that operates the facility, First & Goal Inc. It will open Saturday and initially be operational two to three days a week, distributing about 5,000 doses a week. As more vaccine doses become available, officials said the Lumen site will be able to operate seven days a week and innoculate 22,000 people a day. Mayor Jenny Durkan said when it is operating at full capacity, the operation will be the the largest civilian-run vaccination site in the country. Inslee said the site is designed to help people who have had trouble getting vaccinated – either because they lack access to the Internet or other reasons – get their shots. For now vaccination eligibility is limited to people over 65, teachers and licensed child care providers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Democratic U.S. Sen Joe Manchin told state officials the new federal stimulus package will include $677 million in funding to local governments in the state. The money is broken up into $176 million for metropolitan cities, $153 million for smaller cities and $348 million for the state’s 55 counties. The state government separately will receive $1.25 billion. Manchin said local officials can use funding to pay expenses related to the pandemic, including covering lost revenue and investments in water, sewer and broadband infrastructure. Half of the funds will be distributed within 60 days of the legislation being signed by President Joe Biden, and the second half will go out one year later.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state is expanding COVID-19 vaccine eligibility to at least 2 million more people later this month, including anyone 16 or older with common preexisting medical conditions, such as being overweight, pregnant or having high blood pressure, health officials said. People who don’t have preexisting conditions that would qualify them as of March 29 or who haven’t otherwise qualified yet to get vaccinated are expected to become eligible sometime in May, the Department of Health Services said. The long list of newly qualifying conditions to get vaccinated includes asthma; Type 1 or 2 diabetes; cancer; cerebrovascular disease; chronic kidney disease; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; cystic fibrosis; Down syndrome; heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies; a weakened immune system from solid organ transplant, blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other immune weakening medicines; liver disease; and neurologic conditions, such as dementia. Those conditions were chosen because they increase the risk for severe illness, hospitalization or death from COVID-19, Willems Van Dijk said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The total number of coronavirus cases in Wyoming grew by 42 on Wednesday, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 37 and the number of probable cases rising by five, according to the Wyoming Department of Health’s daily update. There are new confirmed cases in Campbell, Laramie (16), Lincoln (four), Natrona (two), Sheridan, Sweetwater (three), Teton (nine) and Uinta counties.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/12"}]}

Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy clashed over America's economy, the Israel-Hamas war, the U.S. southern border and more. The Republican challengers made a point to take aim at Haley – as the former South Carolina governor rises in polls in important early voting states.\n\nThe GOP candidates also split on how they'll take on former President Donald Trump in the Republican primary. Trump wasn't in attendance at the debate, and the Republican frontrunner has refused to attend previous debates, citing his lead in state and national polls.\n\nCatch up with USA TODAY's live coverage here.\n\nGOP candidates share their favorite presidents\n\nThe Republican candidates ran the gamut when asked about which of America's presidents inspired them, from George Washington to Ronald Reagan.\n\nChris Christie went with former President Ronald Reagan, the conservative icon of the 1980s. Nikki Haley went with the classics: Former President George Washington, the father of the country, and former President Abraham Lincoln, the savior of the country.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy picked former President Thomas Jefferson, primary author of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nRon DeSantis made a unique choice – former President Calvin Coolidge, president during the Roaring 1920s and another pro-business hero.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n‘Disgusting’: Nikki Haley knocks heated college campus hearing\n\nHaley during the debate called Tuesday's House Education Committee hearing on antisemitism on college campuses “disgusting.”\n\nUniversity presidents, including Harvard University's Claudine Gay, were asked to answer to antisemitic incidents that have occurred on college campuses since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nHaley proposed steps the federal government could take to punish colleges and universities, including holding their tax-exempt status at stake. She also suggested limiting the social media app TikTok, which has faced criticism for amplifying antisemitic content.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nVivek Ramaswamy hits out at Nikki Haley\n\nVivek Ramawamy made clear on the debate stage that he doesn’t question Haley’s faith, though his campaign has referred to her by her first name “Nimarata” rather than her preferred name “Nikki.”\n\n“I don't question your faith. But I question your authenticity. And I think that's deeper here. We were just talking about the transition. This is a symptom of a deeper cancer in American life, identity politics,” he said.\n\nRamaswamy added that while Haley said previously he has a “women” problem, she has a “corruption” problem.\n\nHaley, who has converted to Christianity and long been open about her faith replied: “It's not worth my time to respond to him.”\n\nChris Christie bashes Ron DeSantis for not directly answering question on Donald Trump\n\nChris Christie criticized Ron DeSantis for sidestepping a question on whether Donald Trump was mentally fit to be president, saying that while the Florida governor gave an “interesting speech” but was unresponsive.\n\nHe later added, “This is the problem with my three colleagues. They're afraid to offend Donald Trump.”\n\n“And what are you going to do when you sit across from President Xi? You sit across from the Ayatollah, you sit across from Putin, you have to be willing to offend with the truth and answer,” Christie added.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nChris Christie: Donald Trump is an 'angry, bitter man,'\n\nChris Christie blasted the former president's claim he would be a \"dictator\" on \"day one\" when it comes to immigration and energy.\n\n\"There's no mystery to what he wants to do ... this is an angry, bitter man,\" Christie said.\n\nChristie said another Trump presidency would be all about \"retribution\" against his political enemies. Meanwhile, Some members of the audience booed Christie's comments about the ex-president.\n\nHe later got into an argument about DeSantis over whether Trump is fit to be president and accused DeSantis and other candidates of being \"afraid to offend\" Trump.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley fields question on Donald Trump's immigration priorities\n\nChris Christie had earlier in the debate criticized his fellow Republicans on stage for attacking each other, rather than frontrunner Trump.\n\nBut at the hour mark, Haley was served a question on the former president’s comments about implementing immigration restrictions from countries with majority Muslim populations. She sidestepped directly criticizing Trump, focusing instead on the merit of such a ban.\n\n“It’s not about a religion. It’s about a fact that certain countries are dangerous,” Haley said. “The president has one job and that’s to keep Americans safe.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nDeSantis: College isn’t the only route to be successful\n\nWhen Ron DeSantis was asked what he would do to help Americans make ends meet, he directed his answer to a crucial voting bloc in the Republican primary: young voters.\n\n“Another thing that's burdening young people are the student loans,” he said. But he went on to attack student loan forgiveness programs and argued that young people don’t need to go through college to be successful.\n\n“Don't let anybody tell you that the only way you can be successful is through a four year brick and IV degree,” he said. “That's one way you can be. It's not the only way and we're going to fix that problem in the United States of America.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRamaswamy assails 'fascist neocons'\n\nVying for line of the night, Ramaswamy assailed Haley and others for an overly aggressive foreign policy, and invoked the name of a former Republican vice president.\n\n\"You can put lipstick on a Dick Cheney, it is still a fascist neocon,\" Ramaswamy said. \"That's what we see today. It's Dick Cheney all over again in this party.\"\n\nHaley and Christie have described Ramaswamy's foreign policy as ill-informed on the war in Ukraine, Israel's war with Hamas and other global issues.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nCandidates talk fentanyl, southern border\n\nWhen asked about immigration and border policies, Republican White House hopefuls focused on fentanyl.\n\nDeSantis said the drug crisis could have been prevented with a wall along the southern border with Mexico, a Trump administration project the Florida governor said he supports.\n\n“This would not have happened,” with a southern border wall, DeSantis said, adding his promise to complete the effort, adding “There’s going to be a new sheriff in town.”\n\nHaley discussed vetting undocumented immigrants, referencing her own family’s experience.\n\n“My parents came here legally. They put in the time, they put in the price. They are offended by those that are coming illegally,” Haley said.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nNikki Haley, Ron DeSantis argue about who is tougher on China\n\nRon DeSantis and Nikki Haley mixed it up over who would be tougher on China as president – and why.\n\nToo many Haley donors make money on Chinese investments, DeSantis said, arguing \"they are not going to let her be tough on China.\"\n\nHaley said DeSantis is just upset because those donors \"used to support him and now support me.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nGOP candidates discuss American hostages and Israel\n\nWhen asked how far he would go as president to release American hostages held in Gaza, Ron DeSantis said that “we have to look out for our people when they're hostages… you have to do whatever you can to get them home.”\n\nHe added that the U.S. needs to stand with Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, Chris Christie blasted Ron DeSantis for refusing to directly answer the question, saying “I'd send the American army in there to get our people home and get them home now, and I'll answer that question directly.”\n\nRamaswamy said that he’ll tell Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “smoke the terrorists on your southern border” and that Hamas' attack on “subhuman” and “immoral.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nChris Christie on Vivek Ramaswamy: 'The most obnoxious blowhard in America'\n\nForget Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley – the biggest fight so far came between Chris Christie and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nChristie called Ramaswamy \"the most obnoxious blowhard in America,\" and blasted his repeated attacks on Haley. Ramaswamy said Christie doesn't understand foreign policy and appeared to invoke his weight, suggesting that the former New Jersey governor \"enjoy a nice meal and get the hell out of this race.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhat is ESG? What about BlackRock and Charles Schwab?\n\nEarly in the debate, Republican candidates briefly sparred over the term 'ESG.' But what does it mean?\n\nThe acronym for environmental, social, governance principles isn’t widely known outside investment circles but is fast becoming a popular GOP talking point in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe GOP says the nation's top money managers are pursuing an ideological agenda at the expense of financial returns in violation of their fiduciary duty.\n\nCandidates also mentioned BlackRock. Money managers like BlackRock are signatories of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investing. They increasingly use environmental, social and governance factors when making investment decisions.\n\nThe Charles Schwab Corporation is another financial services company.\n\n– Jessica Guynn and Marina Pitofsky\n\nChris Christie: Donald Trump is unfit, and other candidates are cowards\n\nChristie followed through on his plan to attack Trump – and attack the other Republican candidates for not campaigning against the indicted ex-president.\n\n\"The truth needs to be spoken,\" Christie said of Trump. \"He is unfit.\"\n\nChristie said it was \"ridiculous\" that the debate ran 17 minutes without a discussion of Trump. Moderators did not follow up with the other candidates; they moved on to a question about Israel's war with Hamas.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRamaswamy: ‘It is going to take a leader from the outside’\n\nWhen asked whether he was still a unifier in the party, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy dismissed the question and bashed former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, calling her “corrupt.”\n\n“It is going to take a leader from the outside with fresh legs from the next generation to unite this country, not the broken politicians who are puppets of the puppet masters, but the actual people in this country,” he said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRon DeSantis: Voters decide elections, not pundits and pollsters\n\nRon DeSantis answered the first question of the debate, with the Florida governor asked about his electability against Donald Trump.\n\n\"The voters actually make these decisions, not pundits or pollsters. I'm sick of hearing about these polls.\" DeSantis said, not \"pundits\" or \"pollsters.\"\n\nHe then attacked Nikki Haley, who has passed him in many crucial polls in early voting states.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHow do I watch the Republican debate tonight?\n\nThe fourth GOP presidential debate will take place from 8 to 10 p.m. ET on Wednesday.\n\nViewers can watch and stream the fourth Republican debate on the NewsNation channel, app and website. Pre- and post-coverage by former CNN host Chris Cuomo will take place two hours before and after the debate.\n\nThe debate will also air on the CW in the Eastern and Central time zones, and on a delay in the Mountain and Pacific time zones. The GOP matchup will air on the CW from 7 to 9 p.m. Mountain time and 8 to 10 p.m. Pacific time.\n\nA live stream of the debate will also be broadcast on Rumble.\n\n− Haadiza Ogwude\n\nChris Christie plans to bash Donald Trump – and Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis\n\nDonald Trump isn't at this debate, but his name will no doubt surface. Chris Christie will make sure of it.\n\nThe New Jersey governor, who has been outspoken about Trump's legal and ethical problems, also plans to hit Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis for not being more critical of the indicted ex-president.\n\nSaid Christie adviser Maria Comella: \"Expect Governor Christie to be in prosecutorial mode tonight as it relates to Trump and the candidates who have failed to show the courage to take him on.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nEliana Johnson, Megyn Kelly, Elizabeth Vargas are moderating\n\nTalk show host Megyn Kelly, NewsNation anchor Elizabeth Vargas and The Washington Free Beacon editor-in-chief Eliana Johnson will moderate the fourth GOP debate.\n\n– Anthony Robledo\n\nWhat are Republican primary polls saying?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has long led the crowded field of GOP White House hopefuls. In a Real Clear Politics average of national polls, Trump garners 61% support, compared to Ron DeSantis’ 13.5%.\n\nNikki Haley received 10.3% support, Vivek Ramaswamy received 4.9% and Chris Christie received 2.5%.\n\nHowever, some of the candidates have dismissed national polls, saying that they’re focused on critical early voting states like New Hampshire and Iowa. Trump nevertheless leads the Republican candidates in a swath of state polls too.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhere is the Republican debate?\n\nThe setting for the fourth GOP debate is the Moody Music Hall at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.\n\nAlabama voters will make their presidential picks on March 5, part of more than a dozen Super Tuesday states. That’s when the largest number of delegates is up for grabs of any single day in the primary cycle.\n\nIn general elections, the state has been in the red column for decades, last supporting a Democrat for president when Jimmy Carter ran in 1976.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nNikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy and other Republican hopefuls oppose student loan forgiveness\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court had struck down President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive $400 billion in student loan debt for hundreds of Americans - a move that 2024 GOP candidates applauded and has become a contentious point of debate.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on X that a president “cannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors.”\n\nLikewise, biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy supported the court’s decision.\n\n“We have a bad habit in America of paying people to do the exact opposite of what we want them to do: more $$ to stay at home than to work, more $$ to be a single mother than married, more $$ for those who *fail* to repay loans than those who do,” Ramaswamy wrote on X. – Sudiksha Kochi\n\nA low-key debate atmosphere at the University of Alabama\n\nIt's quaint and quiet at the University of Alabama - even on debate night.\n\nUnlike at other Republican debate venues, there no political demonstrators, protesters, or street parties. There are no groups of Trump backers advocating for their missing candidate, or Democrats bashing all of the GOP candidates.\n\nThe road barriers, fencing, reporters, security personnel, reporters, and armies of television production people are the only signs that something is going on at the music building on the edge of campus.\n\nMost of the civilians who wandered over are attending the debate. Many of the others did wear team shirts - mostly for Alabama and/or its celebrated football team.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRepublican face off comes after Ron DeSantis, Gavin Newsom held their own debate\n\nAs voters continue to express their distaste at the prospect of a 2020 presidential rematch next year, two fresher-faced governors provided the current contest with a sideshow earlier this month: Florida's Ron DeSantis and California's Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe leaders have been polar opposites since taking office and often use each other as public foils when making their political arguments. And during last week's debate, they also tried to cast each other as mirrors of Donald Trump and Joe Biden.\n\n\"Joe Biden will be our nominee in a matter of weeks,\" Newsom said during the debate. \"And in a matter of weeks... (Ron) will be endorsing Donald Trump as a nominee for the Republican Party.\"\n\nBut Florida's leader struck back by regularly calling attention to how voters remain pessimistic about higher costs and many don't believe the president is up to the job.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nFollow along as we fact-check the Republican debate\n\nWas that a fair point or a misuse of data?

It's scheduled for July 15 to July 18 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nWisconsin has become a crucial swing state for presidential election, and President Joe Biden won the state in the 2020 race for the White House\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhere is Donald Trump? The Republican frontrunner isn't going to the debate\n\nNo, the longtime Republican frontrunner won’t be in attendance at the debate Wednesday night. Instead, he’s holding a closed-door fundraiser in Florida.\n\nTrump has skipped each of the previous Republican primary debates, arguing that he doesn’t want to give his GOP rivals a chance to take shots at him on stage. He has also said he wouldn’t sign the GOP “Beat Biden” pledge to support any Republican nominee, even if it isn't him.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and Marina Pitofsky\n\nRamaswamy might criticize RNC chair on stage tonight\n\nVivek Ramaswamy has found a new person to target on the debate stage and the campaign trail: Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel.\n\nDuring the third GOP debate, Ramaswamy criticized McDaniel, saying that “no red wave” has come in elections since 2018.\n\n“I think that we have to have accountability in our party for that matter, Ron, if you want to come on stage tonight, you want to look the GOP voters in the eye and tell them you resign. I will turn over my yield, my time to you,” he said.\n\nOn X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, Ramaswamy has called on McDaniel to resign. Meanwhile, she’s hit back at his insults, saying in an interview last month, “Last I checked, I wasn’t running for president. He’s at 4%, he’s looking for headlines.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Ron DeSantis joke about FSU football in Alabama?\n\nWas Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis the reason the College Football Playoff selection committee decided to choose the University of Alabama over Florida State University for the college football's four-team playoff?\n\nNo. But former President Donald Trump has blamed him.\n\nTrump in a recent post on his Truth Social platform, bashed DeSantis for the committee’s decision, and DeSantis had a harsh response for the former president.\n\n“Stop being a keyboard warrior and let’s step up and debate one on one. He’s had a lot to say about me over the last year. Say it to my face. I’m game,” DeSantis said Tuesday on Fox News’ “The Ingraham Angle.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Joe Biden debate Dean Phillips or other Democratic challengers?\n\nJoe Biden probably won't take the debate stage with his Democratic rivals.\n\nIf an incumbent president is running, political parties usually rally around that person's reelection bid. There's no formal rule, but at this point, Biden is the de facto Democratic nominee.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWill the economy take center stage?\n\nThe Republican candidates onstage in Alabama will likely spend swaths of the debate talking about jobs, inflation and other economic issues impacting Americans' wallets.\n\nYou can also expect a lot of attacks on President Joe Biden on these issues, many of which will follow the campaign for the next year.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWill Republican candidates clash with Ramaswamy again?\n\nVivek Ramaswamy will again be near the center of the debate stage, ensuring high-profile skirmishes with other candidates, according to Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan and co-author of \"Debating The Donald.\"\n\nIn the last debate, many candidates sparred with Ramaswamy over his lack of experience and some of his controversial stances on foreign policy and former President Donald Trump’s indictments, which will likely resurface in the fourth debate.\n\nRamaswamy has leaned on ultra-conservative values to try to appeal to voters, but he has also reached out to younger Republicans as the youngest Republican candidate in the field.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhere do Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and other Republican candidates stand on abortion?\n\nNikki Haley has often argued that leaders need to find consensus on the issue of abortion, including agreeing to not jail women who have the procedure. A self-described “pro-life” candidate, Haley said Republicans need to be honest about a national ban, which would require 60 votes in the Senate.\n\nMost Republican candidates, including Chris Christie, has dodged the question by saying they would leave the issues to the states.\n\nRon DeSantis has touted his record on the issue as Florida governor, having signed a statewide six-week ban into law earlier this year.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhen is the fourth Republican debate?\n\nThe debate will start at 8 p.m. ET Wednesday at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. It’s scheduled to continue for two hours.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nHow many times has Chris Christie run for president? What about the other Republicans on stage?\n\nChris Christie’s 2024 bid for this White House marks his second presidential campaign. He previously ran in 2016, when former President Donald Trump ultimately won the Republican nomination.\n\nAs for the other GOP hopefuls on stage, Haley, DeSantis and Ramaswamy are all mounting their first presidential campaign.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen is the fifth Republican debate?\n\nThis is the last Republican debate of 2023, and no one knows how things will proceed in the actual campaign year of 2024.\n\nThe Republican National Committee, which organized all four GOP debates this year, is considering proposals to allow some non-RNC debates in 2024, especially in the days before the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 15 and the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23.\n\nCandidates are agitating for as much exposure as possible ahead of the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 15, and are hopeful that Donald Trump will participate. The RNC is expected to make an announcement next week.\n\n“As has been the process throughout the entire year, the debate committee will meet to decide the details of future debates,” said Emma Vaughn, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHaley and DeSantis prepare for battle\n\nNikki Haley and Ron DeSantis are already circling each other ahead of tonight's debate. In emails and social media posts, Haley and her aides are spotlighting her rise in the polls and reports of infighting within DeSantis' campaign.\n\n\"Ron DeSantis spent $100 million to lose half his support,\" the \"Team Haley\" account said on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThe DeSantis campaign, meanwhile, signaled he will stress that some of Haley's big financial contributions are coming from Democrats.\n\n\"Ron DeSantis is bearing the banner of conservatism in this nomination contest and will defeat the swamp, starting with Nikki Haley,” said DeSantis campaign press secretary Bryan Griffin.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nConservative Supreme Court could factor into debate\n\nSeven years ago, during the first GOP debate of the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was criticized by several candidates.\n\n“It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being,” then candidate Mike Huckabee quipped.\n\nWhat a difference a few years makes.\n\nThe nation’s highest court, which today is more conservative than it has been in decades, has already factored into the GOP primary. Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump have swiped at each other over whether the bench is conservative enough. Earlier this year, Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of candidates he said he would nominate to the court, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nWho's in the debate tonight?\n\nFour candidates will show up to the face off at the University of Alabama.\n\nThe Republican National Committee announced Monday that former South Carolina Gov.

Plus, the latest from House Republicans push to authorize an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. And layoff season has arrived.\n\n♦\n\nThe fourth Republican primary debate is set for tonight in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, following just weeks before the New Hampshire primary and Iowa caucus next month. And only four candidates will take the stage at the University of Alabama. The Republican National Committee announced yesterday that former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy qualified for the debate. To do so, GOP candidates must have polled at least 6% in two national polls, or 6% in one national poll and one poll from two separate early-voting states recognized by the RNC. They must have also had a minimum of 80,000 unique donors and have signed a beat Biden pledge, agreeing to support the eventual Republican 2024 nominee.\n\nThere are some familiar faces missing on stage, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott participated in the third debate last month, but dropped out of the race shortly after. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum suspended his campaign this week. And former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson only qualified for the first debate and did not make the stage this time around. GOP front-runner Donald Trump will skip the debate as he has with the previous three. He's expected to host a fundraiser in Florida, according to NBC News. You can follow along with the debate on usatoday.com. And be sure to tune into The Excerpt tomorrow morning for National Political Correspondent David Jackson's analysis of the event.\n\n♦\n\nHouse Republicans are preparing to hold a vote next week to formally authorize their impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. I caught up with USA Today Congress, Campaigns, and Democracy reporter Ken Tran for more. Ken, always good to have you on.\n\nKen Tran:\n\nThank you for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Ken, House Republicans are getting set to vote to formally authorize the impeachment probe into President Joe Biden. Ken, what are they looking into here and what does this formal authorization actually mean?\n\nKen Tran:\n\nSo House Republicans have been investigating since September in an impeachment inquiry into allegations that President Joe Biden financially and personally benefited from his family's foreign business dealings. While they have found evidence that has already been out there already, that Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, for example, has made millions from doing business overseas. They haven't produced any evidence so far saying that President Joe Biden was directly involved in any of these dealings. They're aiming to formally authorize the impeachment inquiry on the House floor to give it more legal standing and stronger legitimacy in court because investigators have issued subpoenas, but the White House has scoffed at them saying, \"You've not opened this impeachment inquiry without a floor vote.\" Therefore, it's not really considered an inquiry and they can basically defy it.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nKen, are all House Republicans on board with this probe? We know it's a pretty fractured chamber to say the least.\n\nKen Tran:\n\nSure. So that's the delicate balancing act that House Speaker Mike Johnson has to approach here with bringing it to the floor is that they have a very narrow majority, they can only afford to lose three votes. If there's any members that are skeptical of it more than three, that means that they can't authorize the floor vote. Some members like Colorado Republican Ken Buck said he's still a lean no in the inquiry, but lean no means he could still be convinced. Other members, particularly moderate vulnerable members from the 18 districts, Joe Biden won in the 2020 election, most of them have been warming up to the idea of an inquiry and say that the inquiry is going to give them stronger legal standing in court to get whatever information they're looking for.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nKen, how has the White House responded to this impeachment inquiry and the conversation around it?\n\nKen Tran:\n\nSo while the White House has ignored some of the subpoenas, the White House has said that we have cooperated, we've offered witnesses to you, we've testified, and that they say that there is clear evidence showing that the president hasn't financially benefited from these deals. A lot of, for example, what the Oversight Committee has been releasing led by Chairman James Comer, they've been releasing and touting some direct payments. They say from Hunter Biden to Joe Biden in 2019 pointing to recurring payments of a little more than $1,000. But on further examination and what we've seen from public records, those payments were just for a car repayment when the president during his time as a private citizen helped his son finance a car.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Ken, we know that former president Donald Trump was impeached twice. Does that seem to be playing a factor in Republicans' push here?\n\nKen Tran:\n\nFor some Republicans, absolutely. Congressman Troy Nehls, Republican from Texas. He is one of Trump's most vocal and outspoken supporters on the Hill. He told me that while he believes the allegations that President Joe Biden is corrupt, he's taken bribes for example, he's also said that part of his motivation is to impeach Biden at the end of all this and give Trump what he said, a little bit of ammo to fire back. Say if Biden says in a debate, if Trump is the nominee that you've been impeached twice, he wants Trump to be able to say it back, you've been impeached once.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd so we expect this authorization for the probe to come next week. Ken, what's the timeline looking like for this in the coming days and weeks?\n\nKen Tran:\n\nAuthorized next week? Whether or not they would draft articles are still unclear articles of impeachment to begin the formal process. House Republicans still contend that this is merely just an investigation. They haven't pre-judged any facts. Chair of the Judiciary Committee Jim Jordan, one of the GOP investigators leading the probe told reporters on Monday in a little briefing that he anticipates that if they do come to a decision, that decision with articles of impeachment with specific charges will come in the first half of 2024.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Ken Tran covers Capitol Hill for USA TODAY. Thanks as always, Ken.\n\nKen Tran:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nRepublican Senator Tommy Tuberville's blockade on military promotions has come to an end. The Alabama lawmaker has been protesting a Pentagon policy on abortion since February. Depending on the case, the Pentagon gives service members time off and pays for travel to have an abortion. The policy was put into effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade last year. But Tuberville told reporters yesterday that he'll be lifting holds on military promotions for nominees three stars and below. His 10-month blockade has prevented more than 400 military jobs from being filled. Just hours after his announcement, the Senate voted to confirm as many positions though 11 four-star nominees still have their confirmations pending. Tuberville said now looking to Republicans in the House to rescind the Pentagon abortion policy in the annual Defense Spending Bill.\n\n♦\n\nIt's December, which means the arrival of winter and the holidays for many, but it's also layoff season. I spoke with USA TODAY Money reporter Bailey Schulz about what employees can do to prepare. Bailey, thanks for hopping on.\n\nBailey Schulz:\n\nYeah, no, thanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Bailey, let's just start here. Why does some refer to this time of year as layoff season?\n\nBailey Schulz:\n\nYeah, so this is sort of a cyclical pattern where we usually do tend to see layoffs sort of tick up around the December, January months. Companies are looking toward fiscal year-end. They're looking at maybe for ways to improve their balance sheets. And so as they're figuring out ways to restructure and improve operations, unfortunately sometimes that does lead to layoffs.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd which companies have we already seen layoff workers in recent days?\n\nBailey Schulz:\n\nSo there have been a few different industries that have been impacted in recent days, so far in 2023. Tech is a big one where we saw this last year as well, after doing a lot of hiring in the midst of the pandemic, we are now seeing a lot of companies cut back on their staffing at this point. Just this past week or so, we saw layoffs from Spotify. They said that they plan to lay off about 17% of their workforce. That's about 1500 jobs. And then cloud computing company, Twilio said that they would lay off about 5%. And that's just a couple of examples from recent days.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. So you mentioned the tech industry. Is that the main industry we should be keeping an eye on?\n\nBailey Schulz:\n\nYeah. So tech has been one of the more prominent industries that have been conducting layoffs lately. We're also seeing quite a bit of layoffs in media, in that industry as well. And then so far in 2023, there was a recent report that listed some of the more prevalent industries that have connected layoffs and that includes retail, healthcare and products manufacturers, and then financial firms is another.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Bailey, what does the hiring job market look like right now and what's the expectation in the coming weeks for folks who might get laid off?\n\nBailey Schulz:\n\nLabor market overall is still pretty strong. So that's something to keep in mind, where I'd one of the sources I interviewed for the story say like, \"Don't freak out, the sky is not falling.\" The first nine months of the year saw about 13 million layoffs in discharges across the country according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And that's up slightly from 21/22, but that's still below 2019 levels when it was around 16 million. Keep that in mind, but also know that there are some signs of things starting to pull down as far as the labor market where continued jobless claims have been rising. And so we're getting different signals from statistics at this point, but overall, still a strong labor market.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBailey, what advice do experts give employees in this moment to stay prepared?\n\nBailey Schulz:\n\nThe advice that I got for people at this time of year was this is a good time to network. If you know someone at a company that you're applying for, your odds of being hiring tend to be a little better. And so yeah, always a good idea to have those connections in place. And then another bit of advice was this is a good time of year to take a look at your resume, maybe update it, take a look at job postings, and see what's surround. Never a bad idea, just keep your eye open.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Bailey Schulz covers money for USA TODAY. Thank you, Bailey.\n\nBailey Schulz:\n\nYeah, thank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nStudents and Title IX Reform advocates rallied in front of the White House yesterday demanding immediate action from the Biden administration to reform the law. The 1972 legislation prohibits sex-based discrimination at schools that receive federal funding. Under the Donald Trump administration, those accused of sexual misconduct were better shielded from consequences. That's something President Joe Biden promised a reform while running for president. His administration proposed an overhaul of the rule, introducing guidance last June that would provide stronger support for transgender and non-binary students, as well as victims of sexual assault. Earlier this year, the Education Department said it expected to complete them by October. That month has come and gone without final versions of the rules. That's left an increasingly vocal number of students and advocates frustrated at the regulatory gridlock, especially as a likely rematch between Trump and Biden looms.

The Georgia case represents the fourth court case against Trump, who is being accused of trying to steal the state's 16 Electoral College votes.\n\nAmericans who love and loathe the former president waited for hours outside the Fulton County jail before his surrender carrying signs and wearing costumes either applauding or mocking his arrest.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Trump and his 18 co-defendants will return for arraignments and other proceedings as the the threat of jail time becomes a reality for those charged, arrested and booked in the Georgia election fraud case.\n\nAmid all of this the Biden campaign is out with a new TV ad slamming Republicans on abortion, which remains a sticky subject for the GOP in the wake of Roe v.

Meanwhile, the Florida governor is headlining his own events in three counties on the state’s opposite coast – Hillsborough, Sarasota and Lee – steering far clear of Trump as he seeks to close out his bid for a second term.\n\nFor the past two years, Trump and DeSantis have coexisted on opposite ends of Florida – Trump plotting his next move from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and DeSantis building himself into a household name from the state capital in Tallahassee. But as these midterms come to a close and with a decision looming about their political futures, even on a peninsula 450 miles long, it has become increasingly difficult for the two to avoid each other.\n\n“We have two very stubborn, very type-A politicians in Florida that are at the tip of the spear for the GOP,” said one Republican official who asked not to be named. “They both command attention but they both have their own political operations and that’s what you’re seeing. It’s already exhausting to talk about.”\n\nThe long simmering rivalry has spilled into public view during the final weeks leading into Election Day. At a Pennsylvania rally on Saturday, Trump took a direct swipe at DeSantis, and christened a new nickname for the governor, while declaring himself the front-runner in a hypothetical GOP primary.\n\n“There it is, Trump at 71 (percent), Ron DeSanctimonious at 10 percent,” Trump told the crowd as he read alleged poll numbers off a screen.\n\nDeSantis recently endorsed Republican businessman and Colorado Senate candidate Joe O’Dea, as O’Dea vowed in October to “actively campaign” against Trump.\n\n“A BIG MISTAKE!” Trump wrote in response on his Truth Social platform.\n\nTrump followed up by sharing a clip of former Fox News host Megyn Kelly predicting GOP voters would remain firmly in Trump’s camp if DeSantis decided to challenge the former president in a Republican presidential primary. CNN reported Friday that Trump could launch his next presidential bid as soon as this month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback What Trump told Haberman about potential rival for 2024 GOP nomination 02:51 - Source: CNN\n\nBut planning competing events inside Florida two days before a momentous Election Day is especially illustrative of how fraught the relationship between the former allies has become. Unlike other potential 2024 contenders, DeSantis has not declined to run against Trump in a primary, much to Trump’s ire. DeSantis, meanwhile, believes such a concession would undermine his attempts to keep the focus on his current reelection race instead of what may lie ahead, CNN previously reported. DeSantis and his campaign have declined to publicly discuss his plans for after the midterm, but in a recent debate, he wouldn’t respond when asked if he intends to serve a four-year term if reelected.\n\nIn the first of his three events on Sunday, DeSantis made no mention of Trump or the “Ron DeSanctimonious” nickname, choosing instead to criticize President Joe Biden and the so-called “woke” left.\n\nDeSantis described himself as a fighter who stood up against medical experts and criticism during the pandemic to reopen the state and ban coronavirus vaccine mandates, echoing a sentiment in a campaign ad in which DeSantis suggests he was created by God to fight for Florida.\n\nThe biggest cheers the Florida governor received, however, came when he recounted how he arranged for Florida to send nearly 50 migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard, a stunt that has faced intense scrutiny and legal challenges.\n\nIf they do go head-to-head in a primary, the two candidates may find themselves on similar financial footing. DeSantis has raised $200 million this campaign cycle through his two political committees and has spent just over half, leaving about $90 million in potential seed money for a Super PAC. At the end of October, Trump was sitting on about $117 million between his three active fundraising vehicles, according to federal election data.\n\nTrump’s pre-election travel is motivated at least in part by his desire to launch a third campaign for the White House, CNN reported this week. Indeed, during a visit to Iowa on Thursday, Trump told voters in the first-in-the-nation caucus state to “get ready” for his return as a presidential candidate. Trump stopped in Pennsylvania on Saturday – home to the tight Senate race between his endorsee, Republican Mehmet Oz, and Democrat John Fetterman – and he’ll spend election eve in Ohio, where the former president endorsed Republican J.D. Vance in the Senate race against Democrat Tim Ryan.\n\nBut planning a Florida rally was also widely seen as a shot across the bow at DeSantis. Trump first announced last week his intent to hold a rally for US Sen. Marco Rubio in South Florida, leaving DeSantis noticeably out of his plans. Since then, the roster of guest speakers has grown to include the state’s junior senator, Rick Scott, as well as a dozen other elected officials and candidates from around the state.\n\nThe decision to hold the rally in Miami-Dade County comes as Republicans are optimistic they will carry the one-time Democratic stronghold for the first time in two decades. Investments by Republicans to make inroads in the area’s Hispanic neighborhoods have paid off in recent elections, and the party is seeing a wave of enthusiasm that is turning the state a deeper shade of red. Republicans will hold an advantage in voter registration on Election Day for the first time in Florida’s modern political history.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in support of the campaign of GOP Sen. Marco Rubio at the Miami-Dade County Fair and Exposition on Sunday, Nov. 6, 2022, in Miami. Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nAhead of his arrival, Trump was already taking credit for that turnaround.\n\n“President Trump delivered a historic red wave in Florida in the 2018 midterms with his slate of endorsed candidates up and down the ballot and molded the Sunshine State into the MAGA stronghold it is today,” the announcement from Trump’s Save America PAC said. “Thanks to President Trump, Florida is no longer a purple state; it’s an America First Red State.”\n\nWhile DeSantis embarked on his own out-of-state campaign circuit for Republican candidates, including a recent rally in New York for GOP gubernatorial nominee Lee Zeldin, he is spending the final days of the race against Democrat Charlie Crist barnstorming across Florida. His campaign had 13 scheduled events between Friday and Monday. On the final day, DeSantis has a stop planned in Trump’s adopted home county of Palm Beach and in Miami-Dade not far from Trump’s Sunday event.\n\nOn the campaign trail, DeSantis doesn’t talk about Trump, but his remarks are peppered with frequent mentions of President Joe Biden in a preview of what a presidential campaign against the incumbent Democrat might look like.\n\nAt an event Thursday in Central Florida, DeSantis called Biden “King Midas in reverse.”\n\n“Biden touches it and turns into something much worse than (gold),” DeSantis said. “It’s frustrating and a lot of people, the vast majority of Americans, they think that the country has seen its best days. They think that we’re clearly on the wrong track. But you know, I think Florida provides the blueprint that other states can follow.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information Sunday.", "authors": ["Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/10/politics/midterm-outlook-huge-consequences-analysis/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Senate control is the biggest unknown with four weeks ...", "text": "Bristol, Pennsylvania CNN —\n\nA white knuckle midterm election is racing into its last four weeks with the Senate on a knife-edge and with a strong prospect of a Donald Trump-aligned Republican majority in the House.\n\nDemocrats are fighting to stave off the first term-curse that usually punishes a president in congressional elections. They are highlighting issues like abortion and the GOP’s extreme turn while on defense over the raging inflation and rising gas prices that are haunting Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nBut this is a midterm election like no other it since it’s taking place under the shadow of a former President falsely insisting he won the 2020 election and as Washington still reels from the insurrection he incited to try to stay in power.\n\nMany Republican candidates are running on the false premise that Trump was cheated out of office. Some, in statewide races for governor or secretary of state posts, could end up controlling future elections. And the ex-President himself is using the campaign as a testing ground for a likely 2024 bid to reclaim the White House.\n\nThe destiny of the 50-50 Senate could hinge on whether issues like abortion rights and accomplishments in Congress that caused Biden’s popularity to tick up over the summer will preoccupy voters more than the high cost of living and searing Republican attacks over violent crime. But candidates – their strengths, flaws and respective coffers – will also play a role.\n\nElections for all 435 House seats, which tend to be more nationalized races, are more likely to turn on the prevailing environmental winds, which is why the GOP is still strongly favored to flip that chamber.\n\nHow the election will be won and lost:\n\n• History is weighing on Democrats. Presidents almost always take a beating two years after winning election and near 40-year-high inflation and high gas prices are delivering a daily gut punch to millions of voters.\n\n• Besides having history on their side, Republicans have an opening since a majority of voters believe the country is heading in the wrong direction, with fears of a recession growing and the country still trudging through the aftermath of a once-in-100-year pandemic. They are pounding Democrats as soft on crime and fans of open borders as migrants stream across, while leaping on Biden’s low approval ratings at a time of global turmoil to frame the election as referendum on a failing presidency.\n\n• Yet despite post-Labor Day tightening of some of the major races in the GOP’s favor, the fight is still closer than many Democrats dared hope. The tone of the campaign changed in June after the Supreme Court electrified the Democratic base by overturning the right to an abortion. Trump, meanwhile, who scares many voters outside his fervent supporters, roared back into the news with his refusal to hand over classified documents he hoarded at his Florida resort. He also foisted a battery of unskilled election-denying GOP nominees on his party – risking its hopes in key races.\n\nThe parties are campaigning on different ground\n\nOften, the two parties seem to be fighting in different elections, given their choice of different issues to run on.\n\nFor instance, Pennsylvania Democratic Senate nominee John Fetterman on Sunday beseeched around 1,200 supporters in Bucks County, northeast of Philadelphia, where Democrats must run up their margins, to send him to Washington to restore abortion rights, raise the minimum wage and expand access to the health care he says saved his life.\n\n“Send me to D.C., and I will be the 51st vote,” said the stroke survivor, whose blue collar campaign brands his Trump-endorsed opponent, TV surgeon Mehmet Oz, as an elitist peddler of quack cures and a carpetbagger from New Jersey.\n\nFetterman represents Democrats’ best chance to flip a Republican-held state and improve on a wafer-thin Senate majority that depends on the deciding vote of Vice President Kamala Harris – or mitigate Democratic losses in key states they’re defending like Georgia and Nevada. Republicans need a net gain of one seat to win control of the chamber.\n\nBut elsewhere on Sunday, a rising star of the Republican Party – Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who won in Virginia in 2021 a year after Biden carried it by 10 percentage points – slammed Democrats for inflicting economic misery.\n\n“Virginians and Americans are seeing inflation go through the roof and cost of living skyrocket and grocery prices and utility bills, and, oh, by the way, cost of university tuitions and everything else they’re seeing,” Youngkin told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”\n\n“We have got to find a way to reestablish low energy prices, high labor participation.”\n\nRepublicans favored in the House, Senate on a knife-edge\n\nFour weeks out, Republicans remain favorites to win the House of Representatives, though their dreams of a huge majority have dimmed as Democrats try to hold onto suburban areas where the Supreme Court’s abortion decision may not be popular.\n\nMore on key Senate races ‘We can walk and chew gum at the same time’: Cheri Beasley vows to fight inflation and for abortion rights 7 takeaways from the Colorado Senate debate GOP New Hampshire Senate nominee repeats hoax that kids are using litter boxes in schools Schumer: Georgia Senate race ‘going downhill’ but Pennsylvania debate ‘didn’t hurt us too much’ See Senate race ratings by Inside Elections\n\nThe Senate is on a knife-edge. Races in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Nevada look like they could decide the chamber’s fate. And a new CBS News poll in Wisconsin showed Republican Sen. Ron Johnson – the only GOP incumbent running for reelection in a state Biden carried – in a virtual tie with Democrat Mandela Barnes. Other intriguing battles are also unfolding in Arizona, which Democrats are defending, and North Carolina and Ohio, which the GOP is defending. As Republicans in many of these states have struggled to match the fundraising prowess of Democratic candidates, the powerful GOP super PAC Senate Leadership Fund, which is tied to Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, has tried to level the playing field in some key states.\n\nThe consequences of the election are huge. If the GOP does win the House, they will plan to kill Biden’s legislative agenda and to unleash a fearsome set of investigations into the administration, including over the business dealings of the President’s son, Hunter Biden. A GOP majority would be a tool of revenge for Trump and could impeach key Cabinet officials and even the current President himself in a brutal run-up to the 2024 presidential election.\n\nA change in Senate control could have far reaching consequences.\n\nNone of the big wins of the Biden administration – health care and climate legislation, a Covid-19 rescue package, a bipartisan infrastructure deal and the first major federal gun safety measures in years – would have been possible if Democrats had not won runoffs in Georgia Senate races in the last election. A Republican-led Senate next year could halt Biden’s judicial nominees and hold the President’s budget plans hostage, while joining with the House to thwart any future movement on his domestic agenda. And in some states, again including Pennsylvania, a woman’s right to an abortion could hinge on whether Democrats or Republicans win governors’ mansions.\n\nHow Trump may hurt his own party\n\nFor much of the last few months, the midterms have been eclipsed in the news by the war in Ukraine, Trump’s showdown with the Justice Department over the search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and devastating hurricanes. Yet the heat of the campaign has noticeably cranked up in recent days as more voters tune in.\n\nThe race in Georgia was rocked by a Daily Beast report that Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker, a retired college football icon, paid for an abortion for a former girlfriend despite campaigning for national prohibitions on the procedure. Walker denied the report, which CNN has not independently confirmed, yet his struggles are emblematic of the troubles of several inexperienced or unvetted candidates that Trump helped win nominations, partly because they signed up to his false claims of election fraud.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Oz failed to take advantage of a summer with Fetterman sidelined because of his stroke. The GOP nominee, who struggled with consolidating conservative support after a nasty primary, may recently have gained some traction in slamming Fetterman on crime. But the Keystone state’s GOP gubernatorial nominee, Doug Mastriano, trails Democratic nominee Josh Shapiro, the current attorney general, in recent polls. Although in a tightly divided state like Pennsylvania, which Biden won by only by a point in 2020, it’s not impossible for an extremist like Mastriano to win.\n\nAnother Trump pick, Ohio Senate nominee J.D. Vance has run a lackluster campaign in a state trending red, while Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan has tried to reengage working class voters who have been defecting to Trump. Ohio remains a long shot for Democrats though.\n\nIn some states – including Ohio, New Hampshire and Georgia – Trump-endorsed or pro-Trump Senate candidates are running behind their party’s more mainstream gubernatorial candidates in the polls, suggesting that had Trump not played a role in Senate candidate selection, his party would be in better shape.\n\nThe unprecedented nature of these midterms is also playing out in the extraordinary spectacle of the former President and most likely 2024 Republican presidential nominee openly lambasting his party’s leader in the Senate, underscoring the forces unleashed by Trump that threaten to again dash his party’s hopes of winning the chamber.\n\nTrump’s influence is on full display in Arizona, which, like Georgia, is a state where Trump tried to overturn Biden’s election win. Trump acolyte Kari Lake, the GOP nominee for governor, has become a rising star of the MAGA world in her campaign for governor and is refusing to say whether Biden is the legitimate president. Recent CNN polling shows no clear leader in the race between her and Democratic nominee Katie Hobbs.\n\nBut GOP Sen. nominee Blake Masters could cost Republicans a key pick-up opportunity in his race against Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, who’s running for a full six-year term after winning a 2020 special election. The former astronaut, who holds a narrow lead among likely voters in CNN’s polling, blasted Masters in a debate last week for peddling “conspiracies and lies that have no place in our democracy.”\n\nMasters, a venture capitalist, flipped a question over whether he believed Biden was the legitimate president to coin a soundbite on a GOP election theme. “Joe Biden is absolutely the President. I mean, my gosh, have you seen the gas prices lately?” he said.\n\nHow Biden might drag Democrats down\n\nThat answer by Masters underscores Democrats’ vulnerability – and perhaps the most potent Republican attack.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court’s abortion ruling and the chaos in the GOP gave Democrats plenty of material to paint Republicans as a threat, the pain of high fuel costs hits every time voters pass gas station signs. Higher prices for eggs and meat hurt the families that can least afford it. Some of this is beyond Biden’s control and can be traced to post-pandemic issues and the war in Ukraine. Yet if the election ends up turning on the economy, the President’s party is probably in trouble – even if Biden has presided over bright spots, like a low unemployment rate. Economic sentiment often ends up deciding presidential elections. And Biden, despite some more favorable polling in recent weeks, still stands at 39% approval in the CNN Poll of Polls.\n\nIn new CNN polls last week in Arizona and Nevada, more than twice as many voters cited the economy and inflation as their top issue as cited the second place issue in each state – abortion (44% economy vs. 14% abortion in Nevada, 41% economy to 17% abortion in Arizona). Majorities in each state said that the economy there is worsening.\n\nYet at the same time, the Trump-endorsed Senate candidate in both states, Masters in Arizona and Adam Laxalt in Nevada, were viewed less favorably than their Democratic opponents.\n\nThe findings appear to confirm what Republican Senate leaders made clear long ago – the their best chance in November lies in a relentless focus on the Biden economy and the ex-President not making the campaign all about him.\n\nSo while history and economic factors favor the Republicans, the midterms could still be a cliffhanger.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/politics/2022-midterm-election-day-takeaways/index.html", "title": "Takeaways from the 2022 midterm elections: Battle for control of the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe battle for control of Congress is still up in the air, with the Senate coming down to three key races while Democrats and Republicans are still hanging onto hopes of winning a narrow majority in the House.\n\nRepublicans began Tuesday night with a rout in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run.\n\nBut in the hours that have followed, Democrats reclaimed ground. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the battle for the House majority – one that favored Republicans, who expected to benefit from high inflation, historical trends and friendly new district lines after 2021’s redistricting – remains unsettled.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN analyst: Here's what DeSantis' projected victory could mean for the GOP 02:18 - Source: CNN\n\nHere are takeaways as votes are still being counted in key races:\n\nQuestions over control remain\n\nElection Day is over but the fundamental questions of this election cycle remain unanswered.\n\nTo start, control of the Senate remains up for grabs. Fetterman’s victory in Pennsylvania, flipping a GOP seat, gave Democrats some breathing room as they await results from Arizona, Nevada and Georgia. Republicans now need to win two of those three to claim a majority, but the Georgia Senate race will go to a runoff in December after no candidate won more than 50% of the vote.\n\nThe shape of the House, too, remains uncertain. Republicans appear poised to take control but there are scant signs of the big night they were hoping for. As the votes continue to be counted, the coming days will likely reveal the strength of a new GOP House majority – and whether a potentially underwhelming performance undermines Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s standing within a rancorous GOP conference. The GOP is now in a race-by-race fight that will ultimately determine McCarthy’s ability to govern.\n\nKey states are still counting ballots\n\nVotes are still being counted in several key states – including Arizona and Nevada, where a sweep of the Senate races by either party would result in control of the chamber.\n\nArizona and Nevada also have competitive races for governor, secretary of state and more to be decided in the coming days.\n\nIn Arizona, as of late Wednesday night, about 600,000 votes remained to be counted – the bulk of them in Maricopa County, the home of Phoenix and the state’s most populous. Those votes could decide the Senate race between Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican nominee Blake Masters, as well as the gubernatorial contest between Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and Republican former television journalist Kari Lake, an election denier.\n\nIn Nevada, CNN estimates that as of Wednesday night, about 160,000 known ballots remain to be counted. Mail-in ballots can be accepted through Saturday so more could be en route to elections offices. The state is the home of a crucial Senate contest between Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican challenger Adam Laxalt.\n\nThe final House landscape also depends on races that have not yet been decided as a handful of states, including California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona, continue to count ballots.\n\nIn Alaska, a Republican will win the Senate race – but it’s not clear whether Sen. Lisa Murkowski or her Donald Trump-backed challenger Kelly Tshibaka will cross the 50% threshold to avoid the race being decided by ranked choice voting. Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola leads the House race there, but it’s also not clear whether that race’s outcome will be decided by ranked choice voting.\n\nDemocrats go a long way to protecting their Senate majority\n\nRepublicans were not shy about the importance of Pennsylvania’s Senate race: “This is a must-win race. We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority,” said Steven Law, president of the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC.\n\nEarly on Wednesday morning, CNN projected that Fetterman would be the next senator from Pennsylvania, defeating Oz in the most expensive and high stakes Senate campaign in the country.\n\nFetterman’s win was a thunderclap for Democrats. While the race long represented the best chance for the party to pick up a Senate seat in 2022, Fetterman’s near fatal stroke in May – and the lengthy recovery he endured in public – injected uncertainty into the race. But on Wednesday morning, the Pennsylvania lieutenant governor gave Democrats the pick-up they needed to have a better chance to hold the United States Senate next year.\n\n“Fetterman’s win makes it next to impossible for the GOP to get a majority. Pennsylvania was the fire wall,” said Mike Mikus, a Democratic operative based in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nAlthough a number of key Senate races remain uncalled – including contests in Nevada and Arizona and in Georgia which will go to a runoff – earlier on Tuesday, CNN projected one Democratic incumbent: Sen. Maggie Hassan, a first-term Democrat who faced Republican retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, won her race.\n\nA Hassan loss would have effectively ended Democrats’ hopes of retaining their majority. And CNN projected Wednesday that Republican Ron Johnson will keep his Senate seat in Wisconsin. The Democrats are still defending seats in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada – so it will take time to settle Senate control.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN political director breaks down top issue for most voters 03:40 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump’s no good, very bad night\n\nFew Republicans were more involved in these midterms than Trump and the former president had a particularly bad night.\n\nIt appears that Trump knows it, too: He is “livid” and “screaming at everyone,” a Trump adviser who has been in contact with Trump’s inner circle told CNN on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe most striking loss for Trump came in Pennsylvania, where his chosen candidate, Oz, fell to Fetterman in what was the most expensive Senate race in the country. Trump endorsed Oz during the contentious Republican primary, effectively pulling through a brutal primary and narrowly into the general election. But where the former president’s backing was decisive in the primary, it was an albatross in the general election for a Republican Senate candidate who was attempting to make inroads in the suburbs by touting his own moderation.\n\nWhile Trump did score some Senate wins – Trump-backed Republican JD Vance defeated a stronger-than-expected challenge from Democrat Tim Ryan in the Ohio Senate race, while Republican Ted Budd defeated Democrat Cheri Beasley in North Carolina – those wins have so far been limited to Republican states.\n\nIn the House, too, some Trump acolytes lost in what were seen as competitive contests that Republicans needed to win if they were going to build a significant majority in the legislative body.\n\nIn New Hampshire, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt lost to Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in what was seen as a highly competitive contest. In North Carolina, Trump-backed Republican Bo Hines lost to Democrat Wiley Nickel in a race that was widely seen as a test of the former president’s influence. And in Ohio, Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert who bullishly touted her ties to Trump.\n\nTrump’s evening was particularly bad when viewed through the lens of DeSantis’ romp of a night.\n\nDeSantis, Trump’s clearest rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, overwhelmingly won reelection on Tuesday, crushing Democrat Charlie Crist by nearly 20 percentage points, continuing to consolidate Latino support in Florida and even by winning populous counties like Miami-Dade.\n\nThe headline in Trump’s one-time hometown paper, the New York Post, said it all: “DeFUTURE,” the headline blared, showing the Florida Republican on stage with his family.\n\nDemocrats hold their own in the suburbs\n\nIn 2018, the suburbs delivered Democrats the House majority. In 2020, they vaulted Joe Biden to the presidency.\n\nAnd in 2022, suburbs across the country went a long way to helping Democrats avoid a significant red wave.\n\nRepublicans may still win the House, but if the 2022 election was going to be a red wave, it was likely to come through suburban victories that have not materialized yet.\n\nIn a district made up of the Kansas City suburbs, CNN projected Democrat Sharice Davids would win reelection. In Ohio, CNN projected two suburban wins: Democrat Greg Landsman defeated Republican Rep. Steve Chabot in a district that included Cincinnati and some of the surrounding suburbs and Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert in a district that includes areas around Cleveland and all of Akron. In Illinois, CNN projected that Democratic incumbent Lauren Underwood would win reelection against Republican Scott Gryder in the Chicago suburbs. And in Virginia, CNN projected Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger would win reelection, largely because of the votes she picked up from the suburbs of Washington, DC.\n\nRepublicans did score some suburban victories – CNN projected Brandon Ogles the winner in a district around Nashville, Tom Kean Jr. winning in a suburban New Jersey district and Rich McCormick the victor in a district that included Atlanta’s northern suburbs – but it was their defeats that spoke volumes about the size of the GOP wave.\n\nAnother January 6 committee member loses\n\nDemocratic Rep. Elaine Luria, a member of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, lost her Virginia Beach-based House seat, CNN projected.\n\nLuria’s loss to Kiggans, Republican Navy veteran, was the latest demonstration that the lasting focus on the insurrection – even as it sheds light on a dark chapter in the nation’s capitol – is a political anchor for those involved.\n\nLuria had defeated former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018 and 2020. But the district had become slightly more favorable ground for Republicans in redistricting: Biden carried the previous version by 5 points, and would have lost the new district by 2 points.\n\nAnd Luria provided the latest evidence that voters are not rewarding those involved in the committee probing the insurrection. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was routed in a primary by Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman, while Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Florida Democrat, both retired rather than seeking reelection.\n\nDeSantis’ big win could be a 2024 launchpad\n\nDeSantis led a dominant Republican ticket in Florida – delivering historic margins in Democratic territory in his victory Crist on a night that provides him a powerful argument if he seeks the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination.\n\nThe easy wins by DeSantis, who led by nearly 20 percentage points with 92% of the estimated vote counted, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who was 17 points up, were enough to cast doubt on Florida’s status as a national bellwether.\n\nThe most eye-popping outcome – and one that demonstrates the breadth of DeSantis’ appeal in the eyes of Sunshine State voters – came in Miami-Dade County, which is heavily Hispanic and historically a huge source of Democratic votes.\n\nRepublicans had made gains there in recent years: Hillary Clinton defeated former President Trump there by 29 percentage points in 2016. DeSantis did slightly better in the 2018 governor’s race, losing the county by 21 points. Trump made inroads there in 2020, losing by just 8 points. But a GOP candidate for governor hadn’t actually won Miami-Dade County since Jeb Bush in 2002.\n\nThe political reality is straightforward: Democrats have no realistic path to victory in statewide races in Florida without big wins in Miami-Dade County. That reality makes county’s outcome into an exclamation point on a dominant GOP performance.\n\nDeSantis’ win comes as a battle over the future of the Republican Party takes shape, with Trump signaling a potential 2024 announcement next week. Exit polls in Florida showed that 45% of the state’s voters would like to see DeSantis run for president, compared to 33% who want Trump to run in 2024.\n\nIn a victory speech Tuesday night, DeSantis offered a glimpse at how he might describe his governorship to a national audience. Touting his refusal to impose lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, he said that Florida “was a refuge of sanity when the world went mad.” He also described the state as “where woke goes to die” and “a ray of hope that better days still lie ahead.”\n\nGOP makes gains with Latinos in Florida\n\nRepublicans hoped to build on Trump’s inroads among Latino voters in 2020, a trend that could reshape the political landscapes in several swing states if it continues.\n\nThe strongest early signal that the GOP had continued to make gains came in Miami-Dade County, home to a large Cuban population.\n\nBut Latinos are not a monolith, and there were more important signs in Florida, too: Another traditional Democratic stronghold won by DeSantis was Osceola County, a majority Latino county south of Orlando with a heavily Puerto Rican population.\n\nHowever, it’s not clear if those GOP gains are materializing outside Florida.\n\nOne key gauge was the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where three House races in heavily Latino districts were up for grabs. Democrats have won two of those races, CNN projected. Rep. Henry Cuellar, the only House Democrat who votes against abortion rights, won reelection in his Laredo-based 28th District, while Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez defeated Republican Rep. Mayra Flores – the two were drawn into the same district – in the McAllen-based 34th District. The 15th District race, which was widely seen as the GOP’s best chance, is still too early to call.\n\n“The RED WAVE did not happen. Republicans and Independents stayed home,” Flores tweeted just after midnight.\n\nArizona and Nevada, both competitive states with significant Latino populations, are also important to watch. So are a spate of House races in California, where it could take days or weeks for winners to become clear.\n\nDemocrats had a good night in governor’s races\n\nCNN projected Wes Moore the winner in Maryland and Maura Healey the victor in Massachusetts, two seats that are currently in Republican control. Democratic governors in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Mexico and others are projected to hold their seats, while Democrat Josh Shapiro defeated Republican Doug Mastriano in a seat where Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf was term limited.\n\nBut as Tuesday turned into Wednesday, Democrats have a shot at strengthening their grip of governor’s offices across the country.\n\nCNN projected Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly the winner in her bid for reelection on Wednesday morning, while Democrats are competitive in Oregon and Nevada, two states that would represent Democratic holds, and Arizona, a state that would represent a Democratic flip.\n\nThe night is far from an unmitigated victory for Democrats – and how the three outstanding key races tip could shift the way Democrats see their gubernatorial successes. And some of the most famous Democratic gubernatorial candidates did lose: CNN projected Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams failed to unseat Republican incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp in a rematch of their 2018 race, and Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke was unable to defeat Republican incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nBut few Democratic operatives would have said weeks ago that they would be in line to have this kind of night in governors races.\n\nAbortion rights, and its defenders, triumph\n\nIn referendums and races where the Supreme Court’s June decision to reverse Roe v. Wade was a central issue, voters sided overwhelmingly with Democrats and in favor of abortion rights.\n\nIn Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – who staked her reelection campaign on her successful efforts to block the enforcement of the state’s 1931 law banning abortion in almost all instances – defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who had waged a campaign focused on cultural battles.\n\nMichigan voters also approved a Whitmer-backed amendment to the state’s constitution that will scrap that 1931 law and guarantee abortion rights.\n\nVoters in California and Vermont also green-lit constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers had made abortion a central focus of his campaign. Republicans there have rejected Evers’ efforts to amend the state’s 1849 abortion ban to include exceptions for rape and incest. He highlighted that split by calling the GOP-led legislature into a special session in October and urging them to act on the issue – and then used lawmakers’ decision to adjourn in less than 30 seconds without taking action as a campaign cudgel.\n\nIt’ll take time to sort out which issues were decisive, particularly in suburban House battles. But according to CNN exit polls, 27% of voters in House races said abortion was the most important issue – second only to inflation at 31%. Among those who cited abortion as the most important issue, 76% voted Democratic.\n\nA night of firsts\n\nUp and down the ballot, in red states and blue, candidates from both parties are celebrating pathbreaking victories.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Healey is poised to become the state’s first elected female governor and the nation’s first out lesbian state executive. Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary, has been elected the first female governor of Arkansas. And Moore will be the Maryland’s first Black governor.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Massachusetts elected its first female governor. Hear about other gubernatorial firsts 03:06 - Source: CNN\n\nAlabama’s Katie Britt, a Republican former aide to retiring Sen. Richard Shelby, will replace him next year, winning election on Tuesday to become the state’s first female US Senator.\n\nDown the ballot, Democratic state Rep. Summer Lee will be the first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania.\n\nFlorida has also elected the youngest-ever House member, 25-year-old Maxwell Alejandro Frost, now on track to become the first Gen Z candidate to hold federal office.\n\nVirginia’s split decision offers early signals\n\nThree Democratic-controlled House races in Virginia were widely viewed as an early warning signal of the night’s results. With all House districts in the commonwealth projected by CNN, the results hint at a night where Democrats could lose the House – but would not face a 2014-style wave.\n\nDemocrats held seats in two Virginia districts Biden won in 2020.\n\nCNN projected that Democratic Jennifer Wexton won her reelection bid in Virginia’s 10th District. Republicans were hoping Wexton could fall on Tuesday if the night was particularly bad for Democrats.\n\nIn an even more competitive race, CNN projected Spanberger also won reelection in Virginia’s 7th District. Spanberger was widely seen as a vulnerable incumbent, especially after Republican Glenn Youngkin carried the district in his successful gubernatorial campaign in 2021.\n\nBut Democrats lost in southeastern Virginia, with CNN projecting that Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans defeated Luria.\n\n“I was in the White House in 2010 when the big wave rolled in. I know what it feels like. It doesn’t feel like this,” said David Axelrod, the top political adviser to former President Barack Obama.\n\nScott Jennings, a Republican operative and CNN contributor, said whether the results are a wave or just a slight shift in the House, the impact will be the same on President Joe Biden’s administration.\n\n“Whether it is a wave, a ripple, or whatever you want to call it, the oversight is going to feel all the same,” Jennings said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Dan Merica Gregory Krieg", "Eric Bradner", "Dan Merica", "Gregory Krieg"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}]}

To which I say, \"Not all of it.\"\n\nThis is one critic's take on the quintessential Wonder singles of his first 10 years, a cutoff that requires us to get out just before 1972's \"Superwoman (Where Were You When I Needed You)\" and \"Superstition.\" Those are for another list, another time.\n\n15. \"I Don't Know Why\"\n\nThe tone is surprisingly dark compared to Wonder's other '60s work, a tortured soul ballad that starts with an ominous keyboard riff and gets darker from there as Wonder bleeds his way down Lonely Avenue. \"Oh, you never stop your cheatin' ways with another guy,\" he sings, sounding broken. \"Then, laugh in my face.\" And that's when he's just warming up. The vocal just keeps getting more intense, more inconsolable and borderline unhinged as Wonder pleads, \"You throw my heart down in the dirt/You made me crawl on this cold black earth, baby/No I never, I never knew how much love could hurt/Until I loved you baby.\" The B-side of \"My Cherie Amour,\" it peaked at No. 39 on Billboard's Hot 100, No. 16 on the R&B charts.\n\n14. \"Nothing's Too Good for My Baby\"\n\nReleased in 1966, immediately following Wonder's first chart-topping R&B single since \"Fingertips,\" \"Uptight (Everything's Alright),\" it sounds like an obvious attempt to take what worked on \"Uptight\" to the bank. But sometimes, that's a good thing. And no label made it feel more like a good thing more often than Motown. That classic Motown beat is even more insistent here. So insistent, in fact, that if the Jam had covered this at the height of the punk revolution, they wouldn't have felt the need to speed it up. This is maximum R&B. But maybe it was too insistent for the pop charts of the '60s, where it stalled at No. 20, doing better on the R&B charts, where it peaked at No. 4.\n\n13. \"Never Had a Dream Come True\"\n\nThis 1969 recording has a different vibe than any other single on the list, which is nice. Written by Wonder with Sylvia Moy and Henry Cosby, it's got this old-school R&B thing going on, a slow-burning swagger with what sounds like a baritone sax. But that R&B flavor is offset by the lush, symphonic backing of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. It's a flawless blending of the two worlds topped by Wonder's soulful reading of the lyrics, effortlessly capturing the world-weary essence of, for instance, \"Without you, the world out there is painted shades of blue.\" This one peaked at No. 26 on Billboard's Hot 100 and No. 11 on the R&B charts.\n\n12. \"Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday\"\n\nThe backing vocals here are mixed ridiculously high and sound like something you'd encounter on an Andy Williams Christmas special (may he rest in peace). That's why this single isn't rated any higher on the list, despite a brilliant lead vocal from Wonder. And I know he didn't write it, so I'm not sure how much Wonder had to do with this. But there's that magic moment in what I'd assume is the bridge where Wonder's vocal just lingers on \"rules\" at the end of the line \"Two kids who followed all the rules\" and the orchestra stops on a dime as he slides into a higher note and then the orchestra and backing vocals come back in on \"yester-fools.\" That's just a beautifully constructed moment. And for me, it makes the record (which was written by Ron Miller and Bryan Wells). It peaked at No. 7 on the Hot 100, No. 5 on the R&B charts and No. 10 on the adult contemporary charts.\n\n11. \"I Call It Pretty Music But the Old People Call It the Blues\"\n\nThis was Little Stevie Wonder's first single, released in 1962. And it sounds nothing like what casual Stevie Wonder fans would think of as a Stevie Wonder single — the voice of a 12-year-old squeaking his way with authority through an old-school R&B song with bluesy harmonica breaks that places Little Stevie in the classroom \"playing my harmonica in a mellow way.\" But there's nothing especially mellow about the harmonica. Or the swinging backing track.\n\n10. \"Fingertips, Parts 1 & 2\"\n\nThis single is a live recording from a Motortown Revue performance of a song originally featured on his 1962 debut, \"The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie.\" Although he was 13 by the time the single hit, it was recorded when Wonder was 12 and was featured on the 1963 release \"Recorded Live: The 12 Year Old Genius.\" The recording starts with Wonder playing bongos while encouraging the crowd to \"clap your hands, stomp your feet, jump up and down and do anything that you wanna do.\" It's primarily an instrumental, with Wonder in the spotlight on harmonica with slightly schmaltzy, Latin-flavored orchestration. But \"Part 2,\" the radio edit that took him to the top of Billboard's Hot 100 and the R&B charts, begins with a spirited call-and-response of \"Everybody say, 'Yeah,'\" and finds him applying an effervescent 12-year-old falsetto to a few more lines of vocals interspersed with with more harmonica, including a playful quote from \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\"\n\n9. \"I'm Wondering\"\n\nFor a major Motown artist, Wonder didn't make many singles that screamed \"I come from Hitsville USA bearing the Sounds of Young America.\" But that's exactly what this 1967 single screams. And there's no shame in that. Those effervescent Motown accents work as well here as they ever did. His yearning vocals make the most of that bittersweet, Motown-compatible chorus hook. And there's a snatch of \"My Girl\" strings. Included on his \"Greatest Hits\" collection, \"I'm Wondering\" hit No. 12 onBillboard's Hot 100 and went all the way to No. 4 on the R&B charts.\n\n8. \"For Once in My Life\"\n\nThis is a Ron Miller co-write (working with Orlando Murden this time). And it does share a supper-club-soul sensibility with Miller's other contribution to the list, \"Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday.\" It also features backing vocals by the same amalgamation, the Originals and the Andantes. But Henry Cosby's production here is more tasteful and Wonder's lead vocal is great, the sweet spot being when he jumps up to that high note on \"mine\" in the line, \"For once, I can say, 'This is mine, you can't take it.\"\" Berry Gordy didn't like this record and vetoed the single's release. But Motown's head of quality control convinced him to relent and the song hit No. 2 on Billboard's Hot 100 and the R&B charts.\n\n7. \"If You Really Love Me\"\n\nThis is Wonder's most sophisticated single of that whole first decade, with apologies to \"My Cherie Amour.\" Setting the tone with a breezy horn chart and blessed with aching backing vocals from the great Syreeta Wright, this song is marked by a dynamic shift in tone between the upbeat choruses (which feature handclaps) and bittersweet, more free-form verses. It sounds like something Paul McCartney would have liked. The second single pulled from Wonder's first essential album, 1971's \"Where I'm Coming From,\" it peaked at No. 8 on Billboard's Hot 100, hitting No. 4 on the R&B charts and No. 10 on the adult contemporary charts.\n\n6. \"My Cherie Amour\"\n\nThe title track to Wonder's 1969 release — 11 albums in eight years! — this tender ballad makes the most of Wonder's silky vocals as he pledges his devotion in lines as romantic as \"My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore/You're the only girl my heart beats for/How I wish that you were mine.\" The melody is gorgeous and the orchestration does a brilliant job of underscoring everything that's great about it. This one peaked at No. 4 on Billboard's Hot 100 and the R&B charts, climbing one spot higher, for obvious reasons, on the adult contemporary charts.\n\n5. \"Someday at Christmas\"\n\nThis is a true Christmas classic, a yuletide plea for peace and human dignity recorded years before John Lennon's \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over).\" The first words out of Wonder's mouth, after the church bells, are, \"Someday at Christmas, men won't be boys, playing with bombs like kids play with toys/One warm December, our hearts will see a world where men are free.\" It's kind of sad that Wonder's message is as relevant as ever. This one never charted but it should have.\n\n4. \"We Can Work It Out\"\n\nThe greatest Beatles cover ever? It's got my vote. Here's the thing: It sounds like an arrangement Paul McCartney or John Lennon might have pushed for on a different day, although Lennon's harmonica solo would have been a good deal bluesier. And the opening keyboard riff introduces a hook to the equation, as though the original recording somehow struck him as just one hook shy of greatness. There's nothing about this performance that doesn't elevate the session, from Wonder's offhand, conversational delivery to those background vocals shouting \"Hey!\" Released in 1971 as the third and final single from the previous year's \"Signed, Sealed & Delivered,\" it peaked at No. 13 on the Hot 100 and No. 3 on the R&B charts.\n\n3. \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm Yours\"\n\nThe title track, of sorts, to \"Signed, Sealed & Delivered,\" this infectious love song topped the R&B charts for a six-week run in 1970 but somehow stalled at No. 3 onBillboard's Hot 100. This is early Wonder at his grittiest. Check out that opening wail. You'd swear he cut this track on Take Your Inner Wilson Pickett to Work Day. The groove is undeniable and the gospel-flavored chorus hook is on the short list of his most infectious moments. This is the first record Wonder produced on his on and he gets every detail right, from the psychedelic echos of the intro riff to the way he uses his trio of very gospel-flavored backup vocalists (Lynda Tucker Laurence, Syreeta Wright and Vanetta Fields). It sounds more like came from Stax than Motown, especially those horns.\n\n2. \"Upright (Everything's Alright)\n\nReleased in late November, 1965, this single definitely wears Motown on its sleeve, reinforcing its hard-charging opening beat with stabs of Motown horns, the guitars hitting hard on the two and the four of every measure. The title track, of sorts, to Wonder's \"Up-Tight\" album, this one put him back at No. 1 on Billboard's R&B charts for the first time since \"Fingertips\" while hitting No. 3 on Billboard's Hot 100. \"Uptight\" is the first of Wonder's singles that he had a hand in writing (with Sylvia Moy and Henry Cosby). Now 15, his voice had changed a lot since 1963, and this song made the most of that.\n\n1. \"I Was Made to Love Her\"\n\nThis 1967 single spent four weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's R&B charts, held at bay by \"Light My Fire\" on the Hot 100, where it peaked at No. 2. Written by Wonder, Moy and Cosby (the \"Uptight\" trio) with Lula Mae Hardaway, Wonder's mother, \"I Was Made to Love Her\" is an upbeat R&B song that also sounded right at home on Motown. The opening riff is quintessential Hitsville, joined by Wonder on chromatic harp before the soulful verse kicks in with, \"I was born in Little Rock/Had a childhood sweetheart/We were always hand in hand.\" This single inspired a shockingly faithful cover by the Beach Boys that same year on the \"Wild Honey\" album. Rolling Stonequotes Wonder saying he wrote \"I Was Made to Love Her\" for his first love, Angie. \"She's married now,\" Wonder said. \"Actually, she was my third girlfriend but my first love. I used to call Angie up and we would talk and say, 'I love you, I love you,' and we'd talk and we'd both go to sleep on the phone.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2020/01/13/matchbox-twenty-announces-summer-tour-expected-stop-memphis/4452608002/", "title": "Matchbox Twenty announces summer tour, expected stop in Memphis", "text": "Yes, Rob Thomas has seen the \"Smooth\" memes.\n\nIn 1999, the Matchbox Twenty frontman featured on Carlos Santana's sizzling rock hit \"Smooth,\" which topped the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart for 12 weeks.

It was something ridiculous, but it's hilarious.\"\n\nLive from Memphis:10 big Bluff City concerts worth catching in 2020\n\nThomas, 47, will continue to embrace millennial nostalgia this summer with the Matchbox Twenty 2020 tour, a 50-date arena and amphitheater trek across North America, kicking off in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on July 17 and arriving in Memphis August 13. Tickets go on sale to the band's fan-club members Tuesday (10 a.m. am EST) and the general public starting Friday on livenation.com (12 pm EST).\n\nThe tour, announced exclusively on usatoday.com, is timed to the 20th anniversary of Matchbox's 2000 album \"Mad Season,\" which spawned Top 10 hits \"If You're Gone\" and \"Bent.\" The set list will likely incorporate some deeper cuts from that album, as well as other popular songs including \"3 AM,\" \"Unwell\" and \"Push.\"\n\n\"Half of us realizes we're in the hospitality industry: It's our job to make sure people have a good time,\" Thomas says. \"The other half is just playing music we enjoy playing together.\"\n\nNo doubt fans will be 100 percent excited the band is going back on tour for the first time since 2017. Read on for the rest of our interview with Thomas:\n\nQuestion: Matchbox last hit the road together in 2017, on a co-headlining trek with Counting Crows. What surprised you most about that tour?\n\nAnswer: We've been playing together for 20 years and we've had very few personal arguments – any argument we've ever had is strictly professional. But before that (tour), we were right on the precipice of whether or not we were gonna be a band anymore. Kyle (Cook) had gotten frustrated and left, and we were in limbo for a second while I was solo. And then for some reason, everything just aligned. We got back together and that tour in 2017 turned out to legitimately be the most fun we've probably ever had. We got along better than we ever had, so it was a blessing. And that was the moment where we realized that no matter what we're up to, no matter what the hiatus is, when we get back together, we're ready to play.\n\nQ: Aside from the hits, is there a song that gets the biggest reaction from fans when you play it live?\n\nA: There's one I wrote for the third record called \"So Sad So Lonely.\" And then there's one that Paul Doucette wrote for the last record called \"English Town,\" which has become our favorite and a fan favorite every night. Over 20 years, the Matchbox sound has really evolved from songs like \"3 AM\" to \"English Town.\" We're lucky that our fans have kept coming along with us and allowing us to do that.\n\nQ: What about a song that you've grown sick of or have retired from your set lists?\n\nA: There are some songs that are popular that I would be OK if I never listened to again. \"Real World\" is a great example: If I was listening to it, I would just hear all the deficits in production and things I would have done differently now. But when we play it live, there's that energy shared with the crowd and it feels new. It's a whole different thing. Then there are songs like \"Busted\": the very minor-chord, angsty, '90s rock songs. As we all got into our 40s and had families and actual things to be concerned about, that manufactured angst from your 20s doesn't really feel relevant to us anymore. We haven't done some of those songs in a really long time just because they don't feel genuine anymore.\n\nQ: You released a new solo album, \"Chip Tooth Smile,\" last spring, but it's been nearly eight years since the last Matchbox record (2012's \"North\"). Are you guys working on any new music now?\n\nA: We're working on some new songs, but I don't see the landscape in the world being one that makes sense for us to make an entire album right now. We're going out on an anniversary tour for (\"Mad Season\") and there's a huge amount of nostalgia that comes with that. There's 20 years of music that people are going to want to listen to. So for us to just start shoving a whole bunch of brand new songs down people's throats, I don't think they're going to love that. But if we came out with one or two songs that we legitimately got behind and we felt really good about, then those fans that really want to hear something new won't walk away disappointed either.\n\nQ: \"Smooth\" turned 20 last year. How do you and Carlos Santana look back on it now?\n\nA: Listen, we've worked together a lot. We did \"Smooth,\" and then after that I wrote for him and Mary J. Blige and Musiq Soulchild and Seal and a bunch of other people on his records. I think we have this affection for \"Smooth,\" while at the same time, I don't think either one of us thinks it's the best song that we've ever done. I don't think it's the best song I've ever written and certainly not the best song that he's ever done. But it just really holds a place in our hearts. It was the exact right song at the exact right time for the two of us. That's another great example of a song that I don't need to hear ever again, but if you play it live, it just sparks something in the crowd.\n\nWe went through that journey together. We're like, \"Man, this was the jam in the summer. Man, this is kind of cheesy and I'm sick of it. Oh, man, remember 'Smooth?'

It’s been covered by musical artists as diverse as Celine Dion, Kacey Musgraves and BTS.\n\nAnd it’s been heard on the radio by an estimated 3.8 billion people, according to Billboard — where “Feliz Navidad” remains one of the top 10 best-performing songs on its Holiday 100 chart.\n\nMission accomplished.\n\n“For some reason, this little song has united everyone,” the 75-year-old Feliciano recently told NBC’s “TODAY” show. “Nobody can get angry that you made them sing ‘Feliz Navidad’ because it's in Spanish. Nobody can get angry because you made them sing the English part.\n\n“I wanted to wish you a merry Christmas. And I think it's wonderful.”\n\nNow the Puerto Rico native will celebrate the song’s big anniversary with a streaming concert Sunday. The show comes one month after he released a re-recorded version of \"Feliz Navidad\" with an all-star cast of singers, including CNCO, Jon Secada, Jason Mraz, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Gloria Gaynor, Big & Rich, Michael Bolton and Styx.\n\nMore: Santa, Christmas lights and more holiday events in Fort Myers, Cape Coral, Southwest Florida for 2020\n\nFeliciano — who has family in Southwest Florida and even lived in Lehigh Acres at one point — couldn’t be reached for comment. Two of his publicists didn’t respond to interview requests.\n\nBut in a news release for Sunday’s concert, the singer-guitarist said he looks forward to the event, which will be livestreamed from his Connecticut home.\n\n“While I wish we all could be together in person, I’m so happy to be able to celebrate the holidays … with my family and friends around the world,” he said. “Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays everyone!”\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the Christmas hit and Sunday’s concert:\n\n'Feliz Navidad's' popularity\n\n“Feliz Navidad” is one of the most played and recorded Christmas songs in the world. It was part of Feliciano’s 1970 self-titled holiday album, later renamed “Feliz Navidad.”\n\nThe song wasn’t an immediate hit, though. “First people had to get used to it,” Feliciano told CBS Sunday Morning on Dec. 13. “Then the year after, it caught on big.”\n\nSince then, the song has charted on the Billboard Hot 100 many times over the year, and it's appeared in movies such as “The Grinch” and in TV shows from “All in the Family” to “Glee.”\n\n\"'Feliz Navidad' is a beloved holiday favorite for listeners around the world,” said Gabriela Gonzalez of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) in a press release about the song’s 50th anniversary. “Over the last year it was performed in nearly 90 countries, from Argentina to Canada, Norway, Israel, South Africa, India, Japan and New Zealand, to name a few.”\n\nHow Feliciano wrote the song\n\nA producer urged Feliciano to write an original Christmas song for his 1970 holiday album, and Feliciano says he came up with \"Feliz Navidad\" within minutes.\n\n\"I said, 'Well, OK,' and I started humming a couple of notes,\" he told The News-Press in 2010. \"I wrote it bilingual so that radio stations had no excuse but to play it. It covered everybody.\"\n\nFeliciano wanted a song that would unite all people with its positive message and bilingual lyrics.\n\n“My thought when I wrote the song was that it didn’t matter what language you were singing in,” he told the Associated Press in November. “The feeling of Christmas is privy to all of us.”\n\nFeliciano said he was stuck in a Los Angeles recording studio and he missed his 11 brothers and extended family. They had always celebrated Noche Buena — otherwise known as Christmas Eve — by drinking rum, caroling and eating traditional Puerto Rican dishes.\n\nHe ended up channeling those feelings into “Feliz Navidad.”\n\n“It was expressing the joy that I felt on Christmas and the fact that I felt very lonely,” he said in a Dec. 14 NPR article. “I missed my family, I missed Christmas carols with them. I missed the whole Christmas scene.\"\n\nHe sang the song and also played guitar and cuatro — a traditional, 10-stringed Puerto Rican instrument that his uncle had taught him.\n\nWhat the lyrics mean\n\nIt’s a simple song: Just 19 words in English and Spanish, repeated over a 3-minute run time.\n\n\"Musically, it's simplistic, but that doesn't take away from the charm of the song at all,\" musician Bobby Sanabria, co-director of the Bronx Music Heritage Center, told NPR. \"'Feliz Navidad's' one of those kind of songs that, like 'Happy Birthday,' it's very, very iconic. And anybody can sing it.\"\n\nOnly six of those words are in Spanish: “Feliz Navidad, próspero año y felicidad.” Translation: \"Merry Christmas, prosperous year and happiness.”\n\nThe other 13 words are English: “I wanna wish you a merry Christmas, from the bottom of my heart.”\n\nMore about Feliciano\n\nJose Feliciano is considered to be the first Spanish-speaking musician to find huge crossover success in the United States.\n\nThe Puerto Rican-born performer disputes that notion, though, pointing to Ritchie Valens of \"La Bamba\" fame (Valens, however, didn't actually speak Spanish).\n\nBesides \"Feliz Navidad,\" Feliciano had other hits in the '60s and '70s, including his No. 1 cover of The Doors' \"Light My Fire” in 1968 and the hit theme song for the '70s TV show \"Chico and the Man.\"\n\nHe's won three Grammy Awards, and Guitar Player magazine lists him in its \"Gallery of Greats.\"\n\nHe’s also famous for his controversial version of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at a 1968 World Series game in Detroit. Many fans objected to Feliciano’s soulful, Latin-jazz take on the anthem.\n\nMore:Jose Feliciano paid a price when he sang National Anthem 50 years ago, but he has no regrets\n\nHis mixed feelings about 'Feliz Navidad'\n\nFeliciano has said he’s proud of \"Feliz Navidad,” but he’s also frustrated by its legacy. Many people know that song and little else.\n\n\"At times, it can be an albatross,\" he told The News-Press in 2010. \"Unfortunately, the radio stations in this country don't play me the rest of the year.\"\n\nFeliciano said he prefers to be famous for other reasons: His cover of The Doors' \"Light My Fire,\" for example. Or for being the first successful rock musician to play a nylon string guitar.\n\nStill, 50 years after recording the song, he says he’s come to terms with \"Feliz Navidad\" and its fame.\n\n“I just want the song to be remembered,” he told CBS Sunday Morning. “And if they mention my name along with what they remember, then even better.”\n\nThe concert\n\nFeliciano will perform his hits and Christmas classics Sunday from his home in Connecticut. The concert starts at 7 p.m.\n\nThe livestreamed show has been dubbed the \"Feliz Navidad 50th (FN50) Anniversary Livestream Concert.\" It will be hosted by Grammy award-winning producer Rudy Perez.\n\nIt also features appearances by Andrés Cepeda, Austin Jenckes, Haley Reinhart, Kalsey Kulyk, Lawrence Gowan of Styx and more.\n\nTickets are $13. Other ticket packages are available with commemorative posters, a virtual meet and greet, and more perks.\n\nLearn more at feliznavidad50th.com.\n\nConnect with this reporter: Charles Runnells (Facebook), @charlesrunnells (Twitter), @crunnells1 (Instagram)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/17"}]}

The assets could be worth more than $400 million, said crypto risk management firm Elliptic.\n\nIn a tweet early Saturday, FTX general counsel Ryne Miller said the company “initiated precautionary steps” and moved all its digital assets to cold storage, meaning the crypto wallet is no longer connected to the internet. This follows the announcement Friday that the exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nElliptic said although the theft is unconfirmed, $473 million in crypto assets were apparently stolen from FTX.\n\nThe process was “expedited” Friday evening “to mitigate damage upon observing unauthorized transactions,” Miller said in a tweet.\n\nMiller tweeted late Friday that FTX is “investigating abnormalities” regarding wallet movements “related to consolidation of FTX balances across exchanges.” The facts are still unclear and the company will share more information as soon as possible, he added.\n\nThe stablecoins and other missing tokens are being quickly converted to ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, on decentralized exchanges, Elliptic said. Elliptic said it is a common technique used by hackers to prevent their funds from being seized.\n\nFTX, until last week one of the most powerful players in the crypto industry, is experiencing a rapid collapse. Its 30-year-old founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has resigned and has lost his $16 billion fortune in less than a week.\n\nIn its bankruptcy filing, FTX said it has between $10 billion and $50 billion of estimated liabilities and assets.\n\n“I’m really sorry, again, that we ended up here,” Bankman-Fried wrote in a Twitter thread Friday. “Hopefully things can find a way to recover.”\n\nUnder a microscope\n\nAs scrutiny of crypto exchanges increases, Singapore-based crypto.com admitted to accidentally sending more than $400 million in Ethereum to the wrong account. Its CEO, Kris Marszalek, said on Twitter the transfer of 320,000 ETH was made three weeks ago to a corporate account at competing exchange Gate.io instead of to one of its offline, or “cold”, wallets.\n\nAnd though funds were recovered, users are withdrawing from the platform fearing the same outcome as FTX. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao issued a warning on Twitter saying, “if an exchange have to move large amounts of crypto before or after they demonstrate their wallet addresses, it is a clear sign of problems.”\n\n‘We have since strengthened our process and systems to better manage these internal transfers,” Marszalek tweeted Sunday.", "authors": ["Ramishah Maruf"], "publish_date": "2022/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/09/28/facebook-says-50-million-user-accounts-were-breached/1455988002/", "title": "Facebook's 50 million account breach is already its biggest ever", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO – Facebook says the accounts of nearly 50 million users were breached in what was the largest-ever security incident of its kind at the giant social network, delivering another blow to public confidence in the embattled company.\n\nThe extent of the massive hack – how many Facebook users' were affected and how much Facebook users' personal information was compromised – is not yet known.\n\nSecurity researchers suspect the breach affected even more people than Facebook estimated. Facebook would not say if the number of breached Facebook accounts is likely to grow. The unidentified attackers did gain access at least to basic demographic information such as gender, hometown, name or birthday that people include in their Facebook profile.\n\nFacebook says attackers exploited a feature in its code that allowed them to commandeer users' accounts. Those accounts included Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his second-in-command, Sheryl Sandberg.\n\nA spike in traffic triggered an internal investigation on Sept. 16. The breach was discovered Tuesday afternoon and the vulnerability was fixed Thursday night, the company said.\n\nThe disclosure of another in a series of security lapses has already brought political heat. Federal Trade Commission Commissioner Rohit Chopra said late Friday that he was alarmed by the Facebook breach. The FTC and other agencies are already investigating Facebook after it revealed political targeting firm Cambridge Analytica accessed the accounts of 87 million users without their consent.\n\n\"These companies have a staggering amount of information about Americans. Breaches don't just violate our privacy, they create enormous risks for our economy and national security,\" Chopra said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"The cost of inaction is growing and we need answers.\"\n\nFacebook says it has not identified the attackers nor does it know the origin of the September attack. The Silicon Valley company notified the FBI on Wednesday.\n\n\"We are still in the early phase of investigating this,\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told reporters Friday. \"We do not yet know if any of the accounts were actually misused.\"\n\nZuckerberg says Facebook has invested heavily in security measures but will step up efforts to lock down Facebook users' accounts.\n\n\"The reality here is we face constant attacks,\" he said. \"We need to do more to prevent this from happening in the first place.\"\n\nMore than 90 million of Facebook’s users were forced to log out of their accounts Friday morning as a security measure. They will be notified why at the top of their News Feed, the Facebook CEO said.\n\nHow the attack worked\n\nThe vulnerability was introduced in July 2017 when a feature was added that allows users to upload happy birthday videos.\n\nAttackers exploited a vulnerability in Facebook’s code that affected \"View As,\" a feature that lets people see what their own profile looks like to someone else. The feature was built to give users more control over their privacy. Three software bugs in Facebook's code connected to this feature allowed attackers to steal Facebook access tokens they could then use to take over people's accounts.\n\nThese access tokens are like digital keys that keep people logged in to Facebook so they don’t need to re-enter their password every time they use Facebook.\n\nHow it worked: Once the attackers had access to a token for one account, call it Jane's, they could then use \"View As\" to see what another account, say Tom's, could see about Jane's account. The vulnerability enabled the attackers to get an access token for Tom's account as well, and the attack spread from there. Facebook said it has turned off the \"View As\" feature as a security precaution.\n\nThe attackers could have also gained access to Facebook users' accounts on other apps and websites they access with Facebook Login, the feature that allows you to log in to other online services with your Facebook credentials, the company said.\n\nFacebook has reset the tokens of nearly 50 million accounts that were affected and, as a precaution, it has also reset the tokens for another 40 million accounts that have used \"View As\" in the past year. Resetting the tokens logged the affected Facebook users out of the service and should also have logged those users out of third-party apps and websites they access through Facebook Login, too.\n\n\"So far our initial investigation has not shown that these tokens were used to access any private messages or posts or to post anything to these accounts. But this, of course, may change as we learn more,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nWhen these 90 million people log back into Facebook or any apps that use Facebook login, they will be notified at the top of their News Feed, Guy Rosen, vice president of product management, said.\n\nFacebook says there's no need for users to reset their passwords. But security experts recommend they do it anyway.\n\nCalls for investigation\n\nThe breach marks the latest privacy mishap for Facebook, which has been hammered for the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the unchecked spread of Russian propaganda during and after the 2016 presidential election.\n\nConfidence in the giant social network used by more than 2 billion people around the world has been shaken by the troubling revelations. Another two billion people use Facebook messaging app WhatsApp and Facebook-owned Instagram.\n\n\"This is clearly a breach of trust, and we take this very seriously. We are working with lawmakers and regulators to let them know what happened,\" Rosen told reporters.\n\nEven before Friday's disclosure, Facebook was ensnared in multiple investigations, including a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the company’s statements about the leak of millions of people's data to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nSuch a massive breach is likely to trigger more calls for oversight of Facebook and other tech giants. The Irish Data Protection Commission complained Friday about the lack of detail in Facebook’s initial report. The UK Information Commissioner’s Office said it planned to investigate.\n\nDemocratic Senator Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called for a swift and public probe into the breach.\n\n“Today’s disclosure is a reminder about the dangers posed when a small number of companies like Facebook or the credit bureau Equifax are able to accumulate so much personal data about individual Americans without adequate security measures,\" Warner said in a statement. \"This is another sobering indicator that Congress needs to step up and take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users.\"\n\nThe FTC on Friday had no comment on whether it was investigating Facebook over this latest breach.\n\nForrester analyst Jeff Pollard says the Facebook breach illustrates the perils of handing so much sensitive data over to a single company. A critical part of warding off future attacks will be Facebook limiting access to users' data, he said.\n\n\"The fact that a breach at one company can impact tens of millions of users is troubling. Attackers go where the data is, and that has made Facebook an obvious target,\" he said in a statement. \"The main concern here is that one feature of the platform allowed attackers to harvest the data of tens of millions of users.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/05/23/target-pay-185m-2013-data-breach-affected-consumers/102063932/", "title": "Target to pay $18.5M for 2013 data breach that affected 41 million ...", "text": "Kevin McCoy, USA TODAY\n\nRetail giant Target will pay an $18.5 million multistate settlement, the largest ever for a data breach, to resolve state investigations of the 2013 cyber attack that affected more than 41 million of the company's customer payment card accounts.\n\nAnnounced Tuesday by 47 states and the District of Columbia, the agreement sets new industry standards for companies that process payment cards and maintain confidential information about their customers.\n\nTarget confirms massive credit-card data breach\n\nThe states' investigation of the breach determined that cyberattackers gained access to Target's computer gateway served through credentials stolen from a third-party vendor in Nov. 2013. Using the credentials to exploit weaknesses in Target's system, the attackers gained access to a customer service database, installed malware on the system and captured full names, phone numbers, email addresses, payment card numbers, credit card verification codes, and other sensitive data.\n\nAlong with affecting 41 million customer payment card accounts, the breach affected contact information for more than 60 million Target customers.\n\n\"Companies across sectors should be taking their data security policies and procedures seriously.

But the seizure is still a breakthrough for law enforcement, and investigators are actively trying to recover some of the remaining loot, according to Erin Plante, Chainalysis’ senior director of investigations.\n\nThe FBI and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\n“The money has been frozen by [law enforcement],” Sky Mavis co-founder Aleksander Leonard Larsen told CNN. “No funds returned as of yet and we expect it to take time until the community gets the funds back. Note also that all user funds have been reimbursed.”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the seizure.\n\nNorth Korean government-backed hackers have stolen the equivalent of billions of dollars in recent years by raiding cryptocurrency exchanges, according to the United Nations.\n\nIn separate but related activity, a recent CNN investigation found that North Korean operatives posing as other nationalities had tried to land jobs at cryptocurrency firms in the US and abroad. The activity, US officials have publicly warned, is part of an effort to earn “a critical stream of revenue” that helps bankroll the North Korean regime’s “highest economic and security priorities,” including its weapons programs.\n\nNorth Korean hackers also used ransomware — malicious software that locks computers in an extortion scheme — to target medical providers in Kansas and Colorado last year, according to the US Justice Department. The department recovered half a million dollars that the North Koreans extorted in those cases, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in July.\n\nThe Treasury Department has tried to crack down on the North Korean hackers’ targeting of cryptocurrency by sanctioning some accounts that they use to move money, and a “mixer,” or service that the hackers have allegedly used to launder stolen cryptocurrency.\n\nThose actions have made it harder for the North Korean hackers to cash out the stolen funds, Plante said.\n\n“That’s a lot of dirty money right there, so it becomes increasingly difficult to move these funds to a service to cash them out,” Plante told CNN.\n\nBut there are still many mixing services that haven’t been sanctioned, Plante said, adding that she expected the North Korean hackers to change services to try to evade US law enforcement.\n\nFor investigators, the time immediately after a hack is critical in trying to recover money that the attackers attempt to launder through cryptocurrency accounts. The FBI has continued to appeal to victims to share information on those accounts soon after a hack is discovered to increase the chances of recovering stolen funds.\n\nJustice Department officials in June 2021 seized roughly half of the estimated $4.4 million ransom payment that Colonial Pipeline, which provides roughly 45% of the fuel consumed on the East Coast, paid to Russian-speaking hackers.\n\nBut the seizures still only account for a sliver of the billions of dollars made through cybercrime annually. Cybercriminals received more than $1.2 billion in ransom payments in 2020 and 2021 combined, according to Chainalysis.\n\nNorth Korean computer operatives, like those of other foreign powers, are also tasked with collecting valuable intelligence for the regime, according to US officials and cybersecurity experts. Between February and July, suspected North Korean hackers were involved in a spying campaign to gather information on energy firms in the US, Japan and Canada, Talos, Cisco’s threat intelligence unit, said Thursday.", "authors": ["Sean Lyngaas"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/business/nightcap-zelle-fraud-warren-investigation/index.html", "title": "Zelle fraud is rising as big banks neglect victims, Senate report finds ...", "text": "This story is part of CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n\nNew York CNN Business —\n\nZelle, the popular payment app, is under fire for how it handles (or rather, doesn’t handle) fraud and scams that have exploded on the platform in recent years.\n\nThe New York Times called Zelle out in two reports earlier this year. That grabbed the attention of US senators, who pressed the CEOs of the nation’s large banks that own the platform in hearings last month and began an investigation into the service.\n\nHere’s the deal: On Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren’s office said its investigation into Zelle showed that fraud and theft are not only rampant but getting worse. And once people report fraudulent transactions, banks are reimbursing only a small fraction of the swindled customers.\n\nSen. Warren questions bank CEOs about Zelle during a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Sept. 22. Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\n“Big banks own and profit from Zelle but are failing to make their customers whole for both authorized and unauthorized fraudulent activity on the platform, despite their claims that it is safe,” Warren’s office wrote.\n\nKey things to know:\n\nZelle (rhymes with “tell”) was created in 2017 as the banking industry’s answer to Venmo and Cash App.\n\nThe fintech companies behind those apps were doing what big banks had failed to do for decades — make transferring money to your friend who just paid for dinner easy and free and fast.\n\nSo the big banks got together and created Zelle, which was lame and almost no one used it till around 2020, when digital payments took off in response to the pandemic.\n\nZelle is now by far the largest peer-to-peer payment system in America. Last year, according to Zelle, transactions totaled $490 billion, up 59% from the year before. (PayPal-owned Venmo, its closest rival, handled $230 billion.)\n\nThe service is operated by Early Warning Systems, a fintech company owned by seven of the US’s largest banks.\n\nNaturally, where the internet and money collide is where scammers get to work.\n\nZelle’s size and accessibility — it’s built right into participating banks’ apps — make it the “preferred tool of fraudsters and other bad actors,” according to the report from Warren’s office.\n\nAmong the investigation’s key findings, which corroborate anecdotal evidence reported by the Times:\n\nBanks are not repaying 90% of cases in which customers were tricked into making payments on Zelle.\n\nAn estimated $440 million was lost by Zelle users through frauds and scams in 2021. But banks “appear not to have provided sufficient recourse to their customers.”\n\n“Authorized” vs “Unauthorized:” Under the a federal rule known as Regulation E, banks are technically only liable to cover fraudulent activity when it involves “unauthorized” transactions. Say, when someone steals your credit card and makes purchases without your permission. But if someone persuades you to send them $500 through a phishing scam, banks consider that “authorized” and won’t reimburse those funds.\n\nBUT… The bank data reviewed by Warren’s office suggest even the bulk of unauthorized cases are going unpaid. For example: PNC Bank indicated that its customers reported 10,683 cases of unauthorized payments totaling over $10.6 million. It refunded only 1,495 cases, totaling $1.46 million.\n\nZelle sought to downplay the report and didn’t specifically address Warren’s allegations Monday. In a statement, the company said: “Tens of millions of consumers use Zelle without incident, with more than 99.9% of payments completed without any report of fraud or scam,” adding that the proportion of fraud and scams has steadily decreased as its user numbers have climbed.\n\nThe Bank Policy Institute, a banking industry group, also disputed Warren’s findings and claimed that Zelle’s rivals Venmo and CashApp receive more reports of disputed transactions.\n\n“Zelle is the safest peer-to-peer network,” it said in a statement Monday. “For any real discussion of online fraud, the focus belongs elsewhere.”\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\nIt’s kind of crazy to remember how anyone moved money among friends before the advent of payment apps. Did I actually carry cash with me? On the first every month did I take my little checkbook out and literally write out my portion of the rent on a magic slip of paper and then just hand it to my roommates? Wild. It would not surprise me if the original idea for a payments app came from a restaurant server who was fed up with splitting bills unevenly across eight different cards.\n\nBut that’s the pre-internet world Regulation E was made for. It’s a 1978 rule that only got a 21st century electronic payments update by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau late last year. It wasn’t made for the world of instant payments, and could hardly have envisioned how easy the internet would make it to swindle people out of their money.\n\nWarren’s report on Zelle could add pressure on regulators including the CFPB to update its guidance.\n\n“Given this uncertain landscape and the banks’ abdication of responsibility, regulatory clarity is needed to further protect Zelle users,” researchers wrote in the report, noting that the CFPB has regulatory authority over peer-to-peer platforms including Zelle.\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY: $1.26 million\n\nKim Kardashian, the reality TV star, cosmetics entrepreneur and budding private-equity manager, was hit with a $1.26 million fine for touting what turned out to be a worthless crypto token to her millions of Instagram followers.\n\nKardashian failed to disclose that she was paid $250,000 for the endorsement. Her hashtag “#ad” in the June 2021 post wasn’t enough to satisfy the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition to the fine, Kardashian agreed to refrain from any crypto asset promotions for three years.\n\n“This case is a reminder that, when celebrities or influencers endorse investment opportunities, including crypto asset securities, it doesn’t mean that those investment products are right for all investors,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nUK U-Turn\n\nIn a development that I can only assume means that Liz Truss is a Nightcap reader, the British government is reversing part of its tax proposal that was so unpopular it nearly tanked the UK bond market last week.\n\nHere’s the deal: The newly installed government of Prime Minister Liz Truss had announced a massive slate of tax cuts that have amounted to a windfall for the nation’s wealthiest people, slashing the top rate of income tax to 40% from 45%.\n\nThat provision “had become a distraction,” the finance minister said Sunday.\n\nThe proposed cuts of more than $50 billion were aimed at turbo-boosting growth. Instead, it caused panic. The pound plunged to its lowest level against the US dollar, and sparked chaos in the market for UK debt because they will require a large increase in government borrowing.\n\nIt was a dumpster fire of a plan that no mainstream economist supported.\n\nBut, as my colleague Mark Thompson writes, the about-face is more of a symbolic gesture than a genuine reckoning. It will likely reduce the overall size of the tax-cutting package by about £2 billion.\n\n“This move is rather symbolic, being less about the amount of money it will save (low billions) and more about the poor signal it had delivered of ideological (unfunded) tax cuts,” wrote Chris Turner, global head of UK markets at ING.\n\nBottom line: The Truss government’s unfunded tax cuts, which set off a panic in financial markets and put Downing Street in a standoff with the Bank of England, remain, uh, unfunded. The BOE’s bond-buying intervention may have bought the government some time, but Truss has shown no signs of budging on her fringe trickle-down economic theory.\n\nTruss’ finance minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, “still has a lot of work to do if he is to display a credible commitment to fiscal sustainability,” said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, on Monday.\n\n“Unless he also U-turns on some of his other, much larger tax announcements, he will have no option but to consider cuts to public spending: to social security, investment projects, or public services.”\n\nEnjoying Nightcap?

Conservative critics have accused Twitter of suppressing the story at the behest of the FBI, something they claim the released communications, dubbed the “Twitter Files,” demonstrate.\n\nMusk himself has alleged the communications show government censorship, suggesting Twitter acted “under orders from the government” when it suppressed the Hunter Biden laptop story.\n\nBut so far, none of the released messages explicitly show the FBI telling Twitter to suppress the story. In fact, the opposite view emerges from sworn testimony by an FBI agent at the center of the controversy. And in interviews with CNN, half a dozen tech executives and senior staff, along with multiple federal officials familiar with the matter, all deny any such directive was given.\n\n“We would never go to a company to say you need to squelch this story,” said one former FBI official who helped oversee the government’s cooperation with companies including Twitter, Google and Facebook.\n\nElon Musk has suggested internal Twitter communications reveal improper behavior by the FBI in its effort to thwart foreign influence campaigns Andrew Kelly/Reuters\n\nMusk and his conservative allies have insinuated the released messages provide evidence of illicit behavior by the FBI, suggesting the exchange of secret files pertaining to Hunter Biden, and improper payments made to Twitter. But CNN’s interviews with people directly involved with the interactions and with those who have reviewed the documents disprove those claims.\n\nMatt Taibbi, one of the journalists Musk tapped this month to comb through Twitter internal messages for evidence of free speech violations, said himself on December 2 that “there is no evidence - that I’ve seen - of any government involvement in the laptop story.”\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that following Russia’s meddling campaign in 2016, plus after years of interactions with federal agents about how to spot foreign disinformation efforts, Twitter executives were hyper suspicious of anything that looked like foreign influence and were primed to act, even without direction from the government.\n\nBy the time the New York Post published its laptop story on October 14, 2020, Yoel Roth, Twitter’s then head of site integrity, had spent two years meeting with the FBI and other government officials. He was prepared for some kind of hack and leak operation.\n\n“There were lots of reasons why the entire industry was on alert,” Roth said at a conference in November, not long after he resigned from Twitter. Roth insists he was not in favor of blocking the story and thought the company’s decision was a mistake.\n\nAs the released communications show, Twitter initially acted to suppress the story for a few days in part out of concerns that Hunter Biden, the son of the then-Democratic presidential candidate, was being targeted as part of a foreign election interference operation similar to the one Russia carried out in 2016.\n\nWhat Twitter did not know at the time was that Hunter Biden was the subject of a federal criminal investigation. Since as early as 2018, the Justice Department has been investigating Hunter Biden for his business activities in foreign countries. In late 2019, nearly a year before the story first emerged in the New York Post, the FBI had used a subpoena to obtain a laptop that Biden allegedly left behind at a Delaware computer repair store.\n\nAccording to sources at the FBI and at Twitter who spoke to CNN, none of that information was disclosed to Twitter executives trying to decide how to treat the laptop story, nor to anyone else for that matter.\n\n“It was an ongoing investigation, so I would never approve of talking about it,” said the former FBI official.\n\nGOP scrutiny\n\nWhile the released Twitter messages have yet to reveal a smoking gun showing the government ordered a social media company to suppress a story, Republicans on Capitol Hill say there are enough questions raised by the internal communications to merit calling tech executives to testify.\n\nScrutiny is building around the role of Twitter’s recently-fired deputy general counsel James Baker, a former top FBI official who joined Twitter in the summer of 2020. The released documents show Baker was in regular contact with his former colleagues at the FBI, giving rise to rampant accusations from conservatives that he was the conduit for the government to pressure Twitter.\n\nIn some of the material released by Twitter, an email shows Baker setting up a meeting – in the midst of Twitter’s internal deliberations about how to handle the New York Post story – with Matthew Perry, an attorney in the FBI’s Office of General Counsel. It is not clear what the two discussed.\n\nThe FBI declined to discuss any communications Baker had with FBI officials once he arrived at Twitter.\n\nBaker is among a number of former Twitter executives called to testify this month by Republican Rep. James Comer, the incoming chair of the House Oversight Committee. Baker declined to comment for this story.\n\nRep. James Comer (R-KY) attends a House Oversight Committee hearing on July 27, 2022 Drew Angerer/Getty Images/File\n\nComer also wants to hear from several former US intelligence officials who, days after the laptop story broke, wrote an open letter saying it had “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.” The group of former officials who signed the letter included former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who, as a CNN contributor, appeared on the network to express his view.\n\nThough the former officials admitted, “we do not have evidence of Russian involvement,” their letter set the tone for much of the early discussion and coverage of the laptop.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the FBI said, “The correspondence between the FBI and Twitter show nothing more than examples of our traditional, longstanding and ongoing federal government and private sector engagements, which involve numerous companies over multiple sectors and industries. As evidenced in the correspondence, the FBI provides critical information to the private sector in an effort to allow them to protect themselves and their customers.\n\n“The men and women of the FBI work every day to protect the American public. It is unfortunate that conspiracy theorists and others are feeding the American public misinformation with the sole purpose of attempting to discredit the agency.”\n\nAllegations of illicit behavior\n\nAmong the messages given the most attention from Musk and other critics are a series of emails between Roth and Elvis Chan, an FBI special agent based in San Francisco, where he focuses on cybersecurity and foreign influence on social media. On October 13, the day before New York Post story published, Chan instructed Roth to download ten documents on a secure portal.\n\nRoth responded, “received and downloaded – thanks!”\n\nMichael Shellenberger, who is among those Musk has entrusted with access to the internal messages, wrote about the Chan communication with Roth. Shellenberger does not describe the contents of the files, but he does insinuate that the timing of the message suggests Chan was secretly providing Roth information about the Hunter laptop.\n\nAt the FBI’s headquarters in Washington, a team reviewing the internal communications released by Musk says it has identified the 10 documents Chan sent to Roth. “I reviewed all 10 of these documents personally and I can say explicitly there is nothing in these 10 documents about Hunter Biden’s laptop or about any related story to that,” an FBI official involved in the review told CNN.\n\nThe official said eight of the documents pertained to “malign foreign influence actors and activities,” the FBI’s terminology for foreign government election meddling. The official said the other two documents were posts on Twitter the FBI flagged as potential evidence of election-related crimes, such as voter suppression activities.\n\nAnother interaction that has drawn suspicion is an internal message from early 2021 that Shellenberger cites showing that the FBI paid Twitter $3.4 million beginning October 2019. In the message, an unnamed associate emails Baker saying, “I am happy to report we have collected $3,415,323 since October 2019!”\n\nThe FBI says the bureau is obligated under federal law to reimburse companies for the cost they incur to satisfy subpoenas and other legal requests as part of the FBI’s investigative work.\n\nThe FBI describes its discussions with Twitter as the type of information-sharing that Congress and both the Trump and Biden administrations encouraged to help tech companies and social media platforms protect themselves and their users. The released messages appear to show that FBI officials repeatedly noted that it was up to the content moderators at the company to take action if a post violated their rules.\n\n“All the information exchanged is about the actors and their activity,” a second FBI official who reviewed the communications told CNN. “What we are not providing is specifics about the content and the narrative. We are also not directing the platforms to do anything. We are just providing it for them to do as they see fit under their own terms of service to protect their platforms and customers.”\n\nGhosts of 2016\n\nAfter the 2016 election, social media executives knew they had a problem. Russian operatives had used their platforms to run a massive covert influence campaign to help elect Donald Trump, using bots to spread disinformation and sow division among Americans.\n\nTo prepare for the next election, the executives set about bolstering their internal controls, including hiring former law enforcement and intelligence officials. But they also knew they had to forge a closer relationship with the US government to help root out foreign trolls and sources of disinformation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump chats with Russia's President Vladimir Putin at a summit in 2017. Mikhail Klimentyev/AFP/Getty\n\nWhat followed were a series of regular meetings with federal agents that began in May 2018.\n\nThe released communications as well as interviews with people involved in the meetings portray routine, friendly and sometimes tense contacts between company executives and the government officials with whom they regularly interacted. Among the released communications are lively exchanges between Twitter and the FBI, revealing some of the sensitivities — and tensions — at play as the government and Silicon Valley slowly figured out how to work together.\n\nOne former FBI official who spoke to CNN recalls that tech executives would insist on meetings away from their campuses, in part because government agents weren’t welcome. Feelings in Silicon Valley toward the intelligence community were still raw since the Edward Snowden leaks detailed a vast data collection apparatus that targeted the tech companies.\n\n“Early on, who hosted the meeting was also a political football,” said a person familiar with the meetings between the government and Silicon Valley. “Each company wanted someone else to. There were worries about employees seeing a bunch of feds and leaking it in an inaccurate way.”\n\nOne tech source, however, dismissed this and said companies offered their offices for the meetings out of a shared sense of responsibility.\n\nNevertheless, the meetings went ahead. The first one took place at Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park. Later meetings were held at Twitter and LinkedIn’s offices, a person familiar with the meetings told CNN.\n\nSome of the early interactions were terse. Reports published by CNN and other news organizations described complaints from some tech executives that the FBI was sharing only limited information, useless to help the companies protect their platforms.\n\nA telling moment came early on when a government lawyer lectured tech executives about the limits on what the government can do to help, multiple people who attended the meeting told CNN. One Silicon Valley executive described how the lawyer gave a 20-minute speech about the First Amendment and insisted that “government representatives can’t tell the companies to take any content down.”\n\nFormer Twitter employees and FBI officials involved say that by 2020, their discussions had become better coordinated and useful to both sides. One indicator of how advantageous the relationship had become: By 2020, Facebook was issuing press releases about some of the discussions.\n\nRumors of a hack-and-leak operation\n\nMusk and other critics of the interactions point to released messages that they claim show a cozy relationship between the government and Twitter. But the messages also show Roth, Twitter’s then head of site integrity, repeatedly pushing back against asks from the FBI.\n\nAt various points, the Twitter communications show Roth resisting pressure to reveal certain information about users absent a formal legal request, such as which third-party VPN services were used by some account-holders to access Twitter.\n\nYoel Roth Patrick Farrell/Knight Foundation\n\nRoth also shut down a request that the company share more of its data with intelligence officials.\n\nOthers within Twitter noted the US government’s interest in Twitter’s data and urged colleagues to “stay connected and keep a solid front against these efforts.”\n\nConservative critics continue to blame Roth for Twitter’s suppression of the laptop story, but he insists he didn’t make the final call and says he thought it was a mistake. “It is widely reported that I personally directed the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story,” Roth said last month. “It is absolutely, unequivocally untrue.”\n\nExactly who in Twitter’s leadership ultimately made the call to block the story remains unclear.\n\nIn December 2020, Roth gave a sworn declaration to the Federal Election Commission saying the government had warned of expected hack-and-leak incidents targeting people associated with political campaigns. Roth said that he learned in the meetings with government agencies there were “rumors that a hack-and-leak operation would involve Hunter Biden.”\n\nRoth did not point to the government as the source of the rumor, but his claim that law enforcement agencies gave general warnings about disinformation campaigns dovetails with recent testimony from Chan, the FBI agent who played a key role in the meetings.\n\nChan was deposed this year as part of a lawsuit brought by the Missouri attorney general alleging government censorship of social media. Chan disputed that the government told social media companies to “expect” hack-and-leak campaigns, saying that it would have only warned companies it was a possibility.\n\nThat Hunter Biden might be the target of a hack-and-leak operation was being publicly discussed at the time, after it emerged that Burisma Holdings, a company he worked with in Ukraine had reportedly been hacked by Russian military intelligence early in 2020.\n\nChan also testified that government agents never raised Hunter Biden specifically, and that his name came up only when a Facebook analyst asked specifically for relevant information. An FBI agent in the meeting declined to answer, Chan recalled, adding that she was likely not authorized to address the question because at the time the FBI had not publicly confirmed its Hunter Biden investigation.", "authors": ["Evan Perez Donie O'Sullivan Brian Fung", "Evan Perez", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}]}

The department said that these modifications will ensure that Alaska will have the incentive to vigorously compete with American as Virgin does today.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department’s Antitrust Division filed a civil antitrust lawsuit today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block the merger, along with a proposed settlement that, if approved by the court, would resolve the competitive harm alleged in the lawsuit. The merger of Alaska and Virgin would combine the nation’s sixth- and ninth-largest airlines, respectively, to create the fifth-largest U.S. carrier.\n\n“Smaller airlines, such as Alaska and Virgin, provide a critical competitive check on the larger carriers,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Renata Hesse of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “Although this merger offers hope that a strengthened Alaska can be an even stronger competitor than before, because of Alaska’s extensive codeshare agreement with the world’s largest airline, the merger threatened to blunt important competition and reduce choices for consumers. Today’s settlement ensures that Alaska has the incentive to take the fight to American and use Virgin’s assets to grow its network in ways that benefit competition and consumers.”\n\nAlaska and Virgin have both tended to offer lower prices and better service than the larger airlines. However, the complaint alleges that the codeshare agreement, which currently allows Alaska to market American flights on over 250 routes, creates incentives for Alaska to compete less aggressively on routes both carriers serve and to forgo launching new service in competition with American. As a result of these incentives, the complaint alleges that Alaska and American often behave more like partners than competitors.\n\nIn contrast to Alaska, Virgin – which has a network that extensively overlaps with American’s network – has competed aggressively with American. In particular, Virgin has vigorously competed with American on 20 nonstop routes served by both airlines. This competition has forced American to offer consumers lower prices and better service on some of the most traveled routes in the country. According to the complaint, the significant head-to-head competition between Virgin and American on these routes is due in part to the fact that Virgin holds essential and scarce assets, including airport gates and takeoff and landing rights known as “slots,” at key American strongholds. Virgin acquired some of these assets, including gates at Dallas Love Field Airport and slots at Washington Reagan National Airport and New York’s LaGuardia Airport, as part of the settlement of the department’s lawsuit challenging the 2013 merger of American and US Airways. The complaint alleges that the extensive codeshare relationship between Alaska and American would cause Alaska to compete less vigorously with American than does Virgin today, resulting in lower quality service and/or higher prices on the routes where Virgin and American currently compete. The complaint also alleges that the codeshare would make Alaska less likely than Virgin to launch new service in direct competition with American.\n\nTo address the transaction’s likely competitive harm, the proposed settlement requires Alaska to significantly reduce the scope of the codeshare agreement. Specifically, in order to reduce Alaska’s overall dependence on the codeshare and limit Alaska’s incentives to cooperate with American, the proposed settlement prohibits Alaska and American from codesharing on routes where Virgin and American compete today and on routes where Alaska would otherwise be likely to launch new service in competition with American following the merger. At the same time, the settlement permits Alaska and American to continue codesharing in limited circumstances where it is unlikely to lead to competitive harm and may offer some benefits to consumers. For example, the settlement would permit either airline to rely on the codeshare to serve destinations it would otherwise be unlikely to serve on its own in the near term. The department explained that this last type of codesharing can potentially benefit consumers by extending each carrier’s network and is less likely to lead to anticompetitive harm.\n\nTo preserve the competitive benefits brought about by the divestures to Virgin as part of the American-US Airways settlement, the proposed settlement requires Alaska to obtain the department’s approval before selling or leasing any of the gates or slots that were divested to Virgin and expressly prohibits Alaska from transferring any interest in the assets to American. This requirement ensures that American does not directly or indirectly regain control of the assets it divested to Virgin to settle the department’s challenge to the American-US Airways merger.\n\nAlaska is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Seattle. Last year, Alaska flew over 31 million passengers to approximately 112 locations worldwide, taking in more than $5.5 billion in revenue.\n\nVirgin is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Burlingame, California. Last year, Virgin flew over 7 million passengers to approximately 24 locations worldwide, taking in more than $1.5 billion in revenue. Virgin is one of several entities bearing the “Virgin” name pursuant to a licensing agreement with the Virgin Group, which owns approximately 18 percent of Virgin’s outstanding voting common stock. Although other airlines, such as Virgin Atlantic Airways, bear the Virgin name, they operate separately from Virgin America.\n\nAs required by the Tunney Act, the proposed settlement, along with the department’s competitive impact statement, will be published in the Federal Register. Any person may submit written comments concerning the proposed settlement within 60 days of its publication to Kathleen O’Neill, Chief, Transportation, Energy, and Agriculture Section, Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Suite 8000, Washington, D.C. 20530. At the conclusion of the 60-day comment period, the court may enter the final judgment upon a finding that it serves the public interest.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2016/12/14/alaska-air-begins-merger-virgin-america-promises-more-love/95415036/", "title": "Alaska Air begins merger with Virgin America, promises 'more to love'", "text": "Harriet Baskas\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- Alaska Air Group celebrated closing on its acquisition of San Francisco-based Virgin America on Wednesday, a move that came just a week since the U.S. Justice Department gave its go-ahead. The company marked the occasion by unveiling a specially painted Boeing 737-900ER that features elements of each carrier's brand.\n\nThe plane, painted in a commemorative red, purple and blue livery with the slogan “More to love,” flew from Seattle to San Francisco International Airport on Wednesday. Upon arrival, Alaska Air leaders joined more than 200 employees from Virgin America, Alaska Airlines and its sister airline, Horizon Air, to explain how what is now the fifth largest U.S. airline will operate.\n\n“Alaska Airlines and Virgin America are different airlines, but we believe different works – and we’re confident fliers will agree,” Brad Tilden, Alaska Air CEO, said in a statement. “The two airlines may look different, but our core customer and employee focus is very much the same.”\n\nBoth airlines are well-liked, but share very different corporate identities, something that was not lost on employees on the special charter flight.\n\n\"Alaska has more of a reputation of being the sweet nice aunt and Virgin has the reputation of being young, and spunky and a little salty,\" Lucy Lafayette, an Alaska Airlines accounting employee, said from onboard the plane. \"You can make a good combo of both of those things and I think both of us will come out better in the end.\"\n\nBOOKMARK: Bookmark Today in the Sky homepage for your daily fix of aviation news\n\n\n\n\n\nEven Alaska Airlines officials acknowledged the formidable cool factor that Virgin America has so successfully been able to cultivate.\n\n“I think we have a lot to learn about how Virgin America brings in that ‘cool’ factor up, but I think Alaska is going to do cool in its own way,\" Sangita Woerner, Alaska's VP of marketing, said to Today in the Sky. \"It’s about learning from each other and increasing the love we have but in our own authentic and genuine way.”\n\nVirgin America brand stays - for now\n\nThe combined operation creates an expanded route network with nearly 1,200 daily flights to 118 destinations in the United States, Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica and Cuba. For now, Alaska Air plans to continue operating the Virgin America fleet with its current name and “with no immediate changes to the onboard product or experience,” the company said in a statement.\n\n“We appreciate that there is great interest in the future of the Virgin America brand among customers and employees alike,” said Tilden, “This is a big decision and one that deserves months of thoughtful and thorough analysis. We plan to make a decision about the Virgin America brand early next year.”\n\nFrequent-flier plans, new routes, free tickets and leadership changes\n\nPromising “the most customer-friendly merger ever,” with “much more to announce over the coming weeks,” Alaska Air said on Wednesday that:\n\n• Starting Dec. 19, customers will be able to purchase Virgin America tickets at alaskaair.com. Virgin America tickets will also continue to be available for sale at virginamerica.com for the time being.\n\n• Also beginning Dec. 19, Virgin America Elevate members and Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan members will be able to earn reciprocal rewards on each other’s flights and Elite members will receive priority check-in and priority boarding on each other’s flights as well.\n\n• Beginning Jan. 9, Alaska Airlines will ask Virgin America Elevate members to open new (Alaska Airlines) Mileage Plan accounts.\n\n• Starting summer 2017, the carrier will offer new daily flights from its San Francisco hub to Orlando (daily), Minneapolis/St. Paul (twice daily) and Orange County, Calif. (four times daily), with tickets available for purchase Dec. 21.\n\n• To celebrate the airlines’ combined nearly 1,200 daily flights, the company will give away 1,200 round-trip flights starting today at twogether.differentworks.com.\n\nOfficials said customers should not worry about losing their points or miles with either carrier.\n\n“We have no intention to have miles expire,\" Andrew Harrison, Alaska Air's chief commercial officer, said to Today in the Sky. \"Especially now, we have this great opportunity to introduce many new people to the new airline and so we’re more than happy to have people hold onto their miles and use them when they need to.\"\n\n\"Down the road we’re only going to have one program, he added. \"The Elevate miles program will fold into the Mileage Plan program. They won’t expire but will turn into Alaska miles. But we’re not going to have anyone’s Elevate points expire.\"\n\nIn terms of leadership for the new combined operation, it will be led by Alaska Air CEO Brad Tilden. Ben Minicucci, Alaska Air's chief operating officer, will service at the CEO of the Virgin America unit. Peter Hunt, who was Virgin America’s senior vice president and chief financial officer, will become president of the Virgin America subsidiary.\n\nThe Alaska Air Group said it will spend the next year working on getting the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification that will allow the two airlines to operate as a single carrier, and that regional sister carrier, Horizon Air, will remain on its own with a separate operating certificate.\n\nHarriet Baskas is a Seattle-based airports and aviation writer and USA TODAY Travel's \"At the Airport\" columnist.

In the wake of the Justice decision, Alaska Air said it plans to close the transaction \"in the very near future,\" though it noted a lawsuit filed by private plaintiffs in U.S. District Court in San Francisco could affect the timing. That lawsuit, which would block the merger, is unlikely to succeed, most industry observers believe.\n\n\"We remain confident in the merits of this transaction,\" Tilden said in Alaska Air's statement.\n\nAlaska Air advised customers of each airline that until after the deal closes, it remains \"business as usual ... for fliers traveling on Alaska Airlines and Virgin America. You should interact with either airline as you normally would.\"\n\nCurrently, Alaska is the USA's sixth-biggest airline while California-based Virgin America is No. 8. Together, they would become the fifth-biggest in the nation and would become a dominant player along the West Coast. Alaska Airlines' biggest hubs are in Seattle and Portland, Ore., though it has several focus cities in California and in its namesake state. Virgin America operates large bases in San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nWhile no concessions were needed from Justice to proceed with the acquistion, Alaska Air did agree to walk back its \"codeshare\" passenger-sharing agreement with partner American Airlines. Alaska said it would “implement limited changes\" to the pact. In simplest terms, codesharing pacts allow partner airlines to place their two-letter airport codes and sell seats on each other's flights.\n\nAlaska Air's 'Space Bins' come amid broader cabin upgrades\n\nHowever, while Alaska Air said it agreed to a \"limited\" change, Justice described a broader concession. The agency said its \"proposed settlement requires Alaska to significantly reduce the scope of the codeshare agreement\" with American.\n\nJustice continued, saying the agreement \"prohibits Alaska and American from codesharing on routes where Virgin and American compete today and on routes where Alaska would otherwise be likely to launch new service in competition with American following the merger.\"\n\nTo win the government's approval, Alaska will stop selling seats on American Airlines flights — a so-called code-sharing agreement — on 45 routes. Alaska said the concession will cost it between $15 million and $20 million a year in revenue assuming it gets many of those customers back on Alaska planes.\n\nAlaska gets $320 million, or 6% of its revenue, from code-sharing, according to The Associated Press. Of that, $190 million comes from American, $65 million from Delta Air Lines, and another $65 million from other carriers. Alaska Air has codeshare ties with a large number of carriers, though its relationship with Delta has frayed in recent years amid a turf war over Alaska Air's hometown of Seattle.\n\nBloomberg News adds American \"expects to remove its airline code from about 20 of the more than 80 Alaska Air routes in the codeshare relationship.\"\n\nThe number of flights being pulled from the codeshare deal would indicate a concession that seems to fall somewhere between the \"limited\" phrasing used by Alaska and the \"significant\" terminology used by Justice.\n\nRegardless, Justice said limiting the codeshare pact between the two would benefit consumers.\n\n“Although this merger offers hope that a strengthened Alaska can be an even stronger competitor than before, because of Alaska’s extensive codeshare agreement with the world’s largest airline, the merger threatened to blunt important competition and reduce choices for consumers,\" Renata Hesse, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, said in a statement. \"Today’s settlement ensures that Alaska has the incentive to take the fight to American and use Virgin’s assets to grow its network in ways that benefit competition and consumers.”\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen, The Associated Press.\n\nTWITTER: You can follow Today in the Sky editor Ben Mutzabaugh at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky\n\nIN PICTURES: Alaska Airlines unveils makeover for logo, airplanes", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2017/05/09/united-alaska-air-turf-war-united-expands-18-san-francisco-routes/101462226/", "title": "United-Alaska Air turf war?

Delta, Alaska Air to terminate partnership", "text": "Ben Mutzabaugh\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDelta Air Lines and Alaska Airlines were once close partners. But their relationship has deteriorated in recent years, largely the result of a turf war that sprung out of Delta’s move to build up its own hub in Alaska Air’s hometown of Seattle.\n\nNow, the carriers have confirmed on Monday what many thought had become inevitable. Delta and Alaska airlines will officially terminate their frequent-flier and codeshare partnerships at the end of April.\n\nThe companies revealed the news in nearly simultaneous announcements Monday morning, saying their codesharing and frequent-flier partnerships would end April 30. Each carrier spelled out on their websites how the change would affect their customers (Delta | Alaska Air).\n\nThe relationship between Delta and Alaska Air once had been among the closest between two U.S. airlines. Their codesharing deal had allowed the airlines to place their two-letter code and sell seats on some of each other’s flights. Alaska Air and Delta also had a frequent-flier partnership that allowed their frequent-flier members to earn and redeem miles on either carrier’s flights.\n\nThose pacts helped Alaska Air to feed domestic passengers onto Delta’s overseas flights, and Delta to connect its international passengers to other U.S. destinations via Alaska Air's Seattle hub. That allowed Delta to grow its international operation from Seattle -- especially on routes across the Pacific. Eventually, however, Delta began building its own hub at Seattle, where Alaska Air has long been the city’s top carrier. Many of Delta’s new routes began to compete head-to-head with Alaska Air, including on some of Alaska Air’s bread-and-butter routes -- such as those between Seattle and California and Seattle and Alaska.\n\nAs the Delta-Alaska relationship grew frostier, one local media outlet went so far as to call the partners \"frenemies.\"\n\nSeattle breaks another passenger record amid Delta-Alaska turf war\n\nIn announcing the end of its tie-up with Delta, Alaska Air also touted several upgrades to its frequent-flier program, already one of the most flexible among U.S. airlines.\n\nIn that announcement, Alaska Air reminded customers that -- starting Monday (Dec. 19) -- they can now earn Alaska Air mileage for flights on merger partner Virgin America and vice versa. Alaska Air closed on its acquisition of California-based Virgin America just last week in a deal that will make Alaska Air one of the dominant carriers on the West Coast.\n\nAlso in its announcement, Alaska Air revealed it would reduce award-ticket mileage thresholds to as low as 5,000 miles for short-haul one-way award tickets. Starting award prices for longer trips also have been reduced, the airline said. Additionally, Alaska Air it increased the number of miles its frequent fliers earn on many tickets booked on its roster of partners, which includes British Airways, Cathay Pacific and Emirates, among others. Alaska Air said first- and business-class tickets bought on those partners would return as much as 80% more miles as compared to previous award charts. And Alaska Air said it would make all of its elite-level frequent-fliers eligible for complimentary upgrades on mileage award tickets when flying on Alaska-operated flights.\n\nAlaska Air begins merger with Virgin America, promises 'more to love'\n\nAs for Delta, it said in its statement that it would “continue its commitment of investment and growth in the Pacific Northwest following a decision by Delta and Alaska Airlines to end their partnership.”\n\nBut the Atlanta-based carrier also conveyed an amicable tone, saying “the decision is a positive milestone for both airlines as Alaska focuses on its merger integration with Virgin America and Delta focuses on creating more customer choice at its Seattle-Tacoma International Airport hub.”\n\nTWITTER: You can follow Today in the Sky editor Ben Mutzabaugh at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky\n\nIN PICTURES: Behind the scenes at Delta Air Lines\n\nIN PICTURES: Alaska Airlines, Virgin America begin merger process\n\nIN PICTURES: Alaska Airlines, Virgin America kick off merger with celebration", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/todayinthesky/2017/03/22/alaska-air-virgin-america-name-disappear-likely-2019/99517234/", "title": "Virgin America name will be phased out in favor of Alaska Air, 'likely ...", "text": "Ben Mutzabaugh\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAlaska Airlines’ name will live on; Virgin America’s will not.\n\nAlaska Airlines announced Wednesday it will drop the name and logo of the merger partner it acquired late last year. Virgin America will be phased out, “likely sometime in 2019,” Alaska Air said in a statement.\n\nInstead, the combined carrier “will adopt many of the brand elements that Virgin America enthusiasts love,” according to Alaska Air's statement. The company referenced “enhanced in-flight entertainment, mood lighting (and) music” as some of Virgin America’s signature items it will try to incorporate into the post-merger carrier.\n\n“The goal is to create a warm and welcoming West Coast-inspired vibe,” Alaska Airlines said.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY (December 2016): Alaska Air begins merger with Virgin America, promises 'more to love' (story continues below)\n\n\"Our goal from the very beginning of this merger was to become the go-to airline for people on the West Coast, with low fares, convenient flights, a premium product and genuine, caring service,\" Alaska Air CEO Brad Tilden added in the company's statement. \"Three months in, we've dramatically grown our presence in California and are united behind a new purpose: Creating an airline people love.\"\n\nAlaska Airlines and Virgin America each enjoy strong customer-service ratings, regularly faring well in ratings of the top U.S. airlines.\n\nLast summer, Tilden kept the hopes of Virgin America loyalists alive when he said Alaska Air was considering whether the Virgin America brand might live on after the merger.\n\n\"We are looking at that because we do believe in the power of the Virgin America brand and we don't want to lose all that loyalty and revenue that exists today,\" Tilden told The Associated Press then.\n\nAlas, that was not to be.\n\n“While the Virgin America name is beloved to many, we concluded that to be successful on the West Coast we had to do so under one name — for consistency and efficiency, and to allow us to continue to deliver low fares,\" Sangita Woerner, Alaska’s vice president of marketing, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nBut while Alaska Air said it would sunset the Virgin America brand, it also detailed changes to come as the merger progresses. Among those:\n\n- More first-class seats: Alaska Air says it will expand first class from eight to 12 seats on Virgin America's Airbus fleet, though that means that amount of space will shrink for those first-class fliers. Prior to the merger, Alaska Airlines' mainline fleet consisted solely of Boeing 737 aircraft. Virgin America flies only Airbus planes.\n\n- Alaska Airlines will roll out its new \"Premium Class\" extra-room economy seats to Virgin America's Airbus fleet beginning in late 2018.\n\n- Alaska Airlines says it will roll out \"an entirely redesigned cabin with new seats and amenities\" starting in 2018. New employee uniforms are expected to come in 2019.\n\n- As for the fate of Virgin America's Airbus jets, that remains uncertain. Alaska Air tells CNN that a decision on whether to stick with Boeing or move to a mixed mainline fleet would be made later this year. \"Either way, the company will fly a mixed fleet for at least the next 6 years,\" an Alaska Air spokeswoman said to the network.

Alaska Airlines also finished No. 1 in the most recent Airline Quality Rating report that’s issued jointly by the Wichita State and Embry Riddle universities. And Alaska Airlines was the No. 2-ranked U.S. carrier for 2017 in the annual World Airline Awards from Skytrax. Globally, Alaska Airlines ranked No. 36 in the Skytrax rankings, which give the U.S. edge in the Delta (32nd globally). And, in yet another of the airline ratings, Alaska Airlines finished third in the 2017 rankings from Travel + Leisure magazine. Virgin America finished No. 1 there.\n\nAs you would expect, Alaska Airlines lauded its finish in The Points Guy's ratings.\n\n“This award is a credit to our amazing, kind-hearted people who provide genuine, caring service for our guests every day,” Ben Minicucci, Alaska’s chief operating officer, said in The Points Guy’s statement. “We're focused on creating an airline people love, so even when things don’t go perfectly, our people are empowered to make things right. Sometimes that makes all the difference.”\n\nOne possible surprise in the ratings might the relatively high placing for Frontier, an airline that typically fares poorly in such ratings.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: Delta shows off new 'flagship' Airbus A350 in Atlanta (story continues below)\n\nThe Points Guy said Frontier benefited from a change in scoring methodology and from “noticeable improvements in mishandled baggage” and an expanding route network.\n\nAnother surprise could be at the bottom with Hawaiian Airlines, a carrier typically scores well in most service critiques. The Points Guy acknowledged that, saying “some people might think it odd to find Hawaiian Airlines in last place.”\n\n“The primary reason is that our study puts a lot of weight on both airfare and the size of an airline’s route network, and Hawaiian doesn’t do well in either of those areas,” The Points Guy said. “(O)ne could argue it’s not fair to penalize the carrier for the fact that it’s focused on a specific region. But even a theoretically ‘perfect’ airline that was the most comfortable in the world with the greatest customer service and best on-time arrival rate wouldn’t rank that highly to most people if it didn’t fly to where the average customer needs to go.”\n\nScroll down for the overall rankings:\n\n1.

Alaska Airlines flies from DFW to its hubs in Seattle and Portland, Ore.\n\nBy 2019, Alaska Airlines said it plans to have the two airlines fly under one name -- Alaska Airlines.\n\nAt Love Field, Minicucci told Bloomberg the carrier could tweak its route map as the merger continues, though he didn’t appear to suggest any changes were imminent.\n\nTODAY IN THE SKY: It's official: Virgin America to get Dallas Love gates (2014) | Delta survives eviction attempt at Dallas Love Field (again)\n\nRegardless, Alaska Airlines will go up against two dominant competitors at each of the Dallas-area airports.\n\nAt DFW, American Airlines is by far the dominant airline at the airport, which is its busiest hub. At Love Field, Southwest controls 18 of the airport’s 20 gates and is currently in the process of trying to bar Delta Air Lines – the only other carrier besides Virgin America currently flying from that airport – from using its gate space there. That move would essentially evict Delta from Love Field.\n\nTWITTER: You can follow Today in the Sky editor Ben Mutzabaugh at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/07"}]}

The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.\n\nWith inflation hitting a 40-year high in the United States, working families are swimming ever faster in the effort to stay afloat. But the water just keeps rising, as mostly stagnant wages are also rapidly losing value.\n\nThe federal minimum wage has lost at least 21% of its value since Congress last raised it in 2009. This has become an emergency for the millions of workers who earn less than $15 an hour and are finding it impossible to trim other costs enough to still be able to put food on the table and fill the tank.\n\nAccording to new research released by Oxfam, roughly 32% of workers in the US earn less than $15 an hour. Nearly 52 million people are trying to make it on less than $31,200 a year, or $2,600 a month before taxes.\n\nThis is not right, nor is it viable — not for working families, for the economy or for communities. We can’t keep an economy going if people can’t pay the rent and drive to work. That’s why Congress must pass the Raise the Wage Act of 2021, which would gradually increase the wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 by 2025 and would tie increases to median wage growth over time.\n\nIn truth, this a civil rights crisis, as the people most impacted by low wages are historically marginalized populations: women and people of color. Not only did these workers get hit harder, longer and deeper by the pandemic, they’ve been watching their wages buy less each day, as they account for a vastly disproportionate share of the low-wage workforce — 40% of women versus 25% of men. Half of all women of color earn under $15 per hour versus a quarter of all men. And while 26% of White workers earn less than $15 an hour, 46% of Hispanic/Latinx workers and 47% of Black workers earn less than $15 per hour. These are the people suffering the worst sticker shock at the grocery store and the gas pump, choosing between rent and utilities.\n\nWhat’s more, federal law still allows US employers to pay subminimum wages to nearly a million workers. The Raise the Wage Act would fix that, prohibiting anyone from being paid less than the federal minimum wage.\n\nThis is a solution that is long overdue, as it has been almost 13 years since the wage was increased. It’s also common sense: The pandemic filled the coffers of corporations, which made record profits, and created many more millionaires and billionaires. Why are we refusing to mandate that the people who do the work, who are responsible for productivity and profitability, get a slightly fairer share of the rewards?\n\nPeople are hurting not because prices are rising, but because we have built a system that enables employers to exploit workers so a few can cash in. We should be focusing more on threadbare incomes than on prices. We can fix it, and we must.", "authors": ["Opinion Gina Cummings For Cnn Business Perspectives"], "publish_date": "2022/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/11/12/state-lowest-and-highest-minimum-wage/10627028002/", "title": "What state has the lowest minimum wage?

It's all thanks to state law, critics say\n\nLoans too good to be true? In a financial bind? Don't let desperation lead you to a predatory loan, experts advise\n\n“The movement to raise wages continues to gain momentum,” said Yannet Lathrop, NELP’s senior researcher and policy analyst.\n\nHow does inflation affect the minimum wage?\n\nTypically, the annual minimum wage hikes dole out the largest increases to workers in states or localities taking a step in a planned series of bumps over several years.\n\nOther states nudge up their pay floors by small amounts, perhaps 20 cents to 50 cents an hour, because they’re indexed to annual inflation, which has averaged 1% to 2% for most of the past dozen years.\n\nBut inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) began to soar in spring 2021 as the U.S. economy reopened after the pandemic, reaching a 40-year high of 9.1% this past June before easing to a still elevated 7.1% in November.\n\nAs a result, many of the 11 states and 31 cities and counties enacting CPI-triggered minimum wage increases around New Year’s Day will be handing workers significant pay increases.\n\nThe minimum wage will climb from $12.80 to $13.85 in Arizona; from $12.56 to $13.65 in Colorado; and from $12.75 to $13.80 in Maine, all gains of more than 8% based on the CPI increase in those regions.\n\nIn Seattle, base pay will jump from $17.27 to $18.69 for most workers, the highest among localities, because of inflation indexing.\n\nRather than providing workers a financial windfall, the increases will simply allow them to keep up with surging prices, Lathrop says.\n\n“It will help workers at least maintain a minimum living standard,” Lathrop says. “It will prevent people from having to make tough decisions,” such as whether to buy food or medicine.\n\nOther states are providing a healthy raise as part of a several-step increase in the minimum wage. The pay floor will rise from $10.50 to $11.75 in Delaware; from $12 to $13 in Illinois; and from $11 to $12 in Virginia.\n\nNebraska, a Republican-controlled state, hasn’t lifted its minimum wage since 2014, Lathrop notes. But on New Year’s Day, the Cornhusker State will increase its base pay from $9 to $10.50 in the first of a series of steps that will bring it to $15 by 2026. Voters approved a ballot initiative last month.\n\nMinimum wage in every state:Somewhere between $5.15 and $16 an hour: What is your state's minimum wage?\n\nWhat states have a $15 minimum wage?\n\nMore states are joining the rapidly spreading $15-an-hour club. On Jan. 1, pay floors will increase to $15 from $14.25 in Massachusetts and to $15.74 from $14.49 in Washington State. In July, Connecticut will expand the contingent to five states as its pay floor rises to $15 from $14.\n\nBy 2026, another eight states will join the $15 faction – Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Virginia and Nebraska. Hawaii will get there by 2028. That’s a total 14 states with about 41% of the U.S. workforce at or heading to $15 an hour.\n\nAnother 36 localities – including more than two dozen in California, along with Denver, Minneapolis and Seattle – are already at $15 and set to hurtle beyond it in less than two weeks.\n\nRecall alert:140,000 Chevrolet Bolt electric cars recalled to fix seat belt issue that can cause fires\n\nProduct recalls ignored?:Do you have a recalled toy under the tree? Some are still being sold. Here's where\n\nThe $15 threshold was widely considered a pipe dream when Fight for $15, an alliance of fast-food and other low-paid workers, began demanding it as part of walkouts across the country that launched in 2012.\n\n“$15 is still a very important target rate,” Lathrop says. “It’s a bare minimum baseline.”\n\nHow does the minimum wage affect inflation?\n\nMany restaurants and other businesses employing low-wage workers disagree. They argue that sharp minimum wage increases will only intensify inflation as employers raise prices to offset higher labor costs.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has noted that inflation for goods like furniture and used cars has been moderating, but not for service businesses like restaurants whose labor costs make up the lion’s share of their expenses.\n\nThose price increases, he said, must ease before the Fed pauses an aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes that has increased consumer borrowing costs and hammered stocks.\n\n“Powell is right,” says Michael Saltsman, managing director of the Employment Policies Institute, which is backed by the restaurant industry. “An extreme wage mandate makes bad economic sense in any environment. Right now, it’s insane to move ahead with it. Business owners, and small restaurants in particular, will pay the price.\"\n\nBut Dante DeAntonio, an economist at Moody’s Analytics, says minimum wage workers make up a relatively small share of the workforce and their pay increases probably have little effect on inflation overall, especially considering strong U.S. wage growth the past two years.\n\n“I’m not sure this really adds that much fuel to the fire,” DeAntonio says.\n\nWhat is the impact of raising the minimum wage?\n\nThe state minimum wage increases around New Year’s Day will affect 3.4 million workers now earning base pay and another 5.4 million who make somewhat more but will benefit from ripple effects within a business, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. The figures don't include city and county minimum wage increases.\n\nMeanwhile, private-sector wages and salaries broadly increased a robust 5.2% annually in the third quarter, according to the Labor Department’s Employment Cost Index.\n\nWhat is the US federal minimum wage?\n\nThe minimum wage increases come as the federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009 as Republicans in Congress repeatedly blockedg efforts to raise it.\n\nAbout 30 states with more than 60% of the U.S. workforce have higher pay floors than the federal government’s.\n\nAlso, dozens of companies have raised their entry-level wages to $15, including Target, Best Buy, Amazon, Costco and Southwest Airlines.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/10/23/what-state-has-highest-minimum-wage/8171140001/", "title": "What state has the highest minimum wage?

Twenty-one states and 41 cities and counties will raise their minimum wages on or about Jan. 1, with many looking toward a $15 hourly pay floor.\n\nDemocratic members of Congress proposed raising the federal minimum hourly wage last year, advocating for today’s $7.25 an hour to increase to $15 by 2025.\n\nThe bill also proposes increased wages for tipped, newly hired and young employees as well as individuals with disabilities, who are often subject to a separate, lower minimum wage.\n\nMinimum wage is going up in these states:Is yours one of them?\n\nWhat state has the highest minimum wage?\n\nWashington, D.C. boasts the nation’s highest minimum wage at $16.10 an hour, according to the Department of Labor. But if we’re getting technical, the northwest state of Washington has the highest consolidated state minimum wage in the U.S. at $14.49 an hour. Some Californians also enjoy a minimum wage of $15 per hour, though employees with 25 or fewer employees are exempt and can pay a $14 hourly rate.\n\nWashington will maintain its top spot come the new year, when minimum wage will be $15.74 per hour. California's minimum wage will also raise in January 2023, becoming $15.50 per hour for all employees.\n\nParts of New York also have a $15 per hour minimum wage, including New York City and Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester counties.\n\nBut high minimum wages usually go hand-in-hand with high living expenses. In D.C. the cost of living is about 59% above the U.S. average, and in Manhattan it’s around 138%, a Kiplinger analysis of a Cost of Living Index found.\n\nWhat state has the lowest minimum wage?\n\nWhile the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, two states have minimum wages lower than that. Wyoming and Georgia both have basic minimum hourly rates of $5.15.\n\nGeorgia employers who are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act must pay employees the federal minimum wage. According to Georgia Legal Aid, employers whose annual sales are $500,000 or more or who are engaged in interstate commerce must follow the FLSA.\n\nThe same is true in Wyoming. In both states, those who fall under exceptions to FLSA may be paid less than federal minimum wage. These exceptions include farm and seasonal workers, informal workers like babysitters, newspaper deliverers, tipped employees (who receive a special tipped minimum wage), minors, full time students, employees with disabilities and certain minimum wage exempt organizations.\n\nFive states — Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee — have no minimum wage required and default to the federal minimum wage.

The increases account for more than $5 billion in pay boosts for an estimated 8.4 million workers, the Economic Policy Institute estimates.\n\nAdditionally, nearly 30 cities and counties across the US will increase their minimum wage, according to the EPI, a left-leaning think tank.\n\nThe larger-than-typical increases for a dozen states come after inflation hit a 40-year high this summer, leaving families struggling to keep up with the rising costs.\n\n“The fact that there’s high inflation really just underscores how necessary these minimum wage increases are for workers,” said Sebastian Martinez Hickey, a research assistant at the EPI. “Even before the pandemic, there was no county in the United States where you could affordably live as a single adult at $15 an hour.”\n\nThe pandemic and the subsequent period of economic recovery has further revealed the growing chasm in America’s wealth gap. During the past two years, working conditions and low pay contributed to a swelling of labor movement activity and actions by many large corporations to raise their wage floor.\n\nRaiseUpNY Coalition, including the Laborers Internation Union 79 and 32BJ SEIU, hold a rally at City Hall Park to fight for a higher minimum wage in Manhattan, New York, on November 15, 2022. Derek French/Shutterstock\n\nThe pandemic also led to a structural upheaval in the nation’s labor market, creating an imbalance of worker supply and demand that still persists. Employers have found themselves short of workers for most of the year, which has pushed up average annual hourly wages in the battle to recruit and retain staff. While some workers in competitive industries such as retail and dining have found their new salary outpaces inflation, most pay has been outpaced by rising prices.\n\n“The story is different because wages have been increasing at the low-end, much faster than inflation and much faster than in middle- or high-wage jobs,” said Michael Reich, economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley. “And that means that many workers, even in the $7.25 states, are already getting paid above the minimum wage.”\n\nIn other words, he said, the minimum wage “has become less and less binding.”\n\n“Even though minimum wages might go up by 7%, in many states and cities, labor costs aren’t going to go up anywhere as much as they have in the past, because they already have gone up,” he said. “That also means that prices aren’t going to go up at [places like] restaurants.”\n\nThe federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour hasn’t budged since 2009, and 20 states have a minimum wage either equal to or below the federal level, making $7.25 their default baseline. The value of the federal minimum wage peaked in 1968 when it was $1.60, which would be worth about $13.46 in 2022, based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator.\n\nStates with scheduled minimum wage increases on December 31, 2022, or January 1, 2023\n\nDelaware: $10.50 to $11.75\n\nIllinois: $12 to $13\n\nMaryland: $12.50 to $13.25\n\nMassachusetts: $14.25 to $15\n\nMichigan: $9.87 to $10.10\n\nMissouri: $11.15 to $12\n\nNebraska: $9 to $10.50\n\nNew Jersey: $13 to $14.13* (scheduled increase also includes inflation adjustment)\n\nNew Mexico: $11.50 to $12\n\nNew York: $13.20 to $14.20 (Upstate New York); $15 (in and around NYC)\n\nRhode Island: $12.25 to $13\n\nVirginia: $11 to $12\n\nCost of living increases of state minimum hourly wages:\n\nAlaska: $10.34 to $10.85\n\nArizona: $12.80 to $13.85\n\nCalifornia: $14.50 (firms with 25 or fewer employees) /$15 (firms with 26+ employees) to $15.50\n\nColorado: $12.56 to $13.65\n\nMaine: $12.75 to $13.80\n\nMinnesota: $8.42 to $8.63 (small employer); $10.33 to $10.59 (large employer)\n\nMontana: $9.20 to $9.95\n\nOhio: $9.30 to $10.10\n\nSouth Dakota: $9.95 to $10.80\n\nVermont: $12.55 to $13.18\n\nWashington: $14.49 to $15.74\n\nLater in 2023:\n\nConnecticut (effective July 1): $14 to $15\n\nFlorida (September 2023): $11 to $12\n\nNevada (effective July 1): $9.50 to $10.25 (firms that offer benefits); $10.50 to $11.25 (no benefits offered)\n\nOregon: $13.50 (effective July 1, indexed annual increase to be based on the CPI)\n\nSources: State websites, National Conference of State Legislatures, Economic Policy Institute", "authors": ["Alicia Wallace"], "publish_date": "2022/12/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/06/joe-biden-minimum-wage-hike-unlikely-covid-19-relief-package/4419484001/", "title": "Joe Biden says minimum wage hike unlikely to stay in COVID-19 relief", "text": "President Joe Biden says his proposal to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour is unlikely to make it into the final $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package after negotiations with Congress.\n\nBiden, who advocated for a minimum wage increase before the pandemic began, has pitched the idea as an effective way to help working-class Americans cope with the economic consequences of the crisis.\n\n\"No one should work 40 hours a week and live below the poverty wage.

Bobby Scott said, D-Va., chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee.\n\nAt the White House, press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden remains “firmly committed” to raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\n“He believes any American who is working a full-time job trying to make ends meet should not be at the poverty level, and it's important to him that the minimum wage is raised,” Psaki said.\n\nSome bipartisan concern over raising the minimum wage\n\nBiden advocated for raising the minimum wage during last year’s presidential campaign and has proposed boosting the hourly rate to $15 as part of his COVID-19-relief package.\n\nCongressional Republicans and others, however, have raised concerns about raising the minimum wage. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., a crucial swing vote in the Senate, also has said he opposes a $15 minimum wage, raising doubts about whether it can be increased through Biden's COVID-19-relief plan.\n\nBiden conceded late last week that the minimum wage proposal is unlikely to survive as part of his COVID-19 package.\n\n“Apparently, that’s not going to occur,” he said in an interview with \"CBS Evening News With Norah O’Donnell.\"\n\nBut Biden also told O’Donnell he is prepared to negotiate a separate proposal to boost the minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nSounding the alarm:Joe Biden calls women out of work, kids out of school a 'national emergency'\n\nIn its study, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that as many as 27 million Americans would see their pay increase if the minimum wage is raised to $15 an hour. Cumulative pay for those workers would jump by as much as $509 billion over the next 10 years, the report said.\n\nBut the pay increase also would mean increased labor costs for companies, the report said. Employers would pass some of those increased costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices, which could mean a decline in sales and services, the study said.\n\nIn the end, many companies will reduce their workforce or hire less, resulting in 1.4 million fewer jobs, the report said. Young, less educated people would account for a disproportionate share of the job reductions, the report concluded.\n\nRaising the minimum wage to $15 per hour also would balloon the federal deficit to $54 billion over the next decade, the report said.\n\nThe CBO’s projection of a 1.4 million decline in employment is based on an average estimate of the studies it reviewed. But Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, says the CBO gave equal weight to all the studies it assessed and should have placed more value on higher-quality studies.\n\n“The weight of the evidence finds a small to no employment effect,” she told reporters on a conference call.\n\nMichael Reich, a labor economist at the University of California, Berkeley, told reporters a minimum wage increase would have a small effect only on restaurant prices and it would not cause profits to fall.\n\nHow a raise could affect some government services\n\nCBO also found the minimum wage measure would increase federal revenue because low-paid workers would earn more and pay more taxes but that would be more than offset by higher government costs. For example, federal spending on Medicaid would rise because workers providing health care services would earn more and people who lose their jobs because of the minimum wage hike would become eligible for Medicaid.\n\nSocial Security outlays would increase because a higher-paid workforce would receive more benefits on average. And people who lose their jobs would file for Social Security earlier than otherwise.\n\nOther programs would become less costly, CBO says. Spending on food stamps and child nutrition programs would decline as a higher minimum wage reduces the number of low-income households receiving benefits and the average amount they receive.\n\nReich, however, says the CBO analysis doesn’t account for certain increased government revenue. Enticed by higher pay, many older Americans would work longer, saving $12.2 billion in Social Security fund costs.\n\nEmployer advocates, however, say the CBO study underscores their concerns.\n\n“The nonpartisan CBO confirms what we already know from economic research and real-world experience,” says Michael Saltsman, managing director of the Employment Policies Institute, the restaurant industry-financed group. “A $15 minimum wage is a terrible idea that will put economic recovery further out of reach for thousands of employers and employees.”\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who supports a higher minimum wage, challenged the report’s findings.\n\n“I find it hard to understand how the CBO concluded that raising the minimum wage would increase the deficit by $54 billion,” Sanders. “Two years ago, CBO concluded that a $15 minimum wage would increase the deficit by less than $1 million over 10 years.”\n\nFrances Holmes of Fight for $15, an advocacy group that supports raising the minimum wage, said the report underscores the need to boost workers’ pay.\n\n“Essential workers across the country are facing a crisis,” Holmes said. “We risk our lives at work every day during a pandemic because we can’t afford to miss a paycheck. … We don’t need excuses from our nation’s leaders. We need relief.”\n\nContributing: Nicholas Wu\n\nBarreling ahead:Days after talks with GOP senators, Biden signals he'll move ahead without them on COVID-19 relief bill", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/07/18/15-minimum-wage-slammed-business-groups-senate/1771364001/", "title": "Business groups slam House for passing $15 minimum wage bill", "text": "Marc Rod\n\nCNBC\n\nThe House of Representative’s decision to pass a bill raising the federal minimum wage to $15 received almost immediate criticism from major business organizations.\n\nThe groups say the bill, which the Democrat-controlled chamber passed in a 231-199 vote, would be expensive and lead to increased unemployment.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated raising the minimum wage to $15 could cost 1.3 million jobs but raise pay for 17 million\n\nThe House of Representative’s decision to pass a bill raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour received almost immediate criticism from major business organizations.\n\nThe groups say the bill, which the Democrat-controlled chamber passed in a 231-199 vote, would be expensive and lead to increased unemployment.\n\n“The House dealt a devastating blow to small businesses today, risking record growth, job creation, and already increasing wages,” Juanita Dugganin, president and CEO of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, said in a statement.

Shierholz is also former chief economist for the Department of Labor. Workers in smaller-scale manufacturing and day care are also impacted, said David Neumark, an economist at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nBut a national increase to $15 would likely affect a much wider swath of workers, especially in low-wage regions, according to Neumark.\n\n“If we really go to $15 ... the effects would be broader than what we’ve seen in the past,” Neumark said. In the South, half of the workforce could potentially be affected, in a much wider range of industries, he said.\n\nShierholz said that, despite the job losses the CBO predicted, the office’s analysis reflects that the benefits of raising wages would greatly outweigh the costs. She highlighted both the benefits for low-wage workers and businesses.\n\n“One of the things that a minimum wage does is get money in the pockets of people who are very likely to have little choice but to spend it,” Shierholz said. “Their wages go up, they’re going to spend the money, that boosts demand,” which helps industries broadly.\n\nJEDI:Trump to get involved with Pentagon's $10 billion contract as Amazon, Microsoft do battle\n\nBusinesses in favor of an increase\n\nAlthough major business organizations quickly came out to criticize the House’s move, some of the country’s largest businesses in impacted sectors are outliers on this issue.\n\nMcDonald’s stopped working with the National Restaurant Association to lobby against the wage hike in March, and the company came out in support of introducing the wage increase in all industries.\n\nAmazon raised its minimum wage to $15 for U.S. workers in October 2018.

Panera stands firmly by the safety of our products,\" it continued.\n\nPrior lawsuit filed over Panera Charged Lemonade\n\nFamily files lawsuit:Panera Bread's ‘Charged Lemonade’ being blamed for student's death\n\nThis is the second lawsuit accusing Panera of improperly labeling or informing customers of the contents of the Charged Lemonade drinks. A few months ago, the chain was hit with a similar filing after the family of Sarah Katz, a 21-year-old University of Pennsylvania student, claimed the college student's death in 2022 due to cardiac arrest was caused by the highly caffeinated drink and improper labeling.\n\nKatz had a heart condition called long QT syndrome type 1, which caused an irregular heart rhythm, so she avoided energy drinks. According to the lawsuit, a large Charged Lemonade has 390 mg of caffeine in it, far more than what can be found in drinks like Monster or Red Bull. Instead, it was advertised as a \"clean\" drink with the same amount of caffeine as a dark roast coffee.\n\nKatz drank the charged beverage \"reasonably confident it was a traditional lemonade and/or electrolyte sports drink containing a reasonable amount of caffeine safe for her to drink,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nPanera Bread changed the labeling on Charged Lemonade\n\nPanera later changed labels on the product after the first suit was filed, saying in a statement to NBC News they had \"enhanced our existing caffeine disclosure for these beverages\" out of \"an abundance of caution,\" adding that the company was \"saddened to learn this week about the tragic passing of Sarah Katz.\"\n\nThe chain's website advertises the \"charged sips\" under a menu section with a description reading, \"Naturally flavored, plant-based, and Clean with about as much caffeine as our Dark Roast coffee.\"\n\nClicking one of the three available flavors leads to a page with an image of the lemonade overlayed with a large \"contains caffeine\" sign at the bottom. The \"about\" section again says the drinks are, \"Naturally flavored, plant-based, with about as much CAFFEINE as our Dark Roast Coffee.\"\n\nFollowing this is an additional warning that reads: \"Use in moderation. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR children, people sensitive to caffeine, pregnant or nursing women.\"\n\nWhile ad material for the lemonades still compares the caffeine content to that of the brand's coffee, the nutrition information lists the \"regular\" lemonade size as having 260 milligrams of caffeine and the \"large\" as having 390 mg. The Katz lawsuit compared this to the listed 214 mg in the regular-sized dark roast coffee and 268mg in the large, noting the difference.\n\nReporting contributed by Sarah Al-Arshani, USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/06/energy-drinks-go-natural/2479993/", "title": "Energy drinks go natural as market buzzes along", "text": "Michael Hill\n\nAP Business Writer\n\nCompanies are releasing organic and natural energy drinks as demand for caffeinated drinks grows\n\nEnergy drink sales hit %2412.6 billion in 2012%2C a 14%25 jump from 2008\n\n%22Natural%22 drinks try to kick synthesized caffeine%2C artificial flavors %26 colors\n\nALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Energy drinks are busting out of the convenience store cooler and into the health food aisle.\n\nAs energy drink sales soar like a caffeine-fueled rocket, more drinks are promoting organic ingredients, added juices, natural caffeine and so-called \"clean\" energy. A jolt from Rockstar not your speed? There's the \"natural energy drink\" Guru, and Steaz Energy, which according to the can is \"good for the mind, body and soul.\" Or there's Runa's energy drink, made from something called Amazonian guayusa leaves.\n\nClaims of cleaner caffeine boosts come as energy drinks find themselves under increasing scrutiny, particularly for their effects on children and adolescents. The word \"organic\" in front of \"energy drink\" might seem as incompatible as yoga pants with a backward tractor cap, but analysts say that as the market for energy drinks grows, it's diversifying too.\n\n\"I think we're going to see more beverages that offer energy functionality, but in non-traditional energy drinks,\" says John Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest.\n\nEnergy drink sales hit $12.6 billion last year, representing a 14% jump from 2008, according to market research firm Packaged Facts. While Red Bull, Monster and Rockstar still dominate the U.S. market, part of the recent growth comes from new kinds of products, including diet and natural energy drinks. Even the big players are getting into the act. Campbell Soup Co.'s venerable V8 line of drinks now includes a canned V-Fusion + Energy drink made with juice and green tea. And Starbucks sells fruit-flavored Refreshers made with unroasted coffee beans.\n\n\"Because retailers are devoting more shelf space to energy drinks, there's always a battle among the competitors within the sector. So what you're seeing within the energy drink category is an innovation in products,\" says John Lennon, president of Xyience, which makes Xenergy energy drinks.\n\nBut with growth comes greater scrutiny.\n\nRegulators have been increasingly concerned about caffeinated products, particularly energy drinks. The Food and Drug Administration in April said it would investigate the safety of caffeine added to snacks and gum and its effects on children and adolescents. The FDA said last year it was investigating reports of deaths linked to energy drinks. The federal agency has said they would take action if they could link the deaths to consumption of the drinks, including forcing the companies to take the products off the market.\n\nAnd San Francisco's city attorney in May sued Monster Beverage for marketing its energy drinks to children. The lawsuit came after Monster sued City Attorney Dennis Herrera over his demands that the company reduce caffeine levels in its drinks and stop marketing to minors.\n\nAt least on face value, some of the natural drinks seem to be aiming for a different audience. Xenergy calls itself the \"energy drink of the health club, not the nightclub.\" The company expanded its line this year to include energy drinks with tea or lemonade.\n\nRay Jolicoeur, vice president of marketing for Guru, says consumers of his product, which has been available in the United States since 2005, tend to be slightly more mature and educated. The entrepreneurs behind Runa say they are not looking for people who want \"head throbbing, punched-in-the face energy\" like some other brands.\n\n\"Some of them went after adrenaline junkies, others went after NASCAR fans,\" says Runa co-founder Dan MacCombie. \"For us, it's just part of the people who are already … being careful about what they are putting into their bodies.\"\n\nRuna's energy drink hit the shelves recently around the country. It boasts its caffeine from the guayusa \"super leaf\" and supposedly provides as much caffeine as coffee with more anti-oxidants than green tea.\n\nThey join non-traditional energy drinks like Guru and Steaz, which share display space with the likes of aloe juice at Dean's Natural Foods in Albany. Owner Dean King said the drinks eliminate \"ridiculous stuff\" like artificial flavors and colors. The kick still comes from caffeine, but some consumers say it's different.\n\n\"You know how most caffeinated products you feel that surge come over you? And then you drop and you feel miserable? This is more of an alertness,\" says Cheryl Fairweather, a 36-year-old vegan and athlete from the Philadelphia area who drinks a daily can of Steaz at 4 a.m. before she trains.\n\n\"It doesn't have that overwhelming effect, like you're on edge,\" she says.\n\nIt's typical for the caffeine in natural energy drinks to come from organic and natural sources. But in the end, as Roland Griffiths, a professor of behavioral biology at Johns Hopkins University, notes, \"caffeine is caffeine.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter whether that compound is synthesized in a laboratory or is synthesized in a plant,\" he says. \"It's going to have identical pharmacological, subjective and behavioral effects.\"\n\nGuru says one 8.4-ounce can has 125 milligrams of \"naturally occurring\" caffeine. Steaz says a 12-ounce can of its energy drink contains 100 milligrams of caffeine from sustainably sourced ingredients. Ounce for ounce, that's in the ballpark of mainstream energy drinks, like Rockstar or Monster, which each deliver 160 milligrams of caffeine per 16-ounce can, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nutrition advocacy group.\n\nThe natural products generally do not make explicit health claims, opting instead to tout ingredients such as organic guarana or the lack of artificial colors. But Michael Jacobson, the executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, says words like \"natural\" and \"organic\" printed on a can make consumers assume the contents are good for you, even if that's not necessarily so.\n\n\"It implies that there's something helpful about them and it's totally vague,\" he says.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/07/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/30/business/save-tab-soda/index.html", "title": "Coke killed Tab soda. Meet the superfans trying to save it | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nIn October 2020, the moment Trish Priest had been dreading arrived: Tab, the decades-old diet drink, was being killed off by parent company Coca-Cola.\n\nWhat to some was a mere news blip was a crisis for Priest.\n\n“I lived in fear of it being discontinued for years,” she said. “When the notification came out that Coca-Cola was going to stop making it, I had people I hadn’t spoken to in 10 years call me to give me their condolences.”\n\nPriest drinks about three cans of Tabs a day, and has for as long as she can remember. “It is a central part of my life,” she said, and something she’s known for. “I’ve had [colleagues] decorate my office for a milestone birthday” with Tab-themed decorations, and “I drink Tab, water and wine.”\n\nPriest started stockpiling cases of Tab in 2020 when she realized the drink would soon be gone. She has 23 12-packs left, and she’s rationing her supply. She’ll hang onto the final case “for posterity.”\n\nBut Priest isn’t giving up without a fight. She’s hoping that with the help of fellow diehard fans, they’ll convince Coca-Cola to bring Tab back.\n\nTrish Priest in Tab gear. Courtesy Frank Byrum\n\nIt will be a tough battle, as Coca-Cola which has its reasons for killing Tab. The product was cut as part of a sweeping reduction of Coca-Cola’s beverage portfolio, announced in 2020. The reasoning was clear: The 200 brands on the chopping block — half of Coke’s portfolio — together made up just 2% of Coca-Cola’s total revenue, CEO James Quincey said. It just wasn’t worth it for to keep pouring resources into these flagging products.\n\n“It was a hard decision to discontinue TaB,” a company spokesperson told CNN Business. “In order to continue to innovate and give consumers the choices they want, we have to make tough choices about our portfolio.”\n\nThe spokesperson said that “there are no plans to bring [Tab] back.”\n\nTab fans think Coke made the wrong call. From where they sit, Tab sales were stilted because Coca-Cola neglected the brand, letting it linger without advertising for decades. They point out that even without ads, Tab fans have still sought out the product — imagine, they say, what some marketing could do. Plus, nostalgia is hot right now.\n\nIt may be hard to imagine a massive company like Coke giving in to a comparatively small fanbase of a forgotten brand. But it’s happened before.\n\nThe SaveTabSoda committee\n\nCoca-Cola announced in 2020 that it would discontinue Tab. Ramin Talaie/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nAdam Burbach noticed a flurry of activity online after Coke announced Tab’s demise. Across social channels, fans were mourning the product and wondering whether they could change Coca-Cola’s decision.\n\n“A lot of people [were] saying, we should do something,” he said. “The initial … thought behind the committee was coordinating efforts so that we had a single voice.”\n\nBurbach took action. He launched a full-blown campaign to bring back the soda along with a core group of fans, including Priest, that calls themselves the SaveTabSoda Committee. The group has coordinated call days, encouraging fans to bombard Coca-Cola’s customer service line with (polite) phone calls and to send notes to Coca-Cola’s leadership team.\n\n“We appreciate the passionate legion of Tab lovers who have reached out and who embraced the brand for nearly six decades,” the company spokesperson said.\n\nCoke’s top brass has taken notice: In an interview with CNN Business late last year, CEO James Quincey said he’s gotten “a lot of emails about Tab.”\n\nA petition to bring back Tab has garnered nearly 1,100 signatures, and the committee is currently raising money for billboards in Coke’s home city, Atlanta, that will blast its message to passing motorists and any Coke executives who drive by.\n\nThe efforts so far have been fruitless — Coca-Cola (KO) has given no indication it will bring Tab back. But the company does have a history of listening to its fans. Most notably, it quickly reversed course on New Coke in 1985 after fans railed against the new recipe.\n\nThere’s a big difference between paying attention to feedback on Coke, Coca-Cola’s signature product, and something like Tab. But Coca-Cola has changed course on fringe products, too.\n\nSurge makes a comeback\n\nCoca-Cola introduced Surge to the market in 1997 as a competitor to Mountain Dew and pulled it six years later. Bereft Surge fans wanted it back, and years later, in 2011, a group of social media enthusiasts decided to help.\n\nMeanwhile, Matt Winans had created a Surge page on Facebook in the early days of the platform so he could “like” the soda, and eventually the page gathered thousands of fans. Winans spotted the “Surge Movement” and reached out to its founder to see if he’d like to be a page administrator.\n\n“We joined forces and the rest is pretty much history,” Winans said.\n\nWinans and others worked for years to bring Surge back. Like Tab fans, they wrote letters and scheduled call-ins. They spent money on Facebook ads. And in 2014, Coca-Cola brought Surge back in a limited capacity in what the company spokesperson called a “business decision.” Surge was discontinued in bottles and cans as part of the October 2020 purge, but is still available in some restaurants.\n\nWith Surge’s success in mind, Burbach tapped Winans to talk strategy on Tab.\n\n“He wanted to know exactly what we did bring it back,” said Winans, who thinks Burbach and his team have a good shot.\n\n“Both [Tab and Surge] are retro, both have cemented themselves as pop culture icons, both have that intrinsic cult following,” Winans said. His advice? “SaveTab should keep up the hard work.”\n\nWhat’s next for Save Tab\n\nJenny Boyter poses with a can of Tab. Courtesy Matt Boyter\n\nIf Coca-Cola won’t bring Tab back, the fans have backup plans.\n\n“I have a box of [Diet Coke] syrup and a SodaStream, which is going to be my fallback solution,” said Priest. As Burbach’s supply dwindles, he’s switched to some Mountain Dew zero-sugar products (Mountain Dew is owned by PepsiCo (PEP)).\n\nJenny Boyter, a committee member who estimates she sent about 25 letters to Coke and made a video celebrating Tab, says she’ll switch to Diet Pepsi, Diet Dr Pepper or iced tea.\n\nBut she’s holding out for the best-case scenario. “My plan is for Coke to say, ‘Let me just pull the truck up and deliver more Tab to you,’” Boyter said. “That’s my fantasy.”\n\nAs much as Boyter wants Tab back, she’s also been enjoying her committee work. “It’s so fun,” she said. “I feel … really close to them.”\n\nBoyter is in it for the long haul, partially because of the connections she’s made with people like Burbach and Priest.\n\n“I would feel really guilty saying, ‘I’ve been working on this for a couple years, it’s not happening, I’m out,’” she said. “I’ll still want to stay with the committee and keep on trying.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/05/05/dining-defiance-daytona-graduation-news-around-states/111661132/", "title": "Dining, defiance: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Public schools closed because of the coronavirus could bring some students back in June as part of a phased reopening before the next full school year, the state’s top official for K-12 schools said. Children 13 and older could return to campus in groups of 10 or fewer people for athletic practice and possibly summer school starting June 8, Alabama State Superintendent Eric Mackey told AL.com. Younger students could get the go-ahead to return for summer literacy camps as early as July 6, and band and athletic practices could start in early August, he said. But Mackey warned that the timeline was tentative and dependent on the impact of the virus. “We may move forward, and then we may have to retract,” he said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: An oil field contractor plans to lay off 304 workers as the coronavirus pandemic continues to hurt the state’s oil industry, the company said. Doyon Drilling, a subsidiary of Interior Alaska Native Regional Corporation Doyon Ltd., informed state regulators of the job losses last week. The company’s staff reductions will remain permanent until the industry recovers from the economic crisis sparked by the outbreak of COVID-19, Doyon Drilling General Manager Ron Wilson said in an April 30 letter. Doyon Drilling is demobilizing its rig fleet because of “the unforeseen business circumstances resulting from the sudden and dramatic effects of the coronavirus outbreak, the declaration of a national emergency and the drop in oil prices on our business and client’s operation,” Wilson wrote. Doyon Drilling provides rigs and services to ConocoPhillips Co. and other oil companies.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Two sheriffs are refusing to enforce Gov. Doug Ducey’s stay-at-home order as the state continues to deal with the coronavirus. Mohave County Sheriff Doug Schuster and Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb both said they aren’t going to hand out fines or citations or arrest people who disobey the governor’s mandate that has been extended through May 15. “I’m not going to make criminals out of law-abiding citizens,” Schuster told Phoenix TV station KTVK. “As a sheriff, I cannot in good conscience issue citations or arrest people for not social distancing.” “It’s unfortunate that we’re here, but I need to make a stand for the people and for freedom,” Lamb said. “I don’t want to cite, fine or arrest fine people.” Ducey already has laid out consequences for violating his stay-at-home order: a $2,500 fine and up to six months in jail. But Schuster and Lamb said they will not enforce the mandate.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Arkansas Department of Corrections said Sunday that two more state prison inmates who were being treated for the coronavirus have died. Department spokesman Solomon Graves said medical officials would determine the cause of the deaths at the Cummins unit. The inmates died Sunday at separate hospitals. “Both inmates were undergoing treatment for COVID-related symptoms. Both inmates had preexisting conditions susceptible to COVID-19,” Solomon said. State health officials say at least two other Cummins inmates have died of COVID-19, and at least 860 prisoners there have tested positive. The state Health Department on Sunday reported at least 3,431 confirmed cases of coronavirus statewide and 76 deaths, an increase from 3,372 cases and 73 deaths reported Saturday. The number of cases is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick.\n\nCalifornia\n\nYuba City: Two more counties in Northern California allowed many businesses to reopen Monday in defiance of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s orders intended to slow the spread of coronavirus and prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed. Yuba County and adjacent Sutter County followed the lead that rural Modoc County took Friday amid pressures to restart California’s economy even as hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 continue. While the governor has promised a cautious, phased reopening of the state, some people don’t want to wait. A recent heat wave brought thousands out to major beaches in Orange County, leading Newsom to order that county’s beaches closed, which sparked protests and efforts by some to head to the water anyway over the weekend. Newport Beach city spokesman John Pope said lifeguards and police officers asked more than 2,500 people to leave.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A retired paramedic who died from coronavirus after volunteering to help combat the pandemic in New York City was honored Sunday as his body was returned to Denver. Paul Cary, 66, who worked 32 years as a firefighter paramedic in the Denver suburbs, died April 30, a month after he began working in New York. He was part of a wave of out-of-state medical technicians, doctors and nurses who came to the city to help relieve a health care system being overwhelmed by the virus. Gov. Jared Polis said Cary had “heroically” served his community and country and traveled thousands of miles to help others. He had reportedly been planning to stay for a second, one-month tour before getting sick. A large procession of fire trucks, EMS and other emergency vehicles drove from the airport after Cary’s body was returned Sunday night.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Workers at the state’s only nuclear power plant worry that managers are not taking enough precautions against the coronavirus after 750 temporary employees were brought in to help refuel one of the two active reactors. Ten employees at the Millstone Power Station in Waterford have tested positive for the virus, and the arrival of the temporary workers alarms some of the permanent employees, The Day newspaper reports. Millstone security officer Jim Foley, vice president of the local chapter of the United Government Security Officers of America, said security personnel have had to fight for personal protective equipment and for partitions at access points to separate staff from security. Foley also has filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration saying Millstone staff are using ineffective cleaning materials and citing a lack of cleaning and sanitizing.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Police are arresting and ticketing far fewer people during the coronavirus pandemic. In the month leading up to Gov. John Carney’s March 12 stay-at-home order, police recorded just under 8,600 felony and misdemeanor arrests statewide. In the month since, they’ve made about 4,650 such arrests through April 14, according to state statistics. Likewise, in the month prior to the emergency declaration, police recorded about 23,500 traffic violations and just under 7,000 in the month following. But exactly why the numbers have decreased isn’t entirely clear. Some police don’t want to talk about how the pandemic has changed the way they enforce the law. Some police chiefs say the sharp drop is due to fewer people being out and about during the emergency declaration. Other chiefs acknowledge that the times require a change in strategy, with orders to their officers to use more discretion deciding whether to make traffic stops.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A high school senior in D.C. has spearheaded an effort to get thousands of critical face shields into local hospitals. Georgetown Day School senior Jonah Docter-Loeb, a self-professed “news junkie,” says he was transfixed by television footage of the “suffering on such a large scale” caused by the coronavirus pandemic. After learning that supplies of protective medical gear were being depleted, Docter-Loeb tapped into the online community of “makers” – 3D printer enthusiasts – and found an open-source design for a welder’s mask-style face shield he could print at home. In less than a month, that idea has mushroomed into Print to Protect, a network of about 100 3D printers, most in individual homes, producing face shields for distribution to Washington area hospitals. The group says it has printed 3,000 shields so far with a goal of completing 10,000 in April.\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: Seniors at two high schools won’t be taking the traditional walk across the stage to receive their diplomas because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Instead, they’ll be driving across the finish line at the Daytona International Speedway. The school district announced the ceremonies will take place May 31. Matanzas High School’s graduation will begin at 11 a.m., followed by Flagler-Palm Coast High School’s ceremony at 4 p.m. Each graduate will be allowed one car. The ceremonies will be simulcast via radio inside the facility and will be livestreamed on the FlaglerSchools.com website, school officials said. “This class has gone through school closures caused by three hurricanes and a global pandemic so they all envisioned a ‘historic ceremony’ to close out their high school careers,” according to a release from the district.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The region’s largest malls have begun reopening, though not all the stores inside are restarting business, as restrictions enacted in the state because of the coronavirus have been eased. The Outlet Shoppes in Woodstock opened for the weekend, but some individual stores in the complex stayed closed. John Rampsott was among the few shoppers. “It ended up just being kind of surreal where you just go, and no one’s there,” he told WSB-TV. At Lenox Square in Buckhead, which reopened Monday, the owners are requiring workers to take safety precautions, such as being symptom-free and wearing masks at the mall. Arbor Place Mall in Douglasville set up sanitizing stations as it opened its doors and kept the children’s play area and food court seating closed. Some shoppers think the openings are too soon and too risky. “I’m fearful of people not taking safety precautions, and (I’d) rather be safe than to shop right now,” Tanya Moor said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Tenants and landlords have been offered free mediation services by a Hawaii County program aimed at preventing a flood of evictions following an eviction ban during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Rapid Response Landlord Tenant Mediation Program intends to help residential and commercial tenants and landlords reach agreements about individual cases rather than resorting to legal action, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. Democratic Gov. David Ige issued a moratorium last month outlawing eviction of residential tenants for failing to pay rent through May 31 as part of the state’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak, which has left many residents furloughed or unemployed. Once the moratorium ends, tenants who were unable to pay rent will have overdue payments due all at once, Hawaii County Councilwoman Ashley Kierkiewicz said. “We want to get ahead of this tsunami of evictions that’s coming,” she said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A plan to reopen Idaho during the coronavirus pandemic hinges on understanding what the state and individuals have to do to defeat the illness, the co-chair of Gov. Brad Little’s COVID-19 Testing Task Force said. “The long-term success for all of us in this pandemic, which is going to be a long game here, absolutely hinges on our people understanding the enemy better,” said Jim Souza, chief medical officer for St. Luke’s Health System. The Republican governor’s four-stage plan to reopen the state by incrementally lifting restrictions spaced by roughly two-week intervals started Friday. It will conclude in June if there isn’t a second wave of infections that forces a reversal. The virus “is not that tough; it’s actually kind of wimpy,” Souza said. “Simple soap and water will dissolve it. Alcohol wipes will dissolve it. It doesn’t have a brain. We can totally outsmart it.” However, he said, the virus does a good job of hiding in the population.\n\nIllinois\n\nLena: A small northern Illinois church defied crowd restrictions in the state’s latest stay-at-home order, holding a Sunday service with dozens of people. Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s extension of the order, which took effect Friday and lifts May 30, allows for worship limited to groups of 10, along with other social distancing measures. Roughly 100 people attended The Beloved Church in Lena, according to WREX-TV, which was denied entrance but interviewed attendees and neighbors who counted congregants. Officials with the evangelical church sued in federal court arguing Pritzker’s order violates the First Amendment right to free religious practice. However, U.S. District Judge John Z. Lee on Sunday rejected the church’s request for a temporary restraining order because such large gatherings could “magnify the risk of contagion even when participants practice preventative measures.”\n\nIndiana\n\nCrown Point: A helpline has been set up to provide services for front-line workers and families in need in northwestern Indiana and the Chicago area during the coronavirus pandemic. Dr. Kalyani Gopal – a clinical psychologist and the president and founder of SAFE Coalition for Human Rights, a nonprofit that aims to protect the human dignity of trafficked personsed – said she thought about the need for the helpline one day while she was leaving work, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports. The Rapid Outreach Amplified Response Helpline Team includes SAFE Coalition, Greenleaf Consultants, Marram Healthcare, Continuum of Care, local food banks, Mid-America Psychological and Counseling Services, Mid-America Mental Health, seniors and volunteers. The main number for the helpline is 219-200-0003.\n\nIowa\n\nWoodward: Six residents at a facility for people with intellectual disabilities have tested positive for the new coronavirus, although none have shown symptoms of COVID-19, officials said. The Iowa Department of Human Services announced April 27 that a resident at the Woodward Resource Center tested positive for the virus after seeking treatment for an unrelated medical issue. By Saturday, five more residents – all tied to one home on campus – had tested positive for the virus. Three employees at the multi-building campus have also tested positive. Diane Stout, assistant superintendent at the center, said in a letter to guardians and families that the department has begun contact tracing staff members. The state is working to get more COVID-19 testing on the campus, DHS spokesman Matt Highland said. Residents who tested positive have been moved to separate on-campus housing.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Shuttered retailers, dine-in restaurants and offices in some parts of the state reopened Monday as Gov. Laura Kelly gradually begins lifting a stay-at-home order amid the coronavirus outbreak. Social distancing still must be observed, and masks are strongly encouraged under the first reopening phase. Many businesses – including bars, gyms, theaters, barbershops, hair and nail salons, or state-owned casinos – must remain closed until the second phase, expected to begin May 18. That’s when the 10-person mass gathering limit will begin to gradually increase, rising to 30 until June 1 and 90 until June 15. Churches, however, will be exempted from the mass-gathering rules, although worshippers must spread out and not pass collection plates. There will be no immediate change in some counties, including hard-hit Johnson and Wyandotte in the Kansas City area.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: A history museum in central Kentucky is asking for submissions to document how the coronavirus has affected lives. The Lexington History Museum told WKYT-TV that the Lexington Pandemic History Project seeks to build a historical record. Residents are encouraged to send stories and photos by email or traditional mail to the museum. Officials say the length and content of submissions are up to senders. The submissions will be reviewed by a historian when the virus has passed, the museum said. The collection can help future leaders make informed decisions when there’s another crisis, chief historian Foster Ockerman Jr. said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: With some in masks and others uncovered, state lawmakers on Monday resumed the final four weeks of a legislative session stalled by the coronavirus, trying to get their arms around the scale of the budget problems caused by the outbreak. The return to the Capitol has caused a new rift between Republicans, who hold the majority and pushed for a restart of work, and Democrats, who said it was too risky to have hundreds of people in the building in a state that is one of the nation’s hot spots for the COVID-19 disease. Seventy-eight of 104 House members returned for work, with attendance from Democrats lighter than Republicans. Democrats who showed up were wearing masks, while Republicans were mixed in whether they donned a face covering. Masks are “encouraged,” but no one is required to wear one in the building – even as Gov. John Bel Edwards repeatedly calls on state residents to do so when encountering people outside their households.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The governor’s phased reopening plan that includes an extended stay-at-home order through the end of the month will cost thousands of jobs and spur economic turmoil, Republican members of the state Senate said Monday. The charge from the GOP came after some Republican members of the Maine House of Representatives called on Democratic leaders to call the Legislature back into session to end the state of civil emergency declared by Democratic Gov. Janet Mills. Republicans have been signaling growing buyer’s remorse since the Legislature gave Mills more powers with a March vote that passed unanimously without a roll call. Mills placed the state under a stay-at-home order until May 31 and has announced a phased plan of reopening that began Friday. The Senate Republicans said Mills’ decision “could devastate families in our districts” because of the loss of businesses and jobs.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Maryland is opening the first state-run drive-thru testing site for the coronavirus in western Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Monday. The governor said the testing site in Hagerstown will open Tuesday at a Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program station. “With the tests we recently acquired from South Korea, Maryland continues to implement an expanded testing strategy,” Hogan said in a news release. Last week, the governor announced expanded testing to address poultry plant outbreaks in Wicomico and Caroline counties on the Eastern Shore. Meanwhile, Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson and House Speaker Adrienne Jones joined a group of bipartisan leaders of state legislatures around the country in a letter to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urging Congress to help state governments facing big budget shortfalls due to the virus.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker said Monday that the state is seeing hopeful data about its effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus. “In the course of the past few days, we have seen some positive downward trends,” Baker said, pointing in part to a general decline in new hospitalizations for COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. The state processed nearly 16,000 COVID-19 tests Sunday, the highest daily tally since the start of the pandemic. About 12% came back positive, lower than previous daily highs that had exceeded 20%, Baker said. But the Republican warned that the extension of Massachusetts’ state-of-emergency and stay-at-home advisory until May 18 doesn’t mean the economy will be “off to the races” on that date.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint: A woman, her adult son and her husband have been charged in the fatal shooting of a security guard who refused to let her daughter enter a Family Dollar because she wasn’t wearing a face mask to protect against transmission of the coronavirus. Calvin Munerlyn was shot Friday at the store just north of downtown Flint a short time after telling Sharmel Teague’s daughter she had to leave because she lacked a mask, according to Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton. Teague, 45, argued with Munerlyn, 43, before leaving. Two men later came to the store. Teague; her husband, Larry Teague, 44; and Ramonyea Bishop, 23, are charged with first-degree premeditated murder and gun charges. Larry Teague also is charged with violating Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s executive order mandating that all customers and employees must wear face coverings inside grocery stores, Leyton said. About 150 people attended a candlelight vigil Sunday night. On Monday, a makeshift memorial was started outside the Family Dollar.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The number of people in the state hospitalized in intensive care with COVID-19 has jumped for three straight days to the highest levels yet, health officials said Monday. The Minnesota Department of Health reported 166 patients in intensive care units as of Monday, up 11 from a one-day high of 155 set Sunday and a high of 135 set Saturday. A total of 396 patients were hospitalized, up 23 from Sunday. The state’s count of confirmed cases rose by 571 to 7,234 . Health officials say the confirmed case counts are substantially lower than the actual number of coronavirus infections because many patients don’t get tested, and many don’t show symptoms. Minnesota’s death toll rose by nine to 428. Out of that total, 345 deaths have been in residents of long-term care or assisted living facilities.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Commencement ceremonies in the state are looking a bit different from usual as graduates began to receive their degrees via virtual celebrations. Alcorn State University awarded degrees to 466 students, including 73 graduate degrees, in ceremonies Saturday. The university encouraged the students’ friends and relatives to gather online at the university’s website to mark the occasion. Graduates also will be given a chance to walk at a commencement in the future. Mississippi State held its graduation ceremony Friday and livestreamed the event to comply with social distancing restrictions in place because of the coronavirus pandemic. The occasion marked just the third time in the university’s 142-year history that a traditional graduation ceremony was not possible, the university said. The Spanish flu and World War II stopped earlier ceremonies.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Business began reopening in the state Monday, although some cities hit hard by the coronavirus are keeping restrictions in place a little longer. In lifting the statewide stay-at-home order, Gov. Mike Parson placed no limit on the size of social gatherings if people maintain the current 6-foot social distancing efforts. But some businesses – such as retail stores – will be required to take extra steps, such as limiting occupancy. Among the businesses that can resume operations are restaurants, manufacturing plants, gyms and hair salons, along with churches and sporting events. But nursing homes, long-term care facilities, retirement homes and assisted living homes must continue stronger guidance to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19. Stay-at-home orders will remain in effect through mid-May in St. Louis County and the city of St. Louis. In Kansas City, Mayor Quinton Lucas is allowing the reopening of some “nonessential” businesses starting Wednesday.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Restaurants, bars, brewpubs and casinos began reopening Monday with limits on crowds and servers donning masks and gloves, as the state lifts more closures imposed to fight the coronavirus. Not all restaurants were reopening immediately, and some industry workers have expressed concern that interacting with customers could put them at risk. But with confirmed virus infections down sharply since peaking in late March, Montana officials have moved methodically in recent days to reopen sectors of the state’s economy even as other states extended closure orders. Churches and retail shops opened last week, and a stay-at-home order was lifted except for vulnerable populations including the elderly. Schools can reopen May 7 under the latest directive from Gov. Steve Bullock, but many districts already have canceled in-person classes through the end of the year.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State officials are struggling to keep up with the flood of unemployment claims that have been filed since the coronavirus pandemic began. Nebraska Labor Commissioner John Albin said the state has been adding workers and streamlining its processes, but there have still been unacceptable delays that left workers waiting for their checks. “I apologize if anyone’s been out there waiting a long time,” Albin told the Omaha World-Herald. “I don’t know that it’s any comfort, but we’re not meeting our own standards on this.” Since March 8, the state has received 129,309 new unemployment claims, which is more than the total claims filed during the three previous years combined. The state has processed 96,024 of those claims, but that leaves 33,000 requiring a response. Albin said the state normally tries to process all new jobless claims within 21 days.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A task force of business leaders trying use to their global contacts to bolster the state’s coronavirus response has expanded its initial focus from obtaining protective equipment to ramping up testing and helping businesses figure out how to reopen. Former MGM Resorts International CEO Jim Murren said the task force he’s running began in recent weeks working to get test kits and machines, allowing Nevada to test more people and get results faster. Weeks ago, the state was able to process less than 1,000 tests a day, but the task force is hoping to help the state grow to a point where it can processes 30,000 a day by June 1. Murren said members of the Nevada COVID-19 Response, Relief and Recovery Task Force use their contacts and business expertise to find equipment that can be donated to the state or purchased with donated money, moving faster than governments limited by regulatory rules about purchasing.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Housing agencies throughout the state will get nearly $3.6 million in coronavirus aid, the state’s congressional delegation said Monday. The funding was distributed through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Public Housing Operation Fund, used to support housing authorities for the operating and maintenance expenses of their buildings, and its Housing Choice Voucher Program, used to help low-income, disabled and elderly poor people afford housing. Meanwhile, though many libraries are closed during the coronavirus pandemic, one in Laconia is among those providing “take-out” service. The Laconia Daily Sun reports patrons pick up books and other items in shopping bags outside the front door. When returned, the books are quarantined for a week and sanitized. Patrons are asked to wipe down any items they pick up and return them.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Schools will remain closed for the rest of the academic year due to the coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday. Teachers will be required to continue conducting online instruction, which schools have been doing since they shuttered in mid-March. “I had hoped we could get back to a sense of normal by allowing our children to return to the schools they love and to be with their friends and classmates,” Murphy said. “But the reality is we cannot safely reopen our schools to provide students and families, or faculty and staff, the confidence needed to allow for a return to in-person instruction.” Private schools with later academic years are closed until at least June 30, Murphy said. State officials will meet with parents and other stakeholders to consider summer courses, as well as to discuss the 2020-2021 school year, he said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nEunice: Another small city is vowing to reopen despite a statewide health order to keep nonessential businesses closed to stop the spread of COVID-19. Officials with Eunice say the southeastern New Mexico city will open its library, youth center and activity center two weeks ahead of a plan outlined by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, the Hobbs News-Sun reports. Eunice City Manager Jordan Yutzy said the city sent Lujan Grisham a letter outlining plans to reopen and asked for a response by April 30. The letter covered a City Council-approved resolution that proposed three phases to gradually reopen businesses. Yutzy said the city never got a response, so officials will begin their own plan for a phased-in reopening. Lujan Grisham has said cities that reopen early face fines. The city of Grants allowed businesses to reopen last week, and state police have issued warnings and fines and warnings to businesses and the city.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The mayor rejected calls Monday to stop having police officers enforce social distancing during the coronavirus crisis after one was caught on video pulling a stun gun on a man and violently taking him to the ground. Mayor Bill de Blasio called Saturday’s confrontation in Manhattan’s East Village “very troubling” and “absolutely unacceptable” but contended it was an outlier among “tens of thousands of interactions between police officers and civilians over the last weeks that went very well.” The officer was stripped of his gun and badge and placed on desk duty pending an internal investigation. The police department assigned 1,000 officers to social distancing patrols over the weekend as New Yorkers ventured outside to enjoy warm weather. They’ll also be part of a new effort to distribute 7.5 million protective masks over the next few weeks.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A judge has ordered public officials to turn over detailed information and what steps they are taking to prevent coronavirus outbreaks in state prisons. The ruling issued late last week by Superior Court Judge Vinston Rozier comes in connection with a lawsuit filed by the state conference of the NAACP and other advocacy groups as prison officials grapple with two major outbreaks of the virus. At Neuse Correctional Institution in Goldsboro, more than 460 inmates have tested positive, and two have died. At the North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women in Raleigh, 90 inmates have been diagnosed with the virus. The judge’s order gives the state prisons until Friday to provide information about whether each prison provides face masks for inmates equivalent to those provided to prison staff, unrestricted access to soap and hand sanitizer, and bunks arranged to allow for 6 feet or more between inmates.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A widespread outbreak of the coronavirus that has shuttered a wind turbine plant in northeastern North Dakota and initiated a massive contact tracing effort has led many of the state’s largest manufacturers to review and relay their safety measures. No company wants to be the next LM Wind Power. Officials with two of the state’s largest plants, window and door maker Marvin and agriculture and construction components producer John Deere Electronic Solutions, say there are new rules of the road. And they’re doing more than the standard protocol of proper hygiene, high-tech protective gear, social distancing and stickers that say, “IF YOU CAN READ THIS YOU ARE TOO CLOSE.” Hallways, entrances and exits are strictly one-way. Other changes have included temperature checks, unique equipment like “no touch” door openers, liberal leave policies and pay provisions, and an added emphasis on communication between management and workers.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine lit into protesters Monday, saying some had crossed the line when it came to how they treated the media and state health director Dr. Amy Acton. “It’s not fair game to disrespect the news media, to be obnoxious to the news media,” he said. “They’re informing the public about what you think, what you’re saying. To treat them with disrespect, to not observe social distancing with them, to be just obnoxious, I just find that very very sad.” DeWine didn’t reference a specific event, but a viral video from a Friday protest showed a maskless protester refusing to distance from a masked TV reporter and accosting that reporter, who was trying to cover the protest. “Come after me. I’m fair game. They’re not,” DeWine said. DeWine also said it was out of bounds to protest outside the home of his health director, Dr. Amy Acton, as some did over the weekend.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Capitol reopened to the public on a limited basis this week as the Legislature prepares to return and residents began returning to businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic. State Senate President Pro Tem Greg Treat and House Speaker Charles McCall said the public can enter the building starting 10 a.m. Monday after being screened and under social distancing and health safety protocols. “Capitol access is being phased in cautiously just like Oklahoma’s reopening is being phased in cautiously,” McCall, an Atoka Republican, said in their joint statement released late Saturday. Treat, an Oklahoma City Republican, said lawmakers are following the guidance of health officials at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. Lawmakers have met just twice since closing the Legislature in mid-March.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: State officials reported the number of Oregonians sick enough to be hospitalized with coronavirus hit a new low Sunday. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports there were 92 active hospitalizations May 3. That number represents a drop of more than 40% from the 156 reported hospitalizations on April 8, the first day state officials disclosed active hospitalizations for confirmed cases of COVID-19. And on Sunday, the Oregon Health Authority reported no new coronavirus deaths and disclosed 45 additional infections, raising the statewide total of confirmed infections to 2,680. At least 109 people have died.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state has passed 50,000 confirmed coronavirus infections, health officials reported Monday. About 825 additional people tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the Health Department. There were 14 new deaths, raising the statewide total to 2,458. The numbers of new infections and deaths have been trending down, prompting Gov. Tom Wolf to allow construction work statewide to resume and golf courses, marinas, guided fishing trips and privately owned campgrounds to reopen. On Friday, he plans to lift his stay-at-home order and allow some retail shops to reopen in the least impacted parts of the state. The number of infections is thought to be far higher than the state’s confirmed case count because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Lawmakers face some tough decisions as the state emerges from the coronavirus crisis and tries to plug a budget gap of at least $400 million, but higher taxes appear to be off the table, several legislators told The Providence Journal. “Those most impacted by the pandemic should not bear the costs of rebuilding Rhode Island, so I am vehemently opposed to tolling cars and raising taxes on our working families and small businesses,” Democratic Senate Majority Leader Michael McCaffrey said. Republican Sen. Elaine Morgan said she is opposed to any sales or income tax hikes or toll expansion and against legalizing marijuana, but she suggested furloughs or layoffs of “nonessential” state workers. Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello said his team is looking for creative ways to use the $1.7 billion the state has received from Washington for COVID-related expenses.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state has officially begun loosening restrictions on travel, commerce and recreation implemented during the initial spread of the coronavirus, as the Palmetto State tries to regain its economic footing ahead of the summertime tourist season. Monday marked the end of Gov. Henry McMaster’s stay-at-home order, which placed a $100 fine on anyone outside their home for a reason other than work, visiting family, exercising alone or going to an essential business such as a grocery store. Dine-in restaurants and close-contact businesses such as barbershops and gyms remain closed, along with playgrounds and nightclubs. But restaurants were being allowed to begin serving people in outdoor dining areas Monday, as long as tables were at least 8 feet apart, parties were limited to eight people and strict sanitation guidelines were followed.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A pop-up testing site at a high school parking lot will test Smithfield Foods meatpacking plant employees and their families over the next week, officials say. The Washington High School site is specifically for the plant’s employees and their families to be tested, Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken said Monday. The testing is part of the Virginia-based company’s plan to slowly reopen the Sioux Falls plant after a coronavirus outbreak infected more than 850 employees and several hundred more “close contacts” and family members. The plant partially reopened the facility starting Monday with a limited number of department employees returning to work, TenHaken said. Several Smithfield employees said while the plant was closed that they wanted to see required testing among employees before the plant opened.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Vanderbilt University Medical Center had to scramble for personal protective equipment even before the coronavirus hit, after a deadly March 3 tornado tore through the state and took out its distribution center. “Our supply chain is great at crisis management,” said Robin Adkins, a nurse who consults with Vanderbilt on sterile processing and logistics. N95 masks have been the most difficult to come by, Adkins said. In normal times, they are discarded after a single use, but faced with a nationwide shortage of PPE, Vanderbilt at first began sterilizing masks using ultraviolet light, allowing them to be reused up to three times. More recently, it has started using hydrogen peroxide vapor for sterilization and can now reuse a single mask up to 10 times, according to the hospital. Vanderbilt also found a way to “reuse” its valets. Faced with the prospect of laying off about 100 people, the hospital instead retrained them to screen people entering the hospital for symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: State health authorities reported 17 new coronavirus-related deaths Monday, the lowest daily increase in seven days. The latest numbers from the Department of State Health Services show 884 people have died from the coronavirus in Texas. The health agency also reported 784 new daily cases, bringing the total number of known COVID-19 cases statewide to 32,332. For the first time over the weekend, Texas reached more than 25,000 tests in a single day – a goal that Gov. Greg Abbott set for the state as he announced loosening restrictions for certain businesses last week. The health agency reported more than 28,000 COVID-19 tests Saturday. But tests dropped to 9,912 on Sunday – the same day Texas reported its fourth straight day of more than 1,000 new cases. The Department of State Health Services has noted it receives fewer lab reports on Sundays and Mondays, which could explain the decrease in tests.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Government officials from southwestern Utah are asking the state if the region could skip ahead to a “yellow” designation and loosen some of the restrictions put in place to fight the coronavirus pandemic. St. George Mayor Jon Pike confirmed Saturday that the city and other local governments have put in the request, with the support of the Southwest Utah Public Health Department, after the state moved from a high-risk “red level” to a moderate-risk “orange level.” Pike said the request has already been sent to Gov. Gary Herbert’s office, and the hope is that southern Utah will receive a response from the governor’s office in 10 to 14 days. SWUPHD Public Information Officer Dave Heaton said the department is basing its recommendation for a yellow level on ample hospital and testing resources, along with a relatively low case count.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is allowing some elective health care procedures to resume as the state emerges from its COVID-19 shutdown, Gov. Phil Scott announced Monday. Outpatient clinics and surgeries may resume if the providers and the patients comply with measures designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Elective surgeries that require a hospital stay are not yet allowed, the governor said at his weekly news conference. The resumption of some medical care and other aspects of the state’s reopening are made possible by Vermont’s expanded program to test for new cases of the virus and try to stop its spread. “As we find an outbreak, like a brush fire, we are able to put it out before an out-of-control forest fire erupts,” Scott said. Separately Monday, more construction and manufacturing workers returned to their jobs after Scott loosened some restrictions.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam said he anticipates nonessential businesses in the state reopening May 15, saying more time is still needed to help contain the coronavirus pandemic. Northam announced Monday that he is extending by another week an executive order mandating that some nonessential businesses close and banning large gatherings. “The message today is that we will reopen Virginia next Friday,” Northam said. The governor said while the state has made improvements in flattening the curve, it needs to ensure positive trends continue related to testing, hospital capacity and the state’s supply of medical equipment. “I want to make it very clear: This virus is still here,” Northam said. “We must not relax our vigilance.” His executive order, which forces closing some businesses and severely restricting how others operate, was set to expire May 8. His order also bans gatherings of 10 or more in public or private.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Hundreds of health care workers and dozens of first responders in the state have become sick with the coronavirus while on the job, according to workers’ compensation claims. The new data provides some insight into how the coronavirus has affected the health care community, but it underestimates how many doctors and nurses have tested positive for the disease. That number is not known because state and federal health officials have failed to collect the information, and they’ve made no improvements since the Associated Press first reported the problem in April. “Our data on occupations are not complete, so we do not report the information since it would not be reliable,” said Annie Johnson, a spokesperson for the Washington health department’s Joint Information Center. Experts say knowing how COVID-19 is affecting front-line workers in the health care system is vital in handling the crisis.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Some restaurants are balking at the chance to reopen as Gov. Jim Justice’s plan to get the state economy moving again in response to the coronavirus enters its second week. Despite the chance to recoup lost revenues, Super Weenie hot dog shop owner Jason Myer told the Charleston-Gazette Mail he won’t reopen, closed since March, “until it makes sense.” Starting Monday, Justice’s reopening plan includes small businesses with fewer than 10 employees, restaurants with outdoor seating, barbershops and dog groomers. The risk of reopening during the pandemic isn’t worth a potential boost in sales, said Keeley Steele, who operates three businesses on Charleston’s East End, including the Tricky Fish restaurant and Starlings Coffee & Provisions. Steele said she’s not convinced reopening would be profitable due to limited seating and buying personal protective equipment for employees.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers on Monday announced that every nursing home resident and worker in the state will be tested for free for the coronavirus. The expanded testing is part of the state’s plan to ramp up testing to 85,000 per week. Evers said Wisconsin has the capacity to provide that many tests. Expanding testing to all residents and workers at all 373 nursing homes in Wisconsin is part of the plan to make more tests available to targeted high-risk populations. Evers said state health officials started contacting nursing homes Monday to coordinate supplies in advance of testing more than 10,000 residents and staff each week. Other steps to increase testing include using the National Guard and local health agencies to test workers and families associated with outbreaks at businesses; increasing from 10 to 25 National Guard units to help with setting up testing sites to respond to outbreaks; and increasing free drive-thru testing sites.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A round of intensive testing for the coronavirus among patients and staff at the state’s primary psychiatric hospital turned up no new cases. The Wyoming Department of Health, working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, sampled 46 patients and 172 staff members Friday at the Wyoming State Hospital in Evanston, department officials said Monday. Testing was voluntary, and those tested accounted for 61% of the hospital’s patients and staff. Such studies can help provide a better understanding of how a disease affects people and circulates in a given location, State Health Officer Dr. Alexia Harrist said in a release. Two of the hospital’s patients have tested positive for the coronavirus, both after transferring there from another facility in mid-April. Wyoming as of Monday had recorded 435 lab-confirmed cases and 151 probable cases of COVID-19; 191 people had recovered.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/05"}]}

All but eight of the shows have user-generated scores of eight out of 10 or more. Two of the programs – “Game of Thrones” and “Rick and Morty” – have numbers greater than nine out of 10.\n\nMany of the most popular shows nominated for Emmy Awards this year are relatively new. More than a quarter of the shows on our list have no nominations before this year.\n\nOther shows are prime-time staples such as comedies “Will & Grace” and “The Simpsons,” both 2018 nominees.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo identify the 40 most popular Emmy-nominated shows, 24/7 Wall St. developed an index based on the number of IMDb ratings and Wikipedia page views for TV shows nominated for at least one Emmy Award. Overall ratings for TV series were used for episodes nominated separately. Total Wikipedia page views cover the year leading up to and including Aug. 1.\n\nThe Academy of Television Arts & Sciences runs the Emmy Awards\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

One-third of the country’s 15 top-grossing films of all time are \"Star Wars\" movies, and it's likely that future releases will also do exceedingly well.\n\nThe blockbuster series has lined not only the pockets of production studios, but of all those involved, especially the actors. In addition to introducing up-and-coming actors such as Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, numerous Hollywood superstars have enjoyed taking part in the films.\n\n24/7 Wall Street has identified the most successful \"Star Wars\" actors by creating an index based on audience ratings of each actors’ films and TV shows — be they \"Star Wars\" or not — and the number of annual page views for each actor.

Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill are both known for little more than their \"Star Wars\" characters, yet both make our list.\n\nTo determine the most successful \"Star Wars\" actors, 24/7 Wall Street measured fame by creating an index of two metrics: 1) IMDb audience user ratings of all films and TV shows in which each actor appears. 2) The number of views each actor’s Wikipedia page received over 12 months up to May 2018. Acting credits were given additional weight. Only actors with at least 500,000 page views were considered.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

We look to them for entertainment, cultural leadership, and — for better or worse — political guidance. Any way you look at it, actors have an inordinate amount of influence in our society.\n\nThat influence generally emanates from Los Angeles and New York City, the two main hubs of the entertainment industry. Yet only a fraction of actors actually come from these cities. Our nation’s star thespians originate from all across our vast nation.\n\nExploring this notion, 24/7 Wall Street has identified the most famous actor from each state. Each actor’s level of fame was determined by creating an index based on IMDb popularity, Wikipedia page views, and audience ratings of his or her work.\n\nMany of the country’s most famous actors have earned their status through years of hard work. John Goodman, who was born in Affton, Missouri, has been working steadily for 43 years. He has 155 acting credits and is the most famous actor to originate in Missouri.\n\nStill, an entertainer’s level of fame doesn't directly correlate with how prolific or formally accomplished they are. A number of actors on the list are younger and have had shorter careers. These include Damon Wayans Jr., who hails from Vermont, and Matthew Fox, who comes from Wyoming. Both actors have fewer than 30 credits to their names yet represent their respective states on our list.\n\n1.

To be considered, each actor had to appear in the top 10,000 rankings on IMDb’s STARmeter.\n\nEach actor’s place of birth was the reference point for determining where they are from. Actors who have gained the majority of their fame for reasons other than acting, such as Meghan Markle, were excluded from consideration.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

It's addressed to his \"supporters\" and declares nobody in the Avery family is responsible for the murder of Teresa Halbach.

It's uploaded by a YouTube user named Kelly Vrooman of Jelly Man Productions.

Somebody's making Messer's Wikipedia page read like ...", "text": "A slew of recent edits to Rep. Luke Messer's Wikipedia page closely align with his likely primary opponent Todd Rokita's campaign attacks, setting off a new round of finger pointing in what is expected to be one of the most hotly contested U.S. Senate races in the country.\n\nOver the past month, Messer's page has been edited to emphasize his work as a lobbyist, his decision to move his family to Washington, D.C., and a controversy involving his wife's lucrative part-time legal work for the city of Fishers.\n\nThe edits were made under user names that make it difficult to identify the person behind the changes. But Wikipedia editing logs show that Messer's page is the only one they've edited, suggesting they are more interested in influencing Messer's image than providing objective information.\n\nThe Rokita campaign has routinely criticized Messer in recent months as a \"lobbyist turned politician\" who left Indiana for \"one of the wealthiest suburbs of Washington D.C.\"\n\nMesser's campaign, meanwhile, has shot back, accusing Rokita of peddling negative stories and attacking Messer's family. At one point, an official with the Messer campaign told the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette that “Rokita has a history of making unhinged comments.\"\n\nThe changes to Messer's Wikipedia page seem to correspond with Rokita's lines of attack. Among the dozen or so recent changes:\n\nOn June 13, someone using the name HungryHoosier removed Shelbyville as Messer's residence and added a section titled \"Controversies.\" The new section included information about Messer's move \"to McLean, Virginia, a wealthy Washington, D.C., suburb\" under the subheading, \"Residency issues.\"\n\nThe same user added information about Messer's wife's controversial legal consulting contract with Fishers, noting that she has been paid $580,000 since 2015 for work \"she primarily does from the family's Washington, D.C. area home.\"\n\nOn June 21, a user named WI2updater added the word \"lobbyist\" to the first line of Messer's biography, so that his Wikipedia page now begins: \"Luke Messer is an American politician, lobbyist and author ... .\"\n\nThat same day, another user, MIIN, created a new subhead titled \"Lobbying career\" and added several sentences about Messer's work for law firm Ice Miller's lobbying division. The entry suggests a connection between the firm and legislation on which Messer worked.\n\nOther changes seem intended to make Messer seem less conservative. On July 15, WI2updater deleted a sentence describing Messer as a \"libertarian-leaning conservative.\" Another edit removed a quote from Messer comparing himself to his predecessor, Mike Pence, who is now vice president.\n\nIn response to inquiries from IndyStar, the Rokita campaign denied editing Messer's page, suggesting instead that the Senate seat's current occupant, Democrat Joe Donnelly, was behind the changes.\n\n\"Joe Donnelly and his allies are clearly good at editing websites ... ,\" Rokita campaign spokesman Tim Edson said. \"That said, most of what they’ve posted about Luke Messer’s record seems accurate.\"\n\nThe Wikipedia changes, he said, should serve as a warning to Republicans that Messer has \"huge vulnerabilities.\"\n\nDonnelly campaign manager Peter Hanscom laughed at the assertion that Donnelly's campaign was behind the edits.\n\n\"We have absolutely nothing to do with it,\" he said. \"It's childish behavior. This is not the way you win a United States Senate seat.\"\n\nIndiana Democratic Party spokesman Will Baskin-Gerwitz also said party members were not behind the changes.\n\nMesser's campaign said the edits — which include a new section about immigration intended to make Messer sound less conservative — are obviously geared toward a Republican primary audience.\n\n\"Of course it's Rokita,\" Messer campaign spokesman Jason Kneeland said. \"Typical of the level of ugliness we've seen from him. Nobody has declared in the Senate race, but Todd has already established he will say or do anything to get elected. I just don't think that works long-term here in Indiana.\"\n\nThere have also been several recent changes to Rokita's Wikipedia page, but they've been mostly positive.\n\nIn one case, a photograph of Rokita with his family was added. Another edit deleted a paragraph about controversial comments he made about a CNN reporter's appearance. Subsections on \"gun control\" and \"abortion\" were also renamed \"2nd Amendment\" and \"Right to life.\"\n\nThe Wiki fight is only the latest squabble to break out between Messer and Rokita. Both men are expected to enter the Republican primary race to take on Donnelly, though neither has formally declared their candidacy.\n\nDonnelly is widely viewed as one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats in 2018. He is the only statewide-elected Democrat in Indiana, which President Trump won by 19 percentage points.\n\nEfforts to manipulate Wikipedia in such heated races isn't unheard of, but it is unusual, said Aaron Halfaker, principal research scientist with Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit organization that supports and operates Wikipedia.\n\nAlthough anyone can edit most Wikipedia pages — including, at least for now, the Messer and Rokita pages — Halfaker said edits like the ones to Messer's page are frowned upon by most of Wikipedia's volunteer contributors, who keep an eye out for \"single purpose users\" who push a particular point of view.\n\nEven edits that are factually accurate can be biased if they give undue weight to certain facts, he said.\n\n\"Administrators at Wikipedia are likely to ban these users,\" he said. \"That's my take.\"\n\nDespite the recent edits to the Messer and Rokita pages, Halfaker said Wikipedia remains a good resource for voters. Vandalism on the site is often caught within seconds, though less obvious manipulation can take longer to correct. Several of the changes to Messer's page, for example, have already been corrected, he said.\n\n\"If you as a voter are using it as a resource,\" he said, \"you should be skeptical of the information just like everything else on the internet.\"\n\nCall IndyStar reporter Tony Cook at (317) 444-6081.

A winner’s total popularity was determined by the sum of the votes the winner received for all the films and television episodes for which he or she is credited as being in a top-billed role or as director.\n\nWinners were only given credit for episodes of television series in which they appeared or they directed.

And, despite initial complaints about the site's accuracy, it has become increasingly reliable and more scrupulously sourced. (Wikipedia's page on itself references 295 studies, newspaper stories and magazine articles.)\n\nIn addition to being one of the top reference destinations on the Internet — its popularity makes it appear prominently in routine Google searches — Wikipedia has inspired dozens of similarly designed databases, including Lostpedia, devoted to the cult series \"Lost,\" and Wookiepedia, which contains over 102,600 articles on all things \"Star Wars.\"\n\nWhat was your childhood encyclopedia? Nancy Ioele-Santos of Saddle Brook still has \"three full sets, including Britannica from the 1930s, which has its own solid wood case and a huge atlas. I also have a dictionary that weighs more than my rat terrier. I always used to love browsing through them — something about turning those pages and finding out so many new and exciting things in our world gave me pleasure.\"\n\nChristine Kyse of Wyckoff can't remember when her family got its World Book, \"although the last president in it, I believe, was Lyndon Johnson. My mother loved those books, though, and kept them forever. She used them the way we use the Internet today.\"\n\nKevin Lynch of Teaneck had the Golden Book, and Ramsey native Jane Nierstedt had Compton's.\n\n\"I loved the [clear] pages that let you see the anatomy of a bug or a human,\" Nierstedt said. \"Each page added another layer.\"\n\nEdward Podwin of Bergenfield had the World Book and recalled the many family disputes, over dinner, that weren't resolved until someone said, \"Check the book.\"\n\nIn 1961, George Bottinor of Park Ridge answered a help-wanted ad in The Record and, the next day, was selling the Encyclopaedia Britannica, door to door.\n\nHe and the other young salesmen accepted for the job were given a scripted pitch and told to explain to potential buyers that they were students earning money for college. \"It was a real tearjerker spiel that made me uncomfortable,\" he recalled.\n\nBottinor did believe in the product, though, and said he had no problems telling prospective buyers \"that it would only cost pennies a day for their child to have all this wonderful information at their fingertips ... information that would give them a tremendous advantage at school.\"\n\nHe and his fellow salesmen met in a designated parking lot each morning and were driven to different neighborhoods in groups of five.\n\n\"One by one,\" Bottinor said, \"we were dropped off on street corners, told to do both sides of the street and that we would be picked up several blocks down. It was the end of June and very hot. We were all sweating profusely.\"\n\nBottinor said he did well, selling on a good day two sets of encyclopedias — even if he never made the kind of money mentioned in the ad.\n\n\"The following summer,\" Bottinor added, \"a kid came to the door with the same spiel. He started it — and I finished it for him.\"\n\nAnd, no, Bottinor didn't have to look it up.\n\n(Encyclopaedia Britannica released its last print version in 2012, concentrating since then on digital distribution.

Jeff Flake says he will not seek re-election in 2018, citing nastiness of Trump-era politics\n\nLevin is leaving after three decades of doing everything from fighting to make sure Social Security isn't privatized to securing a bailout for the domestic auto industry and overseeing the passage of the Affordable Care Act as the chairman of the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means committee.\n\nHis departure from Congress at the end of 2018 is just the latest departure of veteran Michigan representatives, many of whom held powerful positions as the chairs of key committees, including U.S. Reps. John Dingell, D-Dearborn, Dave Camp, R-Midland, Candice Miller, R-Harrison Township, Dale Kildee, D-Flint and Mike Rogers, R-Brighton. When they left Congress over the last six years, they had a combined length of service of 141 years and significant clout in the halls of the nation's Capitol.\n\nIn the last three election cycles, eight of Michigan’s 14 members of Congress have retired. If U.S. Rep. John Conyers, D-Detroit, resigns from office or decides not to run for reelection in 2018 because of a sexual harassment scandal, only U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph, would remain from Michigan's stable of veterans with more than 10 years of experience in Congress.\n\nU.S. Rep. David Trott, R-Birmingham, who was first elected in 2014, also has announced that he won’t run for reelection in 2018.\n\n“As I look back at what we accomplished, I think of John Dingell’s career. I think of when Bob Traxler and Bill Ford were here and the amount that we got to save the Rouge River,” Levin said of his former colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives. “The challenge now is to elect members who will try to really provide major strength for Michigan.”\n\nRead more:Nancy Pelosi calls for Rep. John Conyers' resignation amid sexual misconduct allegations\n\nLevin decried the lack of bipartisanship currently on Capitol Hill and fondly recalled the times when he would go on trade trips with members from both sides of the aisle.\n\n“The fellow I beat, when I first ran for Congress, was Jerry Rosen. I played squash with him afterwards and he beat me,” Levin said. “And I’ve had a warm relationship with the person who beat me for governor, Bill Milliken. I’ve been blessed with that kind of feeling and environment and I’d like to help to renew that when I leave Congress.”\n\nHe also misses his younger brother — former U.S. Sen. Carl Levin, the Detroit Democrat who retired in 2015.\n\n“I miss him. It took me a long time not to push the button on my phone to call Carl. I had to learn his cell phone number,” Levin said. “He left with a sense of joy and so do I, with no regrets.”\n\nLevin's history of public service started early. He was president of his class at Central High School in Detroit and student body president at the University of Chicago, where he got a bachelor's degree followed by a master's degree at Columbia University and a law degree from Harvard University. In 1952, he was elected national chairman of the Students for Democratic Action and participated in civil rights marches and voting registration drives in the south.\n\nThe activism led to campaigns, which led to his first electoral success in 1965 when he won a seat in the state Senate, where he served until 1970 when he ran, and lost, a race for governor against Milliken, losing to him again in 1974.\n\nHe won a seat in Congress in 1982 and won reelection 17 more times. He has been a member of the influential, tax-writing Ways and Means committee, serving as chairman of the body for six months in 2010 at a time when the Affordable Care Act was winning approval in Congress.\n\nThere have been many victories for him to savor, Levin said, leading the effort to defeat a privatization of Social Security, the passage of Obamacare, his work on trade issues and the concerted efforts of the Michigan delegation to ensure that the domestic auto industry survived with the help of a federal bailout during the last recession.\n\n\"And that saving of the auto industry, economically, if we hadn’t been able to do that, Michigan would have been in desperate, desperate state,\" he said. \"Every time I look at a picture of Carl and me at one of those meetings, it reminds me how close the Big 3 came to falling apart.\"\n\nBut now, it's time to turn the reins over to the next generation. Names that have popped up as possible successors to Levin include his son Andy Levin, a Bloomfield Township Democrat and president of Levin Energy, which deals with clean energy initiatives, and state Sen. Steve Bieda, D-Warren.\n\nRumors of Levin's retirement have been swirling for a couple of months. He stepped aside as the ranking Democrat of the House Ways and Means Committee last year, his longtime chief of staff, Hilarie Chambers, stepped down from that role, and Levin didn't hold his traditional birthday fundraiser this year.\n\nBut he still believes there is much work to do in his final year, including fighting continuing efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the current battles over tax reform as well as working on the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Act, adding. \"We’ve got a major schedule ahead of us in the next year.\"\n\n\"Everybody has to judge their time and I just think it wise to step down as ranking member on Ways and Means to give others a chance,\" Levin said. \"I’m going into my 36th year. It's time for me to keep working, but just not in Congress.\"\n\nSander Levin\n\nResidence: born and raised in Detroit, lives in Royal Oak, Michigan.\n\nPolitics: state Senate 1965-70.

He is also a former chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, where he drew the ire of environmentalists over his denunciations of climate change as a “hoax.”\n\nInhofe won reelection as recently as 2020, and had already planned to make his current term his last. His resignation will likely spark a furious GOP battle for a seat to represent one of the nation’s most conservative states.\n\nIn an interview with The Oklahoman, Inhofe endorsed his top aide, Luke Holland, for the November election to replace him.\n\nA number of Oklahoma Republicans are viewed as potential contenders for the seat, including Holland, Lt.

The one thing we know for certain is that Hell will freeze over before Democrats win this U.S. Senate seat.”\n\nIn his statement, Inhofe noted his 55-year political career – from the state legislature to Tulsa mayor to the US House and Senate – began after he realized he had to visit 27 government offices to obtain a dock permit.\n\n“If we wanted the government to work for the people, not against the people, it was up to us to make a change,” said Inhofe.\n\nSenate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell praised Inhofe after the announcement.\n\n“I know the Inhofes will be glad to have more time with their consummate family man,” said McConnell. “And while the Senate will miss one of its foremost experts on defense policy, I am glad our friend will continue to serve with us through the end of this Congress.”\n\nThe New York Times first reported that Inhofe planned to resign.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments Friday.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers Manu Raju", "Alex Rogers", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/12/05/republican-democratic-lawmakers-leaving-congress-2024/71814547007/", "title": "Dozens of Republican, Democratic lawmakers leaving Congress ...", "text": "Rep.

Ken Buck cited “insidious narratives” within his own party, in a video posted to X, formerly Twitter, announcing his retirement at the end of his term.\n\n“Too many Republican leaders are lying to America, claiming that the 2020 election was stolen, describing January 6 as an unguided tour of the Capitol and asserting that the ensuing prosecutions are a weaponization of our justice system,” Buck said.\n\nBuck, currently in his fifth term in the House, called election denial and the fractured climate in Congress a “significant departure” from his party’s conservative history.\n\nRep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., cast a wider net when announcing her retirement.\n\n“Right now, Washington, D.C. is broken; it is hard to get anything done,” Lesko, who is in her is in her third term representing a district in the northwest Phoenix area, wrote in a statement in October.\n\nSen.

She then guided Democrats as they rode the waves of popular opinion, seeing their power swell to a 257-seat majority after the 2008 elections, ultimately crash to a 188-seat minority, and then rise once again.\n\nHer political career was marked by an extraordinary ability to understand and overcome those political shifts, keeping conflicting factions of her party united in passing major legislation. She earned the Speaker’s gavel twice – after the 2006 and 2018 elections – and lost it after the 2010 elections.\n\nOf late, she has conducted a string of accomplishments with one of the slimmest party splits in history, passing a $1.9 trillion pandemic aid package last year and a $750 billion health care, energy and climate bill in August.\n\nHer legislative victories in the Biden era cemented her reputation as one of the most successful party leaders in Congress. During the Obama administration, Pelosi was instrumental to the passage of the massive economic stimulus bill and the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which provides over 35 million Americans health care coverage.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the California liberal has been relentlessly attacked by Republicans, who portray her as the personification of a party for the coastal elite. “We have fired Nancy Pelosi,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Fox News on Wednesday, after Republicans won back the chamber.\n\nIn recent years, the anger directed toward her has turned menacing. During the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, pro-Trump rioters searched for her — and last month, a male assailant attacked Paul Pelosi, the speaker’s husband, with a hammer at the couple’s home in San Francisco, while she was in Washington.\n\nPelosi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper this month that her decision to retire would be influenced by the politically motivated attack. Paul Pelosi was released from the hospital two weeks ago after surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his arm and hands.\n\nAfter thanking her colleagues for their well-wishes for Paul, the House chamber broke out into a standing ovation.\n\nDemocrats now look to finally choose Pelosi’s successor\n\nPelosi’s long reign became a source of tension within her own party. She won the gavel after the 2018 elections by promising her own party that she would leave her leadership post by 2022.\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, who previously tried to oust Pelosi, told CNN it’s time for a new chapter.\n\n“She’s a historic speaker who’s accomplished an incredible amount, but I also think there are a lot of Democrats ready for a new chapter,” said Moulton.\n\nBut some Democrats praised Pelosi and said they wished she would remain leader. Asked about her decision, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer clutched his chest and said he had pleaded with her to stay.\n\n“I told her when she called me and told me this and all that, I said ‘please change your mind. We need you here,’” Schumer said.\n\nHouse Democrats appear likely to choose New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, to succeed Pelosi as leader, though Democrats won’t vote until November 30.\n\nAfter her speech, Pelosi wouldn’t tell reporters who’d she support. But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn announced they would also step down from their leadership posts, and endorsed Jeffries to succeed Pelosi. Hoyer said Jeffries “will make history for the institution of the House and for our country.” Clyburn added that he hoped Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar would join Jeffries in House Democratic leadership.\n\nBefore Pelosi’s announcement, Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, told CNN that she expects her caucus to throw their support behind Jeffries, and help him become the first Black House Democratic leader.\n\n“If she steps aside, I’m very clear that Hakeem Jeffries is the person that I will be voting for and leading the Congressional Black Caucus to vote for,” said Beatty.”I don’t always speak for everybody, but I’m very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries.”\n\nRetiring North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a former CBC chairman, told CNN that Jeffries “is prepared for the moment” if Pelosi steps aside. Butterfield said he thought Jeffries would run.\n\nThe longtime Democratic leader told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that members of her caucus had asked her to “consider” running in the party’s leadership elections at the end of the month, adding: “But, again, let’s just get through the election.”\n\nAny decision to run again, Pelosi said, “is about family, and also my colleagues and what we want to do is go forward in a very unified way, as we go forward to prepare for the Congress at hand.”\n\n“Nonetheless, a great deal is at stake because we’ll be in a presidential election. So my decision will again be rooted in the wishes of my family and the wishes of my caucus,” she continued. “But none of it will be very much considered until we see what the outcome of all of this is. And there are all kinds of ways to exert influence.”\n\nPelosi is a towering figure in American politics with a history-making legacy of shattering glass ceilings as the first and so far only woman to be speaker of the US House of Representatives.\n\nPelosi was first elected to the House in 1987, when she won a special election to fill a seat representing California’s 5th Congressional District.\n\nWhen she was first elected speaker, Pelosi reflected on the significance of the event and what it meant for women in the United States.\n\n“This is an historic moment,” she said in a speech after accepting the speaker’s gavel. “It’s an historic moment for the Congress. It’s an historic moment for the women of America.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers Annie Grayer Manu Raju", "Alex Rogers", "Annie Grayer", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/08/30/2020-congressional-retirements-tilting-heavily-republican/2155526001/", "title": "Election 2020: House and Senate members retiring from office", "text": "WASHINGTON – While all eyes are on who could be the future occupant of the White House, the battle over control in both chambers of Congress is also heating up, especially as more lawmakers announce their retirement.\n\nThe retirements, most of which were announced by Republicans, open up a series of key races ahead of the 2020 elections as Republicans try to fend off Democrats aiming to take control of the Senate and maintain, or perhaps grow, their majority in the House.\n\nHere is the list of lawmakers who have announced they aren't running to keep their seats in 2020.\n\nHouse\n\nSo far, 30 members of the House have announced they won't be running in 2020 or have already left off: twenty-three Republicans and seven Democrats.\n\nAmong those leaving Congress are two of House Republicans' 13 women, including the female lawmaker that was tasked with recruiting more conservative women and minorities to the body.\n\nPhil Roe: Republican representing Tennessee's 1st District\n\nRoe, who has served in Congress for 11 years and is the top Republican on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, announced he would retire at the end of the 116th Congress.\n\n\"I’ll leave Congress at the end of the year knowing that our nation’s heroes are better served today because of our work,\" he said.\n\nRoe's district in central Tennessee has been a safe Republican seat for decades.\n\nMark Meadows: Republican representing North Carolina's 11th District\n\nMeadows declared he would not run again the day after President Donald Trump was impeached by the House.\n\nThe former chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus and staunch Trump ally said in a statement that his work with the president's administration \"is only beginning,\" but he did not offer specifics.\n\n\"This President has accomplished incredible results for the country in just three years, and I’m fully committed to staying in the fight with him and his team to build on those successes and deliver on his promises for the years to come,\" Meadows said\n\nDuncan Hunter: Republican representing California's 50th District\n\nHunter announced he would be resigning from Congress \"shortly after the holidays\" after pleading guilty in federal court to misusing campaign funds.\n\n\"It has been an honor to serve the people of California's 50th District, and I greatly appreciate the trust they have put in me over these last 11 years,\" the Republican lawmaker said in a statement.\n\nHunter and his wife were indicted on 60 counts of campaign finance violations of spending $250,000 in campaign funds in personal usage by federal prosecutors in August 2018.\n\nThe district in Southern California is traditionally Republican.\n\nHunter won re-election by 3 points in 2018, despite facing the indictment.\n\nGeorge Holding: Republican representing North Carolina's 2nd District\n\nHolding, who has served in Congress since 2013, announced his retirement in a Dec. 6 statement, citing the heavy Democratic lean of his new congressional district among the reasons for his retirement.\n\n\"I should add, candidly, that, yes, the newly redrawn Congressional Districts were part of the reason I have decided not to seek reelection,\" he said in a statement.\n\nHolding's Raleigh-area district was redrawn after a federal court ruled North Carolina's congressional districts were illegally gerrymandered.\n\nTom Graves: Republican representing Georgia's 14th District\n\nGraves, who was first elected to Congress in 2010, announced in a Dec. 5 tweet he would be retiring from Congress.\n\nIn a letter to constituents, the member of the House Appropriations Committee said he had entered a \"new season in life\" and would not be seeking re-election.\n\nThe heavily Republican district in northwest Georgia is likely to remain in Republican control.\n\nDenny Heck: Democrat representing Washington's 10th District\n\nRep.

Susan Brooks, one of only 13 Republican women in the House as well as the head of GOP recruitment for 2020, announced she would not run for re-election in an exclusive interview with USA TODAY on June 14.\n\nMore:Exclusive: GOP lawmaker who sought to recruit more women to run in 2020 is herself retiring\n\n“While it may not be time for the party, it’s time for me personally,” Brooks, 58, said. Democrats have been eyeing her district, which includes the wealthy northern Indianapolis suburban areas, as potentially flippable as Republican support has eroded in some suburban areas under Trump.\n\nDave Loebsack Democrat representing Iowa's 2nd District\n\nRep.

Hill said claims that she was in a relationship with her legislative director are \"absolutely false.\"\n\nSenate\n\nFive members of the Senate have announced they won't run for re-election in 2020, including four Republicans.\n\nDemocrats are hoping to take control of the chamber as they did with the House in 2018. In the midterms, though, Senate Republicans were not only able to fend off Democrats, they also picked up two seats.\n\nBut the 2020 election will differ from the midterms as the president will be on the ballot. Voter sentiment about Trump is likely to play a bigger role in determining who turns out at the polls and which party they support.\n\nIn 2020, Democrats need to gain four seats, only three if they take the White House. Twelve Democrats and 22 Republicans are up for re-election in 2020. Many of the GOP seats are in red states that previously voted for Trump but the retirement announcements could help in a number of key races.\n\nJohnny Isakson Republican representing Georgia\n\nSen. Johnny Isakson announced Aug. 28 that he will retire at year's end, a departure that sets up a rare election in November 2020 when both of the state's Senate seats will be on the ballot and teeing up what could become a battle for Republicans to retain the state.\n\nThe 74-year-old lawmaker said he is leaving the job he loves because \"mounting\" health issues, including Parkinson's disease, are \"taking their toll\" on his work, family and staff.\n\nMike Enzi Republican representing Wyoming\n\nSen.

Pat Roberts, the longest-serving member of Congress in Kansas history, announced on Jan. 4 that he won’t run again in 2020, setting up a scramble to replace him in a GOP-leaning state where Democrats are energized by key victories in last year’s midterm elections.\n\nThe 82-year-old, four-term senator was likely to have faced grueling primary and general election contests next year.\n\nLamar Alexander Republican representing Tennessee\n\nAfter roughly a quarter-century in elected office, Sen.

Andy Biggs, the hard-right Arizona Republican and one-time leader of the House Freedom Caucus, announced he will be a candidate for the speakership when the full House votes on January 3.\n\n“I’m running for Speaker to break the establishment,” Biggs wrote on Twitter. “Kevin McCarthy was created by, elevated by, and maintained by the establishment.”\n\nTo become elected speaker, McCarthy can only afford to lose four votes when the House meets next month. Last month when he defeated Biggs for his party’s nomination, McCarthy lost 31 votes despite winning 188. Now with Biggs’ candidacy, McCarthy detractors can vote for an alternative to run the new House, which will have 222 GOP seats.\n\nIf McCarthy can’t win 218 votes on the first ballot, it will go to multiple ballots until someone does – something that hasn’t happened in about a century.\n\nSteve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, told CNN he won’t speculate about the possibility that he could emerge as a candidate for speaker on January 3 if McCarthy can’t get 218 votes to win the gavel.\n\n“No, I’m not going to get into speculation,” Scalise said. “Obviously our focus is on getting it resolved by January 3. And there’s a lot of conversations that everybody has been having, Kevin, surely, with the members who have expressed concerns.”\n\n“I think this is all theatrics,” said Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas, a McCarthy supporter.\n\nThe move comes as the speakership fight has begun to overshadow their party’s plans in the majority, even as some in his conference have called on McCarthy to take a firmer stand on how he would run the House – including over raising the national debt limit – and as the California Republican on Tuesday night sketched out in lengthy detail on his website investigative plans for when Republicans get committee gavels and subpoena power next year.\n\nIn a closed-door meeting on Tuesday, House Republicans engaged in a back-and-forth over the speaker’s race, with McCarthy and his allies calling for the conference to come together over the speaker’s vote and his detractors pushing back, according to multiple GOP sources.\n\nEven the time limits imposed at the microphones became an issue, as House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia had an exchange over the matter, according to a source in the room.\n\nAfter the testy back-and-forth, Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee attempted to bring some levity to the moment by joking that the only woman he lets disrespect him is his wife. He added that conference meetings are a waste of time and no one learns anything from them, a sentiment met with a round of cheers, sources said.\n\nAfter the meeting, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – a controversial conservative and close ally of former President Donald Trump – confirmed she spoke up in favor of McCarthy and said she is “sick and tired” of the so-called “Never Kevin” movement, even though some of them are her friends. She urged them to back down, saying they’re going to look foolish if the floor fight delays their majority.\n\nYet some Republicans were not persuaded.\n\nIn the meeting, Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina told Republicans he wouldn’t be instructed over how to vote and that he would take the next 28 days and decide on his own, according to GOP sources. Norman confirmed his closed-door comments.\n\n“It should be testy,” Norman told CNN. “We’re getting to elect the No. 1 job in the country.”\n\nRep. Chip Roy, the Texas Republican, defended the effort by hardline Republicans to extract concessions from McCarthy and potentially send the House speaker’s race into multiple ballots on January 3. Roy has not said how he would vote.\n\n“It’s nothing new in our history,” Roy said. “This is normal, we’re having a debate, just like, by the way, the Democrats did last time, remember? I mean, there was an enormous discussion heading into the Speaker’s race in the last Congress about the Democrats” who were voting against Nancy Pelosi, though most ultimately did.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Manu Raju Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/04/politics/devin-nunes-resigns-from-congress/index.html", "title": "Devin Nunes officially resigns from Congress | CNN Politics", "text": "1.

I know my work is only getting started,\" McCarthy said in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThough McCarthy’s next steps are uncertain, he has promised to stay involved in Republican politics.The California Republican declined to make another bid for the gavel after being removed as speaker in October.\n\n\"I will continue to recruit our country’s best and brightest to run for elected office. The Republican Party is expanding every day, and I am committed to lending my experience to support the next generation of leaders,\" McCarthy said.\n\nEight Republicans voted with House Democrats in October to remove the California Republican from his leadership post.\n\nWhen one of the eight GOP members who voted to oust McCarthy, Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., was asked by USA TODAY what he thought about McCarthy's departure, he smiled: \"I thank him for his service and wish him well.\"\n\nRegardless of his ouster, McCarthy, in a video after his announcement, said he is \"proud of what we have accomplished,\" touting the bipartisan debt ceiling agreement he struck with President Joe Biden to avert a catastrophic default and his efforts to avoid a government shutdown. Both of those deals played a role in his eventual removal from the speakership by a conservative rebellion.\"\n\n\"Simply put, we did the right thing,\" McCarthy said.\n\nRep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., an outspoken McCarthy supporter during the speaker contest after his removal, said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that McCarthy \"is a leader of conviction and I have been proud to stand alongside him.\"\n\n\"We will miss you on the House Floor, my friend,\" Gimenez said.\n\nMcCarthy's fellow California Republican, Rep. Kevin Kiley, said the former speaker is \"irreplaceable in terms of the value that he brought to our delegation and the entire conference.\"\n\nMatt Gaetz, the Florida conservative who led the efforts to force McCarthy out of the speakership, wrote on X: \"McLeavin.'\"\n\nMcCarthy's departure also further narrows the razor-thin GOP majority in the House. After his resignation, Republicans will control the lower chamber by just a three-seat margin, further complicating House Speaker Mike Johnson's bid to pass conservative legislation.\n\nAfter McCarthy's departure from Congress, California Gov. Gavin Newsom must declare a special election to fill the vacancy within 14 days, according to California law. After that declaration, the special election must be held within 126 to 140 days. McCarthy's seat is considered a safe Republican district, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\n\nRep.

What's pushing them out?", "text": "WASHINGTON – Forget running for re-election. House Republicans are running for the exits instead.\n\nOn Wednesday, South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy — chairman of the powerful House Oversight Committee — became the third GOP lawmaker in just the past week to announce plans to leave Congress at the end of this term.\n\nAll told, 41 Republican House members have said they will either retire or seek another office, compared to 16 Democrats, according to the House Press Gallery. Some of those lawmakers have been forced out amid sexual-harassment allegations, while others are running for governor or the Senate.\n\nBut at least nine are influential committee chairmen who, like Gowdy, are leaving with no scandal afoot. So what’s pushing these gavel-wielding lawmakers out the House door?\n\nA toxic stew of congressional dysfunction, perilous electoral prospects, term limits on committee chairmen and an increasingly rightward tilting party with a president widely seen as erratic at its helm.\n\n“Washington’s not a very pleasant place for anybody,” said former representative Tom Davis, a Virginia Republican who retired in 2008 after 14 years in the House. “The polarization and all the gamesmanship” can be grinding, Davis said, and the rewards aren’t very sweet these days.\n\n“The public hates you,” he said. “It doesn’t mean you don’t get re-elected, but you’re not getting great outcomes.”\n\nJust look at Congress’ legislative plate right now: a spending standoff that threatens a second government shutdown in a matter of weeks, an explosive immigration debate with no clear solution and a presidential infrastructure proposal that appears dead on arrival.\n\nAnother helping, anyone?\n\n“There is a time to come and a time to go,” Gowdy tweeted Wednesday. The former federal prosecutor said he wanted to leave politics and return to the justice system.\n\n“Whatever skills I may have are better utilized in a courtroom than in Congress, and I enjoy our justice system more than our political system,” he said in a statement.\n\nGowdy’s announcement came on the heels of two others: Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Pat Meehan said he would not run for re-election last week after news emerged that a former aide had accused him of sexual harassment. And on Monday, New Jersey Republican Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen announced that he would also retire rather than seek another term in November. Frelinghuysen last year became chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, once considered the most powerful perch in Congress.\n\nRead more:\n\nHouse Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy to retire\n\nReports: Rep. Patrick Meehan denies sexually harassing staffer he called a 'soul mate'\n\nGOP retirements boost Democrats' hopes for taking the House in 2018\n\nBut with earmarks banned — making it nearly impossible to bring home pet projects or use the promise of them as leverage in negotiations — and spending bills mired in the legislative mud, the committee has lost some of its luster. And Frelinghuysen’s decision was at least in part a nod to the electoral landscape.\n\nDemocrats are hoping to ride a wave of anti-Trump anger to regain the House majority in November. Frelinghuysen would have faced a tough re-election in his swing New Jersey district, where several Democrats were already lining up to challenge him.\n\nThe party that controls the White House generally loses seats in the midterm elections, and several non-partisan political analysts believe that President Trump’s dismal approval ratings will be a significant added drag on Republican congressional candidates.\n\nDavid Wasserman, a political analyst with the non-partisan Cook Political Report, said a wave election dissent may already be forming, giving lawmakers a heads up to get out of the way.\n\n“In past cycles when the House has changed parties, members haven’t seen it coming until a couple months out,” Wasserman said. “The difference is now Republicans have a choice between filing for re-election or retiring or running for other office. And many of them are deciding that it’s not worth trying to ride this out.”\n\nEven those in safe House seats aren’t sure they want to stay in office if it means being in the minority, Wasserman said. In the House, the minority has almost no power to influence legislation or set the agenda.\n\nDavis agreed and said some Republicans have become “uncomfortable” with the party, as it has shifted rightward and now is led by Trump.\n\n“This is not the party that they grew up with,” Davis said. “The Republican base had kind of rotated from the country club to the country.”\n\nJesse Hunt, a spokesman for the House Republican campaign committee, rejected the suggestion that Republicans were leaving because their party was about to be out of power.\n\n“The vast majority of retirements are term-limited chairmen who hail from deeply Republican districts,” Hunt said.\n\nIn the House, Republicans operate under rules that limit committee chairman to six years no matter how long they serve in Congress. Wasserman and others agree that dynamic is playing a role in driving even powerful and safely ensconced lawmakers out.\n\n“Many members spend years in Congress climbing up the ranks to become a committee chair, but if you’re termed out after a couple cycles, you can suddenly find yourself with less power,” said Wasserman. “Upward mobility is essential to many members.”\n\nDavis said that rule was imposed in the 1990s because committee chairman had become too powerful. But it inadvertently made congressional leaders too powerful, and the legislative process has suffered as a result.\n\nAdd the gridlock and partisanship, Davis said, and the job just isn’t appealing anymore.\n\n“You wait, sitting around all day, waiting for the deal and then I vote yes or no. That’s it,” he said. “That’s why I left. You look at this and you say, 'Geez, what am I doing here?' \"\n\nContributing: Nicole Gaudiano", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/31"}]}

But it wasn’t too tricky for the 40-year rap veterans to rock a rhyme, closing out the show and being introduced by none other than producer extraordinaire Jermaine Dupri.\n\nThe roster of artists on the bill for the night somehow wasn't enough, with special guests from the godfather of hip-hop DJ Kool Herc (and its godmother, Cindy Campbell, whose party at which the genre originated in 1973) to The Fugees fronted by the fashionable (and fashionably late) Lauryn Hill, who put on a surprise set alongside Nas.\n\nHip-hop is the great unifier. People from each New York borough, all walks of life and multiple generations joined in unison as rap titans of past and present brought their biggest hits (and audience favorites) to the stage.\n\nTo attempt to name every single act who graced the stage during the marathon six-plus-hour show would be a laundry list (like T.I., Cam'ron, Common, Roxanne Shante, Slick Rick, Trina, etc.), only skimming the surface of hip-hop's most notable contributors. But at the jam-packed stadium, these moments ascended to legendary heights.\n\nHip-hop turns 50:50 essential hip-hop songs to celebrate the anniversary, including Grandmaster Flash, Jay-Z, Outkast, more\n\nNew York is in the house! Run-D.M.C., Nas, Wu-Tang Clan, more show hip-hop's roots\n\nWhen a New Yorker took the stage, it was evident before they even opened their mouths, rocking Yankees jerseys, the quintessential bling-iest of bling bling, Timberlands and some iconic pairs of Adidas sneakers.\n\nFor their last performance together, heads topped with their signature black fedoras, Joseph \"Run\" Simmons and Darryl \"D.M.C.\" McDaniels of Run-D.M.C. ran through their biggest hits from \"Walk This Way\" and \"Here We Go\" to \"My Adidas\" (as the crowd on the floor held up Adidas shoes in the air), taking the mics after 1 a.m.\n\nWhile Nas is a legend in his own right, performing his \"N.Y. State of Mind\" and \"One Mic\" among others, he paid homage to his musical peers and the man behind it all: The Fugees and DJ Kool Herc. Nas shared a hug with DJ Kool Herc on stage, bowing down to the \"creator\" of hip-hop. Lauryn Hill emerged onto the stage in a hot pink tulle gown alongside The Fugees for a rousing performance, including \"Killing Me Softly With His Song,\" \"Doo-Wop (That Thing)\" and \"If I Ruled the World.\"\n\nFat Joe, who may as well be mayor of the Bronx, joined forces with the best of New York, including Remy Ma for \"Lean Back\" and \"All The Way Up,\" plus Ashanti for \"What’s Luv?\" and KRS-One for \"Bronx Tale\" (honorable mention to b-boy Crazy Legs, whose breakdancing opened the set).\n\nWu-Tang Clan members Ghostface Killah, Method Man, Cappadonna and Inspectah Deck got back in action with a rowdy mix of classics like \"C.R.E.A.M.\" (preceded by a chorus of \"Cheers\" theme song \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name\") and \"Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing Ta F' Wit.\"\n\nDJ Kid Capri played a full set, briefly taking it to the new age before giving people what they came for, scratching the old-school hits.

And note: It focuses exclusively on people and bands born in Wisconsin — leaving out, for instance, former Madison resident and \"Funky Drummer\" Clyde Stubblefield, or longtime Milwaukee soul man and \"Disco Lady\" writer Harvey Scales, who was born in Arkansas.\n\nBut their collective legacy shows the mark Wisconsin has made on the music we listened to, and still listen to.

Ava Max\n\nIt's true that Ava Max's career is just getting started; she released her debut full-length album, \"Heaven & Hell,\" last fall.

The Wausau native only lasted a year in that band, but he continued to work with Miller on stage and in the studio, and with Miller's Chicago-born, Racine-raised keyboardist Ben Sidran. He also established the Pacific Northwest Blues in the Schools program in the Seattle area.\n\nListen to: The dreamy \"Sacrifice\" on Miller's platinum-selling 1977 \"Book of Dreams\" album, which Cooke co-wrote.

The following year, he was playing Native American flute on Vanessa Williams' version of the Oscar-winning \"Colors of the Wind\" for the Disney film \"Pocahontas.\" He's collected three Grammys since then, toured with Eddie Vedder and Arlo Guthrie, and has a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Native American Music Awards and Association.\n\nListen to: The quietly epic instrumental \"Wind Spirit,\" led by Miller's majestic flute, from his 2006 album \"The Spirit of Survival.\"\n\n47.

And he's been gracious enough to share some of his tricks in instruction books and lessons; Guitar World proclaimed Koch one of the greatest guitar teachers of all time.\n\nListen to: Koch's instrumental group with his son Dylan on drums, the Koch Marshall Trio, is one of his most popular bands, and the band's \"Sin Repent Repeat\" is one of the outfit's most intoxicating songs.\n\nRELATED:Guitar World names Milwaukee's Greg Koch one of the world's greatest guitar teachers\n\n45. Joe Schermie\n\nThree Dog Night had 14 top 20 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, and six gold and one platinum album, from 1968 to 1972, when Madison-born bassist Schermie was part of the band.\n\nListen to: Three Dog Night's cover of the Randy Newman-penned \"Mama Told Me Not To Come\" — their first Hot 100 chart-topper — is better known today than the original recording, with Schermie's bass lending a funky vibe to this trippy tale of debauchery.\n\n44. Spanic Boys\n\nWhen Sinead O'Connor scrapped plans to be a musical guest on \"Saturday Night Live\" with just three days' notice in 1990, the show's then-bandleader G.E. Smith reached out to this little-known Milwaukee father-and-son-led rock band to fill the slot. Interview requests and orders for their album came pouring in, and together Tom Spanic and his son Ian were able to make eight albums and tour across the United States and Europe several times.\n\nListen to: \"Meant to Be,\" from the Spanic Boys' 1991 album \"Strange World.\" After Tom died in 2016, Ian told the Journal Sentinel it was one of his father's favorite songs to sing together.\n\nRELATED:Tom Spanic remembered for music career with his son\n\n43.

Korey Cooper\n\nChristian rock act Skillet was founded by John Cooper in his native Memphis, but Cooper and his wife and bandmate Korey Cooper ultimately settled in Korey's native Kenosha around 2005.

Danny Gokey\n\nThere have been plenty of singing-show competitors from Wisconsin, but none as successful as Milwaukee-born Gokey.

Dan Nimmer\n\nLearning to play piano by ear before honing his chops at the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music, the Milwaukee native was recruited to the prestigious Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, led by Wynton Marsalis, in 2005, just a year after moving to New York. Beyond his orchestra work, he has recorded on several Marsalis projects and is the leader of his own trio.\n\nListen to: \"Hallelujah I Love Her So,\" the opening track on a live Marsalis and Willie Nelson tribute album to Ray Charles, with Nimmer's swinging piano a standout.\n\n39. Killdozer\n\nLike their Touch and Go Records label mates Die Kreuzen, Madison-based post-hardcore band Killdozer recorded with Butch Vig at Smart Studios in Madison, and their 1989 album \"Twelve Point Buck\" was a turning point, influencing the likes of Nirvana and Smashing Pumpkins, who ended up working with Vig as well.\n\nListen to: \"Buck\" opener \"New Pants and Shirt\" showcases Killdozer pleasingly punishing style, with Michael Gerald growling menacingly over the Hobson brothers Bill and Dan's sludgy guitar and sluggish drums.\n\n38. Die Kreuzen\n\n\"They just missed that window where they could have been massive,\" Butch Vig once said of the Milwaukee band, who broke up in 1992 before they were offered a deal with Atlantic Records. Nevertheless, the band's innovative, explosive blend of hardcore punk, metal, glam, gothic rock shoegaze and psychedelia is recognized today as being ahead of its time, finding passionate admirers like Steve Albini and Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore.\n\nListen to: Die Kreuzen had several intense minute-long thrash rockers, but \"Black Song,\" the final track of their last album \"Cement,\" is an epic 7-minute sendoff.\n\nRELATED:A look back at Die Kreuzen's pioneering career\n\n37. Lynne Arriale\n\nGetting first place at the International Great American Jazz Piano Competition in 1993 was just the beginning for the Milwaukee native. Arriale has gone on to tour in 28 countries and play some of the most prestigious venues, including the Kennedy Center, and has consistently earned praise for her albums, frequently ending up on critics' annual best jazz album lists.\n\nListen to: Arriale's body of work is so vast it's hard to recommend an entry point, but a soulful piano rendition of \"Feeling Good\" with the Lynne Arriale Trio is a sublime introduction.\n\n36. Trixie Mattel\n\nAfter winning “RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars” in 2018, Mattel (developed in Milwaukee’s drag scene by Silver Cliff native Brian Firkus) has become the show’s greatest success story. But credit extends beyond Mattel's filthy and dark humor and Barbie-meets-Dolly look; she really stood out with original, tender and funny country songs, helping to spark a growing queer country movement.\n\nListen to: The comical “Mama Don’t Make Me Put on the Dress Again” is a swell showcase for Mattel’s smart songwriting chops.\n\nRELATED:Trixie Mattel is one of the most popular drag queens in the world. And it all started in Milwaukee.\n\n35. Josh Thompson\n\nThe Cedarburg native launched a successful country career in 2009, but beyond his own songs and albums, his greatest achievements have been as a hit songwriter for several superstars, including four Billboard Country Airplay chart-toppers for Jason Aldean, Blake Shelton and Luke Bryan.\n\nListen to: “Drowns the Whiskey,” one of two No. 1 songs Thompson co-wrote for Aldean, a remorseful, brokenhearted tune sweetened by Miranda Lambert’s vocals.\n\n34. Glenn Yarbrough\n\nThe Milwaukee native always had an angelic voice; he helped his mother pay the bills as a paid boy soprano at Grace Church in New York City. But following a private concert with Woody Guthrie in his college dorm room, he was inspired to pick up guitar. By 1960, he formed the popular folk trio the Limeliters, and by the middle of the decade, went solo, achieving his greatest chart success with 1965’s “Baby the Rain Must Fall,” which peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nListen to: “Take My True Love by the Hand,” used to darkly comic effect in arguably the best episode of “Breaking Bad,” “Ozymandias,” from the show’s final season.\n\n33. Kevn Kinney\n\nThe Atlanta-born Drivin N Cryin may embody the sound and swagger of Southern rock, but its frontman is a Midwesterner. The Milwaukee-born Kinney has led the group for 36 years and nine full-length original studio albums, including the Gold-certified 1991 release “Fly Me Courageous.”\n\nListen to: Drivin N Cryin’s devilish “Straight to Hell,” covered in 2017 by Darius Rucker with fellow country stars Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean and Charles Kelley of Lady A.\n\n32.

Stuermer replaced Steve Hackett as Genesis’ touring lead guitarist in 1977, a job he holds to this day, and has been by Phil Collins’ side for his solo career, both in the studio and on tour, in addition to fronting his own band.\n\nListen to: “Something Happened on the Way to Heaven,” Collins’ final Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 from 1990.

Grey has been a go-to songwriter and singer for the rapper ever since, has released her own solo albums, and has been featured on several singles with Macklemore, Nicki Minaj and other stars.\n\nListen to: While Rihanna ended up singing Grey’s chorus on “Love the Way You Lie,” Grey’s piano ballad “I Know You” is a fine showcase for her equally anguished and angelic voice.\n\nRELATED:Wisconsin-born singer-songwriter Skylar Grey ready to soar\n\n30. Andy Hurley\n\nWhen he was a sixth-grader in Menomonee Falls, Hurley wrote for a school assignment that he would be in a band when he grew up.

Tank\n\nBorn Durrell Babbs in Milwaukee, Tank was part of an R&B wave in the early aughts, and was part of the supergroup TGT with Tyrese and Ginuwine. But when Tank's signature falsetto fell out of commercial flavor, he adapted his sound to modern times, dialing back the vocal pyrotechnics to match slick, sparse production flourishes, and achieved the biggest hits of his career in his 40s.\n\nListen to: \"When We,\" the sensual platinum single from 2017 album \"Savage.\"\n\n19.

In June 1991, Jet magazine reported the 50-year-old singer had died of an apparent drug overdose.\n\nFlorence Ballard\n\nDetroit Memorial Park East in Warren\n\nKnown as the lost Supreme or the unsung Supreme to some, Florence Ballard played a key role in the group's foundation. From recruiting Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, and Betty McGlown to The Primettes, to singing lead on \"Buttered Popcorn,\" an early Supremes single, Ballard helped lay the foundations for the group's success. The Supremes found their first hit in 1964 with \"Where Did Our Love Go,\" and leading up to Ballard's dismissal in 1967, the group released 10 No. 1 singles, according to her obituary on Legacy.com.\n\nFollowing Ballard's dismissal from the group due to struggles with alcohol, the singer attempted a solo career, which was quickly brought to an end by ABC Records. After losing her home and a lawsuit against Motown records, Ballard began drinking heavily, according to the Legacy.com obituary. After purchasing another house for her family in 1975, Ballard considered relaunching her music career, but on Feb. 21, 1976, she died at age 32.

By 1965, the group had released a number of hits through Motown Records.\n\nAfter watching police officers beat crowds of protesters in Berkeley, California, Benson began writing a song about the incident with Motown lyric writer Al Cleveland, according to Rolling Stone. On Jan. 20, 1971, Marvin Gaye released the single, and on March 27, 1971, the song hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Lt. Gov Garlin Gilchrist issued a special tribute earlier this year in honor of the famed protest song's 50th anniversary. On July 1, 2005, after suffering from a flurry of health problems, Benson died of lung cancer. He was 69.\n\nPaul Williams\n\nBuried in Lincoln Memorial Park Cemetery in Clinton Township\n\nPaul Williams' voice should be familiar to anyone who's heard of the Temptations with his baritone voice featuring prominently in hits like \"My Girl,\" and \"The Way You Do the Things You Do.\" As a member of the group's classic '60s lineup, Williams was initially responsible for the Temptation's choreography, according to the group's website. Even after he stepped away from the group in 1971, Williams continued to oversee the choreography, according to a 1973 report by the Free Press.\n\nOn Aug. 19, 1973, the Free Press reported Williams was found in the front seat of a car, wearing only swimming trunks with a gunshot wound to the head.

Farr was a first-round draft pick for the Detroit Lions, where he played from 1967 to 1973, according to ESPN. In 1975, Farr purchased his first dealership with money he'd saved from his time playing football. At the height of his business, Farr owned 11 dealerships.

Over the course of her career, Gacioch struck out 162 times out of more than 3,000 at-bats, and pitched a no-hitter in 1953, according to her All-American Girls Professional Baseball League history. Born in Wheeling, Ohio, in 1915, Gacioch's career would serve as inspiration for Rosie O'Donnell's character in the 1992 film \"A League of Their Own.\" She died Sept. 9, 2004, in Clinton, Michigan, according to the Wheeling, Ohio, Hall of Fame.\n\nGeorge Gipp\n\nBuried in Lakeview Cemetery in Calumet\n\nGeorge Gipp, better known as \"The Gipper,\" is the source of college football legend. Gipp was the star player of Notre Dame's undefeated football team in 1920. According to Notre Dame Magazine, Gipp's performance led the team to 19 straight wins in the 1919 and 1920 seasons. In late November 1920, Gipp fell ill. According to legend, the dying Gipp reportedly told Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne that when the team was down and in need of a victory, to ask them to “go in there with all they’ve got and win just one for the Gipper.” He died on Dec. 14, 1920. According to the University of Notre Dame, Rockne told this story to his team on Nov. 10, 1928, rallying his players to victory and cementing the legend.\n\nAutomotive innovators\n\nDavid Buick\n\nBuried in Woodmere Cemetery in Detroit\n\nWhile he might be best known for founding the Buick Motor Co., David Buick was the progenitor of multiple other household innovations, including the yard sprinkler and method of applying enamel to cast iron, creating rust-free sinks and toilets. Despite these achievements, Buick fell into debt and his company was purchased in 1904 prior to selling a single car. According to the Automotive Hall of Fame, Buick left the company in 1906, and died in 1942.\n\nHenry Ford\n\nBuried in Ford Family Cemetery in Detroit\n\nAs one of the men who helped build Detroit's reputation as the Motor City, Henry Ford is among Michigan's most famous innovators. Born in what is now Dearborn in 1863, Ford showed an early interest in machinery. According to The Henry Ford, there is a story of 13-year-old Ford receiving a pocket watch as a gift, and proceeding to take it apart to learn how it worked. Ford would later go on to become chief engineer at the Edison Electric Illuminating Company before inventing his first self-propelled vehicle in 1896 and his second in 1898.\n\nOn June 6, 1903, Ford founded the Ford Motor Co. The company sold its first car just over a month later, according to the Ford Motor Co. website. In 1908, Ford introduced the Model T as a “motorcar for the great multitude,” according to The Henry Ford. While Ford did not invent the automobile or the assembly line, his development of a moving assembly line helped to increase production and lower costs. Ford retired to his Dearborn estate in 1945. He died on April 7, 1947, from a cerebral hemorrhage according to the Ford Motor Co. He was 83.\n\nDodge brothers\n\nBuried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Detroit\n\nJohn Francis and Horace Dodge. From their early days of manufacturing the Evans & Dodge Bicycle, to the release of the first Dodge brothers closed car, the Dodge brothers are key figures in Michigan's automotive history. Before establishing the Dodge Brothers Motor Car Company, the brother also produced engines for Oldsmobile and chassis for Ford, according to MotorCities National Heritage Area. After taking their company public on July 17, 1914, the brothers' company went on to become one of the top automakers in the United States. In 1920, the brothers died within months of each other, John from pneumonia and Horace from influenza. Both brothers were buried at Woodlawn Cemetery.\n\nR.E. Olds\n\nBuried in Mount Hope Cemetery in Lansing\n\nInventor of the Oldsmobile and founder of the Olds Motor Works Co., Ransom E. Olds is another automative innovator with strong Michigan ties. Born in Geneva, Ohio, and raised in Lansing, Olds founded his company in 1897 before taking the company to Detroit in 1900 and reorganizing as the Olds Motor Works, according to the Automotive Hall of Fame. When the Detroit factory was destroyed by a fire in 1901, Olds moved the company back to Lansing. Olds was well known for his charity and helped Michigan State University rebuild its engineering school after the original burned down, according to the R.E. Olds Transportation Museum. Olds died in Lansing on Aug. 25, 1950, at age 86, according to the R.E. Olds Foundation.\n\nA Taste of Michigan\n\nC.W. Post\n\nBuried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Battle Creek\n\nMillionaire cereal manufacturer Charles William Post was one of the key figures in making Battle Creek the cereal city. Post was born in Springfield, Illinois, on Oct. 26, 1954. Post worked in sales and manufacturing and helped to develop the eastern part of Fort Worth, Texas, according to the Texas State Historical Society. After suffering a nervous breakdown in 1891, Post moved to Battle Creek and entered a sanitarium. After recovering, Post began to experiment with a cereal drink he called Postum. He also developed Grape-Nuts and Post-Toasties cereal. In 1914, Post committed suicide while recovering from an operation at his home in Santa Barbara, California, according to a report from the Battle Creek Enquirer.\n\nJames Vernor\n\nBuried in Woodmere Cemetery in Detroit\n\nVernors ginger ale is a Detroit staple, so it should come as no surprised that its creator was also buried in the city. James Vernor was a pharmacist who moved to the city from Albany, New York, when he was a boy. Vernor served in the 4th Michigan Cavalry unit during the Civil War, a unit which was credited with capturing Confederate President Jefferson Davis, according to the Detroit Historical Society. While the story has some variations, a collections associate at The Dr. Pepper Museum in Waco, Texas, said the most popular version is that Vernor created the drink by storing an experimental beverage in an oak cask before leaving for the war. When he returned four years later, Vernor found the beverage improved with age, and Vernor's ginger ale was born. According to the Detroit Historical Society, Vernor opened his own drugstore in 1866 and began selling his soda there. In 1896, Vernor closed the drugstore to open a small plant for manufacturing and bottling his soda. Vernor died from pneumonia and influenza on Oct. 29, 1927, at the age of 84.\n\nJ.H. and W.K. Kellogg\n\nBuried in Oak Hill Cemetery in Battle Creek\n\nIn Battle Creek, Michigan, two feuding brothers gave rise to one of America's best-known cereal companies. John Harvey and William Keith Kellogg served as the progenitors of Kellogg's cornflakes, after John invented the cereal for patients at his Battle Creek sanitarium, NPR reported.\n\nIn 1906, William Kellogg started the Battle Creek Toasted Cornflake Co., which would later become the Kellogg Co. After quitting his job at his brother's sanitarium, William received John's permission to start a cornflakes company after offering him money and stock in the company. After William bought out his brother and found success, John began making his own Kellogg's cereal, NPR reported. The two brothers entered a fierce legal battle, with John, a respected doctor, arguing he was the originator of the cereal and more widely known than his younger brother, according to Medical Historian Howard Markel's book \"The Kelloggs: The Battling Brothers of Battle Creek.\" William argued he had perfected the recipe, legally purchased the rights to the cereal, and that his widespread advertisement of the brand had earned him the commercial rights to the family's surname.\n\nThe case went all the way to the Michigan Supreme Court before it was decided in William's favor. According to Markel, the brothers rarely spoke after the incident. John died at age 91 on Dec. 14, 1943. William did not attend his funeral, according to Markel. William later died on Oct. 6, 1951, at age 91, according to the Kellogg company.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/living-well/ragbrai/2023/01/28/what-to-know-about-ragbrais-50th-anniversary-ride-july-23-29/69840434007/", "title": "RAGBRAI 2023 route, towns, and what to know about the 50th year ...", "text": "The Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa will celebrate 50 years with what is expected to be record registration and quite a few nods to the history of the ride.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the week-long cycling extravaganza.\n\nWhat is RAGBRAI?\n\nIt may be hyperbole, but Iowans like to boast that RAGBRAI is the world's largest annual mobile party. Each summer, cyclists set out from a point on or near the Missouri River in western Iowa and ride seven day-long routes to their destination on the Mississippi River. The route changes from year to year, so almost all of Iowa has participated at one point or another.\n\nMore:He's been on every single RAGBRAI – and probably fixed your bike tires, too\n\nWhat does RAGBRAI stand for?\n\nRAGBRAI stands for the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa.\n\nHow did RAGBRAI begin?\n\nJohn Karras, a copy editor and features writer for the Des Moines Register, and Donald Kaul, the paper’s Washington columnist, hatched the plan for a cross-state bicycle ride and invited their readers along. When they set out from Sioux City on Aug. 26, 1973, for the first day's ride to Storm Lake, a few hundred people joined them. They rode again in 1974 with a growing entourage, and in January 1975, Kaul announced in a short item in the Register that the ride had gained an official name for its planned third edition: the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa.\n\nToday, RAGBRAI is its own organization within Gannett Co., the Register's owner. A dedicated year-round staff organizes the event, which typically draws tens of thousands of participants from across the nation and around the world, though this year, organizers are saying the number of riders could break all records.\n\nMore:Brush up on your RAGBRAI history as the ride across Iowa marks its 50th year\n\nWhat is the RAGBRAI 2023 route for RAGBRAI in 2023?\n\nThis year’s scenic tour of Iowa pays homage to the original bike ride in 1973. Here are the much-anticipated dates and starting, ending and overnight towns for this year’s route:\n\nSunday, July 23 ― Sioux City to Storm Lake.\n\nMonday, July 24 ― Storm Lake to Carroll.\n\nTuesday, July 25 ― Carroll to Ames.\n\nWednesday, July 26 ― Ames to Des Moines.\n\nThursday, July 27 ― Des Moines to Tama-Toledo.\n\nFriday, July 28 ― Tama-Toledo to Coralville.\n\nSaturday, July 29 ― Coralville to Davenport.\n\nMore:What to know about the RAGBRAI L starting, ending and overnight towns\n\nHow are the towns chosen?\n\nThe organizers choose towns from eager applicants across the state. Representatives of the chosen towns celebrated during a route announcement party Jan. 28.\n\nDuring the ride, each town vies to outdo the others with nightly parties, replete with bands, food vendors and, of course, beer.\n\nRiders can bed down for the night at campgrounds and parks. Many rent space in residents' home or yards, with indoor bathroom privileges. Some stay in motor homes driven by supportive friends or relatives. And, of course, any hotel rooms are sold out months in advance.\n\nWhat are meeting or meet-up towns?\n\nThey are selected towns about midway on each day's route where those separated from companions while riding can regroup; those who are too tired to continue can catch a ride on a RAGBRAI support-and-gear “SAG wagon”; and members of teams or others with support drivers can meet them. All can enjoy the offerings of vendors and local restaurants, as well as entertainment.\n\nWhat are pass-through towns?\n\nTowns, some with just a handful of inhabitants, that the ride passes through. The residents often gather to cheer on the riders, and the enterprising among them sell snacks and beverages — or just offer a drink from a garden hose. Pass-through and meeting towns will be announced at a later date.\n\nWhat is the longest day’s ride this year?\n\nWhile this year’s route does not include a mandatory 100-plus mile century ride, riders should still expect quite a few days of heavy bicycling. The longest ride this year will be 83 miles from Carroll to Ames, though there will be two additional days exceeding the 80-mile mark. There will be an optional century loop on Day 3 for those who want to log a 100-mile day.\n\nMore:RAGBRAI 50th anniversary edition hews closely to original route, including stop in Des Moines\n\nWhat is the shortest day's ride this year?\n\nThe shortest ride will be just 50 miles on July 26 from Ames to Des Moines.\n\nWhich day will have the most elevation gain?\n\nKeep your derailleur on low July 27, when riders will gain 3,652 feet of elevation over the course of the day. But don’t think you’re off the hook the rest of the week ― Sunday’s ride will require riders to climb 3,504 feet, and on Friday riders will gain 3,276 feet.\n\nWhat are some major highlights on the RAGBRAI route?\n\nFor the 50th anniversary ride, they’re too numerous to list. But expect more of everything, from church lady pie, grilled pork chops and craft beer to big-name bands, spontaneous dancing, goat yoga and just plain fun.\n\nMore:Northwest Iowa farmer invites RAGBRAI riders to stop by, and they keep coming, and coming, and coming\n\nWill RAGBRAI break a Guinness World Record?\n\nThis year’s organizers will not use the golden anniversary as an opportunity to break the Guinness World Record for the largest single-day “parade of bicycles.” The record ride would have run from Ames to Des Moines on July 26.\n\nThe last time RAGBRAI came to the capital city, in 2013, an estimated 32,000 people rode from Perry to Des Moines, and the last time it came to the Des Moines metro, in 2019, there were 40,000 riders on the road from Winterset to Indianola. RAGBRAI Director Matt Phippen estimates 100,000 people could ride this year’s Day 4 route from Ames to Des Moines, shattering the June 11, 2000, record set when 48,615 people rode an 18.2-mile circuit around the city of Udine, Italy.\n\nHow do I register for RAGBRAI 2023?\n\nRiders can register online on the RAGBRAI website, ragbrai.com. Choose \"RAGBRAI L registration\" under the header titled \"The Ride.”\n\nWhat does registration cover?\n\nGenerally, registration covers the costs of putting together the route and holding the event. Registered riders also can depend on ambulance and paramedic services in case of accidents, as well as SAG wagon rides, and they get discounts and free commemorative patches.\n\nWho can register?\n\nLast year, RAGBRAI ended its long-held registration lottery, which limited weeklong passes to about 12,000 riders. Registration is still capped but now is on a first-come, first-served basis. Phippen would not disclose the cap, but said RAGBRAI works with the Iowa State Patrol and Iowa Department of Transportation to ensure all roads on the route can handle the number of riders expected.\n\nMore:'Shift: The RAGBRAI Documentary' releases trailer; premiere coming in May\n\nHow much does it cost to ride RAGBRAI?\n\nPrices increase as the ride draws nearer, with a May 15 final deadline.

Though some of the best riders may engage in friendly competition, and Lance Armstrong has been known to make an appearance, RAGBRAI is all about riding at whatever pace makes sense to you through the cities, towns and countryside of Iowa, meeting people along the way and, above all, having the time of your life.\n\nStaff writers Philip Joens and Sarah LeBlanc contributed to this article.

Teddy Abrams And Friends: The annual Teddy Abrams And Friends set is something completely unique to Forecastle. Every year, Abrams — the music director of the Louisville Orchestra — puts together what he calls the “Forecastle Symphony,” which is a mixture of classical players and local rock and hip-hop luminaries. The set is always different and unpredictable. In the past, we’ve seen everything from 1200 performing originals to Twin Limb covering David Bowie’s “I’m Afraid Of Americans.” You’ll see moments that will never be recreated.\n\nPro Tip: Find some air conditioning. The beauty of Forecastle’s location is its proximity to Main Street. The festival isn’t held in some dusty field in the middle of nowhere — it’s a five-minute walk to bars and restaurants. Every year, I find weak spots in the lineup, ideally in the late afternoon, and I walk up to Against The Grain, 401 E. Main St., or Bluegrass Brewing Company, 300 W. Main St., and get something to eat and a beer. It saves you some money and a sunburn. And, the air conditioning is rejuvenating after getting pummeled by hours of humidity.\n\nYou may like:Your ultimate guide to (free) outdoor movies this summer in Louisville\n\nTravis Searle\n\nOwner at Guestroom Records\n\nAnderson .Paak & The Free Nationals: We've loved Paak since hearing \"Malibu.\" Yes, \"Lawd\" was our favorite album of 2016 and \"Ventura\" is leading the pack of favorite releases of 2019.

Tom Carper shared that he won't be running for re-election in 2024, others had already announced their plans for the 2024 campaign − with some as early as last year.\n\nIn recent months, candidates vying for New Castle County executive and Wilmington city mayor have launched their respective campaigns, as well as a play for insurance commissioner. Matt Meyer also made his intentions formal in his governor's race announcement in early June.\n\nAs people launch various state and local campaigns for office in the coming weeks and months, stay up to date with us here at Delaware Online/The News Journal for a running list of all the respective candidates.\n\nDover veteran vies for Republican line in Congressional race\n\nDonyale Hall, a 53-year-old veteran, business owner and mother of 10, said Tuesday she is seeking the Republican nomination for Delaware’s at-large U.S. House of Representatives seat.\n\nHall, a biracial African American woman from Dover who has run for political office before, said the platform she’s always run on resonates on any level.\n\nShe said she brings a “unique” perspective to the seat having served in the U.S. Air Force in support of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm; being a survivor of domestic violence; and overall understanding others who feel as though they have been forgotten or overlooked.\n\nHall also seeks to expand small business opportunities and improve the public education system.\n\n“I feel I bring unique vantage points to the things that I feel are problematic with our government,” Hall said. “I’m just continuing to forge a pathway that provides opportunity for people.”\n\nCarney considers mayoral run as Purzycki won't run for 3rd term\n\nWilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki, who easily won two terms as Delaware's largest city's mayor, announced Wednesday he will not seek a third term, citing his age and desire to spend more time with family.\n\nRELATED:Carney expresses interest in Wilmington mayor after Purzycki announces he won't run in 2024\n\nPurzycki saw a city undergo tremendous economic development, while also struggling with ongoing crime. He previously served as the longtime executive director of the Riverfront Development Corp., seen as one of the architects in the development of the Wilmington Riverfront, and served on New Castle County Council in the early 1980s.\n\nFollowing the news of Purzycki not seeking reelection, Delaware Gov. John Carney said he is \"seriously considering\" running for the office.\n\n\"Tracey and I have lived in Wilmington for thirty years, and I care deeply about our city,\" he said on Wednesday. \"While I am focused on serving as Delaware's Governor, it's something I'm seriously considering.\"\n\nHall-Long announces run for Delaware governor\n\nLt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long has announced that she will run for governor in 2024.\n\nHall-Long, if elected, would be the state’s second female governor, following Ruth Ann Minner, who served in the early 2000s. She has spent two decades in public office.\n\nBACKGROUND:Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long announces 2024 run for governor. To face Matt Meyer in primary\n\n“There’s work to do to improve access to health care, create good-paying jobs, protect our rights and strengthen our education system – and I’m up for the challenge, because when you give a nurse a job -- that job gets done,” Hall-Long said in her campaign announcement.\n\nGay announces bid for lieutenant governor\n\nState Sen. Kyle Evans Gay, a Democrat representing North Wilmington, announced in late August the launch of her campaign for lieutenant governor, resulting in an even more competitive race for 2024.\n\nGay was elected to the legislature in 2020, when she flipped a Republican-held seat. The senator previously worked as deputy attorney general in the Delaware Department of Justice before going into private practice. Her campaign video, which featured her two young daughters, focused on parenting.\n\n“Delaware families know that raising kids is hard work, and it’s harder when the deck is stacked against working parents and working people,\" Gay said in her campaign announcement. \"It’s what drove me to run for the State Senate, where I worked to pass bills that make it easier for Delawareans to afford the basics and raise a family.\"\n\n“Delawareans know we have a lot more work to do,\" she said. \"That’s why I’m running for Lieutenant Governor: to make sure Delaware works for working people.”\n\nEugene Young to run for Congress\n\nEugene Young, director of the Delaware State Housing Authority, announced this summer that he is running for Delaware’s at-large U.S. congressional seat.\n\nYoung, who made the announcement in a campaign email, has been viewed as a rising star in Delaware politics for years. If elected, Young would be the first Black man to represent Delaware in Washington, D.C.\n\n“I have a deep, abiding sense of commitment to the state and the people of this state because the state's done so much for me,” Young said in an interview. “So for me, it's about how I serve those men and women and families that make up this wonderful state.”\n\nBlunt Rochester enters as front runner to U.S. Senate race\n\nU.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, Delaware’s sole congresswoman, entered the 2024 U.S. Senate race Wednesday, June 21.\n\nBlunt Rochester, if elected, would become the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to represent The First State in the U.S. Senate – and possibly the third Black woman ever in the country’s history.\n\nREAD:Lisa Blunt Rochester, Delaware's sole congresswoman, will run to fill Carper's Senate seat\n\nThis announcement by Blunt Rochester has been highly anticipated, following U.S. Sen. Tom Carper’s retirement announcement in late May. The senior senator publicly called on the congresswoman to run – admitting she probably should have done so years ago.\n\nColleen Davis to run to U.S. House seat\n\nColleen Davis, state treasurer, announced Wednesday, July 19, that she will run for Delaware’s at-large U.S. House of Representatives seat.\n\nDavis, 43, was largely unknown in Delaware before she ran for treasurer in 2018, defeating Republican incumbent Ken Simpler. She is also one of the rare statewide elected Democrats from Sussex County.\n\nREAD:State Treasurer Colleen Davis enters race for Delaware's US House seat\n\n“Raising three children here in Delaware,” Davis said in an interview, “ I think that we need more leaders in Congress who come from working-class situations as I did growing up.”\n\n“And truly, I'm focused on fighting for families and keeping them safe and secure.\n\nSarah McBride announces historic bid for Congress\n\nState Sen. Sarah McBride, the country’s highest-ranking transgender elected official, announced her candidacy Monday, June 26, to become Delaware’s next sole congresswoman.\n\nMcBride, if elected, would become the first trans person elected to federal office, catapulting the already nationally known politician to an even bigger stage. She would also be the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\n“It's clear that diversity in government is necessary for us to not just ensure we have a healthy democracy but also to truly deliver for people,” she said in an interview with Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nREAD:Sarah McBride announces run for US House seat to become first trans member of Congress\n\nRetired U.S. colonel to run for lieutenant governor\n\nDebbie Harrington, a retired U. S. Army colonel, will run for lieutenant governor in 2024.\n\nThe Middletown resident served in the Army for 25 years. In her retirement, she became an advocate for children with disabilities.

Sherry Dorsey Walker, a Wilmington Democrat, has announced her candidacy for lieutenant governor.\n\nDorsey Walker, who officially entered the race on Juneteenth, would become the state’s first Black woman to serve in this role.

Governor I will continue to be a boots-on-the-ground advocate for all Delaware citizens,” she said in her announcement. “My decision to announce on Juneteenth is symbolic of the advancements made by people of color, women, and those who seek the freedom that comes with change for the advancement of all mankind.”\n\nNew Castle County Executive Matt Meyer becomes first to enter governor's race\n\nNew Castle County Executive Matt Meyer announced in early June that he will run for governor in 2024\n\nMeyer, who has been county executive since 2016, previously worked as a school teacher, attorney, entrepreneur and economic development adviser for the U.S. State Department in Iraq. He didn’t have much government experience before leading the state’s largest municipal government, which has an annual budget of about $300 million.\n\nREAD:New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer becomes first to enter 2024 governor's race\n\nHe signaled in his announcement that health care, affordable housing and education will be key issues in his campaign, noting the state “needs to move with greater urgency to tackle” these problems. Meyer has also been a polarizing figure. He has frequently publicly sparred with the county’s police union, which supported his opponent during his bid for county executive reelection in 2020.\n\nFamiliar face Velda Jones-Potter launches Wilmington mayoral campaign\n\nFormer city treasurer Velda Jones-Potter announced her run for Wilmington mayor in March, launching the first mayoral campaign for the 2024 election in Delaware’s largest city.\n\nJones-Potter unsuccessfully ran for the city seat in 2020, trailing incumbent Mayor Mike Purzycki by just over 1,000 votes in the Democratic Primary. Purzycki captured 42.9% of the total vote, compared to Jones-Potter’s 35.6%. Former City Councilperson Justen Wright also vied for the Democratic nomination, garnering 21.5% of the vote.\n\nThe former city treasurer’s mayoral campaign touts a focus on making neighborhoods safer, empowering Wilmington residents and using city resources efficiently. Those efforts include:\n\nCreating an Office of Neighborhood Development to work across city departments and ensure needs of all neighborhoods are met.\n\nCollaborating with community and city public safety to address challenges in policing, fire and emergency services.\n\nImproving the city hiring process to promote diversity and establishing policies that promote social justice and economic equity.\n\nCreating policies to ensure fairness, accountability, and transparency in all transactions involving public funds.\n\nUpdating city facilities and infrastructure to implement smart-city technology and remove lead and other hazardous materials.\n\nThe campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWith Meyer gone, Marcus Henry, Karen Hartley-Nagle make play for New Castle County executive\n\nTwo familiar faces to New Castle County politics are vying for the County Executive race.\n\nDemocrat Marcus Henry, son of former Senator Margaret Rose Henry, began his campaign for county executive in April of last year.\n\nHenry has over 20 years of experience in public service and has worked for the past three county executive administrations, including as the general manager of the county Department of Community Services under current executive Matt Meyer and a brief stint as the county’s economic development director.\n\nHe has publicly stated his intention to bring transparency to the position and ensure that the county remains “a safe and flourishing home for residents, and an attractive destination for visitors.”\n\nThe Marcus Henry campaign did not directly respond to a request for comment.\n\nKaren Hartley-Nagle, current New Castle County Council President, announced her candidacy on March 24 of this year. She has served as council president for the past six years, with two left in her current term.\n\nHartley-Nagle previously served as a board member of Delaware Common Cause and the Coalition for Open Government and was a member of the New Castle County Board of Adjustment. She has publicly stated that as County Executive, her main focus would be on core services such as public safety, parks and recreation, libraries, land use and infrastructure.\n\nHartley-Nagle has come under scrutiny from her fellow council members in the past, and was under investigation for hostile work environment claims. As Council President she has focused on uplifting the county’s senior population and attracting business development to the area.\n\nThe Hartley-Nagle campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCandidate enters Insurance Commissioner's race\n\nKayode Abegunde, a member of New Castle County's Financial Advisory Council, launched his campaign for insurance commissioner.\n\nAbegunde, a Democrat, previously lost in the primary to incumbent Trinidad Navarro, who has served in the role since 2016. The two will likely face off again in the primary. In his announcement, Abegunde said would \"bring more insurance products\" to Delaware and provide more options to veterans.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/09/04/delaware-2024-race-lieutenant-governor-kyle-evans-gay-president-joe-biden/70736615007/", "title": "This Delaware 2024 political race just got even more competitive ...", "text": "Editor's note: This story has been updated to include the correct date of the 2024 state primary.\n\nWelcome to The Press Room, a weekly roundup of the major stories and happenings in Delaware politics.\n\nThis week’s edition focuses on the 2024 lieutenant governor’s race, nominations made by Gov.

She has been in Delaware politics for decades, most recently serving as lieutenant governor since 2016.\n\n“We look forward to the results of the audit and amending any reports as needed,” Hall-Long said. “I have always been strongly committed to public integrity and transparency, and will continue to uphold those values throughout this campaign.”\n\nWho runs her campaign finances?\n\nHall-Long’s husband, Dana Long, previously served as her campaign treasurer for her current fundraising committee, according to Delaware’s Campaign Finance Reporting System.\n\nHe is listed as serving in this role from Jan. 25, 2021, to May 2, 2023, according to the website.\n\nDana Long has in the past created major headaches for his wife's various campaigns. In 2014, when she was a state senator, Hall-Long admitted that her husband stole Republican political signs, which were along a road in Middletown. This came to light after a video showed him carrying signs to his car.\n\nHe was also accused of \"abuse of power\" when he served as a housing inspector for New Castle County. Hall-Long defended her husband against these claims. He does not work on her gubernatorial election campaign, a campaign official said Thursday.\n\nAllison Murray, of Rhode Island, has been in the treasurer role since May 2.

One of these was supposed to be hosted this month by Gov. John Carney, who quickly endorsed her when she announced her candidacy.\n\nThe campaign, in a statement to Delaware Online/The News Journal, said scheduled fundraisers \"have been pulled down, and she is not currently soliciting donations pending the audit.\"\n\nHall-Long \"is committed to leading with transparency and integrity, which is why she requested an audit of her campaign finance reports,\" the campaign said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/10/04/wilmington-mayor-mike-purzycki-wont-run-for-re-election-2024/71060994007/", "title": "Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki won't run for reelection in 2024", "text": "Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki announced Wednesday afternoon that he will not seek a third term in 2024.\n\nBut Wilmington isn't without big hitters expressing interest in leading Delaware's largest city.\n\nFollowing the announcement by Purzycki, who easily won his last two elections as Wilmington mayor, Delaware Gov. John Carney expressed an interest in running. It would be the first time, in recent memory, a Delaware politician has sought this office after serving as governor.\n\n\"Tracey and I have lived in Wilmington for thirty years, and I care deeply about our city,\" Carney said on Wednesday. \"While I am focused on serving as Delaware's Governor, it's something I'm seriously considering.\"\n\nPurzycki saw a city undergo tremendous economic development, while also struggling with ongoing crime. He previously served as the longtime executive director of the Riverfront Development Corp., seen as one of the architects in the development of the Wilmington Riverfront.\n\nIn an open letter to Wilmington residents, the mayor cited his age as one of the key factors, writing that he is “for the first time in my life, aware of my age.” He described his health to be “generally good.” In 2020, he recovered from emergency heart bypass surgery.\n\n“My difficulty in committing to another term that would begin 15 months from now is in continuing to undertake such a demanding job at the age of 78,” he wrote. “I can take some time away from the job — but people should understand that the job of Mayor never lets you go.\n\n“And Bette and I now have four small grandchildren who occupy a large part of our lives and our hearts. Selfishly, I want them to remember me.”\n\nThe seasoned politician has served two, four-year terms as Wilmington's mayor, and in the early 1980s was a New Castle county councilman. His longest tenure was as head of the Riverfront Development Corp. for 20 years before running for mayor.\n\nPurzycki's accomplishments\n\nCounty Executive Matt Meyer, who earlier this year announced his bid for Delaware governor, said historically the county and city have had a contentious relationship, but with Purzycki at the helm, the two politicians were able to develop a \"historic partnership.\"\n\n\"Together, we have created additional affordable housing opportunities by eliminating red tape and combining our Section 8 Housing Voucher programs,\" Meyer said in a news release. \"We have addressed homelessness by collaborating to create and sustain the Hope Center. And we saved taxpayers millions of dollars in legal fees by partnering to solve a 25 year-old sewer dispute.\"\n\nPurzycki noted in the letter that his administration's achievements include “unparalleled economic development throughout the city” and “some of the best crime statistics in decades.” He also wrote that Wilmington has made “massive investments” in affordable housing, among others.\n\nCarney said Purzycki has \"managed our city through some of the most challenging times in recent history, guided by compassion, fairness, and a commitment to doing the right thing.\"\n\nWhen the mayor leaves office, Carney said, \"he'll be leaving city government better than he found it, with a professional, efficient city workforce focused on improving the quality of life for Wilmington residents.\"\n\nRIVERFRONT DEVELOPMENT:Hundreds of millions in tax dollars built Wilmington's Riverfront, was it worth it?\n\nCity Councilmember Chris Johnson said he was \"very happy\" for Purzycki, noting that family should come first. But in the meantime, the councilman said he looks forward to getting some of the initiatives he's worked on with the administration across the finish line.\n\n\"We have a lot to do in terms of our neighborhood stabilization work, especially on the West Side and East Side, and also in terms of continuing to really settle on our public safety strategy,\" Johnson said. \"2024 is going to be a great year for the city.

He said the question facing the nation is \"whether, in the years ahead, we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer.\"\n\nMore on Biden's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Democratic\n\nAge: 54\n\nFamily: Phillips wed wife Annalise in 2019, and has two adult daughters from a previous marriage: Daniela and Pia.\n\nPrevious political experience: Phillips was first elected to Congress in 2018 and has served for three terms as a representative for Minnesota's 3rd district. Prior to politics, Phillips made his name as a businessman. In addition to taking over his family company, Phillips Distilling, he opened a coffee shop in the Twin Cities and served as chair of Talenti Gelato for four years.\n\nHis views: Phillips is a moderate with a reputation in Washington of reaching across the aisle. A member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, one of his major legislative accomplishments was the Paycheck Protection Program which he co-authored with Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy. Under the program, the government paid workers salaries and benefits to qualifying small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic for eight weeks or less.\n\nMore on Phillips 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nDean Phillips 2024: Democratic Rep. from Minnesota throws hat in the ring\n\nPolitical party: Democratic\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: Williamson was married once in the late 1970s to a Houston businessman whom she has not named. She has one daughter, India Emmanuelle, whose father has not been publicly identified.\n\nPrevious political experience: Williamson is a self-help author and spiritual leader who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020. Then she was largely drowned out by a crowded Democratic field, breaking through for a rare viral moment, but eventually written off as a non-traditional candidate whose views involved centering the \"politics of love\" and rejecting a “dark psychic force of collectivized hatred.”\n\nHer views: Williamson supports abortion rights, a single-payer health care system and reparations for descendants of formerly enslaved Americans. She has suggested creating a U.S. Department of Children and Youth to increase child advocacy, and a U.S. Department of Peace.\n\nMore on Williamson's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nRepublican party candidates for 2024\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 55\n\nFamily: Binkley met wife Ellie in college and the two share five children.\n\nPrevious political experience: Binkley is CEO, president, and co-founder of the mergers and acquisitions conglomerate Generational Equity Group.

He says he wants to stand out in a crowded field by prioritizing unity, and leaning on his faith and business experience.\n\nHis views: Binkley has said he hopes to prioritize balancing the budget, lowering health care costs, creating bipartisan immigration reform, and putting more community emphasis on education. Binkley is against abortion. Though he signed a highly restrictive bill in his own state, he had indicated he would not do the same nationally and it should be a local issue.

Since then, he has captured national attention with controversial legislative measures on education and immigration.\n\nWhile in law school, DeSantis joined the U.S. Navy as a JAG officer, later deploying to Iraq for active duty. Prior to his run for governor, he served in the House of Representatives as a congressman for Florida's 6th district for three terms from 2013 to 2018.\n\nHe is widely viewed as Trump’s biggest threat in the Republican primary. Similar in politics but different in demeanor, DeSantis represents a younger, some say more predictable, alternative to the former president.\n\nHis views: DeSantis is campaigning on a hard-right agenda to make America look more like Florida.

She won reelection in 2014 and has bragged that she has \"never lost a race.\"\n\nIn 2016, former President Trump nominated Haley to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, a position she held for a year before unexpectedly stepping down in 2018. Haley has played up her role as a female candidate in what is expected to be a largely male primary field. \"May the best woman win,” she quipped in an interview with Fox News.\n\nHer views: Haley is anti-abortion and pro-Israel. She supports cracking down on illegal immigration and \"getting tough\" on China and Russia.

Bush administration.\n\nWhile in the House, Hutchinson served as impeachment manager in the trial of former president (and fellow Arkansas native) Bill Clinton. After leaving Washington he was elected 46th Governor of Arkansas. He served for two terms, from 2015 to 2023.\n\nHis views: He supports lower taxes, a strong national defense, and opposes abortion.

Ramaswamy left the company in 2020 amid clashes with colleagues over how to respond to the murder of George Floyd and the public outcry that followed. He now heads up Strive Asset Management.\n\nHe is the author of three books, including \"Woke Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam,\" which explores how American politics and capitalism have become increasingly intertwined.\n\nHis views: He has peddled ideas such as ending affirmative action and eliminating the Department of Education.

Born and bred in New York, he first made his name developing skyscrapers and casinos.\n\nTrump first married in 1977, wedding Czech-born model Ivana. The two were married for 13 years and share three children: Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric. In 1993 Trump married actress and model Marla Maples. The two had one daughter: Tiffany. Following his divorce from Maples, Trump tied the knot for a final time with model Melania, who is mother to his youngest child, Barron.\n\nTrump's family was uncharacteristically involved in his presidency. Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner played prominent roles in the administration, and both Don Jr. and Eric were often cited as close advisors.\n\nPrevious political experience: When Trump entered the race in 2016, he branded himself as a political outsider, a businessman separate from the establishment, ready to \"drain the swamp.\"\n\nPrior to 2016, he dabbled in politics, often sounding off on controversial issues like the birther movement meant to cast doubt on Barack Obama's citizenship and the guiltiness of the now-exonerated Central Park Five. However, he was still primarily known for real estate and his forays into reality television, famously starring in \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nIn 2016, Trump shocked pollsters by securing victory over Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. He served a full four-year term and was defeated by Biden in his reelection bid.\n\nHis views: The former president has centered much of his campaign on his purported “political persecution” by Democrats. He supports securing America’s borders, “reclaiming free speech,” and “dismantling the Deep State,” according to his campaign website. He has said he would consider pardoning participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which was inspired by his false claims of election fraud.\n\nMore on Trump's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nThird-party 2024 presidential candidates\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nAge: 69\n\nFamily: Kennedy bears a powerful last name in Democratic politics.

He wed current wife Cheryl Hines in 2014. Hines is a television star best known for her role on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"\n\nPrevious political experience: Kennedy is an environmental lawyer known for trumpeting a debunked theory that vaccines can be linked to autism.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Kennedy opposed vaccine mandates, calling them an infringement on individual liberty and at times used the Holocaust as a historical comparison. In 2017, former President Trump invited Kennedy to head up a presidential commission on vaccine safety.\n\nHis views: He is campaigning on a platform of fighting for the \"liberties guaranteed by the Constitution,\" according to his campaign website.\n\nMore on Kennedy's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical Party: Green Party\n\nThough West originally announced his candidacy under the People's Party, he later officially filed as a Green Party candidate.\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: West has been married five times and has two children.

His bid with the People's Party represents the first independent ticket to enter the race thus far.\n\nHis views: West is a proponent of Medicare for All, and removing oil and gas subsidies as well as drilling on public lands.

Advisers are already preparing the president’s annual State of the Union address, typically delivered in late January or early February, viewing the speech as an opportunity to lay down the stakes and themes that Biden could adopt on the campaign trail.\n\nThe first couple arrived in St. Croix on Tuesday, along with family members, a gathering of the tight-knit clan who, according to several people with knowledge of recent conversations who have spoken to CNN, have now pledged support for another White House run by Biden. Senior administration officials once viewed this week’s tropical escape as a crucial juncture that would play a major part in deciding his political future, and – while the president does still plan to mull with his family the pros and cons of mounting a reelection bid – people who have discussed the matter with him lately say the decision is essentially made.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN Exclusive: Pelosi and Schumer say Biden should run for re-election in 2024 02:51 - Source: CNN\n\nClues that Biden was expected in St. Croix were everywhere in the run-up to his arrival: the jumbo C-17 transport planes sitting among the puddle jumpers at the airport; temporary security checkpoints among the bougainvillea along the quiet coastal road; unusually high numbers of visitors from Washington.\n\nEven for a popular tourist destination accustomed to a wave of winter travelers, this week’s presidential visit has maxed out the island’s resources. Rental cars were all taken, and hotels were at capacity, according to residents.\n\nAfter the Bidens skipped the US Virgin Islands tradition the last two years, this trip may have some of the same vibes as one of their more recent vacations. In the early hours of 2019, when Biden was last contemplating a presidential bid, the couple were photographed taking a selfie at Point Udall in St. Croix on New Year’s Day, catching the first sunrise of the new year at the easternmost point under the American Flag, as the popular tourist spot is known.\n\nA decision had been made. Several months later, Biden would announce his candidacy for the presidency.\n\nPrivacy, please\n\nIn 2014, Joe and Jill Biden enjoyed their time on the island so much, they visited St. Croix twice – once to ring in the new year and again for a weekend in March, a quick getaway trip not on the then-vice president’s official schedule.\n\nIn 2015, the couple again passed the week after Christmas there, after deciding he would not run for the White House.\n\nIn 2016, Bidens spent the waning days of his vice presidency relaxing on St. Croix, ahead of Donald Trump’s ascension to the White House.\n\nBiden’s loyalty to the US territory has been the most high-profile of any American politician in recent history. A sitting American president has not visited St. Croix since Harry S. Truman in 1948. Truman arrived by yacht – the USS Williamsburg – and was hosted at an estate owned by the manufacturer of Jeeps.\n\nIn 1997, President Bill Clinton visited neighboring St. Thomas, another of the US Virgin Islands, for his winter vacation, chartering a catamaran with his family and snorkeling with daughter Chelsea.\n\nIn a 2020 statement, Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. said of Biden, “We consider him our hometown president.” Asked why the Bidens have picked St. Croix as their island getaway, Vanessa Valdivia, the first lady’s press secretary, told CNN, “Over the years, the president and first lady have frequently traveled to a warmer location the week after Christmas, going to the US Virgin Island several times.”\n\nFor the entirety of his presidency, Biden has skipped out when he can on weekends in Washington, DC, in favor of his longtime family home in Wilmington, Delaware, where residence staff and storied rooms aren’t a thing.\n\nSt. Croix, for the first couple, has provided that sort of intense privacy, plus the warmth and beach that the Bidens favor.\n\nDuring their visits in the years after Biden served as vice president, when his security apparatus dwindled and normalcy found a return to their daily routine, the first couple could be spotted around the island on occasion with virtually no entourage, driving themselves along the flower-lined roads in a rental Toyota sedan.\n\nThe home they leased was modest – only a few bedrooms – and was available at other times of the year for other tourists on vacation rental websites.\n\nYet on Tuesday, law enforcement was busy in the same area making preparations for Biden’s visit, including setting up flood lights and popping up white tents to act as checkpoints along the roadside.\n\nThe Bidens are staying at the home of his friends Bill and Connie Neville in St. Croix, the White House says. The president and first lady have stayed at the home of the tech executive on previous visits to the island.\n\nBeach people\n\nThe first couple are “beach people,” said a family friend familiar with their vacation preferences. Others who know them well said there is little more they enjoy when relaxing than pitching an umbrella on the beach, tossing a towel onto the sand and closing their eyes under a warm sun.\n\nTheir Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, neighbors are now used to being screened by Secret Service agents during beach walks, the telltale signal the president and/or first lady have walked down from their oceanside vacation residence to the beach for a respite closer to the waves.\n\nThe first lady, in particular, finds peace in her books and soaking up the sun. This spring, staff for Jill Biden – on a solo, whirlwind, three-country visit to Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica – made sure to schedule private time for the first lady beside the pool at a resort out of Panama City, so she could lay out like dozens of other vacationers, steps from the waterside.\n\n“They both prefer hot and sunny and humid to wet and snowy and cold,” said another close acquaintance of the Bidens.\n\nFor the first couple, a true respite involves privacy as well, not just sun and warmth. St. Croix has fit the checklist. Locals have spotted the couple in years past at the grocery store, going mostly unnoticed as they shopped for vacation provisions at Seaside Market and Deli. Joe Biden has played rounds of golf at the Buccaneer Resort, a par-70 course described as “challenging, yet very playable” on the property’s website.\n\nThey have attended mass at the white-steepled Holy Cross Catholic Church in the island’s main town Christiansted.\n\nReelection discussions on the island\n\nThe break from Washington comes on the heels of a busy holiday season. Jill Biden – so tasked with dozens of White House celebrations, photo lines, family visits and general hosting duties that she had laryngitis for several days – is on her second week off from her teaching duties at Northern Virginia Community College.\n\nFor Joe Biden, the stakes of getting away are not just about rest and recuperation.\n\nBarring unforeseen events or a sudden change of heart, Biden’s team is laying the groundwork for a reelection announcement in the coming months, putting to rest persistent speculation about whether the 80-year-old president would seek another term.\n\nCNN has reported that Jill Biden is “all in” on the 2024 campaign despite previous concerns about the deep implications of what a second run might mean for her family and her husband. She has, as one White House official told CNN, “zero concerns” about Joe Biden’s schedule and stamina.\n\n“This is, ultimately, a family decision,” Joe Biden said at a news conference last month. “I think everybody wants me to run, but we’re going to have discussions about it.”\n\nAside from the rigors of launching the final political campaign of his career, Biden will face a new Republican majority in the House of Representatives, intent on stymieing many of his legislative ambitions. Republican leaders have also vowed to mount investigations into Biden’s administration and his family.\n\nWith his legislative prospects dampened, Biden plans to travel extensively in the new year promoting the accomplishments from his first two years in office. It will be an intense period that could ultimately include a rematch with his 2020 opponent, Trump – and one that will require the full backing of his wife of 45 years, along with the support of his extended family.\n\nIf there is a time to speak up on hesitations, either his own or from his offspring, it would be during this vacation.\n\nWayne Nichols, who leads Alexander Hamilton tours of St. Croix in the character of the founding father, recalled a 2019 encounter he had with Biden, with whom he engaged while the then-not-quite-presidential candidate was walking alone on the east end of the island.\n\nAt the time, Biden was also mulling a daunting campaign. After passing on a bid in 2016 following the death of his son, he was being encouraged by his family to mount a challenge to Trump.\n\nNichols said he stopped Biden to ask if he would run.\n\n“My question to him was, ‘Well, you’re going to run?’ He goes, ‘Well, I’m running now.’ And I thought, well, technically you’re walking,” Nichols recalled this week, wondering whether he might again cross paths with Biden.\n\nNichols came across Joe Biden a second time that week in 2019, while out for a walk on the island – Joe Biden up front, Jill Biden walking a few paces behind – when someone in the group told Jill Biden that her husband ought to run for president.\n\n“‘When you get up there, let him know that,’” Nichols said she responded.\n\nAs the Bidens make similar deliberations this year, they won’t be getting around in a rented Toyota and their stops on the island will go less unnoticed.\n\n“I have a feeling this is the place,” Nichols said of Biden often choosing St. Croix as his spot to find stillness for a consequential decision about the future. “Chilling there by the water with the nice weather. They get to talk about it. And I believe he’ll run again, only because I don’t know that he thinks there’s any alternative.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett Kevin Liptak", "Kate Bennett", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/11/politics/biden-democratic-primary-challenge-2024/index.html", "title": "As worries about Biden in 2024 grow, other Democrats aren't ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA challenge requires a challenger – and all the Democrats being discussed as potential primary opponents to President Joe Biden tell CNN they’re ruling out runs and warning others to follow suit.\n\nThe chatter is fed by Democratic officials and party leaders who have begun to doubt that Biden is, as he’s insisted privately to donors and others, their strongest candidate to beat Donald Trump – or another GOP candidate – in 2024. And it’s being propelled even more by the 79-year-old President’s age, which has prompted questions about what kind of campaign schedule he’d be able to keep up.\n\nFear runs deep of yet another unfavorable Biden comparison to Jimmy Carter, who survived a 1980 primary challenge from Ted Kennedy but not the lasting wound going into the general election. Democrats privately hoping Biden might reverse course and not run are petrified that they’re backbiting their way into allowing Trump and Trumpism back into power.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped muted worries from going around the West Wing, according to four aides familiar with the conversations, that someone may yet emerge ahead of the President’s planned spring 2023 formal reelection campaign launch. Biden advisers expect to stick to that no matter what happens, including if Trump decides to jump in early.\n\n“Nothing about our timeline changes, but we’re prepared if he decides to run,” one person familiar with the Biden team’s political planning said about Trump.\n\nBut even Rep. Ro Khanna, the California congressman and former Bernie Sanders campaign co-chair, who first won his seat by beating an incumbent in a primary, said he won’t entertain the thought of jumping in against Biden, although he’s aware he’s being whispered about – so much that a close friend had a dream over July Fourth weekend that he did it.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Khanna told CNN. “I plan to support (Biden) because of the danger that Donald Trump poses. I would certainly not do anything to weaken him, and I hope no one else will do anything to weaken him. He’s still the safe brand in the midwestern states to make sure Trump is kept far away from the Oval Office.”\n\nThat also goes for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has been causing the most antsy whispers from the Biden orbit with his comments calling out a lack of Democratic action and energy and his buying a July Fourth ad in Florida hitting Gov. Ron DeSantis, a prospective 2024 GOP candidate. Newsom, who’s facing reelection in November, compared the Democratic dynamics to those he initially faced in his recall election last year, when he and advisers worked to scare off several Democrats who’d looked at jumping in against him.\n\n“The success of our recall was about unifying around our party and defining the opposition. We need to unify the Democratic Party and not destroy ourselves from within,” Newsom said. “We need to have our President’s back. But we also have to get on the field. He needs troops. He has to govern. Our job is to organize, and it’s to have his back.”\n\nThe same goes for J.B. Pritzker, the billionaire first-term Illinois governor who also drew some behind-the-scenes brushback from Biden world by delivering a speech about his exhaustion with the Democratic status quo in famous first-presidential primary state New Hampshire. The Democrat, who’s running for a second term in November, lit up even more speculation with his response to the Highland Park shooting in his state earlier this month, which was more forceful than Biden’s.\n\nBiden “has said he’s running for reelection and I support that,” Pritzker told CNN, adding that though he thinks some other opponent may yet emerge, Biden “will win the nomination, and yet, it’ll be Ted Kennedy running against Jimmy Carter … They will lose and they will take away from the President. That’s not what we need right now.”\n\nThe speculation is at a high enough fever that when Pete Buttigieg’s PAC reactivated on Twitter at the end of June to endorse a few candidates for US House and state legislature, several plugged-in operatives began to wonder if this was the first step in the transportation secretary relaunching as a candidate. His attendance at Democratic National Committee events and meetings with a few potential future donors only sparked more talk.\n\nBut there’s nothing to that, according to a Transportation Department spokesperson, who said, “Buttigieg has had no involvement in Win the Era PAC since his nomination as Secretary. He is 100 percent focused on his job at DOT, including implementing President Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law.”\n\nSome have talked about Jared Polis, the Colorado governor known for straying from what became Democratic orthodoxy on Covid-19 lockdowns and is facing voters this fall. He has a personal fortune, several operatives noted, and while not enough to self-fund, enough to possibly seed a campaign and feel confident that he wouldn’t have to worry about endangering future job prospects. Polis campaign spokesperson Amber Miller said he’s “not considering anything like that and is focused on running the state of Colorado. If he is re-elected, he plans to serve his entire term as governor of Colorado.”\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has repeatedly said Biden intends to run and that she’d be his running mate, and no one around her or anywhere else believes she’d be able to pull off a campaign that started by breaking with him.\n\nSanders, the Vermont senator who has twice sought the Democratic nod, told CNN last month he would not run against Biden. A spokesperson for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, told CNN that nothing has changed since the Massachusetts Democrat told NBC News that she’s not running for president in 2024 and would be supporting Biden. Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ top political adviser and former campaign manager, said trying to run by appealing to his wing of the party “would be an almost insurmountable climb to get to the top of that mountain, given that Bernie has said he’s going to be supporting Joe Biden if he runs for re-election.”\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated a member of Democratic House leadership to come to Congress, told late night host Stephen Colbert at the end of June that she was more focused on preserving American democracy than presidential speculation.\n\nBut she’s also held off on saying she would support Biden for reelection, noting that the President hasn’t said he’s running himself.\n\nAsked by CNN if that left space for her to consider running a youthful, progressive primary against him, a spokesperson for the congresswoman didn’t return requests for comment.\n\nFacing a ‘soft’ primary\n\nCarter-Kennedy isn’t the only historical example on Democrats’ minds. There’s Ronald Reagan’s bruising 1976 primary campaign against Republican President Gerald Ford, which helped pave the way for Carter’s win. Or George H.W. Bush never quite recovering from Pat Buchanan’s 1992 primary campaign, which hurt him with the GOP base heading into the general election.\n\nSeveral senior Democrats, though, cited 1968, when President Lyndon Johnson faced a primary challenge from Eugene McCarthy. Eventually, other candidates jumped in, leading the President to withdraw that March from running for reelection.\n\nOperatives around a number of prospective presidential candidates argue that Biden is already facing a “soft” primary challenge from many directions. The goal, they say, is not to run against Biden, but rather to implicitly reassure the President that Democrats have other good options from the next generation or two, and that he should be comfortable passing the torch to them.\n\nThe other goal is for Democrats to get as ready as they can, on the chance that Biden drags out his reelection decision and then changes his mind so late into the presidential cycle that other candidates are hobbled in launching campaigns and raising money.\n\nFor all the free media attention that would come from declaring a primary campaign against Biden, no one seems to want to go down as blowing a hole in the party for Republicans to march back through – particularly at a moment when apocalyptic feelings are so high. This is about future ambitions, too: Those would-be candidates are aware Democratic voters would never forgive a spoiler.\n\n“It’s about us having his back, not taking back some wing of the party,” Newsom said. “It’s about everybody disabusing ourselves that we have the luxury of division from within.”\n\n“I believe there will be plenty of time post-Donald Trump to debate the future of the Democratic Party,” Khanna said. “For people who have future ambition, they’d much rather be running in a post-Donald Trump and post-Joe Biden world.”\n\nBarack Obama faced a flurry of primary speculation at about this point ahead of his own reelection campaign 12 years ago – to the point that Gallup tested how well he’d do if Hillary Clinton ran against him, and Sanders started poking around in New Hampshire about jumping in against him.\n\nMany of the Democratic leaders, operatives and donors who spoke to CNN about having these conversations insist it’s precisely their fear of Trump beating Biden that is driving them to cast around for possible other options.\n\nNot only is Biden now clocking lower approval ratings than almost every Democratic governor and senator on the ballot in November, but several internal Democratic polls have shown him struggling against Trump in battleground states.\n\nAsked if he understood what was generating the talk of a primary challenge that he thinks may yet emerge, Pritzker paused. First, he reiterated his support of Biden. Then, he repeated his call for more energy and action, without mentioning the President specifically.\n\n“We absolutely need to be stronger and louder in our condemnation of the right wing and what they stand for, and in our defense of the liberties of women and those who are marginalized,” Pritzker said. “There is a palpable change in attitude among Democrats.”\n\nPushing back on the nudging\n\nBefore he launched his 2020 campaign, Biden advisers had bounced around the idea of a one-term pledge as a way to answer questions about his age. Biden nixed the idea, saying he’d never be able to get anything done as an immediate lame duck. He’s made similar comments about what would happen to his power at home and on the world stage if he were to announce he’s not running for reelection.\n\nFew around Biden see that changing. Some even suggested that a primary challenger could inadvertently help him recover from approval numbers stuck below 40% by giving him a foil. If that challenge came from the left and allowed him to argue he hasn’t kowtowed to progressives – as Republicans and some Democratic moderates claim – several operatives said that would be even better.\n\nBut as White House aides regularly point out, no incumbent president has launched a reelection campaign this early, and Biden was the last serious primary contender to announce a 2020 campaign, pushing back on those who urged him to declare earlier.\n\n“There’s nobody who’s more infamous about his inability to make a decision about running for president of the United States,” joked one Democratic member of Congress, who asked not to be named. “And hey, he’s President.”\n\nAnd while four years ago at this same point ahead of the 2020 cycle, the Democratic National Committee was deep into preparations for primaries and debates, no such efforts are underway.\n\nLong before he became famous for managing Howard Dean’s anti-establishment 2004 presidential campaign (in what was an open Democratic field), Joe Trippi was a young aide to Kennedy’s 1980 primary challenge, running the floor operation for several states on the floor of the convention that summer.\n\nTrippi said he hopes anyone thinking of a Biden primary realizes it would be “murder-suicide,” and warned his fellow Democrats: “Nothing good can come from it.”\n\n“I learned that lesson the hard way as a young idealistic progressive in the late 70s early 80s,” Trippi said. “What we got for it was eight years of Reagan and four years of H.W. Bush.”", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/09/20/migrants-bidens-delaware-home-gov-desantis/10436238002/", "title": "Sending migrants to Biden's Delaware home was Gov.

Community groups stood by to help. Reporters and camera crews staked out airports.\n\nBut the plane – and the migrants – never showed.\n\nThe confusing drama was among the latest chapters in an ongoing spat between Biden and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis that has captured headlines and put a spotlight on Biden's border policies.\n\nExclusive poll:Trump vs. DeSantis in 2024? Poll shows Florida Republicans prefer their governor\n\nAnalysis:How DeSantis decision could help a 2024 showdown with Trump\n\nDeSantis, a Republican who is considered a likely presidential candidate in 2024, has threatened to send migrants captured at the border to \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" around the country.\n\nLast week, he followed through on that threat and flew 48 Venezuelan people from the San Antonio airport to Martha's Vineyard on two private planes. When they arrived, the Venezuelan migrants told reporters they had lured by individuals who falsely promised them jobs and rent-free places to stay. They filed a class-action lawsuit against DeSantis and other officials on Tuesday seeking unspecified damages.\n\nA federal class action lawsuit was filed Tuesday in Boston on behalf of the migrants that accuses the DeSantis administration of deploying a “fraudulent and discriminatory scheme” to transport them. On Monday, Bexar County, Texas Sheriff Javier Salazar announced his agency had opened an investigation into how 48 Venezuelan migrants were “lured” to board flights from San Antonio to Martha's Vineyard.\n\nOnPolitics newsletter:Is Trump fading? DeSantis rising as 2024 prospect in USA TODAY/Suffolk poll\n\nStay in the conversation:Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nCrist, Hispanic leaders blast DeSantis\n\nDemocrat Charlie Crist joined with Hispanic leaders Wednesday to keep the heat on DeSantis for using more than $1.5 million of Florida taxpayer money on the Martha’s Vineyard flight.\n\nCrist called the action a “premeditated crime,” by his rival in the Nov. 8 election.\n\n“To utilize human beings for his political gain is shameful,” Crist said.\n\nAmong those joining DeSantis on a Zoom call with reporters were Massachusetts state Rep. Carlos Gonzalez, a Springfield Democrat; Florida state Sen. Annette Taddeo, D-Miami; and Adelys Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan American Caucus, based in South Florida.\n\nDeSantis tapped a $12 million fund approved by the Republican-led Legislature to relocate unauthorized aliens from Florida to other locations. But Crist and other Democrats say the governor misused the dollars by sending two aircraft to Texas to retrieve asylum-seekers in that state and send them to the wealthy island, what DeSantis later described as “greener pastures.”\n\nA plane to Delaware from Texas?\n\nMonday night, reports surfaced that another plane was scheduled to depart Texas on Tuesday and then head to the Delaware Coastal Airport, about 20 miles west of Biden's vacation home in Rehoboth Beach. Flight plans filed late Monday indicated the plane would travel from San Antonio to Delaware, with a short layover in Crestview, Florida.\n\nBut what actually happened remains fuzzy.\n\nThe plane had not left Texas as of 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, but Delaware Gov. John Carney’s spokesperson Emily David Hershman said the governor's office was aware of the reports and was preparing for the potential arrival.\n\nReporters and photographers from the USA TODAY network looked for signs of the aircraft in Texas and Florida. No plane took off. No plane landed.\n\nOfficials later said no plane is expected.\n\n\"We have no reports of anyone arriving at this point,\" said Jill Fredel of the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services after officials waited for hours for the plane to arrive at Delaware Coastal Airport in Sussex County.\n\nOpinion:Ron DeSantis' Martha's Vineyard stunt cruelly uses migrants as human pawns, helping no one\n\nIn Okaloosa County, Florida, where the plane was to stop briefly, officials said they don't receive passenger manifests for flights like the one reportedly bound for Delaware. County spokeswomen April Sarver said the county isn't even allowed to ask for such documents.\n\nMuch of what officials learn, she said, comes from the public, who might be using apps to trace flights coming in from Texas or just passing rumors back and forth on social media.\n\n\"We get to hear the rumors too, but we wouldn't get anything official,\" Sarver said. \"I sure would like it if Gov. DeSantis would call and give me a head's up.\"\n\n'INHUMANE ACTS':Massachusetts seeks human trafficking probe targeting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over migrants\n\nWhite House responds\n\nAt the White House, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration was aware of reports that a plane was heading to Delaware. The White House was in \"close contact\" with Delaware officials, but had not been in touch with DeSantis or his administration, she said.\n\n“Our heads up did not come from Gov. DeSantis because his only goal, as he's made it really quite clear, is to create chaos and using immigrants fleeing communism as political pawns,” Jean-Pierre said. “So it's about creating political theater for him. It's not about getting to a solution.”\n\nBiden, asked later about reports that DeSantis was sending migrants to Delaware, told reporters: “He should come visit. We have a beautiful shoreline.”\n\nDeSantis, meanwhile, refused to confirm to reporters in Florida whether he had ordered more migrants from Texas be sent to Delaware. But he defended his plan to steer migrants apprehended at the border away from Florida and send them to “sanctuary jurisdictions” around the country.\n\nHe also kept up his drumbeat of intense criticism of Biden’s border security policies.\n\nDeSantis counters: Where's anger for Biden?\n\nIn Bradenton, DeSantis questioned why those denouncing his migrant plan aren’t expressing anger with Biden for allowing dozens of migrants to die last June in and around a tractor-trailer in San Antonio. “I heard no outrage about that,” he said.\n\n\"I don’t hear outrage about the criminal aliens who have gotten through and victimized people... throughout the country, but you have 50 that end up in Martha's Vineyard, then they get really upset,\" DeSantis said.\n\nBiden’s border security policies are “doing huge damage to our country,” he said, and “nobody can deny there's a crisis.”\n\nDeSantis said his plan took shape last year when he took a trip to the U.S.-Mexico border to help Texas Gov. Greg Abbott deal with the border crisis.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection officials reported Monday that the number of arrests of undocumented immigrants along the southwestern border — for the first time — had surpassed 2 million this fiscal year, which ends at the end of the month.\n\n'SOLUTIONS AND NOT THEATER':Rep.

Glenn Youngkin and Republicans’ plans for a red Virginia.\n\nDemocrats had said they were “cautiously optimistic” heading into Election Day, particularly about their chances in the upper chamber. The deciding seat was called just before midnight Tuesday.\n\nTheir success means Youngkin will have an uphill battle with his proposed 15-week abortion limit, which Democrats in the state already blocked in January. Candidates on the left made abortion a top campaign message in 2023, and the final outcome could be a bellwether for 2024.\n\nHeather Williams, interim president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Monday that Democrats would consider winning just one chamber “a huge win.”\n\n“With this victory, Gov. Youngkin has been denied a governing trifecta and our newly elected majority stands ready to defend Virginia from Republican extremism,” Williams said in a statement Tuesday evening.\n\nThe House of Delegates majority has yet to be called, though Democrats currently lead in that chamber as well.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMember of ‘Central Park Five’ elected to NYC council\n\nYusef Salaam, one of the \"Central Park Five\" who was exonerated for a 1989 attack on a jogger, won election Tuesday to be a member of the New York City Council.

The incident took place just after 9:15 a.m. Tuesday, according to area police.\n\nOfficers who responded found a man on the scene who was \"making threatening gestures toward voters\" while \"wielding a flag attached to a fishing pole.\" The man, identified by police as 40-year-old Jacen Cockerell, is also accused of damaging a voting machine by ripping off a printer that was attached to it.\n\nCockerell is charged with tampering/destruction of a voting machine and interfering with an election, both felonies, along with two misdemeanor counts of menacing.\n\n− Lucas Aulbach\n\nVirginia race results may be close and slow to come\n\nAll eyes might be on Virginia, but the country could have to be patient for the state’s final results.\n\nWith the state's deadline for mail in ballots at noon on Monday and some races potentially coming down to a tight margin, there's a “strong likelihood” that the outcome will not be set by the end of Election Day, said Heather Williams, interim president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.\n\n“These races are on a razor's edge,” Williams said in a press conference Monday. “We want to prepare you all for a long wait.”\n\nIt could be a waiting game then to see if Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Republicans are successful in their push to turn the state legislature red, or whether Democrats there manage to hold their state Senate majority.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nMother of 10-year-old girl killed in Uvalde school shooting runs for mayor\n\nKimberly Mata-Rubio, whose 10-year-old daughter Lexi Rubio was killed during the shooting at Robb Elementary School last year, is running for mayor of Uvalde in this year’s election.\n\nMata-Rubio, 34, is seeking to succeed Mayor Don McLaughlin, who is stepping down after nearly 10 years leading the city to pursue a seat in the Texas House.\n\n“I grieve for the woman you would have become and all the difference you would have made in this world,” Mata-Rubio wrote on X when she announced her run. “I grieve for the woman I was when you were still here. But, one part of me still exist, I am still your mom. I will honor your life with action. This is only the beginning.\n\n− Ryan Autullo and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nColorado voters consider Proposition HH\n\nIn the Centennial State, voters will weigh in on a measure known as Proposition HH.\n\nThe proposal asks whether voters want the state to keep some amount of surplus tax revenue that Colorado's constitution requires be refunded to taxpayers. In exchange, the measure would lower property tax rates for a decade. A portion of the funds the state retains would be spent on education and rental assistance.\n\nThe proposal was introduced by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis and Democratic lawmakers.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nVirginia sends a 2024 signal\n\nVirginia might be the country's modern bellwether, with their constituents having a near-perfect track record for picking recent national election winners. But before 2024's national elections can officially begin, voters and activists from both parties in the state say they're focused on winning this year.\n\nSenators and representatives from the Virginia State Senate and House of Delegates are all up for reelection for the first time in four years.\n\nYoungkin and other Virginia Republicans hope to hold their majority in the state House and flip their Senate red, much like the national GOP aspires to keep the U.S. House of Representatives and take back the majority in the Senate. But Democrats are hoping to block Youngkin's conservative agenda into 2024 and beyond.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nOhio election results: Abortion ballot measure in the Buckeye State\n\nThe eyes of the nation are on Ohio as voters in the state head to decide on an abortion ballot measure that has the potential to rock the state and send a message to the rest of the country.\n\nOhio voters will consider Issue 1, a measure that would enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution through viability, typically around 24 weeks gestation. After that, a doctor could perform an abortion to save the life or health of the pregnant patient.\n\nOhio is the only state to have an abortion measure on the ballot this fall.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders makes Election Day endorsement for Donald Trump\n\nA southern governor, who is not up for election today, still told voters she's endorsing Donald Trump for another term as president.\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trump's former White House press secretary, said \"it’s not a question between right versus left anymore.\"\n\nSanders is scheduled to attend Trump's rally on Wednesday in Hialeah, Fla., opposite the third Republican primary debate in neighboring Miami.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nKentucky Democrats edge out Republicans in early voting\n\nThe 2023 election is Kentucky’s first gubernatorial contest where three days of early voting were approved, and it appears Democrats were more eager this year.\n\nIn the closely watched race between incumbent Andy Beshear and Republican challenger Daniel Cameron, which is seen as a harbinger for 2024, a total of 260,324 people cast a ballot through no-excuse, in-person voting, according to the secretary of state’s office.\n\nOf those, 133,169 ballots, or 51.2%, were Democrats versus 112,398, or 43.2%, who were Republicans. Beshear’s party did even better when other forms of early voting − such as mail-in ballots and excused in-person voting − were taken into account.\n\nPolling shows Beshear and Cameron, the state’s attorney general, are tied at 47%.\n\n– Phillip M.

The seat was previously held by Sylvester Turner, who reached his term limit.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee and state Sen. John Whitmire have emerged as the frontrunners in the race, both touting their extensive experience, according to the Associated Press. The race has been focused on crime, infrastructure and impending budget problems.\n\nAccording to The Texas Tribune, Whitmire outpaced Jackson Lee in funds, but Jackson Lee landed endorsements from powerhouse Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton.\n\n–Kinsey Crowley\n\nIn Florida, all eyes are on Orlando for mayor, House rep. primary elections\n\nThree challengers are running against Orlando Mayor incumbent Buddy Dyer, who has held the position since 2003, longer than anyone in the city's history.

Officials aim to earn your trust in 2024\n\nWASHINGTON − Ahead of another election cycle that is already shaping up to be contentious, federal and state election officials are in the midst of campaigns of their own to reassure wary voters about the integrity of casting their ballots.\n\nThey are recruiting poll workers, certifying voting machines and hosting lessons on how election systems work in community centers, classrooms and libraries.\n\nThe steps are needed, experts say, to restore voters' confidence in a system that, despite some flaws and outspoken election deniers, was mostly trustworthy and secure in the first place.\n\nThose fraud claims, in part, gave rise to calls for major overhauls of election systems in some states led mostly by Republican lawmakers. Some, particularly voters of color, were already skeptical of a system with a history of discrimination that hasn't always been open to them. New laws to restrict access has fueled that mistrust, experts said.\n\nMuch of the work of assuring voters will fall to local elections officials, experts said. Americans have more trust in their local election systems, which they’re more familiar with, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.\n\n\"People know their local election officials. They know when they go to city or town hall that they trust the people that work there,'' said Rob Rock, Rhode Island's deputy secretary of state. \"It's really important to make sure that people understand the process.''\n\n–Deborah Barfield Berry and Terry Collins\n\nRead the story:Fearful of voter fraud?

Part of that program is \"relentless followup.\" Tracy is ordering detectives to investigate the personal networks of shooting victims immediately after every incident in an effort to prevent retaliation. This isn’t a novel concept, he said, but he’s holding officers accountable for making it standard operating procedure.\n\nThe department has information on a victim's associates and enemies, Tracy said, and \"we're just not using it.\"\n\n\"We put the yellow tape up. We question people. The person goes off to the hospital. And there's nothing that goes on after that,\" he said at a public safety meeting this week. \"We need an overall plan so we can prevent the next shooting.\"\n\nWednesday’s three shootings took place within a five-and-a-half-hour span.\n\nThe first shooting occurred about 5:25 p.m. in the city’s Brandywine Village neighborhood when a 17-year-old boy was approached by several teenagers on bicycles in the 100 block of Elliot's Way. One of the teens on a bike began firing a weapon, grazing the top of the victim’s head. The victim was admitted to Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in good condition.\n\nA little over three hours later, violence erupted in the 500 block of W. 25th St. where emergency crews found a 23-year-old man suffering from a gunshot wound to the head about 8:50 p.m. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene, about a half-mile from the first shooting.\n\nAlmost two hours later, officers were summoned to Eighth and Windsor streets in West Center City in reference to a shooting. Arriving officers found a 30-year-old woman with a gunshot wound to the lower right leg. A 14-year-old boy has been charged in that shooting.\n\nFaith leaders, some who admit it's difficult reaching people committing the violence, are hopeful of Tracy's willingness to try different approaches.\n\n\"We're optimistic that he will come with an open mind to explore opportunities to do things that will move the needle of violence to a more positive direction,\" said the Rev. Vincent P. Oliver, pastor of New Calvary Baptist Church and president of the Interdenominational Ministers Action Council of Delaware.\n\nMuch of what's causing the city's troubles is people with idle times, he said. For that, IMAC is pushing to create opportunities that provide economic mobility, as well as finding ways to engage with young people living violent lifestyles.\n\nIMAC also sees a need for community policing to allow the public to know their officers in their community and make them feel more confident in them.\n\n\"This is a tough problem, and no one solution is going to resolve it,\" Oliver said, adding IMAC members have been encouraging their congregations to reach out to young people. \"It's such a big problem. Where do you start?\n\n\"I think we all start in our own backyards.\"\n\nFor longtime City Councilwoman Loretta Walsh, breaking another violence record is \"heartbreaking.\"\n\n\"It's a complete breakdown in our society as to the use of guns and the cavalier attitude toward the death of another human being,\" she said. \"I don't know what the answer is. If I knew, I'd make it happen.\"\n\nTracy could be a \"morale booster\" for the rank and file and a strong leader for Wilmington's neighborhoods, said Walsh, chair of the Public Safety Committee.\n\nSTORY: Teen injured in Wilmington shooting\n\nSTORY: Shooting on W. 25th St. in Wilmington kills man\n\nSTORY: 14-year-old boy charged with shooting woman, 30\n\nTracy acknowledges the responsibility he took on.\n\n“I accept that challenge,” he said. “There’s a lot of trust put in me, and I’ll live up to those expectations in terms of my work ethic and making sure my officers are believing in what we’re doing. But I’m only going to be able to do it with the community. We’re all doing this together.”\n\nTracy said at the meeting that he will continue and amplify the practice of all officers being considered community policing offers, who will regularly attend civic association meetings.\n\n\"If they're going to cover an area, the community should know who they are,\" he said. \"Those are my expectations, and it’s starting this week.\"\n\nThe chief is encouraging officers to walk their beats instead of staying in their cars, a source of frequent complaints from city residents.\n\n“I like my officers getting out of their cars,” Tracy said.\n\nThe chief is also in the process of conducting a top-to-bottom review of the department and looking for redundancies.\n\n\"Where can we put civilians in a role where an officer can go back on the street?\" he said at the public safety meeting.\n\nThe city is still getting assistance from county and state police departments, though officials wouldn’t say how many officers are helping or how often. Tracy will be meeting soon with county and state police officials to assess the mutual aid program, he said.\n\nThe department maintains a culture that values rank over foot patrols, Walsh said. That could change under Tracy.\n\n\"I think he's going to bring pride back to the patrol divisions,\" she said. \"(Now) patrol is almost like a punishment. … That’s not the way it should be. Patrol should be the most important job in that department.\"\n\nAt the public safety meeting, Tracy talked about questioning current protocols, such as one practice that requires specialists to document certain reports.\n\n\"To me, we’re not serving the public,\" he said. \"When I sat in a room with my executive staff, everybody said, 'That’s the way we’ve always done it.' ... That changes today.\"\n\nTracy, who left a private sector job to return to policing, said law enforcement is his passion and he is committed to creating relationships with city residents to build trust and help quell the violence.\n\n“I’m going to give it every waking hour.\"\n\nContact Christina Jedra at (302) 324-2837, cjedra@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ChristinaJedra.

The response time exceeded National Fire Protection Association standards that fire departments respond to a dispatch in 4 minutes or less.\n\nJohn Rago, the mayor's deputy chief of staff for policy and communications, said there is a possibility things could have been different if Engine No. 3 had been operating. But he added that Squad No. 4, another pump engine housed at Station No. 4, was out at the time of the fire, which caused a longer response time.\n\n\"Please note that when the incident was re-dispatched as a house fire at 14:36:01, the first engine arrived at 14:40:32 which is 4 minutes and 31 seconds,\" Rago said in an email. \"But it is important to note that the car was parked extremely close to the dwelling which means that regardless of arrival time, the possibility existed that the fire could have extended to the dwelling.\"\n\nThe city Fire Marshal’s Office ruled the fire accidental, caused by a person working on the vehicle's fuel pump.\n\nNo lives were lost in this fire, but Snow, his daughter, Zhane, and his neighbor were displaced from their homes. Snow, whose daughter started a Go Fund Me page to help with the recovery, said he's not sure where he's going to get the money to fix his home since he did not have insurance.\n\nMore:Wilmington still grieving one year after Canby Park fire\n\nWilmington officials, including Purzycki, said the use of rolling bypasses have been in place for 20 years on and off and they don't see them as a threat to public safety.\n\n\"This is nothing novel,\" Purzycki said. \"It’s no departure from standards of safety. I don't think we'd even think about doing something if we really believed it would impair public safety.\"\n\nSTORY: Canby Park arson case moves to trial\n\nSTORY: Purzycki: Fire cuts work with proposed scheduling changes\n\nWilmington firefighters, their families and experts have continuously said the strategy can affect response times, and put residents and firefighters at risk.\n\n\"Since January of 2016, there have been three civilian fire deaths as well as three firefighter deaths,\" said Kevin Turner, president of International Association of Fire Fighters' Local 1590, the Wilmington firefighter union. \"During all of these incidents, an engine company that was due to respond was, in fact, closed.\n\n\"The common link is that closures eliminated the closest responding apparatus, which could have made a difference in the event.\"\n\nThe practice was in place Sept. 24, 2016, when Wilmington firefighters Capt. Christopher Leach and Lt. Jerry Fickes died in a Canby Park rowhome fire. Lt. Ardythe Hope, who was injured in the early morning fire, died more than two months later.\n\nIn that case, the fire department's first apparatus arrived in 5 minutes and 3 seconds after being dispatched, according to the fire board.\n\nConditional closures were in place on the afternoon of Jan. 12, 2016, when two children died in a fire that engulfed a North Monroe Street rowhome.\n\nA rig from the department already out on another call responded in about 1 minute and 35 seconds after the first report was received, nearly a full minute faster than the department's average response time of 2½ minutes, then-Fire Chief Anthony Goode said last year.\n\nA rolling bypass, or brownout, also was in place on Sept. 11 of this year when a fire in the 100 block of W. 37th Street left one man dead and two injured. The response time for that incident was 3 minutes and 24 seconds.\n\nIn these cases, the trucks out of service were in stations closest to those fire scenes. No link has been cited between the closures and the deaths.\n\nBut a 2006 report from the federal Department of Homeland Security shows that about half of structure fires confined to the room of origin and confined to the floor of origin had a response time of less than 5 minutes.\n\nMore than half of fires confined to the building of origin and nearly half of fires beyond the building of origin had a response time of less than 6 minutes.\n\nIn Snow's case, the car fire was reported at 2:33 p.m. The first apparatus to arrive at the scene was a ladder truck and that was at 2:36 p.m.\n\nThe first apparatus carrying water arrived at the scene in 6 minutes and 12 seconds, with a second water-carrying engine arriving in 6 minutes and 49 seconds.\n\nSnow believes had Engine No. 3 been operational that day, only his vehicle would have been burned.\n\n\"That's my honest to God opinion,\" he said. \"You can actually pretty much see the fire station from my house.\"\n\nTurner also believes the fire would not have reached such an advanced stage had Engine No. 3 been in service and available, adding that a reduction of firefighters in the community has had a detrimental effect on the safety of citizens and firefighters, as well as an increase in property damage.\n\n\"The companies responding to this incident all came from greater distances than what Engine 3 would have responded from, approximately five blocks, at 30th Street and Northeast Boulevard,\" he said. \"These greater distances increased the fire department response time, allowing the fire to spread rapidly from the vehicle and into the homes.\"\n\nThe day after the firefighters were killed last year, the fire department union – which has repeatedly said the program puts people at risk – begged Goode to suspend the closures.\n\nGoode did so.\n\nBut two months to the day after the arson, the city resumed the practice, citing $500,000 in overtime costs and a need to be fiscally responsible.\n\nWilmington's top firefighter, Chief Michael Donohue, said he wants more trucks on city streets, but he also toes the company line.\n\n\"I'm in a very tough position,\" he told The News Journal. \"Of course, every fire chief would like to have as many companies on the street as he can, but right now with budget constraints and injuries and the hiring of a class, I have to do the rolling bypass.\"\n\nIn May the city passed a controversial budget that proposed 29 staffing cuts, including 16 firefighter positions, to help avoid a $2 million projected budget deficit for the current fiscal year. Purzycki argued the fire department will be safely staffed at 156.\n\nDonohue promises that once the 17 fire department cadets graduate, the bypasses should go away.\n\n\"My goal is to keep fully staffed,\" he said, \"In the past, we've waited until we needed to hire 20 guys and that made the overtime go way up. My goal is once we're eight down, to start a new class. We need eight people to have a class through the state school ....\"\n\nFully staffed means six fire engines, two ladders and two battalion chiefs.\n\nPurzycki has said the rolling bypasses could end tomorrow if the union agreed to change their schedule from working 24 hours and resting 72 hours to a \"3-3-3\" schedule that was used years ago.\n\nUnder this scenario, firefighters would work three days on, three nights on and then have three days off. This schedule would allow for 47 firefighters to be working on any given shift and it would save $1.17 million on salaries and benefits, Purzycki said.\n\n\"Mayor Puzycki and his staff have never agreed to end rolling bypass in exchange for a shift schedule change,\" Turner said. \"Our current schedule of 24 on, 72 off, if properly staffed, allows the city financial flexibility in providing firefighting services.\"\n\n\"The loss of three citizens, two of which were children, and three firefighters clearly demonstrates that the belt-tightening on an already lean fire department has had deadly consequences,\"\n\nControversies with rolling bypasses are not unique to Wilmington.\n\nPhiladelphia tried cutting costs with bypasses, but last year stopped its policy, claiming it \"only exacerbated the department's already underachieving response to fire emergencies,\" according to an audit of the department. Specifically, Philadelphia Controller Alan Butkovitz's found that the bypass policies jeopardized public safety and contributed to an increase of almost $20 million in overtime costs.\n\nThe report pointed to the Dec. 9, 2014, line of duty death of Philadelphia firefighter Lt. Joyce Craig in which the first fire ladder took 18 minutes to respond.\n\nWhen Philadelphia's bypasses were implemented, the fire department said it would save $3.8 million dollars in overtime costs.\n\nAn investigation by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, an organization within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, may shed some light on Wilmington's practices. The Firefighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention team is looking into last year's Canby Park arson that killed Leach, Fickes and Hope. Part of the team's responsibility is to research fire fatalities and make recommendations.\n\nAs part of the investigation, the team reviews operating procedures, dispatch reports, medical reports and blueprints of the structure involved, and also interviews any and all people involved in fighting and responding to the blaze.\n\nThat report, which is public when finished, is on track to publish close to the end of the calendar year, according to a CDC spokeswoman.\n\nReporters Brittany Horn and Christina Jedra contributed to this story.\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2023/05/31/new-castle-county-officers-suspended-fatal-lymond-moses-shooting/70200224007/", "title": "New Castle County officers suspended after fatal Lymond Moses ...", "text": "Figuring they’d go where stolen vehicles were being found, three New Castle County Police officers drove into northeast Wilmington on a bitter cold January morning in 2021.\n\nOne of the officers, a corporal who'd recently been assigned to the area, turned onto an isolated street adjacent to a ballfield and spotted a car parked on the wrong side of the road.

Vaughn Correctional Center has made in the months since the deadly Feb. 1, 2017, riot. Here's what you can expect:\n\n1. Few details on what occurred inside Building C. The Independent Review Team was tasked with studying and understanding what led to the uprising, not with what occurred inside Building C that day. Because multiple investigations remain ongoing (and won't be closed until after the trials, which start as early as October), the team did not deal directly with what occurred that day or the details of the riot.\n\n2. Status updates on recommendations provided last fall. The state Department of Correction gave The News Journal a tour of Vaughn Correctional Center back in late January for an anniversary piece on the riot. During that tour, cameras were being installed throughout the prison; inmates on an advisory council were meeting with DOC staff; and the new warden, Dana Metzger, spoke about policy changes he was implementing to shift Vaughn's culture. All of those were recommendations from the report, so it's likely that more information about these will be shared with the public.\n\nFULL COVERAGE: Delaware's prison hostage crisis\n\n3. Low staffing numbers. Despite the state's efforts to increase the starting salaries of correctional officers, the DOC remains woefully understaffed – so much so that correctional officers remain \"frozen over\" on shifts or forced to stay on for a second shift regularly. This practice was highly criticized in the Independent Review Team's first report and cited as one of the factors that played a role in the uprising.\n\nSo what's next?\n\nThe first in the series of trials against 18 inmates charged with leading the uprising – 16 of whom are charged with murdering Lt. Steven Floyd – is slated to begin in October. Details about what the state will bring up during the trial have been limited, as prosecutors used a Rule 9 indictment to charge the men. This type of indictment contains few details and means that until the trial, the public will have little insight into the state's evidence.\n\nDefense attorneys have said the state will likely call upon other inmates as witnesses to the crimes, which will force prosecutors to pit inmate against inmate – and say that one inmate's testimony can be trusted while another's cannot.\n\nIt also may result in a larger discussion during the trial about prison conditions, one of the main reasons inmates cited as a catalyst for the riot. Many prisoners have contacted The News Journal or asked their family members to do so regarding lack of mental and physical health care, poor living conditions, and abuse at the hands of correctional officers.\n\nDelaware prison murder trial may cost state much more than money\n\nThe state did complete a review of provided health care within Vaughn and found it to be adequate, though outdated in its tracking of medical records. The \"inadequate electronic health record system\" and too few nurses and health professionals creates delays in care or missed appointments, according to the report.\n\nHealth care delays for prisoners at Vaughn partly due to staff shortage\n\nGov. John Carney, DOC Commissioner Perry Phelps and DOC Special Assistant Claire DeMatteis will address the media at 10 a.m. to release the report and answer questions about its findings.\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771 or bhorn@delawareonline.com.

Richard Bratz. \"While any fleeing felon has no right to a leisurely escape, his or her apprehension has to be constantly weighed against the likelihood of serious injury or death to the trooper or anyone else.\"\n\nAlpert said DSP's policy doesn't explicitly limit a trooper's freedom to start a chase unless the need to capture a fleeing suspect immediately could cause people further harm, such as in the case of an escaping murder suspect.\n\nInstead, he said, the written DSP policy offers vague latitude to start a chase with non-violent suspects, bucking an increasingly restrictive national trend in law enforcement practice.\n\nIn recent years, police departments across the country have revised their pursuit policies after some high-speed chases ended in tragedy. Those changes most often leaned toward eliminating chases in all but the most dangerous cases.\n\n\"Many of them are restricted to violent crimes only,\" said Alpert, who's served as a member of the International Association of Chiefs of Police Research Advisory Council.\n\nExperts say the officers and departments must weigh the benefits and risks of letting a suspect get away and the potential harm of a chase.\n\nIn most cases, experts argue, it is safer to let a suspect escape. Yet, police have complained that these overly strict policies make enforcing the law harder.\n\nThe written DSP policy gives troopers latitude to initiate a chase for misdemeanors and non-violent offenses, according to a review of the policy obtained by The News Journal.\n\nIn Delaware, troopers decide to initiate pursuits, but then must check in with a supervisor who determines whether to continue pursuing or break off.\n\nThe model policy from the International Association of Chiefs of Police, used as a standard for many agencies across the country, does not allow that latitude.\n\nThe DSP policy warns of the dangers of pursuits, but DSP reports have cited minor offenses such as broken headlights and non-violent causes such as stolen vehicles as the impetus for pursuits. What is not in all of those reports, though, are details about the pursuit, such as the length of the chase, what supervisors said to do and the speed involved.\n\nIt is those details, kept out of public view until presented in a courtroom, that define any chase's merits, a DSP spokesman said.\n\n\"Delaware State Police is confident in our pursuit policy and the authority vested in our supervisors,\" Bratz said. \"Delaware State Police continually strive to enhance the quality of life through best practices and continuous training to protect life and property.\"\n\nConcern about the DSP procedures was raised after the June 23 death of a burglary suspect on a bicycle who collided with a trooper pursuing him in a marked vehicle. State police have released few details about how the crash happened.\n\n\"The whole momentum right across North America is to make pursuits more restrictive because they're inherently dangerous,\" said Gareth Jones, once a sergeant in London and now an expert witness on police pursuits in North America. \"There's more of a realization that it is just not worth it except in the most egregious of circumstances.\"\n\nAt least 11,500 people were killed in police car chases from 1979 through 2013, according to a 2015 USA Today analysis. That includes more than 5,000 bystanders and passengers and about 6,300 fleeing suspects.\n\nSettlement reached over 2013 fatal motorcycle police chase\n\nThe civil case of a bystander killed in a 2014 crash involving a pursuing DSP trooper ended in February when a jury sided with the defendants in the case, awarding no damages to Smith's family. The fatal June 23 chase that resulted in the death of Richard Talbot is under investigation, state police said.\n\nTalbot was a 32-year-old father and tattoo artist with a history of burglary pleas and, according to a letter from his family, drug abuse. In that letter, his family described his life as a troubled one bespeckled with personal joys, which kept him afloat.\n\n\"He battled his addiction right along with his demons, trying hard to escape them all,\" the emailed letter read. \"He loved fishing, it was his other passion besides his child and his art. It was on the water he felt calm and peaceful. Please understand, we do not want Richie Talbot to be remembered as a suspect fleeing police, he was so much more.\"\n\nFamily: Man fatally hit by trooper was father, tattoo artist\n\nHe was on a bicycle around 12:30 p.m. on Fisher Road south of Milton when a Troop 7 officer noticed Talbot matched the description of a burglary suspect. The trooper turned on his lights and initiated a pursuit, police said.\n\nThe details of the chase have not been made public as DSP investigates, but there was a fatal collision between the trooper's Chevy Tahoe and Talbot's bicycle.\n\n\"The suspect ignored numerous verbal commands and continued to flee,\" read a DSP news release. \"As the pursuit of the suspect continued, the two vehicles were involved in a collision.\"\n\nPolice said stolen electronics were recovered from Talbot after the crash. The trooper involved in that crash has been placed on leave, a standard procedure.\n\n\"In past cases, and even in this case, it's unfortunate for everyone involved,\" Bratz said. \"For a trooper engaged in or about to become engaged in a pursuit, a decision must be made to continue or discontinue the pursuit. The Delaware State Police vehicle pursuit policy is designed to assist the individual trooper in determining when it is reasonable to undertake those substantial risks and, for safety purposes, when it is best to continue.\"\n\nExperts interviewed for this story agreed that chasing a suspect on a bicycle is a unique case.\n\nA more typical high-speed chase took place on Interstate 95 just days before.\n\nA Delaware River and Bay Authority police officer, on June 20 around 10 a.m., attempted to stop a driver on I-295 for aggressive driving and other moving violations, according to a police spokesman. A chase, which soon involved a DSP trooper, began on I-95 and reached speeds of 100-120 mph, according to police reports.\n\nThe fleeing motorist left the interstate onto Del. 896 headed toward Maryland, and pursuing DRBA police and the DSP trooper broke off the chase. A DRBA spokesman said the pursuit was too dangerous to continue once it reached a residential zone.\n\nNo one was hurt and the driver got away.\n\nA stricter policy in that case might have kept DRBA and DSP from giving pursuit at all.\n\nPolicies should guide officers\n\nJust letting bad guys go may be anathema to officers, but that is why policy must provide firm guidelines, according to Louis Dekmar, IACP president and chief of police of the LaGrange, Georgia, Police Department.\n\n\"The natural inclination of a police officer is to catch someone who has violated the law. But we know through studies, policy and analysis of pursuits that most folks that run from the police are not involved in dangerous felonies, and that anywhere between 10-25 percent result in an accident,\" Dekmar said.\n\nDekmar said the majority of police pursuits last less than one minute and continue for less than one mile, a circumstance which often precludes supervisors from weighing in.\n\nHe said officers are better equipped when their checklist for pursuits is short and firm.\n\n\"Policy is ultimately going to guide the response of the officer,\" Dekmar said. \"Pursuits begin and end very quickly, and so do the consequences of pursuits.\"\n\nBratz said the policy which guides Delaware state troopers is backed up by one guiding supervisors. Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security provided The News Journal with the troopers' policy but not the supervisors' policy because, Bratz said, operational security measures could be harmed through its publication.\n\nHe said the troopers' policy, reviewed every year and reinforced throughout troopers' training and career, advises them to take into account factors such as road conditions, time of day, surrounding traffic and public safety.\n\nUnder DSP policy, Bratz said, troopers make the first choice in whether to pursue, but he emphasized those mitigating factors also give them the choice to end it.\n\nAlpert said all those factors are exactly why progressive departments take the choice away from officers and put it on the command staff and supervisors.\n\n\"It forces the officer to make a series of decisions in the heat of a chase,\" Alpert said of policies like the one DSP troopers follow. \"While the officer is trying to drive well and keep an eye on the suspect, his or her mind has to go through this variety of factors to make the decision. It is complicated.\"\n\nTulsa, Oklahoma, Police Department Maj. Travis Yates is a trainer with SAFETAC, which aims to reduce line-of-duty deaths and injuries among first responders. He is adamant about strict police pursuit policies, though he didn't always see it that way.\n\n\"If you had talked to me 20 years ago, I would have said we have to chase everybody. But that has certainly changed, and I think that has come from, unfortunately, tragedies, and, unfortunately, from lessons learned,\" Yates said.\n\nNot every police administrator agrees overly strict pursuit policies are best.\n\nMilwaukee officials: Police will chase suspects\n\nMilwaukee Police Department Officer Charles Irvine Jr. died June 7 after his squad car crashed during the pursuit of a reckless driver. His partner and the squad car's driver, Officer Matthew Schulze, was injured in the rollover crash.\n\nIn the mind of Milwaukee Police Chief Alfonso Morales, the person who fled, not the policy, is the problem.\n\n\"We’re going to chase you,\" Morales said at a June 25 press conference.\n\nThat department's policy underwent a major overhaul after police pursuits there killed four bystanders in a three-month span in 2010. Some of those strict limitations have since been rolled back after suspects began to take advantage of it.\n\n“I thought you guys couldn’t pursue vehicles unless it was a felony,” the suspect in the fatal police chase told detectives after his arrest, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nA commission with oversight over the Milwaukee Police Department stands by the importance of officers having the freedom to think and act on their own.\n\n\"I'm sorry that it ended tragically but that is what the job is, and we give officers the ability to use their judgment,\" Fire and Police Commission Chairman Steven DeVougas said after the fatal police pursuit. \"Sometimes people get hurt and sometimes the bad guy doesn't get caught. We have to let the officers make those calls.\"\n\nInformation about Milwaukee police was written by Ashley Luthern of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nContact Adam Duvernay at (302) 319-1855 or aduvernay@delawareonline.com\n\nRecent Delaware State Police pursuits\n\nOn May 4, a trooper spotted a stolen Cadillac near Seaford, activated emergency sirens and, when the driver didn't stop, engaged in a vehicle pursuit. The Cadillac collided into a stop sign, ending the chase. The driver, 21-year-old Mikeyah Brewer, was charged for drug paraphernalia found in the car after the chase, driving with a suspended license, reckless driving and multiple traffic offenses.\n\nOn March 24, a trooper in Bridgeville tried to pull over 40-year-old Christopher Albury for a busted headlight, but Albury accelerated and a pursuit began. It didn't end until police deployed tire deflation devices, though Albury then fled on foot. Police said further investigation determined Albury was drunk. He was charged with DUI, failing to stop on command, resisting arrest and traffic offenses.\n\nOn Nov. 4, state police troopers tried to stop 32-year-old Seaford resident Donshell Weston in Bridgeville. No reason was given for the attempted stop in the DSP news release. Weston fled, leading troopers on a vehicle pursuit that ended when Weston crashed into a utility pole at Fisherman’s Bridge. Weston escaped on foot. Weston was wanted after the pursuit for drug possession, disregarding a police officer's signal and traffic charges. He's since been arrested.\n\nPursuit policies\n\nLouis Dekmar, president of the International Association of Police Chiefs and chief of police LaGrange, Georgia, said the IACP model should be used as a baseline.\n\n\"It's a decent policy, but it's by far not the best policy,\" said Tulsa, Oklahoma, Police Maj. Travis Yates, who is also a police trainer. \"If you're not at least meeting that guideline, you're probably behind.\"\n\nBratz said revisions to DSP's policy include guidance from groups like IACP plus any court decisions and state law changes.\n\n\"We feel, as an agency, the Delaware State Police pursuit policy is consistent with the IACP model policy guidelines,\" Bratz said.\n\nThe DSP policy offers troopers greater freedom in making the decision to chase and it first tells troopers to consider the seriousness of the offense.\n\nDSP policy states pursuits for traffic violations are unnecessary. Troopers need only position themselves to get a vehicle description and its plate numbers, the policy states.\n\nThe DSP policy puts pursuits starting with suspicions of DUI, misdemeanors and non-violent felonies at the discretion first of the trooper then the on-duty supervisor, who after being informed a pursuit has begun decides if it will be continued or abandoned.\n\nThe DSP policy give more latitude for chases with felonies involving serious injury or death. This section of the policy offers a variety of limiting factors troopers are advised to consider, though, including risk of a pursuit and seriousness of the crime.\n\nThe final portion of the DSP policy presented to The News Journal was redacted.\n\n\"Historically, most high-speed pursuits are the result of minor traffic violations,\" the DSP policy reads. \"The injuries and property damage that often occurs is frequently disproportionate to the state interest sought to be protected.\"\n\nBratz said pursuits for simple traffic violations do not meet policy by themselves, but weighing additional safety factors and supervisor oversight might change the decision.\n\nThe answer for giving chase, he said, is more complex than yes or no.\n\nThe guts of the DSP policy, according to Alpert's review, are based in the balance equation of possible harm versus potential good any police chase should calculate.\n\n\"It does have language in there that chases are dangerous and that you have to be careful, but the training they get and the accountability they're held to will determine whether they err on the side of caution or chase until the wheels fall off,\" Alpert said.\n\nAdam Duvernay\n\nPOLICE AND THE ROAD\n\nDirt bike street riding: An escape for inner-city dwellers or nuisance for everyone else?\n\nMore than 470 bags of heroin seized in Milford\n\nWilmington man in stolen car leads Pa. police on 20-mile chase, rams cop car\n\nVehicle pursuit leads to lockdown at Del Tech's Georgetown campus", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2018/08/14/delaware-state-police-ag-still-reviewing-fatal-trooper-bicyclist-collision/984633002/", "title": "Delaware State Police, AG still reviewing fatal trooper-bicyclist ...", "text": "A state police spokesman corrected information he provided earlier about a trooper's duty status after this article was first published.

Main St. at least twice a day. \"It's definitely a confusing intersection.\"\n\nOne-way West Main Street branches there, with South Main Street, formerly Elkton Road, off to the left, while West Main (Del. 273) and New London Road (Del. 896) split just south of the tracks with separate rail-crossing gates and lights.\n\nAt Wonderland Records, in the V just north of the tracks formed by the roads' split, owner Demitri Theodoropoulos said safety at the crossing is something he has \"thought long and hard about ... for many, many years.\"\n\nAfter seeing 13 crashes on \"the problem spot\" tracks since 2003, however, Theodoropoulos, an engineer by training, says he sees no easy solution.\n\n\"It's really well-marked,\" he said, and most crashes he has seen stem from \"people not paying attention.\"\n\nThey have included people driving the wrong way on New London Road and turning onto the tracks, a tractor-trailer that stopped too close to the tracks and tried to cross after gates were lowered, confused drivers like the one Sunday who drove onto gravel by the tracks and a van-load of people whose driver stopped on the tracks when pulled over by city police for a traffic violation, he said.\n\nPerhaps the best approach to reducing crashes at the crossing would be to gather railroad and road safety representatives, city officials and citizens to develop possible improvements, Theodoropoulos said.\n\nNewark does not have the money to pay for safety improvements, which he said could include additional gating, but said he wouldn't want to see studies take a lot of time, cost a lot of money and do nothing.\n\nSince 1978, the crossing next to the Deer Park Tavern, has been the subject of nine crash reports filed with the Federal Railroad Administration, three of them with injuries.\n\nNewark Police Department found records of six crashes at the crossing in the last five years alone, Lt. William Hargrove said.\n\nDuring that period, federal records list only one crash, but has variable reporting requirements, such as those with injuries or exceeding $10,500 damage.\n\nThe last crash listed in the Federal Railroad Administration accident/incident reporting database for the West Main Street crossing, city police and federal records agree, was its last with injury.\n\nA train hit a tractor-trailer there on Nov. 9, 2012, injuring the truck's driver, both say.\n\nNo one was hurt in Sunday's 11:10 p.m. crash, but the SUV was destroyed.\n\nTwo city officers – Sgt. Tom Buglio and Cpl. Robert Sharpe – were working extra-duty jobs at the Deer Park tavern next to the tracks and ran to help George Kichline, 76, of Alpha, New Jersey, after seeing his car get stuck when he turned onto gravel next to the tracks.\n\nAs they reached Kichline, warning lights began to flash and two gates came down, police said.\n\nRob Doolittle, a spokesman for CSX, which owns the train involved in Sunday's crash, said that incident \"appeared to be a case of the driver losing his way, leaving the roadway and entering the railroad tracks.\"\n\nCity police say Kichline mistakenly left the roadway and turned onto the tracks' gravel bed, where his car got stuck.\n\nNo malfunctions of the crossing's safety equipment were reported.\n\nThe Newark Police Department's Traffic Unit on Tuesday continued its investigation of the crash, in which no charges have been filed, Hargrove said.\n\nThe railroad crossing safety issue also arose in April, when a number of University of Delaware students climbed between the cars of a stopped freight train, with several jumping when the train started to roll.\n\nAbout 14 trains a day go through the West Main Street crossing, half between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., according to federal statistics. The speed limit for trains there is 50 mph.\n\nWhile overall railroad safety is improving, federal officials have seen a slight increase over recent years in grade-crossing mishaps and trespassing fatalities – both intentional and accidental.\n\nThe Federal Railroad Administration recently began a national campaign to boost safety at grade crossings.\n\nLaunched late this spring, the campaign aims to involve local enforcement agencies to \"show a greater presence at grade crossings, issue citations to drivers that violate rules of the road at crossings and consider rapid implementation of best practices for grade crossing safety.\"\n\nNewark Police Department has not been contacted for any direct involvement in that safety campaign, Hargrove said, but \"we always enforce any violations we see near crossings, very strictly.\"\n\nThere are 250,711 such grade crossings across the country, with slightly more than half used by the public, according to the railroad administration.

And some of the festival's vendors said the same.\n\nWhile this weekend hasn't reached past soaring highs, such as the years with Paul McCartney and Foo Fighters, there is still no question that Firefly is still Delaware's biggest, wildest annual party.\n\nSo if you're a cranky Dover local hoping Firefly would go away or just a hater of large-scale, corporatized festivals, sorry, but it doesn't seem like Firefly is going anywhere soon.\n\nVeteran Firefly attendee Christina Ballas, of Wilmington, gave Firefly No. 7 two thumbs up after attending every fest but one over the years.\n\n\"They really hit a home run,\" says Ballas, owner of the Talleyville-based Christina's Unique Accessories & More, who upgraded to the RV camping lot for the first time. \"I don't think they've lost their mojo whatsoever. They keep bringing amazing bands, everyone has a great experience and tells their friends.\"\n\nVendors such as Dogfish Head and NKS Distributors, which sells Budweiser, Bud Light and Red Bull, reported that they believe this year's festival will outdraw last year's. That line-up included five headliners for the first time, but no major, must-see bookings like Eminem's Delaware debut or Kendrick Lamar's hotly-anticipated Firefly return this year.\n\nAfter a solid crowd Thursday for the opening night and many more on site for Friday to see Arctic Monkeys headline, Dogfish Head workers were already making a trip back down to its Milton Brewery Friday afternoon to get more beer and gin.\n\n\"We were trending like we were going to run out. The beers and the kegs are flying,\" said Dogfish Head founder Sam Calagione. \"You know it's a good sign when we have to go back on the second day.\"\n\nCalagione estimated sales were up about 25 percent over last year and Dogfish Head's Neal Stewart, vice president of marketing, added that the number could jump as high as 35 percent more considering the high hopes for Saturday and Sunday.\n\n\"I think it's really going to really accelerate tonight,\" Stewart said late Saturday afternoon. \"I hope it's like when the Foo Fighters played and it was wall to wall people,\"\n\nSaturday is traditionally Firefly's busiest day each year and it will probably hold true again this year, seemingly buoyed by a spike in Saturday single-day passes judging from the crowd size.\n\nNKS President Paul Ruggiero reported that he had heard that Firefly had sold more than 15,000 single-day passes just for Saturday — a festival record.\n\nRuggiero said Firefly organizers Red Frog Events and Goldenvoice do not provide him beer sales numbers until the end of the weekend, but from his perspective, there are more people for 2018 than 2017.\n\n\"I would suggest it's already better than last year,\" he said Saturday afternoon from his room at Dover Downs Hotel & Casino as he watched a steady stream of day-trippers arriving.\n\nThe festival is the biggest Delaware annual event in terms of beer sales for NKS, dwarfing other massive sellers such as Memorial Day weekend in Dewey Beach.\n\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise since Saturday's line-up was stacked not only with Eminem's performance, but also an early headlining set by Las Vegas glam-pop crowdpleasers The Killers. Other acts included rapper Lil Wayne, Dutch electronic DJ Martin Garrix, British rock duo Royal Blood and rock band Portugal. The Man.\n\nCalagione, who has attended all seven Firefly fests with his family, pointed not only to buzzworthy headliners such as Eminem and Lamar for the 2018 Firefly \"surge,\" as he called it, but also the weather.\n\nWith highs hovering around 80 with clear blue skies and single-day passes available all weekend, he thinks many last minute decisions were made to visit Firefly.\n\n\"I just talked to a couple of people who saw that it was going to be awesome outside festival weather and thought, 'This is going to be epic,' and came for three days,\" Calagione said.\n\nSunday's forecast calls for some real heat with a high of 86 with partly cloudy skies. But by the time hip-hop heavyweight and Pulitzer Prize winner Kendrick Lamar appears on the main stage at 9:15 p.m. to help close out the festival — arguably the most anticipated Sunday set in Firefly history — it should be a more comfortable 75 degrees.\n\nAfter some campers were turned off by security confiscating all glass, including beer bottles and liquor bottles, as well as Thursday's long will-call lines, the festival quickly took a silly turn Friday morning for a group shower.\n\nA big group shower. A Guinness World Record was set when 396 people squeezed into a custom shower for an Irish Spring promotion, breaking the record of 331 people. \"The Bachelorette\" winner Shawn Booth was there shirtless to add to the spectacle.\n\nInside the festival, actor Terry Crews was spotted.as fans munched on everything from grilled cheese and Kobe hot dogs to steak sandwiches and Jamaican jerk ribs. Some just had to stop at Eminem's customized Mom's Spaghetti eatery, named after a lyric from his song \"Lose Yourself.\" Cups of spaghetti cost $9 and spaghetti sandwiches were $12.\n\nAnd just like last year, the festival is still drawing a younger crowd with the grounds sometimes resembling a June Bug invasion, brought on by the pop, hip-hop and EDM-heavy line-up.\n\nWilmington's Maria Romano, 19, is attending her fifth straight Firefly and enjoys the turn toward her generation. It gives them an over-sized playground, which is especially tempting for local teens and college students looking for a big-time experience in their own backyard.\n\n\"The crowd is definitely younger and the line-up has a lot to do with that. Every year, it seems younger kids are here,\" Romano said. \"And I like it younger — it feels safer.\"\n\nAt The Brewery, Newark's Rainbow Records had a pop-up shop at the festival for the first time. Co-owner Todd Brewer set up a listening station, so people could check out an album before buying.\n\nSoon, the age of the crowd struck him. He was not only dealing with young music fans who are already into vinyl like at his shop. Instead, he was teaching teens how to use a turntable.\n\n\"We were blown away when we told them to check out a record and they were like, 'Uh, what do we do?'\" he said. \"So we ended up doing tutorials, but that's a good learning experience.\"\n\nDover's Skylar Speed and Newark's Matthew Conrad, both 24, still marvel that Firefly is in the heart of Delaware, even though it was first held back in 2012 when Justin Bieber's \"Boyfriend\" dominated the charts.\n\n\"It's hard to stay away when these bands are five minutes from your house,\" says Speed, who has attended four Firefly festivals. \"It's the best thing ever. It hasn't worn off.\"\n\nConrad was especially happy to see Rainbow Records, his hometown record store, in the air conditioned Brewery tent with Dogfish Head. It was there where Conrad spotted Rainbow co-owner Brewer DJing.\n\nHe has a typical record store relationship with him. Conrad doesn't know Brewer's name and Brewer knows Conrad only as \"the Iron Maiden guy\" because he swoops in any time Rainbow gets new vinyl from the English heavy metal band.\n\n\"I'm so happy they are the ones here representing independent record shops,\" Conrad said, sitting at a picnic table under a sparkling sun and clear blue skies. \"It's cool that they're adding to the Delaware vibe, it's something to be real proud of.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

Cape also captured its first state championship in a nail-biter against Caravel Academy and sent several players to the All-Conference and state teams.\n\nBut the icing on the cake came Wednesday afternoon, when Vikings’ senior shortstop Zack Gelof was selected in the Major League Baseball draft. In the 38th round,, the Cleveland Indians selected the Delaware baseball Player of the Year.\n\n“I was in the car and got the call from the area scout for the Indians,” Gelof said. “It was pretty awesome. It was me and my mom, and we had just left to go up to my college summer league. It was really special that I got to share it with her. I wanted to give her a hug, but it was hard since she was driving.”\n\nGelof was a special player from the start\n\nGelof’s head coach said he always knew his star player had pro potential.\n\nHOT STOVE UPDATES: MLB free agency: Ranking and tracking the top players available.\n\nThrough his work ethic, dedication to his teammates and desire to get better, Evick said he wasn’t surprised when he heard Gelof had been drafted.\n\n“When I saw him come in as a freshman, right away I knew he had something you don’t see very often,” Evick said. “He had the ability, the size, the speed, but he also had the mental approach of no other kid I’ve ever seen. He had the game figured out, he knew it’s a game of failure. He uses it as motivation, and he never stopped working.”\n\nGelof signed his national letter of intent to play at the University of Virginia in December. In his senior season, the shortstop finished with a .466 batting average, six homers and 16 RBIs.\n\nDespite his selection, Gelof said he plans to attend college and develop as a player and person.\n\n“(The season) was super special,” Gelof said. “I’m so thankful for everything that happened. A lot of hard work went into this, and to cap it off this way, it’s just really special.”\n\nHe was one of three Cape players selected to the All-State first team, with teammates Austin Elliott and David Erickson also receiving the honor.\n\nAn inspiration to future Cape players\n\nWith so much success at a young age, Evick thinks Gelof sends a huge message to current and future Vikings’ ballplayers.\n\n“They saw the time he put in,” Evick said. “He would have speed and agility workouts after games. He would take extra swings, go take groundballs and put in extra time to get better and get the reps. Losing a kid like that who’s been a leader for our school, not just our team … we’re really going to miss him. Zack really is phenomenal.”\n\nGelof wasn’t the only Delmarva athlete to get a call on the third day of the draft.\n\nFormer Nandua player gets drafted\n\nFormer Nandua player and University of South Carolina catcher Hunter Taylor was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the 23rd round, while Colonel Richardson pitcher Jake Zebron was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 18th round.\n\nTaylor, a 2014 graduate, was an All-American second team selection his senior year, when he recorded a .554 batting average with 12 home runs and 39 RBIs.\n\n“He was pretty special in high school,” Nandua coach Luke Brankley said. “He had scouts coming to watch our home games, so we knew he would have interest. I told him to stay humble and keep working hard every day.”\n\nOnce he got to college, Taylor saw action behind the plate in all four seasons, making the NCAA Regional All-Tournament Team as a sophomore.\n\nOne of his best performances came in February, when the Virginia native blasted a grand slam in South Carolina’s victory over Winthrop. In his final year with the Gamecocks, Taylor recorded a .266 average, 41 hits, 32 RBIs and eight homers.\n\nSouth Carolina continues its season Saturday in the NCAA Super Regionals. The team is set to take on No. 5 Arkansas.\n\nOnce he does make it to a Major-League field, Brankley said he hopes there’s some tickets lying around for Taylor’s former coach.\n\n“We have a pretty good relationship, so when there’s extra tickets, he can send them my way,” Brankley said with a laugh. “He’s definitely a role model these kids can look up to. I know he felt really relieved getting drafted.”\n\nColonel Richardson pitcher hears his named called\n\nUp the road, Zebron is coming off one of his best high school seasons, helping the Colonels to a Bayside North title and an appearance in the 1A East Regional Final.\n\nThe senior was part of a team that won all but one game in the regular season, while helping Colonel record 11 shutouts on the year.\n\nAccording to MaxPreps, Zebron finished with 70 strikeouts in 51 innings pitched, while allowing 14 walks. He was also a force at the plate, putting up a .446 batting average with 33 hits and 22 RBIs.\n\nBaseball Reference had Zebron listed as the third player ever drafted from Colonel Richardson.\n\nShould they all sign, the trio would likely start their pro careers in the organization’s farm systems. But as they continue their baseball journeys, the three athletes have the potential to represent Delmarva in the MLB for years to come.\n\n“People never really respected Delmarva,” Gelof said. “With kids going to good schools, they're starting to take notice. It goes to show you don’t need the crazy facilities that are in the baseball hotbeds — you can be from a small town, and if you work really hard, you can get there.”\n\nMore sports stories:\n\nBaseball:Olympic gold medalist hockey player to speak at Delmarva Shorebirds' game\n\nNational success in the ring:Boxer from Main Street Gym advances in national tournament\n\nShark captured:Massive shark caught at Ocean City tournament", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/high-school/2018/05/31/zack-gelof-cape-henlopen-named-delaware-baseball-player-year/660141002/", "title": "Zack Gelof of Cape Henlopen named Delaware baseball player of ...", "text": "Cape Henlopen shortstop Zack Gelof has been voted Player of the Year and leads the All-State baseball team released Thursday by the Delaware Baseball Coaches Association.\n\nGelof hit .466 with six home runs and 16 RBIs and was successful on all 25 of his stolen-base attempts during the regular season.

They were 3-13 in their previous 16 games.\n\n“We followed the game plan,” A's manager Mark Kotsay said. “This park can get you out of the right approach, and from the onset we stayed through the middle, we stayed through the other side of the field, and you saw the results. We were able to add onto a lead, which we haven't been able to do. Overall it was a good night.\n\nOakland took a 7-2 lead into the eighth inning, but the Rockies closed to 7-5 on pinch-hitter Michael Toglia’s run-scoring single and Jurickson Profar’s two-run double.

Sears has not missed a turn in the rotation this season, but his only other victory came against Milwaukee on June 11. A’s starting pitchers are 10-47 this season.\n\n“It was good to get a big lead early, so I could go out and attack those guys,” Sears said. “It's an adjustment (pitching at Coors Field). You can't think too much about it. Some of the late movement on some of your pitches may not be there.

I'm going to keep trying to have a blast out there and bring some energy.”\n\nAfter Laureano singled in Rooker in the first inning, Langeliers tripled in the first run of a three-run second for a 4-0 lead. His was the only ball the A’s got out of the infield in a rally fueled on errors by third baseman Ryan McMahon and second baseman Alan Trejo, a hit batter and a fielder’s choice that did not result in an out.\n\nAllen drove in Langeliers with Oakland’s only other hit in the second, a liner the caromed off Colorado left-hander Kyle Freeland (4-11), who was activated from the injury list before the game.\n\nLangeliers doubled with two outs in the third inning and scored on Allen’s triple to make it 5-0.\n\nGrichuk’s 445-foot homer in the fourth inning broke Sears’ shutout. Gelof’s 393-foot homer with two outs in the fifth made it 7-1.\n\nFreeland gave up nine hits and five runs, three earned, in his first start since suffering a right shoulder injury when he dove for an popup in San Francisco on July 9.

Here's how often it happens\n\n“It’s a pretty surreal feeling,” said Josh, who played parts of two seasons with the San Diego Padres in 2011-12. “It’s one of those things you always hope he gets the opportunity to experience. He has put in the work, and the team has played well. I am just so excited he gets the chance because I know how special Omaha can be.”\n\nJosh and his parents weren’t able to travel to the United States to watch Liam play in person because of the strict travel restrictions still in place in Australia from COVID-19.\n\n“I would have been on the next plane out if I could get there,” Josh said. “When we punched our ticket to Omaha in 2009, my mom and dad were on a flight two or three days later. That makes this a little bit harder for all of us.”\n\nThe NCAA does not keep a list of brothers who have played at the CWS or track how many Australians have been on rosters. But there is a good chance the Spence brothers made history.\n\n“We are likely the first Australian brothers to ever do it,” said Josh, who was drafted three times and spent five seasons in major league baseball. “There are not a lot of Australians in general that have been fortunate enough to play at the College World Series. It just makes this even more special.”\n\nThree brothers, three baseball players\n\nJosh, 33, Liam, 23, and their middle brother, Nic, 31, grew up competing with and against one another in Australia. They all played baseball at Central Arizona before transferring to four-year universities to finish their college careers. Nic played at Cincinnati.\n\n“I think part of Liam’s resilience as a player comes from us not treating him eight to 10 years younger than us when we were playing backyard cricket or pingpong,” Josh said. “No matter what we did, he was always one of us, and he learned from a pretty young age how to be resilient and relentless in that brotherly situation.”\n\nLiam was not an immediate star in baseball. He never made a national team in Australia and made the state team only once in six years.\n\nMORE:How Tennessee baseball roster is built for a deep College World Series run\n\nFATHERS' DAY:To understand Tennessee baseball coach Tony Vitello, start with his dad\n\nHe started playing in a local men’s league at age 14 to help develop his game.\n\n“He got told ‘No’ a lot by teams and told he was not good enough. But he never got discouraged and just kept working hard,” Josh said. “To see him get some accolades now and go from basically a non-prospect to a first-team All-SEC shortstop at Tennessee almost makes me emotional just to think about. I think it’s a really good lesson about using failure as a stepping stone towards success.”\n\nJosh hopes Liam can serve as a role model for up-and-coming Australian baseball players. Spence was named first-team All-SEC and to the SEC All-Defensive team.\n\n“Liam being able to play there can shed some light on college baseball,” Josh said. “A lot of our best players get poached to sign professionally out of high school and some aren’t ready. Liam can be a poster child for working hard in the college system and flourishing in that system to turn himself into a prospect.”\n\nThroughout Tennessee’s postseason run, the Spence family has received messages of support from people across Australia. They are following the team’s success and trying to watch every game, no matter how early they need to wake up.\n\n“Within the baseball community in Australia, there is a lot of excitement for Liam. Everyone's rooting for him,” Josh said. “Obviously you would rather be there in person to share those memories with him. But we are all just so happy for him.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2023/08/09/michael-lorenzen-throws-no-hitter-as-phillies-beat-nationals-7-0/70563885007/", "title": "Michael Lorenzen throws no-hitter as Phillies beat Nationals 7-0", "text": "AP\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) — Michael Lorenzen threw the 14th no-hitter in Philadelphia Phillies history, a dazzling performance in only his second start with his new team, which beat the Washington Nationals 7-0 on Wednesday night.\n\nThe 31-year-old Lorenzen (7-7) struck out five, walked four and improved to 2-0 since he was acquired from Detroit at the trade deadline for a minor leaguer.

Ryan Noda and pinch-hitter Seth Brown each launched a two-run homer in the sixth to begin the comeback after the last-place A’s were held hitless through five innings.\n\n“Getting something going there in the sixth was a good sign,” A’s manager Mark Kotsay said. “The momentum of the at-bats, they kind of feed off each other. The next thing you know we’re back in the game and taking a lead.”\n\nOakland blew a 4-3 lead in the top of the seventh on Luis Rengifo’s 15th home run before storming back in the bottom half.\n\nZack Gelof singled with one out, and Angels reliever José Soriano (0-1) fielded Noda’s sharp comebacker but turned and threw the ball wildly into center field for an error. Brent Rooker walked to load the bases before Kemp’s single gave the A’s a 6-4 lead. Rooker also scored on the play following a throwing error by center fielder Mickey Moniak.\n\nHOT STOVE UPDATES: MLB free agency: Ranking and tracking the top players available.\n\nBrown was intentionally walked before Langeliers drove in a pair with a first-pitch double to right.\n\n“It takes one pitch to get going in the box,” Noda said. “Hitting is contagious. We love when it’s contagious on the positive side for us. We’re going to keep building off today, keep growing, and hopefully it doesn’t take us until the sixth inning to get going.”\n\nOakland has won three straight for the second time this season. It was the third series sweep this year for the A’s (42-95).\n\nThe Angels scored twice in the ninth and had two runners on before Trevor May got pinch-hitter Mike Moustakas to strike out swinging for his 17th save.\n\nFrancisco Pérez (1-1), the third of five relievers used by Kotsay, retired two batters for his first career win. The first out Pérez got was was a five-pitch swinging strikeout of two-way Japanese star Shohei Ohtani, who is tied for the major league lead with 44 home runs.\n\n“It feels awesome,” Pérez said. “Striking out Ohtani, that’s a tough guy to get out, but nothing is impossible to do. We just made the right pitches and executed.”\n\nRengifo, who had an RBI single in the ninth, extended his career-high hitting streak to 11 games.\n\nEarlier in the day, Angels catcher Max Stassi announced he will miss the entire 2023 season because of a serious family medical issue.\n\nThe last-place A’s couldn’t muster much offense against Tyler Anderson early and got their first hit off the left-hander after a video replay overturned a call.\n\nThe change came one pitch before Noda crushed a first-pitch fastball from Anderson over the wall in center.\n\n“There’s still a lot of growth to go but I’m going to keep going and keep grinding with the boys,” Noda said.\n\nAfter Carlos Pérez singled to chase Anderson with one out, Brown hit the second two-run homer of the inning for the A’s, a pinch-hit drive off Andrew Wantz to make it 4-3.\n\nRengifo tied it with a solo home run off Adrián Martínez in the seventh.\n\nROOKIE HONOR\n\nMoments after the game ended, Gelof was named AL Rookie of the Month for August. Gelof made several big plays Sunday, including legging out an infield single that began the A’s rally in the sixth.\n\nGelof also made a nice grab of Moniak’s sharp grounder up the middle, then threw to first for the out.\n\n“It’s been a tough season but there are some bright spots and this is definitely a bright spot for us as a group and as an organization,” Kotsay said. “He plays with an intensity and you saw that with the infield single.”\n\nFOR STARTERS\n\nAnderson dominated the A’s early. He retired nine of the first 10 batters and pitched out of a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the fourth. Anderson allowed three hits and three runs in 5 1/3 innings.\n\nA’s starter Kyle Muller had three strikeouts in four innings and allowed three runs on five hits.\n\nTRAINER’S ROOM\n\nAngels: C Matt Thaiss was activated off the injured list after he missed eight games with right shoulder inflammation. INF Andrew Velazquez was optioned to Triple-A Salt Lake.\n\nAthletics: Top prospect Mason Miller (forearm tightness) had four strikeouts in three scoreless innings during a rehab start with Triple-A Las Vegas on Friday. Miller threw 22 of his 37 pitches for strikes.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAngels: LHP Kenny Rosenberg (0-0, 6.43 ERA) faces the visiting Orioles on Monday. Rosenberg’s only start in the majors was against Seattle on June 19, 2022.\n\nAthletics: LHP Ken Waldichuk (2-7, 5.92) pitches against the Blue Jays on Monday in Oakland, his 31st appearance this season and 18th start. Waldichuk is fourth in strikeouts (114) among rookie pitchers.\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/03"}]}

Burying a hatchet on Return Day. Scrapple.\n\nAnd this year marks a particularly wacky, yet endearing, chapter in Dela-Weird history: It's the 25th anniversary of the Claymont Christmas Weed.\n\nFor more than two decades, local residents have been decorating a \"weed\" with holiday ornaments and displaying it on Philadelphia Pike. Seriously.\n\nThere's even a well-attended Christmas parade, which started in 1998, that's built around the tradition. And a song.\n\nThe parade steps off at 10 a.m. Saturday. The 1.4 mile route on Philadelphia Pike runs from Maple Lane Elementary School to the parking lot of the Food Lion shopping center at Darley Road.\n\nOrganizer Barbara Harbin expects four to five marching bands, cheerleaders, dogs from Faithful Friends, local politicians, fancy cars and a plethora of fire trucks ending with the Claymont Fire Company carrying Santa Claus, who will pose for photos at the library.\n\nBut, let's go back to why Claymont residents find festive pride and pleasure in a weed in the first place.\n\nIt all started on a slow news day back on Dec. 16, 1993, a little more than a week before Christmas.\n\nThe late News Journal photographer Donaghey G. Brown snapped some sweet photos of a wild fir tree growing from a crack in Philadelphia Pike near the I-495 exit in Claymont.\n\nThe scraggly little thing was decorated with ornaments and gold garland, apparently by passing motorists.\n\nOne of the photos ran on the front page of The News Journal on Dec. 17, 1993, and a cheeky copy editor (and were there ever any other kind?) slapped on a headline: \"O Christmas Weed.\"\n\nIn the news business, this is known as a \"bright,\" a short, amusing story intended to delight newspaper readers as they sip their coffee.\n\nThat morning a lot of eyes saw Brown's uplifting photo, but apparently, not everyone found the humor.\n\nDelDOT, in particular, viewed the weed as a traffic hazard, not a holiday symbol. Bah-humbug.\n\nIn the interest of safety, though some have described it as the ultimate Scrooge-y move, DelDOT, that same morning, chopped down \"the weed.\"\n\nAnd that's when the Yuletide throwdown began.\n\nAnother tree went up, but, a short time later, it was stolen. And it happened again. And again.\n\nEight trees later, The News Journal, with the help of a local security company, stepped in and then Executive Editor John N. Walston hired a guard to watch over \"the weed\" until Christmas Day. Really. It should be noted, this was back-in-the-day when newspapers were a lot more flush.\n\nAnd just to put even more nutty icing on the cake, former reporter/editor Al Mascitti wrote a fable called \"The Christmas Weed\" which appeared in The News Journal on Dec. 25, 1993. Actually, several readers later wrote Letters to the Editor saying how much they enjoyed Mascitti's tale.\n\nToday, the wacky Christmas Weed tradition continues and Barbara Harbin is not at all surprised.\n\n\"We say it represents Claymont. We're not pretty, but we're plucky. We are resilient and we keep coming back.\"\n\nThe weed will be decorated Saturday on the lawn of the Church of the Ascension, after the parade, around 12:30 p.m. Then, the Claymont Lions Club will accompany the weed as it's placed on a median on Philadelphia Pike.\n\nHarbin, who has been organizing the parade and weed decorating since 2004, says no one ever tries to steal the weed anymore.\n\n\"It's famous now. It's so famous, people come from out-of-state to see it. Even DelDOT leaves it alone,\" she says.\n\nStill, just in case anyone has sticky fingers or unkind intentions, there's a little added insurance so the weed stays put.\n\n\"We ziplock it to the post that's at the median,\" Harbin says.\n\nSUPPORT LOCAL JOURNALISM: Subscribe today\n\nThe \"weed\" today remains true to its original roots. It's scrawny and about 4 feet tall, though Harbin admits \"it doesn't look a whole lot like the first one.\"\n\n\"A couple years back, we went out and dug it out of the woods. We used to do that every year, \" Harbin says, \"but I got tired of tromping through the woods in the snow and rain.\"\n\nHarbin says she made an executive decision: \"Two years ago, I decided we're going to plant this sucker. I dug a hole in my yard and planted it. I just dig it up now and put it in a bucket every year. In January, I'll put it back in the hole.\"\n\nMore on the Christmas Weed\n\nThe original \"Christmas Weed\" first appeared on the front page of The News Journal on Dec. 17, 1993. Later that morning, in the interest of safety, DelDOT chopped the weed down.\n\nAn article posted on Dec. 24, 1993, from then News Journal Executive Editor John N. Walston, who decided to hire a guard to watch over the \"Christmas Weed.\"\n\nA fable about \"The Christmas Weed,\" written by former reporter Al Mascitti, appeared in The News Journal on Dec. 25, 1993:\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico\n\nRELATED:\n\nThe fun of 'The Pole Family' might be its mystery\n\nGreek monument at Tatnall was once a 1920s Wilmington gas station\n\nWhy is there a vintage, clawfoot bathtub on Bellefonte's main street?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/09/hospital-wedding-howard-celebrates-home-order-news-around-states/114749772/", "title": "Hospital wedding, Howard celebrates: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: An organization for teachers is expressing concern that children are being allowed to return to school before completing required COVID-19 quarantine periods, potentially putting the health of students and school employees at risk. The Alabama Education Association sent a letter Thursday to the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners saying it had learned some doctors are writing excuses for students to return to school before mandated quarantine periods expired. Theron Stokes, associate executive director of AEA, said doctors should be aware of the guidelines and follow them. “When students return to school having not completed the entire 14-day quarantine period, they are placing their fellow students and their schools’ employees at risk. For students and school employees who have underlying health conditions, these decisions can be deadly,” Stokes wrote. The group said it is gross negligence to ignore the quarantine guidelines and threatened possible legal action.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s largest city plans to boost enforcement of an expanded mask mandate and restrict gathering sizes in a bid to curb coronavirus cases, officials said Friday. The changes take effect Monday, with masks to be worn, with a few exceptions, in indoor public settings or communal areas and outdoors when distancing from non-household members is not possible. In some cases, such as for individuals with disabilities who cannot tolerate a mask, face shields will be allowed unless wearing one would be impossible, the order says. Masks are to be worn by school-age children older than 5, those who exercise or work at gyms, and athletes, players, coaches and officials who participate in organized sports, according to the municipality directives. Athletes must keep a mask on for indoor sports, but one is not required while “exercising vigorously outdoors,” the directives state.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A top hospital official urged Arizonans to help curb the spread of the coronavirus by considering alternatives to traditional Thanksgiving get-togethers. “Congregating in large groups and close contact with others outside of your immediate household put you and those around you at risk,” said Dr. Marjorie Bessell, chief clinical officer of Banner Health. “I know we are asking a lot of you.” Banner operates 23 hospitals in Arizona and several in other states. Arizona health officials on Sunday reported 1,880 new COVID-19 cases and 17 additional deaths. State Department of Health Services officials said the latest figures increase Arizona’s totals to 259,264 cases and 6,164 known deaths since the coronavirus pandemic began. Cases and hospitalizations have been steadily increasing in Arizona since late September and throughout October after bottoming out in August after the state was a national hot spot in June and July.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state hit a record one-day increase in coronavirus cases Friday for the second day in a row, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he was growing concerned about hospital capacity. The Department of Health said the state’s probable and confirmed virus cases rose by 1,870. The state’s previous one-day high came Thursday, when it reported 1,548 new cases. On Saturday the department reported 1,598 new cases and 12 additional deaths for totals of 120,828 cases and 2,068 deaths since the pandemic began. The department reported 722 hospitalizations, 16 more than Friday’s then-record high. “Today’s numbers show we are not in a good position as we head into the colder months,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Friday. “I ask all Arkansans to take this virus seriously and to take necessary precautions. Our number of new cases is growing at a rate that worries me in terms of our hospital capacity.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: Republican former U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa was victorious Saturday in his race to return to Congress, where he once headed the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and became a GOP favorite for launching a string of investigations of the Obama administration. The former nine-term congressman and ardent supporter of President Donald Trump trailed early in the San Diego-area 50th District. But as more votes were counted after Election Day, he overtook Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar. The latest vote count update gave him about 54% of the votes and a 23,000-vote lead. Issa already had declared victory in a statement posted to social media Friday night. Campa-Najjar, a 31-year-old former Obama administration official, was making his second bid for the seat. He received more votes than he did in 2018 and thanked his supporters for “giving a Latino-Arab American a chance to do something special.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: City officials are urging residents to stay home between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. in an effort to stem the tide of coronavirus cases, which could overwhelm area hospitals by the end of the year. Mayor Michael Hancock said during a virtual news conference Friday that the “Home by 10 Order,” which will last for at least 30 days, is necessary to avoid another citywide stay-at-home order. He also urged residents not to gather or mix with other households. “I’m not going to mince any words here when it comes to the spread of the coronavirus,” Hancock said. “We’re on a very dangerous path. We’re seeing rapid, significant increases in the numbers of people getting sick, and many of those people ended up in the hospital.” The mayor shied away from calling the order a curfew because he said enforcement would only target the most egregious violations – not, for instance, someone walking their dog or going for a run after 10 p.m.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: Several colleges and universities have added new restrictions for students as coronavirus cases continue to rise in the state. Quinnipiac University announced it is instituting a two-week quarantine after recording 155 positive tests on campus since Wednesday. The quarantine means residential students must stay in their rooms, except to pick up takeout meals from the dining hall, and students living off campus can only return for testing. Students in isolation who have tested positive for the coronavirus will have meals delivered to their rooms each night. At Yale University, students residing in Davenport, Hopper, and Saybrook Colleges were ordered to quarantine because of positive coronavirus tests. In Fairfield, Sacred Heart and Fairfield universities have instituted curfews. The state reported Friday that 22 more people were hospitalized with COVID-19, bringing the total to 402, the highest total in five months.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: For the Rehoboth Beach Film Society, the show (or shows) must go on. The 23rd annual Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival is taking place as scheduled this month with a few modifications for health concerns. Only five films will be shown inside the society’s Cinema Art Theater, with 10 more available to stream at home. “We had the opportunity to carry out this event with the safety of our viewers as a priority,” said Rehoboth Beach Film Society Executive Director Sue Early. “They can watch films at home this year. It’s not the same experience, but there’s some great films to see. And in our theater, we could be showing at 60%, and we’re only going to use 30 out of 104 seats, which is just under 29%. They are well-spaced and cleaned after every screening. So it’s really safe.” Tickets are on sale now for the festival, which runs Nov. 5-15.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Hundreds of people gathered on the campus of Howard University on Saturday to celebrate their sister Kamala Harris after her announcement as vice president-elect, WUSA-TV reports. “When you come to Howard University, that is a very distinct choice,” said Niambi Carter, associate professor of political science at Howard University. “You are choosing a legacy and a lineage that is great in so many aspects.” A large group of Alpha chapter members of Alpha Kappa Alpha gathered in front of the sorority’s plot on the yard to cheer for Harris’ election. “I’m so proud of Kamala, and I’m so proud to stand on the grounds where she walked,” alumna Kenya Sumner said. Harris graduated from Howard with a degree in political science and economics in 1986, the same year she became a member of the Alpha chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first historically black sorority, founded on Howard’s campus.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrange Park: Eight weeks after being admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, Henry Bell and his longtime fiancee decided the time was right for a wedding. So the day before his anticipated release from the inpatient rehab center at Orange Park Medical Center, Bell, 63, and Antionette Brown, 48, said their vows in the parking lot Thursday. Brown’s uncle performed the ceremony. “His condition was deadly,” Brown said. “We decided to do it now because we feel they (the hospital staff) are like family and wanted to share the life they gave us back.” Bell was admitted to the hospital Sept. 13 and immediately put on a ventilator. Brown and the couple’s seven grown children could only wait and hope for his condition to improve. He spent weeks in intensive care. He entered the hospital’s rehab center Sunday, and his recovery has included learning how to walk again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Athens-Clarke County plans to rent space for jury trials and grand jury proceedings. Grand juries and trials have been on hold in the state since March 14, when state Supreme Court Chief Justice Harold Melton declared a statewide judicial emergency because of the coronavirus threat. In subsequent renewal orders, Melton amended them to allow for court proceedings if they could be conducted safely. The best option for holding court proceedings in Athens-Clarke County is by using the Classic Center, said a committee tasked with deciding the issue. The county will pay the Classic Center up to $350,815 to rent space for the proceedings. The price Athens-Clarke will pay includes daily cleaning of the rooms used for trial proceedings, including space to conduct actual trials and a jury deliberation room. The $350,815 amount is based on the cost of 30 jury trials that last an average of five days each.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Land and Natural Resources reopened a popular scenic spot on Oahu that has been closed to visitors since the outbreak of the coronavirus. The Nuuanu Pali State Wayside, popularly known as Pali Lookout, was closed to the public at the outset of the pandemic because of budgetary constraints and crowding concerns. There were challenges in maintaining physical distancing at the lookout, State Parks Administrator Curt Cottrell said. Officials announced the park, which is among the most visited spots on Oahu, reopened Wednesday with daily hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The gates to the park’s access roads will be unlocked and secured daily by the Honolulu Police Department. The state set new parking fees of $7 per vehicle for nonresidents. Hawaii residents are not subject to parking and entry fees at any state parks. Tour buses are largely absent from the lookout, making the volume of visitors much lower.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A state panel of medical experts is asking the governor for a statewide mask mandate, and hospitals are running out of space for COVID-19 patients, after a week marked with record numbers of new cases and deaths. At least 671 Idaho residents have died from the coronavirus, and a record high of 1,290 new COVID-19 cases were reported on Wednesday alone, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, followed by 1,265 new cases Thursday. More than 69,500 residents have been confirmed to have the illness since the pandemic began. Idaho hospitals have reported more than 200 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 every day since Oct. 12. On Nov. 2, the most recent data available, there were nearly 300 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Jeanie Gentry, CEO of Steele Memorial Medical Center in Salmon, told the Idaho Statesman the facility is short about 40% of its staffers because they’ve been exposed or sickened.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has tested negative for the coronavirus after learning he may have been exposed during a meeting to someone who tested positive. Members of Pritzker’s staff who attended the meeting last Monday also tested negative for the virus, his office said Saturday in a news release. Pritzker had self-isolated Friday while awaiting test results. They were the second negative test results for Pritzker and staff members who also underwent weekly tests Wednesday, according to his office. Meanwhile, 12,438 newly confirmed and probable cases of the virus and another 76 deaths were reported Saturday by the Illinois Department of Public Health. More than 10,370 new cases and 49 deaths were reported Friday. Illinois has had nearly 478,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 10,150 deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: The University of Notre Dame’s Faculty Senate formally expressed disappointment in the school president’s failure to wear a face mask at a White House event days before he tested positive for the coronavirus. The Faculty Senate voted 29-13 on Thursday for a resolution expressing disappointment in the Rev. John Jenkins’ failure to wear a mask and practice social distancing at a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor confirmed last month as a U.S. Supreme Court justice. The Faculty Senate was originally expected to vote on a no confidence resolution, but that was amended. Jenkins tested positive for the coronavirus days after the Rose Garden ceremony, where President Donald Trump introduced Barrett as his nominee to the high court. Jenkins was seen without a mask, and he shook hands and sat shoulder-to-shoulder with others.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State prison officials reported Friday that a coronavirus outbreak has infected nearly half of the inmates at a prison in Anamosa. Testing last week revealed 476 inmates among 985 at the prison tested positive for the virus, said Cord Overton, a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Corrections. A report provided by the department indicates 37 staff members also tested positive. Across the nine institutions the department manages, 601 inmates were infected as of Friday afternoon. The report shows coronavirus has been active in the prison system since testing began in March with more than 21,000 tests administered to inmates. It said 1,252 inmates have recovered, an indication they have at one time tested positive but are no longer symptomatic are believed to be contagious. Four Iowa inmates have died during the pandemic, the report said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state saw most of a projected budget shortfall melt away Friday with a fiscal forecast that is less pessimistic about the economy and tax collections than a dire estimate issued this spring during a statewide lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic. The forecasting group boosted the state’s forecast for tax collections by $463 million, or 6.3%, for the 2021 budget year that began July 1. The group also issued its first calculations for the 2022 budget year that starts in July 2021, and while the forecast predicts a drop in tax collections of 2.1%, or $166 million, that’s due largely to the end of a temporary, pandemic-induced move to help income taxpayers. The Legislature’s nonpartisan research staff now projects a $153 million budget shortfall for the state’s 2022 budget year, an amount that almost can be covered by an internal shuffling of government funds that Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly already has proposed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s bar and restaurant operators are getting a break from alcoholic beverage renewal fees in a cost-saving step as they struggle with revenue losses from the pandemic. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is granting a 12-month fee renewal waiver to license holders, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday. Bar and restaurant operators who haven’t submitted the renewal fee this year won’t have to pay until 2021, he said. Those who have paid this year will have their fees waived in 2021, he said. “This has certainly been a difficult year for our bars, restaurants and venues, and they deserve this innovative support as we face what could be a very painful winter,” Beshear said. Bars and restaurants have endured capacity limitations to help contain the coronavirus. The fee waiver doesn’t apply to producers, distributors, wholesalers and others able to continue operations throughout the virus-related state of emergency.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: In response to complaints that family and clergy were barred from hospitals and nursing homes amid the coronavirus pandemic, legislators have rewritten state laws to lessen visitation restrictions during public health emergencies. The bills passed unanimously in the special session that ended last month and were signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. They still will give discretion to the Louisiana Department of Health to decide just how wide-open the visitation can be and what safety protections will have to be followed. One measure by Sen. Robert Mills, a Minden Republican, calls on the health department to create rules requiring inpatient health care facilities to allow pastors, priests and other members of the clergy to visit patients during a public health emergency, if the patient asks for the visit.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials on Friday recommended caution at more schools in the state because of the rise in coronavirus cases. The state uses a color-coded system to categorize the level of precaution schools should use. The administration of Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said it’s adding schools in Knox County and Franklin County to the “yellow” category, which is an intermediate level. Those counties join Somerset and Washington counties in the yellow category. All other counties in the state are in the “green” category, the lowest level, though officials said they’re closely monitoring schools in Waldo and Kennebec counties. The state recommends that schools located in counties in the yellow category consider hybrid instruction models to reduce the number of people in schools and classrooms. The change in category for some schools came as cases surged around the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city is tightening restrictions on restaurants and indoor and outdoor gatherings in response to rising cases of the coronavirus, Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young announced Friday. The changes will take effect Thursday at 5 p.m. Young said numbers of people in restaurants, religious facilities, theaters and malls will be limited to 25% capacity. Young said food service establishments must close indoor dining at 10 p.m. Bars that don’t have a license to sell food will be closed. “I am instituting these restrictions for the public health and to save lives in Baltimore city,” Young said. Also, the city’s health commissioner revised an order to require masks to be worn in public at all times, whether people are inside or outside. Dr. Letitia Dzirasa’s order is effective immediately. “Over the past month Baltimore city has seen our data trends move in the wrong direction,” she said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State officials on Friday urged more schools to return to full, in-person instruction, saying that only communities with the highest COVID-19 rates should be using any form of remote learning. Under previous guidance, schools were told to shift among remote learning, in-person learning or a mix of the two depending on their area’s infection rate. Areas with moderate spread were advised to use remote or hybrid learning, while only those with the lowest rates were encouraged to bring students back full time. But speaking at a news conference, Gov. Charlie Baker said there’s growing evidence that schools are not a significant source of spread and that keeping students at home hurts their learning and mental health. “We continue to see too many communities with children learning in remote-only models,” he said. “We all know that losing a week, a month, a quarter or more in the life of a kid’s education has real consequences.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Joe Biden reclaimed the Wolverine State for Democrats with a surge of support in urban regions like Detroit and Grand Rapids, offsetting high turnout in rural and exurban areas for President Donald Trump. Biden’s 146,000-vote margin, 2.7 percentage points, was powered by gains in big, vote-rich counties such as Oakland near Detroit and Kent, which includes Grand Rapids – amid a record 5.5 million people casting ballots statewide. Biden won Oakland by 14 points, besting Hillary Clinton’s 8-point edge in 2016. He carried Kent by almost 6 points after Trump netted it by 3 points four years ago. Trump again won traditional bellwether Macomb County outside Detroit, by roughly 8 points – less than his 11-point margin in 2016, however. Biden became just the second Democratic presidential candidate to carry Kent in more than 50 years, after Barack Obama did it in his first run.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: COVID-19 is sweeping across the state at an unprecedented pace, breaking records for new cases and daily deaths and raising concerns about the ability of hospitals to keep up. The Star Tribune reports Saturday’s tally of 4,647 new cases – a figure that would have easily set a record during the first eight months of the pandemic – wasn’t even close to the biggest single-day count of the past week. For the seven-day period ending Saturday, Minnesota reported more than 25,000 new COVID-19 cases, or more than 10% of the state’s cases since March. The Minnesota Department of Health reported another 34 deaths Saturday, bringing the week’s total to 168, the second-highest one-week count since the start of the pandemic. Hospitals, meanwhile, are scrambling to treat more COVID-19 patients even as the virus threatens to sideline more health care workers.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Health has been working around the clock to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Now, the agency will be responsible for starting a statewide medical marijuana program within the next nine months. Uncertified election results showed 74% of Mississippi voters approved the ballot measure that allows doctors to prescribe up to 5 ounces of marijuana per month for people who have at least one of more than 20 serious medical conditions. “This vote shows minds are changing,” said Jaqueline Temple Rudder, a homemaker from Madison County who lost her father-in-law to cancer and voted for Initiative 65. “We don’t want our sick suffering.” Both Gov. Tate Reeves and state’s top health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, opposed the initiative. Officials with the Department of Health will have until August to begin licensing treatment centers and certifying eligible patients.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Local health departments in the state don’t have enough staffers to conduct contact tracing for all the COVID-19 cases popping up, so they have been prioritizing the ones they try to trace back to their sources, officials said. The state’s rate of positive tests over the past two weeks is more than double the national average, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Larry Jones, who heads the Missouri Center for Public Health Excellence, said local health departments are struggling to keep up with contact tracing, which helps determine how a disease is spreading. Missouri on Sunday reported 4,131 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three more deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Missouri has risen over the past two weeks, from about 1,789 new cases per day Oct. 24 to about 3,126 as of Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A nursing facility in Butte has reported 10 COVID-19-related deaths in less than two weeks, and Gallatin County on Friday enacted stricter measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. Montana has hit a record for hospitalizations, and the confirmed number of infection cases was closing in on 38,000, state officials said. The state health department confirmed 986 more cases of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the total for the past week to 6,040, or an average of 863 cases per day. Over the previous week, the daily average was 779. Montana has reported 418 deaths, which may not include all 10 deaths tied to the outbreak at the Continental Care & Rehabilitation nursing facility in Butte. The Gallatin County health board on Friday said bars, restaurants and casinos must close by 10 p.m. instead of 12:30 a.m. They must also limit group sizes at tables to six adults plus children who are with a parent or guardian.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to report record numbers of new coronavirus cases and people hospitalized with the virus. Health officials said the surge in cases over the past month continued Friday with 2,681 new cases and 748 people hospitalized with the virus. Both those were new records, and the state’s rate of new cases was the seventh-highest in the nation. The state said 27 new deaths were reported Friday to give Nebraska 701 deaths. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has increased over the past two weeks from 836.71 new cases per day Oct. 23 to 1,408.86 new cases per day Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Also Friday, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said nine more staff members had tested positive for the virus to give it a total of 225 staff members who have been diagnosed with the virus. The department said the ill staffers are all isolating themselves at home.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Democrats successfully won reelection in the swing state’s two battleground congressional districts. First-term Rep. Susie Lee won reelection to a second term by defeating former professional wrestler Dan Rodimer in the 3rd District. Republicans believed the Las Vegas-area district offered them their best chance at unseating an incumbent. Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford was reelected in the state’s other battleground district, defeating Republican former Assemblyman Jim Marchant. Lee and Horsford’s victories cement a six-year hold on Nevada’s swing districts, which Democrats have won in the three most recent elections, and helps Democrats hoping maintain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, where many races remain too early to call with votes left to be counted. The result sends Nevada’s existing delegation back to Washington, D.C.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth-Hitchcock is again putting strict limits on visitors to its hospitals and outpatient clinics in response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Effective Friday, visitors are banned under most circumstances. Limited exceptions will be made for pediatric patients, women giving birth, patients at the end of life and those in a few other circumstances. The return to more restrictive policies applies to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon as well as the health system’s outpatient clinics and facilities. Officials said their decision was based on the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in both New Hampshire and Vermont. Meanwhile, the state’s court system said it is suspending in-person hearings for a few days after Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Day to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday named his associate counsel to lead the commission that will oversee the state’s new recreational marijuana marketplace. Dianna Houenou, who serves as legal counsel to Murphy’s administration, will chair the Cannabis Regulatory Commission. Before working in Murphy’s administration, Houenou was policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union in New Jersey. Murphy, a Democrat, made the announcement just days after New Jersey voters approved a constitutional amendment legalizing recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. The amendment goes into effect at the start of next year and calls for state regulators to set up a marketplace for the legal sale of the drug. It’s unclear when marijuana will be ready to hit retail shelves in the state. Advocates for legalization said the soonest they expect it could happen toward the end of 2021.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State officials have the power to impose civil penalties when enforcing public health orders that call for businesses to restrict their operations amid a public health emergency, the state Supreme Court said Friday. The unanimous written opinion details the legal reasoning for an oral decision made by the court in August in a case brought by businesses that challenged health orders issued as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had petitioned the court to resolve the dispute. Lujan Grisham has warned that more restrictions could be imposed as early as this week as infections, hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase. She also said she has been disappointed in enforcement, pointing to businesses and country clubs in Albuquerque and elsewhere that hosted Halloween parties despite the ban on gatherings.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Restrictions in some New York City pandemic hot spots will be rolled back, even as the state prepares to combat coronavirus flare-ups upstate, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday. The governor said he’s considering imposing additional social distancing restrictions in “microcluster” zones in the Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse areas because of rising infection rates. The addition of more of those zones upstate reflect the shifting state strategy as COVID-19 becomes a worsening problem beyond New York City, once an epicenter of the pandemic. The governor also said the National Guard will increase its presence at airports to help make sure travelers from non-neighboring states can provide proof of a negative coronavirus test. “In general, downstate New York is doing better than upstate New York, which is a total reversal from the first phase of COVID,” Cuomo said during a telephone briefing.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans pressed state election officials Friday to make public more information about the number of outstanding ballots from last week’s election that could be counted. Nearly a dozen Election Day races in North Carolina, including those for president and U.S. Senate, remained too early to call because as many as 172,000 ballots had either yet to be counted or rejected, or could trickle in before this week’s deadline to receive mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day. The actual number of ballots that will arrive is likely to be less, however, because many people who requested absentee ballots ended up voting on Election Day or perhaps didn’t vote at all. And past elections show a significant portion of the 41,000 provisional ballots cast Tuesday will be rejected.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A child with COVID-19 has been confirmed to have a rare condition that causes inflammation in different parts of the body, state health officials said Friday. The child, who was discharged from the hospital and is resting at home, is the first confirmed case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in the state. “This development is an unfortunate reminder that COVID-19 can impact people of any age, even children,” Dr. Joan Connell, Department of Health field medical officer and pediatrician, said in a statement. “The best way to help prevent your child from getting MIS-C is to take action to avoid exposure to the COVID-19 virus and teach your child how to do the same.” MIS-C – short for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children – can inflame the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs. Children with it have experienced persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes and fatigue. Long-term effects are unknown.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The number of coronavirus cases in the state has continued to spike despite pleas from the governor for people to help slow the spread. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Ohio has risen over the past two weeks from 2,084 new cases per day Oct. 22 to 3,748 new cases per day Thursday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in the state has also risen over the past two weeks from 4.96% on Oct. 22 to 7.93% on Thursday, according to the tracking hub. The Health Department on Friday reported 5,008 probable and confirmed cases, another daily record high. Ohio has reported more than 240,000 probable and confirmed cases to date, including 5,494 deaths. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday that he planned to announce additional measures soon to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of newly reported coronavirus cases in the state Saturday more than doubled the previous one-day record, and the Department of Health said a backlog of cases and possibly duplicate reporting were the reason. There were 4,741 new cases, bringing the total to 136,492 since the pandemic began, the department said. The previous one-day record of 2,101 new cases was recorded Thursday as cases in the state have surged in recent weeks. “We have reason to believe that our normal case count would have continued on an upward trajectory without the backlog and duplication,” which is due to a transition from a manual to electronic reporting system, according to a health department statement. In a statement, Gov. Kevin Stitt called on residents to wash hands often, socially distance and voluntarily wear masks at indoor public places.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Following a record-breaking day of COVID-19 cases in the state, officials announced new restrictions Friday that will be implemented in at least five of the state’s counties as part of a two-week pause on social activities. The updated safety measures, which begin Wednesday, include halting visitations to long-term care facilities, reducing the capacity of indoor dining at restaurants to 50 people, encouraging all businesses to mandate working from home, and urging Oregonians not to gather with people who do not live in their household – but if they do to limit it to six people. If people have multiple get-togethers, which is discouraged, it should be the same social circle of six people. “Let me be clear, we cannot allow this disease to continue to spread so rapidly in our communities. Lives are at stake,” Gov. Kate Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Bail has been set at $750,000 each for two men authorities said were armed with loaded handguns when they were arrested near the city’s convention center where votes were being counted. Joshua Macias, 42, and Antonio LaMotta, 61, traveled from the Virginia Beach, Virginia, area in a Hummer and did not have permits to carry the weapons in Pennsylvania, police said. They were charged with carrying a concealed firearm without a license and carrying a firearm on a public street. The men were stopped Thursday about a block from the vehicle, Macias with a .40-caliber Beretta handgun inside his jacket and LaMotta with a 9 mm Beretta in a holster, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. An AR-style rifle and ammunition were found inside the vehicle, Outlaw said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: Protesters gathered near a prison that houses federal detainees Friday, denouncing the facility’s contract with U.S. immigration authorities and pointing to a surge in coronavirus infections among detainees. Demonstrators blocked roads leading to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, where authorities say more than 150 detainees have tested positive for COVID-19. Activists have repeatedly called for Wyatt’s closure, saying conditions are subpar. The publicly owned but privately operated lockup has about 540 inmates in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In April, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal class-action lawsuit seeking the release of dozens of detainees, saying the virus was spreading “uncontrollably.” More than two dozen detainees subsequently were freed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two days after his opponent proclaimed victory in South Carolina’s 1st District, freshman U.S. House Rep. Joe Cunningham conceded defeat Friday, saying he was proud of the work he had done in his single term in Congress and pledging to continue to work toward bipartisan progress as a private citizen. Standing in front of the U.S. Customs House in Charleston, Cunningham told supporters that he had called Republican Nancy Mace to offer support and congratulations. “She’s now my representative,” Cunningham said. “I’m rooting for her.” The Associated Press called the race for Mace early Wednesday morning, but Cunningham did not concede, citing scanning issues with absentee ballots in one of the district’s counties. In her victory, Mace, 42, becomes the first Republican woman elected to Congress in South Carolina and only the second-ever woman from the state elected to a full House term.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: More than 100 state residents have died of complications due to the coronavirus in the first eight days of November, health officials said Sunday. The Department of Health confirmed 13 deaths in the past day, for a total of 111 this month and 536 since the start of the pandemic. The overall death count is the 24th-highest per capita in the country in the past two weeks, Johns Hopkins University researchers said. The state reported 1,426 positive tests for COVID-19 since Saturday. South Dakota ranks second in the country behind North Dakota in the number of new cases per capita in the past two weeks. The top five counties with the most cases per capita in that time are Bon Homme, Dewey, Buffalo, Potter and Sanborn, according to the COVID Tracking Project. There are 546 people being treated in hospitals in the state, up 31 in the past day. Of those, 96 are in intensive care units, and 69 are using ventilators.\n\nTennessee\n\nJohnson City: Health officials in northeastern Tennessee say they do not have enough nurses to combat COVID-19 inside the region’s hospital system. “There are no longer enough nurses to fill the need that we have,” Ballad Health Senior Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer Lisa Smithgall told WJHL-TV. According to Ballad Health, the hospital system is looking to hire 350 registered nurses to fill its nurse shortage. “In the last eight weeks, we’ve had more than 900 patients admitted to COVID-19,” said Ballad Health Chief Administrative Officer Eric Deaton. After hitting 200 inpatients last week, the health care system has adjusted its COVID-19 surge plan to receive 300 inpatients. “These numbers represent lives; they’re non-encouraging,” Deaton said. “In fact, it’s really becoming a tragedy in the increased rates that we’re seeing.”\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: A district judge on Friday upheld an order from El Paso County’s top elected official shutting down businesses while the region fights an alarming surge in COVID-19 cases. The decision from Judge Bill Moody of El Paso’s 34th District Court came as federal military medical teams deployed to the border region at the request of the state. The county’s top elected official, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, ordered a two-week shutdown of nonessential activities late last month. In making his decision, Moody pointed out that during the Spanish flu pandemic in the early part of the 20th century, city and county elected officials had authority to respond as they “thought was necessary to protect the health and financial interests of their individual communities.” Chris Hilton, an attorney with the Texas attorney general’s office, said the state would appeal.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s largest teachers union called for the governor to move all public secondary schools in high coronavirus transmission areas to remote learning Friday as the state reported a single-day record of 17 COVID-19 deaths. The Utah Education Association also called for Republican Gov. Gary Herbert to suspend all extracurricular activities that can’t comply with social distancing guidelines in high transmission areas from the Thanksgiving holiday throughout winter break. “We are now seeing multiple schools repeatedly shift back and forth from in-person to at-home learning due to outbreaks,” the union wrote in a statement. “This cycle is obviously not helping to control the virus spread and, as educators, we can unequivocally state the continual interruptions are not in the best interest of student learning.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott said Friday that comments by President Donald Trump casting doubts on the integrity of the election process are hurting society. Scott said all legal votes cast in the 2020 election need to be counted, including mail-in votes. Scott’s comments came a day after President Donald Trump made baseless claims of fraud in the ballot-counting process for the presidential election. Scott said that the president’s comments are “inciting a lot of rhetoric” and that many of his followers take him at his word. “I don’t believe any of the statements he made last night are true, and I do believe it is hurting our society and our ability to work together,” Scott said. After voting Tuesday, he said he had cast his presidential ballot for former Vice President Joe Biden. He said he had never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate before but had to put “country over party.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Freshman Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger has kept her seat in a competitive congressional race in the Richmond suburbs. The former CIA operations officer defeated Republican challenger and state House delegate Nick Freitas in a close race that was called Sunday. Spanberger is considered one of Congress’ more moderate Democrats and was part of a wave of women who helped Democrats retake the U.S. House in 2018. But Freitas had tried to tie Spanberger to her party’s leadership and said it was out of sync with constituents. Spanberger spent nearly a decade with the CIA, working on counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation cases. She is one of two moderate Virginia Democrats who held on to U.S. House seats they flipped from red to blue two years ago, as Democrats’ strength in the Old Dominion continues to grow.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state set a daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 1,777 new confirmed cases announced Saturday, and the state Department of Health warned that COVID-19 cases are spreading in the Puget Sound region. In a statement, the health agency said the high numbers the state has seen over the past week reflect an overall surge that started in mid-September. King, Snohomish and Pierce counties are currently the hot spots in the region, officials said. “COVID-19 is currently spreading very quickly in Washington state,” said Secretary of Health John Wiesman. “We are very concerned that disease transmission will only grow over the next few weeks with the holidays coming up. The threat to overwhelming not just our hospital systems, but our ability to do contact tracing, is real. We need everyone in Washington state to take action now to stop the spread.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported surging COVID-19 case numbers Saturday along with 15 newly reported deaths from the virus. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources reported 655 newly reported cases as of 10 a.m. Saturday for a total of 27,742 total cases and 502 deaths since the pandemic reached the state. The daily case count set a record for the state, a day after West Virginia saw a new peak of 540 cases over 24 hours. On Friday, several government staff and officials including Gov. Jim Justice were tested for the virus after a staffer in the Capitol building tested positive Friday morning. The attorney general’s office later said the employee believed to have the virus tested negative Friday night. Justice said he was tested for the virus minutes before a noon news conference Friday, where he announced the record high of new cases. He also urged West Virginians to get tested at sites around the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: State health officials reported a new daily high of more than 7,000 new COVID-19 cases – another new daily record. Saturday’s total of 7,065 confirmed infections is more than 900 cases higher than the previous record, set Friday with 6,141 cases, according to the state Department of Health Services. The state first passed 6,000 daily cases Friday, and Tuesday and Wednesday of this past week also saw record-setting numbers of new cases. The 7,065 positive cases made up 37% of the 18,928 test results reported Saturday by the state health department. The seven-day average of new cases also rose again, hitting 5,394, which is the highest weekly average to date, according to DHS. The state health department also reported 45 more people have died, bringing the state’s death toll to 2,301.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State health officials reported 646 new coronavirus cases Sunday, the second-highest single-day total of the pandemic in the state. The Department of Health listed 966 new cases Friday, the highest single-day total. The Casper Star-Tribune reports at least 114 people have died of the coronavirus, and more than 14,690 people have tested positive. The new totals come amid a rapid surge in the numbers of cases in Wyoming and throughout much of the U.S. Gov. Mark Gordon has said he is not considering implementing a statewide face mask order but has urged residents to wear masks. Albany County, which includes Laramie; the Wind River Reservation; and Teton and Laramie counties have implemented mask mandates under which residents must wear facial coverings when outside their homes, with some exceptions.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/09"}]}

Neuberger, who is representing McDole's family in a federal civil lawsuit alleging the shooting by the officers was prompted by racial discrimination, called the report \"historic\" and \"unprecedented\" because of the information it provided.\n\nThis included portions of interviews with the shooting officers explaining what they saw on Sept. 23 that caused them to fire at McDole, a 28-year-old who was in a wheelchair.\n\nSome of those interviews, Neuberger said, contradict what is seen in a cellphone video that was modified by the FBI and provided in the report issued by Attorney General Matt Denn's office.\n\n\"Instead of closing off the investigation, Denn ... goes on and helps us make the civil case for us,\" Neuberger told The News Journal on Friday.\n\nDenn's office had no comment.\n\nIn releasing its report on why it would not charge the four police officers, Denn's office took the rare step, at least in Delaware, of singling out Senior Cpl. Joseph Dellose for \"extraordinarily poor police work\" during the incident.\n\nDellose fired a shotgun at McDole about two seconds after initially ordering him to put his hands up, creating uncertainty among other officers – Senior Cpl. Danny Silva, Cpl. Thomas Lynch and Cpl. James MacColl –who, not knowing where the gunfire came from, also turned their weapons on McDole, the 31-page report said.\n\nGenerally speaking, that would be helpful for the civil case, said Jonathan Abady, one of the lead attorneys representing the family of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old boy who was shot and killed by Cleveland police in 2014. Their civil suit settled in April for $6 million in federal court in Ohio.\n\nThere might, however, be a question of admissibility in bringing Denn's report into the civil case, though, Abady said.\n\nAlthough it's unclear exactly what role the report will play in the McDole family's case, it's unusual that it was released at all, said Philip Stinson, a criminology professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio who studies police violence.\n\n\"Prosecutors don't have to explain themselves,\" he said, adding that there's no way to know how many cases prosecutors have opted not to file charges.\n\nHowever, since there was widespread public discontent following the outcome of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri – which failed to bring charges against the shooting officer – prosecutors have been issuing more reports like the one in the McDole case.\n\nSTORY: McDole shooting: Wilmington police won't be charged​\n\nSTORY: McDole family sues Wilmington over fatal police shooting\n\nNeuberger called the FBI's enhancement of the cellphone video \"key\" to showing what happened moment-by-moment when police shot McDole because it contradicts statements made by the officers to investigators. Neuberger refers to Dellose's comments:\n\n\"Again, I gave more commands; he just didn't look like he was responding to anything,\" Dellose said in the report. \"I couldn't see his hands, he kept moving around his waist. At that point, I felt I was in danger, my life was in danger if he picked up that gun and started shooting. He could shoot the other officers, he could shoot me, and bystanders that were ... in the line of his fire as well. That's when I decided I had to fire one round.\"\n\n\"Denn made it very clear to us there is no verification of that fact and the video directly contradicts the excuse for the shooting that Dellose gave,\" Neuberger said. \"In other words, he shot to kill a person who was not armed, waving around or displaying, shooting, a weapon.\n\n\"That's a big deal.\"\n\n\"We've got these new leads that we will be following up when we file the amended complaint on the 23rd,\" Neuberger said.\n\nThe report offered a rare glimpse into the prosecutorial decision-making process, explaining in detail why the AG's office did not file charges against the officers. It also explained how prosecutors initially considered filing a felony assault charge against Dellose.\n\n\"Unlike the other three officers who discharged their firearms, the attorney general determined that probable cause could exist to pursue felony assault charges against Senior Cpl. Dellose, and that the state should determine the feasibility of bringing criminal charges,\" the report said. In the end, two national police-use-of-force experts concluded that Dellose's conduct was not criminal because of a Delaware law that immunizes officers if they believe force is necessary to protect themselves.\n\nAside from condemning Dellose and the fact he shouldn't be carrying a gun, Neuberger said Denn talks about systemic problems within the Wilmington Police Department and the city's use of force policy, which he called vague and in need of an update. The report also said officers get little guidance on de-escalating similar situations, especially among people who are physically or mentally disabled.\n\nThis, Neuberger said, will help them as they go after Wilmington for poorly supervising its police force.\n\nWhile this is helpful for his civil case, Neuberger believes much of that information can help the community have a better force.\n\n\"He goes and develops all this evidence and releases it for the family and for the good of the community, I believe,\" Neuberger said.\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.

And he's currently preparing his fifth studio country album with a pair of singles already on the radio ahead of its release later this year.\n\nWe spoke with the South Carolina native ahead of his Harrington return to get a sneak peek at his new album, reminisce about Hootie's success and help preview the fair, which kicks off tonight and runs through July 29.\n\nQ: After this show, you will have played Delaware three times over the past eight years. We're a small state. You must tour your tail off.\n\nA: Yeah, I've been playing shows. We're just trying to play places that we don't get to very often. It's going to be fun.\n\nQ: Is there a different vibe when you play places like Delaware -- places that are kind of off the beaten path, places that may not see acts of your caliber all the time?\n\nA: There's a lot of excitement, which I love. People are glad to be there and they're glad you're there. They are there to have a good time -- it always creates a great show.\n\nQ: It's all those shows that have probably helped you reel off four No. 1 country albums in a row. I was curious about how many doubters you had back when you made the leap.\n\nA: [Laughs.] I had a lot. I definitely had more doubters than champions. And that was OK. It just made me work harder. My label [Capitol Nashville] was so behind me. They were going to be with me. We had a bunch of naysayers, but I've let that go. It's been a fun ride. Like you said, four No. 1 albums. All the hard work was worth it.\n\nQ: Have you had the chance to rub your country success in the face of any of those naysayers or have you stayed humble?\n\nA: No, I'm not that kind of guy. No. [Laughs.] There are a lot of people I know who didn't mind telling me that it wasn't going to work, but, no, I'm not that kind of a guy. I'm just happy to be still making music that people are listening to.\n\nQ: Have you come up with a name or date for your new album?\n\nA: They are getting on me to name it, but I haven't named it yet. It could be out in the fall. We should have something soon.\n\nQ: There are two songs out now -- \"If I Told You\" and \"For the First Time\" -- so we've had a taste. What should fans expect from the rest of it?\n\nA: It'll be a little different than my other records just because I have a new producer, Ross Copperman (Keith Urban, Jake Owen, Dierks Bentley). It's a fun record -- a record that represents me where I am in my career right now, where I am in my life. You can expect great music. It has songs I hope people love because they are songs I love.\n\nQ: You've been playing shows with Hootie and the Blowfish here and there in recent years.\n\nA: Yeah, we still play. We have two shows coming up in August and we play three or four charity gigs every year. We just don't go and tour anymore.\n\nQ: What's it like when you drop in for a night with them at a charity gig? It must be like parachuting into your past.\n\nA: It does have a little different vibe just because we are such a band through and through. But it's just like riding a bike. We've been a band for like 31 years now. We all fall back into that same spot.\n\nQ: It's the summer of 1994 and \"Cracked Rear View\" is about to come out just as grunge is king in the rock world with Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots all having No. 1 albums in the months before your release. What were your expectations when it came out 23 years ago?\n\nA: I don't really know what our expectations were. We wanted to get a record out and play. We had been playing clubs on the East Coast [Hootie and the Blowfish played to a handful of fans The Stone Balloon in Newark prior to the release of \"Cracked Rear View\"] and were making a pretty good living doing that. We just made the record and started touring again. The next thing you know, \"Letterman\" happens and everything blows up. We expected success, but we weren't expecting it to do what it did.\n\nQ: You are unique in having pop success in the '90s several years before Napster helped upend the industry and then finding more success years later in country. What are some of the biggest industry changes you've seen from the inside over these past 20 years or so?\n\nA: When we were playing in the '90s, the only reason you toured was as an advertisement for the record. You went on tour so people would go out and buy your record. Now, the only reason you make a record is to tour. It's really changed that much. Touring is the way you make a living in this business these days, but I like being on the road, so it's OK.\n\nQ: Finally, I was curious if there was any industry or life advice that 51-year-old Darius Rucker would give a 28-year-old you as \"Cracked Rear View\" was taking off?\n\nA: [Laughs.] I would tell myself to wake up, pay attention and enjoy it. Being in the middle of the party, I never really looked at the success. It was about how much fun are we going to have tonight. Just stop and take a second to smell the roses every day.\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

The public was not notified about that specific chemical release, according to the state's list of recent environmental releases.\n\n• The fire also caused the release of an unknown amount of sulfur dioxide into the air.\n\nHydrogen sulfide is a colorless, poisonous and flammable gas that smells like rotten eggs. Acute exposure to the chemical can impact heart rate, blood pressure, the respiratory system and may cause skin irritations, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, blurred vision, sensitivity to light and neurological effects such as giddiness, irritability and dizziness.\n\nIn worst cases, exposure can lead to coma or death, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's CAMEO Chemicals database.\n\nSulfur dioxide is a colorless, poisonous, corrosive gas that can have a choking or suffocating odor, according to CAMEO. That database states the chemical is \"very toxic by inhalation and may irritate the eyes and mucous membranes. ... It may cause death or permanent injury after very short exposure to small quantities.\"\n\nPeople with asthma or heart problems are at greater risk during exposure to these chemicals, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n• A \"code orange\" air quality alert was in effect before the fire was reported.\n\nThat means air pollution concentrations within the region may be unhealthy for sensitive groups such as children, seniors and people suffering from heart disease, asthma or other lung diseases. The alert remained in effect Monday.\n\n• The wind on Sunday was blowing the smoke to the northwest and nearby fire companies received complaints from residents about the smell of chemicals in the air as far away as Newark and Wilmington.\n\n• Michael Globetti, a spokesman for the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, said on Sunday that state air monitoring devices up to six miles away read \"non-detect\" for hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide, the pollutants of greatest concern.\n\n• Some nearby residents in Delaware City received robocalls about the fire and were told DNREC was onsite monitoring air quality, but there was no immediate threat to the environment.\n\nResidents who did not receive a robocall likely do not have a landline and have not signed up for the state's emergency notification system.\n\nWhat we don't know\n\n• There has been no word on what caused the fire. On Sunday, officials said they wouldn't be able to determine that until the fire was out.\n\n• State and company officials have not said how much hydrogen sulfide escaped during the fire. It is also unclear if the fire caused any other pollutants to escape.\n\n• It is unclear how far the smoke and chemicals from the fire spread.\n\n• It is unknown when, or if, specific details about the cause of the fire and chemicals released during the fire will be provided by the state or company. DNREC's environmental release system states \"an updated posting will be made when total amounts are available.\"\n\n• It is unknown if the fire and released chemicals harmed, or posed any threat to, nearby residents or the environment.\n\n• It is unclear if the refinery will face any citations or fines related to the fire.\n\nNews Journal reporter Jessica Bies contributed to this story.

So he bought a 47,000 pound, 20-foot ship's propeller.\n\nMeding had the cast-iron propeller, also known as a ship's screw, hauled from Bayonne, New Jersey, in 1990. It's been parked in front of Meding's Seafood, his family-owned seafood market and restaurant off Del. 1 near Milford, ever since.\n\nPassing motorists can't miss the gleaming gold nautical object that resembles a supersized pinwheel.\n\n\"I bought it with the intent of it being a landmark for my establishment,\" Meding says.\n\nBut, the iconic propeller is much more than eye-catching; it has played a fascinating role in U.S. nautical and space exploration history.\n\nThe propeller was one of four that once helped thrust the USS Shangri-La, an aircraft carrier commissioned in 1944 that earned two battle stars in World War II, and three stars in the Vietnam War.\n\nDELAWARE HISTORY: Why does a duPont mansion have a stone wall topped with jagged glass shards?\n\nThe Shangri-La also was significant in the lives of astronauts Jim Lovell, commander of ill-fated Apollo 13 lunar mission, and Gene Cernan, the last man to have walked on the Moon.\n\nBoth pilots were deployed on board of the aircraft carrier in the 1950s, though not at the same time.\n\nThe Shangri-La and its propellers figure into a pivotal scene in the 1995 movie \"Apollo 13,\" an adaptation of Lovell's book \"Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13.\"\n\nLovell, played by Tom Hanks in the Academy Award-nominated movie, was a Navy pilot when he was deployed on the aircraft carrier in 1956.\n\nIn a scene from the book and the \"Apollo 13\" movie, Lovell recalls having a close call while flying a Banshee night fighter off the Shangri-La in the Sea of Japan.\n\nLike 'Why is this here?': Subscribe to Delaware Online\n\nDuring a night flight, Lovell's radar had jammed, his homing signal was gone and the instrument panel shorted out in the cockpit. Fuel was running low and Lovell thought he would have to crash into the ocean.\n\nThen, in the darkness, he saw a green trail of phosphorescent algae churned up in the wake of the Shangri-La. It saved his life.\n\n\"It was leading me home,\" Hanks, as Lovell, says in the movie about the trail of algae. \"If my cockpit lights hadn't shorted out, there's no way I'd ever been able to see that.\"\n\n\"You never know what events are to transpire to get you home,\" he says during the tale, which foreshadows the later possibility of the Apollo 13 astronauts not making it back to Earth.\n\nGene Cernan, one of only three people to fly twice to the moon, also was deployed on USS Shangri-La. His service began there in 1958.\n\nCernan, the commander of Apollo 17who died in 2017, has said everything knew he about flying, he learned while on the Shangri-La.\n\nThe Shangri-La was decommissioned in 1971 and sold for scrap in 1988.\n\nDELAWARE TRIVIA:Why is this here? The story behind Odessa's giant shark in a Santa hat\n\nTwo years later, at the start of The Gulf War, Henry and Robbie Meding came upon one of the Shangri-La's propellers as Navy salvage in New Jersey. They felt the giant nautical object would be the perfect draw to get customers into their seafood business.\n\nThough they declined to say what the object cost, Robbie chuckles as he says, \"It cost more to move it than it did to buy it.\"\n\nThe propeller was sandblasted and, over the years, repainted several times with gold-leaf. It faces busy Del. 1 and, at night, a spotlight is aimed at the pinwheel. It doesn't turn, though Robbie says people ask all the time if it does.\n\nWhile they didn't anticipate it, the Medings have found the propeller has drawn in more than just seafood lovers looking for their signature, homemade cream of crab soup. Over the years, it has become a pilgrimage for World War II veterans and history buffs.\n\nRobbie's son Dayton has collected and studied books about the Shangri-La. He also keeps scrapbooks in the market featuring photos of veterans who served on the aircraft carrier and have posed in front of the propeller.\n\nThe propeller now is featured on Meding's seafood business cards as well as T-shirts. It has served its initial purpose, and much more.\n\nRobbie says when he mentions his family's Kent County seafood market and restaurant, people say, 'Oh, the one with the giant propeller?' \"\n\n\"It's a draw,\" he says, \"and it's put us on the map.\"\n\n\"Why is this here?\" is an occasional News Journal/Delaware Online feature that looks at the history behind curious objects found throughout Delaware.\n\nRELATED:\n\nThe fun of 'The Pole Family' might be its mystery\n\nGreek monument at Tatnall was once a 1920s Wilmington gas station\n\nClaymont Christmas Weed has a wacky, 25-year history\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/07/26/deliberations-continue-dover-murder-trial-brett-scott/839354002/", "title": "Trial in Dequan Dukes homicide in Dover focuses on accused gunman", "text": "Deliberations continue today in the murder trial of Brett A. Scott, a Felton man accused of luring Dequan Dukes to a Dover apartment complex with the intent to rob him before gunning him down.\n\nScott is charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy, first-degree robbery and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony in a shooting June 27, 2017, at the Pine Grove Apartments complex in Dover.\n\nIn closing arguments Wednesday, the state painted a picture of \"betrayal, violence and then death\" in the final chapter of Dukes’ life, saying he was lured to the apartment complex with the promise of sex and then was fatally shot by Scott after the two exchanged gunfire.\n\nIn his closing remarks, deputy attorney general Stephen E. Smith said Scott had conspired with three others to steal money and drugs in a bag in the backseat of Dukes' car.\n\n“Brett Scott was not just a guy who went along for a ride. He was not there by happenstance,” Smith said. “Mr. Dukes was a target of a pre-planned robbery, a drug rip-off.”\n\nSecond effort made to steal 'thin blue line' flags honoring trooper, police say\n\nFormer Delaware priest charged with child rape dies months before trial\n\nPennsylvania man robbed outside Claymont dollar store\n\nThe state contends that co-conspirator Raymond Ward saw Instagram photos of Dukes holding up a large amount of money and asked Lisa Wagaman, who is also charged in the case and scheduled for trial later this year, to set up a meeting with the promise of sex.\n\nWagaman testified on Tuesday that after she got out of the car because she \"wasn't feeling it,\" she saw Scott approach the vehicle and ask Dukes for a cigarette, but didn't see a firearm.\n\nAs she was walking away, she testified she heard gunshots.\n\nAccording to Wagaman, the plan was for her to keep Dukes occupied in the front seat while an alleged accomplice opened the vehicle’s back door and grabbed the bag.\n\nSmith said evidence at the scene pointed to Scott being the shooter, even though the gun that killed Dukes was never recovered.\n\nThe deputy attorney general said Dukes fired four times in the exchange, hitting Scott in the chest, hand and leg. Scott was later dropped off at Bayhealth-Kent General Hospital in Dover.\n\nSmith said there were nine shell casings from a gun other than Dukes' near his' car, including one inside the vehicle, and a trail of blood that matched Scott's blood type leading away from the car.\n\n\"It was a close-range encounter,\" he said. \"Nobody else could have shot Dequan Dukes.\"\n\nDefense attorney Patrick J. Collins painted a different picture of the incident, saying Scott was acting in self-defense when he was shot three times.\n\nHe said the blood trail and casings show that Scott was crawling away while likely firing back as he tried to retreat from Dukes, who was firing at him.\n\n\"Dequan Dukes shot first and Brett Scott returned fire,\" Collins said. \"He was firing in self-defense.\"\n\nCollins told the jury that all of the counts against Scott come down to the first-degree attempted robbery charge. He said the state did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his client was there to commit a robbery.\n\nHe said evidence showed that Lisa Wagaman and Raymond Ward planned a theft, but Brett Scott was not mentioned in the scheme to grab the bag.\n\n\"If you find there was no attempted robbery by Brett Scott, you must find him not guilty of murder in the first,\" Collins said. \"You must have no reasonable doubt that he intended to commit robbery first degree.\"\n\nContact Jerry Smith at jsmith17@delawareonline.com.

The proximity between El Paso and Ciudad Juárez allows opportunities to access reproductive health services, but the border, socio-economic status, and conservative culture in both states of Texas and Chihuahua present obstacles as well.\n\nThe series includes deeply personal stories about abortion that could be upsetting to some readers. This story includes language that may be offensive to some readers.\n\nLea esta historia en español\n\nLucero drove across the Bridge of the Americas alone. The cramps the abortion clinic’s staff told her to expect were already creeping into her abdomen.\n\nBehind her was El Paso, where at 23, she’d just received an abortion at the Hill Top Women’s Reproductive Clinic. Ahead was Ciudad Juárez, her home, wherein the surrounding state of Chihuahua, abortions are a criminal offense.\n\nLucero, who has asked to withhold her full name for this story, had considered flying to Mexico City. It was 2017 and abortions had been legal there for 10 years, but she weighed the costs: Two plane tickets, the price of food and lodging — not to mention having to explain her sudden trip to the country’s capital.\n\nMeanwhile, the drive to El Paso could take half an hour. With her tourist visa, she could enter Texas with no issue. She’d be back home the same day without anyone knowing what she had done.\n\nAs she crossed the border into Juárez, her fear mounted. “Please, please don’t let this happen,” she remembered telling herself, worried that she might faint or hemorrhage and be forced to go to a hospital in Juárez. She couldn’t count on doctor-patient confidentiality: Anyone who realized she’d had an abortion could report her to the police. “What if I get caught?”\n\nEl Paso residents can go to Juárez abortion clinics but not the other way around\n\nWhile Lucero traveled north for her abortion, many El Pasoans turn south. In Juárez, they find cheap, easy access to misoprostol, an abortion-inducing medication that is sold over the counter as an ulcer treatment at many Mexican pharmacies — a welcome solution for those willing to have abortions outside a health care setting, as tightening legal restrictions make the procedures tougher to come by in Texas clinics.\n\nIn the Paso del Norte region, fronterizas on both sides of the Rio Grande have long looked across the border to end their pregnancies on terms they can’t always choose at home.\n\nNow, however, Juarenses must look elsewhere. The U.S. land border remains closed to most Mexican nationals, and in March 2020, El Paso lost all abortion services.\n\nThe consequences of El Paso’s barren abortion landscape, along with the pandemic-era closure of the U.S. border, have rippled across the Rio Grande. In the 15 months that El Paso’s Planned Parenthood offered abortion services, about 3% of its patients were from Mexico, according to the clinic. But the Texas city is no longer a legal haven for people like Lucero, who once came to El Paso to have abortions without fear of prosecution.\n\nEl Pasoans, meanwhile, could soon rely all the more on Juárez for abortion pills.\n\nOn Sept. 1, a new Texas law will effectively ban state clinics from performing abortions roughly six weeks after conception — as soon as cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo, and before many know they are pregnant. With dwindling abortion access, more El Pasoans seeking abortions may choose to cross the border if the law, known as Senate Bill 8, takes effect.\n\nMore:Supreme Court declines to block Texas abortion law that bans procedure at six weeks\n\nTexas law's restrictions on abortions\n\nOver the last two decades, Texas state lawmakers have enacted increasingly strict regulations on abortion providers.\n\nIn 2013, after the passage of House Bill 2, which imposed hospital-like standards on abortion facilities, two El Paso clinics temporarily closed and procedures in the county dropped by 40%. Though the Supreme Court struck down the measure in 2016, other restrictions have remained in place. By 2017, about 96% of Texas counties had no abortion clinics.\n\nEl Paso was an exception until the pandemic. Then, in March 2020, the Planned Parenthood physicians who’d once flown to El Paso twice a month to perform abortions stopped coming due to COVID safety concerns. That month, El Paso’s last remaining abortion provider — the Hill Top Women’s Reproductive Clinic, where Lucero received her abortion — shuttered without explanation.\n\nThe Planned Parenthood clinic remains open in El Paso for other health services and is actively recruiting new physicians to resume abortion procedures. But Texas’ ever-mounting series of restrictions has made physician recruitment all the more difficult, said Xochitl Rodriguez, philanthropy officer for Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas in El Paso. Rodriguez could not say when the clinic would resume offering abortions.\n\nIn addition to banning clinical abortions after about six weeks, Senate Bill 8 would empower individuals to sue abortion providers and anyone else who “aids or abets” someone seeking the procedure past this timeframe. In July, dozens of abortion clinics and advocacy groups sued to block the measure before it starts. At a hearing scheduled for Monday, they hoped to convince a federal district judge in Austin to stop the law from taking effect. On Friday, however, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals canceled that hearing.\n\n“(W)ithout the courts stepping in, on Wednesday, Texans will be denied their constitutional right to abortion in violation of fifty years of precedent,” Julie Murray, an attorney representing the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in the case, said in a written statement.\n\nMore:Some Texas residents are stockpiling contraceptives and pregnancy tests after abortion ban\n\nAt the national level, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case where Mississippi’s attorney general has asked to overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the landmark rulings establishing the constitutional right to end a pregnancy.\n\nAbortion opponents hope the court’s conservative majority will soon do just that, among them Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. In July, he joined a coalition of anti-abortion governors to file an amicus brief urging justices to declare abortion unconstitutional. During the spring legislative session, Abbott signed into law a measure that would automatically ban the procedure if Roe v. Wade is struck down.\n\nEl Paso → Juárez exchange\n\nWalk across the Downtown Paso del Norte Bridge into Juárez, and “the first thing you see is bar, bar, pharmacy, bar — maybe a good restaurant here and there,” said Lina-Maria Murillo, an assistant professor at the University of Iowa who researches the history of reproductive health care on the border. There, any number of pharmacies sell misoprostol, a medication that induces abortions, in 28-pill boxes that run as low as $20.\n\n“This tells us that for a very long time abortion has been a major part of the health economy of the borderlands,” Murillo said. “(P)eople in border region go to Mexico to get dental work done, checkups — abortion is obviously one part of that health care regime.”\n\nAlthough it is illegal in Chihuahua to use misoprostol to terminate a pregnancy, the medication is sold over the counter at Mexican pharmacies to treat ulcers.\n\nIn Texas border communities, people have long managed their own abortions at higher rates than the rest of the state and country. A statewide survey of abortion clinics found that 12% of patients living along the Texas-Mexico border had at some point attempted to manage their own abortions — compared to 7% of patients throughout Texas, and 2.6% nationwide.\n\nThat practice has begun to take hold nationwide. Where abortions outside the clinical setting once conjured images of coat hangers and dangerous folk remedies, the practice has grown safer and more effective with the rising use of abortion pills.\n\nMore:What to know about Texas abortion law that bans the procedure once heartbeat is detected\n\nTo end pregnancies, U.S. clinics — and now, some telemedicine services — offer a two-drug regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol, which in combination is more effective than misoprostol alone. But with mifepristone hard to come by in Mexico and much of the global south, many rely solely on misoprostol, which is about 85% effective compared to roughly 93% for the two-drug regimen. The World Health Organization has endorsed misoprostol as a safe and effective way to self-manage abortions up to 10 weeks after conception.\n\nAs barriers to clinical abortions mount, people are more likely to self-manage their abortions. Abigail Aiken, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin, found with her research team that the number of self-managed abortions rises along with each 40-mile increase in distance to the nearest abortion clinic. According to the study, the lower someone’s income, the more likely they are to attempt to end their pregnancy outside a health care setting.\n\nSelf-managed abortions increased dramatically during the pandemic, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized providers to send mifepristone and misoprostol to patients by mail. Nineteen states, including Texas, do not allow in-state providers to mail these medications, but they have little control over organizations that operate outside of the state, or even the country.\n\nAiken also found that requests to the international group Aid Access, which provides abortion medication and telemedicine consultation, spiked during the pandemic, especially in Texas. When Gov. Abbott imposed a four-week ban on abortion for much of April 2020, citing COVID safety concerns, the study found that Texans’ requests for Aid Access abortion support rose by nearly 94% from the previous year, the highest increase in the country.\n\nCriminalization and abortion law exceptions in Chihuahua\n\nEven after her abortion, Lucero still feared that her family might find out. The fronteriza felt she hadn’t just crossed a geographical line to get an abortion; she’d crossed a moral one as well.\n\n“I knew I was doing something illegal in Mexico and there were a thousand reasons for which I could go to jail,” Lucero said in Spanish.\n\nSince 2013, 10 Juarenses have been charged with illegally terminating a pregnancy, according to data from the Chihuahua State Prosecutor’s Office. Only one, in 2018, resulted in a conviction and a prison sentence of 32 months.\n\nAccording to information published by the Executive Secretary of the National Security System, nine reports of alleged crimes involving abortion took place in Chihuahua for 2020 and three for 2021, with the latest update released in June.\n\nAccording to information obtained from the High Court of Justice of the state of Chihuahua through the country’s online National Transparency Platform, there were no registered cases with a pronounced sentence in Chihuahua involving the illegal termination of a pregnancy in 2020 and none so far in 2021.\n\nThough most abortions in Chihuahua are criminalized, the law does grant some exceptions. The criminal code of the state of Chihuahua states that terminating a pregnancy is legal in cases of sexual violence, if the woman’s health is at risk, if the woman has been forcibly inseminated or if the abortion was accidental.\n\nThe Mexican Official Norm, NOM-046-SSA2-2005, is the legal framework that lays out the criteria to address and prevent family and sexual violence against women, and the standards for abortion services in the state in cases of rape. Those services include access to syphilis and HIV testing, counseling, pregnancy tests and, in the case of a positive result, emergency contraception pills or the necessary procedures to terminate a pregnancy, if requested.\n\nMedical staff are not required to verify the statements of those who petition for a voluntary abortion in the case of sexual assault. They must take petitioners at their word and act “under the principle of good faith referenced in Article 5 of the Victim’s General Law.”\n\nMore:Texas law banning most abortions takes effect as Supreme Court expected to wade into broader issue\n\nThough the law also allows medical staff to decline to offer abortion services based on a conscientious objection, the state is still required to provide a physician willing to perform the procedure.\n\nChihuahua’s state health services fully comply with the standards set forth by the NOM-046, according to Mitzi Alicia Garcia, the Chihuahua Health Department’s coordinator of Reproductive Health in Ciudad Juárez. Garcia affirmed that in cases where abortion is legal under the state’s penal code, all state hospitals can guarantee medical attention from a non-objecting physician.\n\nBut Elia Orrantia, the director of the center against family violence SinViolencia, said in her experience, helping women get a legal abortion is still a challenge, as many physicians can still refuse to perform the procedure.\n\n“In Chihuahua, conscientious objection is still very prevalent,” Orrantia explained in Spanish. “It’s really the doctor who decides if there’s going to be a legal termination of the pregnancy.”\n\nSelf-managed abortion in Juárez\n\nNot all state-run hospitals in Ciudad Juárez have the services required to prevent or terminate a pregnancy, Orrantia added. Sometimes people seeking an abortion will have to be referred to other hospitals.\n\n“Best-case scenario, the victim is transferred to another state hospital, but they have to tell their story once again to receive a service that should be guaranteed by the state,” she said.\n\nEven when abortion is legal under state law, Juarenses may shrink from requesting the procedure to avoid judgment and stigma, she noted.\n\nBetween restrictions to access and the looming fear of criminalization, some Juarenses may still choose to manage their own abortions after considering that the medication is fairly accessible at pharmacies.\n\nThis was the case in 2019, when an acquaintance reached out to Lucero. She asked for her help knowing that she had been very vocal on social media about her position in favor of the legalization of abortion in Mexico. Most importantly, Lucero wouldn’t judge her.\n\nAfter taking misoprostol, she endured an infection for more than a week. Not only that, the medication failed to terminate her pregnancy.\n\nLucero had taken the day off from work to help her. She took the woman to her own gynecologist — the same doctor who had discreetly handed Lucero a card with contact information for the Hill Top Women’s Reproductive Clinic back in 2017. The doctor recommended a procedure to remove the infected tissue.\n\nUnlike Lucero, the woman didn’t have a visa to easily cross to El Paso. Even if she did, she had no money and no support from her family.\n\n“With her, I saw the counterpart. Those were the two faces of this experience: what I had lived and what she was currently living,” Lucero said.\n\nThe two cried in the car on their way to the hospital and practiced what to say to the medical staff once they got there.\n\nLucero told her there was no way for medical staff to know that she had taken misoprostol. “Deny it completely,” she said. “Tell them that you felt this intense pain and started bleeding this morning and that’s why you’re in urgent care.”\n\nLucero waited outside of the state Hospital de la Mujer in Ciudad Juárez, while a woman she barely knew had just walked in to get checked. She could only stay outside the hospital with dozens of people who were waiting for their loved ones.\n\nA sheet of paper would be posted on the glass door of the hospital with updates, but every time she checked, there was no news about the girl, who until then was only an acquaintance.\n\nA city police car pulled into the hospital’s entrance. The vehicle parked over the curb, its lights flashing. Lucero’s heart dropped to her feet thinking about the woman inside the hospital.\n\nThe woman had no access to her phone; Lucero couldn’t warn her that she may have been reported. She didn’t know what to do, but was convinced that she couldn’t take off and leave her now friend behind.\n\n“I was imagining myself in prison already,” Lucero said. “I thought about how someone had told me that accomplices also go to jail for helping those who want to get abortions.”\n\nUnder Article 143 of Chihuahua’s criminal code, anyone who forces or assists a woman obtain an abortion “will be punished with six months to three years of prison, with whichever medium used, as long as this was done with the women’s consent.” Without the woman’s consent, the penalty will go up to three to six years.\n\nAnother police vehicle parked by the entrance, and that’s when Lucero saw a pregnant inmate from the federal penal center get off the truck. She wore the center’s uniform and shackles on her ankles and wrists.\n\nLucero felt relieved but was still filled with anger.\n\n“Why do we have to go through this? Not only do we not want to be pregnant but we also have to deal with this legal matter and economic struggles just because some people in government get to decide. They get to say ‘No. You don’t get a say over your body.’”\n\nAfter more than six hours, her friend came out. She’d gotten the care she needed, and no one on the medical staff asked a thing about it.\n\nA privilege or a right?\n\nLucero’s abortion put a financial burden on her. But unlike her friend, she was able to pay for the procedure. And ultimately, having a car and tourist visa allowed her to get an abortion without legal or health complications.\n\n“I recognize that I was able to do that with all of (my) privileges,” Lucero said, acknowledging that for other fronterizas, access to an abortion is not that simple.\n\nLiz Stunz does not think of abortion access as a privilege. For her, it is a right. Texas’s restrictive abortion landscape, she said, caused her unnecessary fear, isolation and pain. She learned she was pregnant in 2015, just two months after moving to El Paso. The timing couldn’t have been worse.\n\nThen 28, she didn’t have a car and didn’t have friends in the city to confide in. Her new boyfriend had sexually assaulted her, she said — but in El Paso, she had only him to turn to. She knew better than to ask him for too much. A ride to the nearest Planned Parenthood, in Albuquerque at that time, was out of the question.\n\n“I’d never been in such a vulnerable, vulnerable position before,” she said.\n\nLiving on a graduate student’s salary, Stunz couldn’t afford the cost of an abortion anyway.\n\nIn Texas, the cost of an abortion starts at $450, and depending on the stage of gestation, can run up to $1,500. These are usually paid for out of pocket because Texas prevents health insurance plans from covering most abortion procedures.\n\nShe read online about misoprostol and its easy, cheap availability just across the border.\n\n“I wanted to get it over with ASAP and didn’t want to talk to anyone about it,” she said. Her thoughts were blurry, sporadic, constantly turning to her mother — a devout Catholic who would be horrified to hear of her daughter’s plans.\n\nWith misoprostol, Stunz wouldn’t have to wait for a clinic appointment and she wouldn’t have to pass a line of protestors outside that clinic. She could end her pregnancy in private, at home.\n\nStunz’s boyfriend was from Juárez and visited regularly. She told him about misoprostol and asked him to buy it for her. “It was the least he could do,” she said.\n\nFor five hours after taking a second round of misoprostol, she huddled at home, her legs curled into her chest, as cramps that felt like a knife twisting within her uterus came and went. Her temperature rose to a fever, then chills. Roiled with nausea, she vomited, then worried she’d thrown up the medication. Finally, she fell asleep.\n\nFever, abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding are common side effects after taking misoprostol, according to the WHO. The Mayo Clinic states that the medication can also cause nausea and vomiting. In the moment, however, that didn’t make it any less frightening.\n\nBefore moving to El Paso, Stunz had lived in Portland, Oregon, where one of her friends was able to get an abortion the day after learning she was pregnant. The procedure was cheap, too, Stunz recalled. Unlike Texas, Oregon allows private insurance to cover abortions, and also has a state insurance program that will fund the procedure. “It’s totally opposite sides of the spectrum.”\n\nHad she been pregnant in Portland, she said, she would have gone to one of the city’s many Planned Parenthoods. “If one clinic is a little busy, there’s like, four more that would be a 10-minute bus ride away.”\n\nThere, she said, she would have felt supported. She wouldn’t have needed her abusive boyfriend’s help. She might even have felt empowered.\n\n“Why (does it) even ------- have to be so much harder than it is in Portland? Like, that makes me ------- angry. That we’re still having this debate,” she said. “That women still have to deal with these kinds of regulations on their bodies is ------- crazy.”\n\nIn Portland, she said, “no one’s standing there trying to make shit harder for you like in El Paso, or just in Texas. I’m glad I could at least get that shit for cheap in Juárez, you know? I’m glad there was at least that.”\n\nThis story was produced as part of the Puente News Collaborative, a binational partnership of news organizations in Ciudad Juárez and El Paso.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/02"}]}
