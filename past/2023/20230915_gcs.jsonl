What to know about testing ...", "text": "A new strain, or variant, of the coronavirus is spreading across the United Kingdom sparking fear across the globe.\n\nIt has not been detected in the U.S. yet, but it’s drawing attention as vaccines are being rolled out.\n\nAmerican health care workers began getting inoculated with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine a week ago. This week, Moderna’s vaccine became available after receiving authorization for emergency use from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Friday.\n\nThese vaccines are considered crucial to ending the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, where more than 317,000 Americans have died. Here's what you should know.\n\nWhat’s new about this coronavirus strain?\n\nThe World Health Organization said the variant was identified in southeastern England as early as September and had been detected as far away as Australia.\n\nCatherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist with UTHealth School of Public Health in Houston, said one or two mutations to the original coronavirus pop up every month or so, but this new variant has a whopping 17 mutations.\n\n\"We've never seen so many mutations happen so fast,\" she said.\n\nWhat's most concerning, Troisi said, is that eight out of the 17 mutations seem to affect the “spike protein” found on the surface of the virus, which allows the virus to attach itself to host cells and infect them.\n\n“Some of the mutations might make it easier for the virus to enter the body,” said Dr. Prathit Kulkarni, assistant professor of medicine in infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\nEnglish officials say the variant appears to be more infectious than the original.\n\nBritish Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the infection was “out of control” in Southern England.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, who described the new variant as 70% more transmissible than the original, ordered tighter restrictions and dropped a much-anticipated relaxation of rules that had been set to kick in across much of England ahead of the holidays. More than 16 million people are now ordered to stay at home in London and southeast England, and socializing elsewhere in the country is now restricted to Christmas Day only.\n\nKulkarni said modeling data found a recent steep rise in COVID-19 cases in the U.K. from this new variant, which could suggest it's more transmissible. However, an increase in human interaction could have also contributed to rising cases.\n\nU.S. officials stress this point.\n\n\"I think scientifically to date there is no hard evidence that this virus is more transmissible,\" Moncef Slaoui, co-head of Operation Warp Speed, said during a press conference Monday. “There is evidence that there is more of it in the population.\"\n\nCan tests for the COVID-19 virus in the US detect this new strain?\n\nThe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test should still test positive for this version of the coronavirus, experts say, and could also distinguish between the original and the variant.\n\n“It appears to be the case that the vast majority of tests should be unaffected in their ability to detect this particular strain of SARS-CoV-2,” Kulkarni said.\n\nTroisi said PCR tests detect parts of the virus's spike protein, specifically three proteins in the original coronavirus. However, it will only test positive for two of the proteins in the new variant.\n\nGenetic sequencing is a more reliable way of finding out if someone is infected with the variant, but Troisi said it takes sophisticated laboratory work that is more time intensive.\n\n\"We're early in detection,\" she said. \"If we were missing people who were infected with this mutation, we wouldn't know it right now.\"\n\nWill the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines protect against it?\n\nExperts say there’s no evidence to suggest the vaccines wouldn’t work to protect against the variant found in the U.K., however, ongoing surveillance is needed to confirm this.\n\nVivek Murthy, President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee for surgeon general, on Sunday urged Americans not to let concerns over the new version shake their faith in vaccination.\n\n“There’s no reason to believe that the vaccines that have been developed will not be effective against this virus as well,\" Murthy said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\nEric Cioe-Peña, a physician and director of Global Health, Northwell Health, in New Hyde Park on Long Island, New York, says the variant shouldn't delay the timeline for a return to a version of \"normalcy\" later this year.\n\n\"I think this is still to be seen how big of a deal this will be,\" Cioe-Peña said. \"Mutations are random, and sometimes they fizzle out when we are expecting them to become dominant.\"\n\nTroisi emphasizes current information is based on early data and will likely change as ongoing studies learn more about the new coronavirus variant.\n\n\"There's no reason to panic right now; we have enough to worry about,\" she said.\n\nContributing: John Bacon, USA TODAY.

Phil Murphy has been touting a surge in COVID-19 vaccine doses in late March and early April to help ease the appointment logjam and drive down rising cases and hospitalizations.\n\nBut while the number of doses from the federal stockpile has steadily increased, the \"quantum leap\" he has spoken about publicly has not yet been realized.\n\nThe reason became a bit more clear late Wednesday when The New York Times reported that 15 million doses of Johnson & Johnson's COVID vaccine were ruined when workers at a Baltimore factory accidentally combined ingredients from two different vaccines several weeks ago.\n\nThe mix-up has halted future shipments of the coveted one-shot dose in the U.S. while the Food and Drug Administration investigates, the Times reported.\n\nThe current doses sent to New Jersey and elsewhere were produced at a plant in the Netherlands. How many, if any, J&J doses will come to New Jersey in the following weeks is unknown after the accident.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, the New Brunswick-based pharmaceutical giant did not address whether the accident at manufacturing partner Emergent Biosolutions would significantly derail shipments of future doses.\n\nJ&J said it had already sent its 20 million doses to the federal government as it had promised by the end of March and will deliver another 24 million doses through April. The company had a goal of producing 100 million doses by the end of May.\n\nStill, New Jersey will get an 11% increase in its overall vaccine allocation next week, with 551,320 doses expected, state officials announced Wednesday.\n\nThe number of one-shot J&J doses being shipped to New Jersey will rise to 131,600, up from 51,700 doses this week.\n\nThe number of Moderna doses will increase slightly, to 178,700, but Pfizer will decrease by about 27,000 doses to 241,000 next week.\n\nNJ COVID vaccine finder:Book your appointment online at new website\n\nThe state totals don't include an additional 42,000 doses that will be distributed each week at a new vaccine site at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark. The site, operated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, opened this week.\n\nMurphy said Wednesday that his team lobbies the Biden administration every day to increase the number of doses. \"We are pounding away,\" he said at a briefing.\n\nMurphy said the \"supply-demand imbalance\" is still hampering New Jersey's ability to vaccinate more people.\n\nAs of Wednesday, more than 4.2 million doses had been administered and about 1.6 million New Jerseyans were fully vaccinated. Murphy's goal is to get 4.7 million fully vaccinated — 70% of the state's adult population — by July 4 at the latest.\n\nThe amount of vaccine has almost doubled since February, when New Jersey was receiving 200,000 to 300,000 doses weekly.\n\nCOVID-19 cases on the rise:New Jersey appears to be in yet another COVID wave, with cases, hospitalizations rising\n\nMurphy also announced the launch of an online vaccine appointment finder for New Jersey residents on Wednesday.\n\nThe website, which states near the top that it's still a work in progress, was launched in an effort to be a one-stop webpage for finding available appointment slots, which Garden State residents have struggled to get since the vaccines became available to larger swaths of the public.\n\nThe website, covid19.nj.gov/pages/finder, prompts you to choose one of the state's counties to check availability at vaccination centers within each area.\n\nThe pace of vaccine production and distribution was expected to take a substantial step forward by now.\n\nJ&J executives had pledged to deliver 20 million doses by the end of March to the federal stockpile. The New Jersey-based company will produce an additional 80 million by the end of June with the help of pharmaceutical rival Merck.\n\nModerna executives had said the company expects to double its monthly vaccine output to 40 million doses by April. Pfizer said it would produce more than 13 million doses per week by the middle of March, up from its 4 million to 5 million doses per week in early February.\n\nSince shipments are usually apportioned by state population, New Jersey would be in line for more than 500,000 of the 20 million J&J doses overall.\n\nThe news comes as New Jersey appears to be amid another wave of the virus.\n\nThe state has had the highest rate of new COVID infections in the nation for at least a week, and the number of COVID patients in New Jersey hospitals is up 30% over the last three weeks, to 2,363 on Tuesday. That's higher than any day since mid-February.\n\nStory continues below graph\n\nState officials said the demand for the J&J vaccine has been so great that some New Jerseyans were canceling their appointments for the two-shot Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.\n\nHealth officials — including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert — have said people should take the first vaccine available to them.\n\nThe pace of vaccinations has picked up in New Jersey with an increased supply and the number of vaccine providers climbing to more than 700 from about 300 in February.\n\nMeanwhile, eligibility was opened up in March to teachers, transportation workers and other employment categories deemed essential. The next round of eligibility begins Monday, when those 55 and older and more essential workers are able to get shots.\n\nScott Fallon covers the environment for NorthJersey.com.

Getting boosted this fall is still an important way to renew protection, even among people who were previously infected or vaccinated.\n\nBut the hope was that by tweaking the vaccine recipe to include currently circulating strains of the Omicron variant, it would help broaden immunity against those variants and perhaps offer better and longer-lasting protection.\n\nWhen the researchers compared the immune responses of people who got a booster dose of the original shot to people who got the updated bivalent boosters, they looked about the same.\n\n“We see essentially no difference” between the old boosters and the new about a month after the shot, said Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia, whose team authored one of the studies.\n\nImmunologists say a vaccine against two strains may not be better than a single strain shot because of a phenomenon called immune imprinting. Scientists say imprinting may complicate efforts to stay ahead of new variants as the coronavirus continues to evolve, and it adds urgency to the development of new vaccine technologies to fight the virus.\n\nWhen the US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorizations for new bivalent Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna at the end of August, it did so on the basis of studies in mice and previous human trials with a different two-strain booster formulation. Little was known about the how protective the shots might be in people; full data from clinical trials testing the BA.4 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines in humans hasn’t yet been made public.\n\nBut modeling data suggested that getting the boosters out in September could save tens of thousands of lives if the country had another winter surge, so the FDA authorized the shots, ahead of results from clinical trials, in order to get them to the public more quickly.\n\nThe updated shots contain instructions that show cells how to make spike proteins from the original virus that caused Covid-19, as well as spikes from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. These spikes get assembled by our cells and displayed to our immune system so it can make antibodies to fight the real thing during an active infection.\n\nThe original strain of the virus, sometimes called the ancestral or wild-type strain, is no longer circulating, however. When we boost, we are mostly boosting antibodies against a virus that’s long gone.\n\nAs the virus has evolved, the vaccines have not kept pace. Each new variant has become more and more resistant to the antibodies we make against it, increasing the risk of breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nRight now, protection against infection begins to wane just a few months after each booster dose. Protection against severe outcomes – hospitalization or death from Covid-19 – lasts longer, but can also fade, especially for vulnerable groups such as people who are over 65, who have weakened immune systems or who have underlying medical conditions.\n\nSimilar immune responses\n\nThe studies have important limitations, and they aren’t the final word on the updated boosters.\n\nBoth studies were small. Ho’s study looked at the immune responses of 19 people who were boosted with a fourth dose of the original recipe vaccine and 21 people who got a fourth dose of the updated boosters. The other study, from Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor at Harvard and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, looked at 15 people who got the original booster and 18 people who got bivalent shots.\n\nBoth reports were posted as preprints, before scrutiny by independent experts.\n\nThe studies also measured immune responses over a short period of time – about three to five weeks after the fourth doses. Ho says these results could change with time, as immune cells mature.\n\n“We can’t say that a few months from now, there won’t be any difference,” he said. “We won’t know that until these individuals are followed for a longer period of time.”\n\nDespite these caveats, experts who were not involved in the research say that two studies from well-regarded labs arriving at roughly the same conclusions about the vaccines gives them confidence that the results are correct.\n\n“At least at this time point, there’s no discernible benefit” over the older boosters, Ho said.\n\nClinical trials being conducted by vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna involve hundreds of people who have had the updated boosters and are being followed for longer periods of time. Data from those studies are still coming.\n\nBoth companies declined to comment on Ho and Barouch’s studies, citing company policies not to weigh in on research they have not been involved in.\n\nIn comparing the immune responses of people who got the old boosters with those who got the newer ones, the researchers found that neutralizing antibodies spiked after both shots to about the same high levels, which was good news.\n\nIn Barouch’s study, antibody concentrations were 15 times higher after the original boosters, rising from 184 to 2,829. They were 17 times higher after the updated shots, jumping from 211 to 3,693. The difference in antibody levels between shots didn’t pass a statistical test, however, so the results may have been due to chance.\n\nMore importantly, that slight difference in antibody levels probably wouldn’t protect people any better in the real world.\n\n“We would not expect this to be clinically significant,” said Barouch, who worked on the development of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nBut the bulk of the antibodies generated after either shot were ones that would bind the original virus, with fewer directed specifically against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\nBarouch’s team also looked specifically at T cells, which help the body hold the memory of germs it has been exposed to. These cells are thought to play a key role in how long immune protection lasts. Antibody levels naturally drop off over time, but T cells stick around.\n\nThe numbers of T cells didn’t budge much after either vaccine.\n\n“Unfortunately, neither one increased T-cell responses very much, and we believe that T-cell responses in addition to antibody responses are important for protection against severe disease,” Barouch said.\n\n‘A booster is a booster’\n\nDr. Eric Topol, who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the study results “can be considered a disappointment,” especially because the US government raced to make them available and because there had been high hopes for an improved vaccine in time for a predicted winter Covid-19 surge.\n\nTopol also said it would be a mistake to skip these shots. They still work; they just may not be much of an improvement over the older ones.\n\n“A booster is a booster until proven otherwise and we are in great need of getting more of them in the US,” Topol, who was not involved in the new studies, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nFewer than 20 million people – less than 10% of the population ages 5 and up – have gotten the updated booster, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAfter waiting the recommended three months since his last Covid-19 infection, President Joe Biden got an updated booster Tuesday and urged eligible Americans to do the same.\n\n“Your old vaccine or your previous Covid infection will not give you maximum protection,” Biden said.\n\nPublic health officials had hoped that the rollout of the updated boosters would mark a turning point, where Americans might be able to get annual Covid-19 shots instead of boosters every few months.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, recently told Stat that he wasn’t sure whether the country had reached that point.\n\n“I would be lying to you if [I said] it doesn’t keep me up at night worrying that there is a certain chance that we may have to deploy another booster – at least for a portion of the population, perhaps older individuals – before next September, October,” he said.\n\n“I’m not saying that’s what’s going to happen, but it’s what keeps me up at night, because we see how fast this virus is evolving.”\n\nImprinting may complicate quest for better immunity\n\nThe studies probably didn’t find any difference between the new and old boosters because of immune imprinting, says Michael Worobey, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies the evolution of viruses and the origins and control of pandemics.\n\n“Your body is on a hair trigger to create more antibodies of what it has a good memory of,” said Worobey, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, our immune systems were blank slates when it came to the coronavirus. By now, most of us have been exposed to one version of the virus or another through the vaccine, an infection or both. That exposure programs cells called B cells to make specific kinds of antibodies, and more B cells get this programming during their first exposure to the virus than they do in subsequent brushes with it.\n\nThat’s the reason some strains of the flu may hit certain age groups harder than others, too. When viruses look more similar to the first infection or vaccine you had, your body tends to do a better job fighting them off.\n\nWorobey said that both new studies have limitations, “but I think when you put them together, they paint a pretty clear picture that that antigenic imprinting is causing issues here, for sure.”\n\nIt’s possible to break through immune imprinting, he said. Certain kinds of vaccine ingredients, or adjuvants – “things that just happen to really wake up the immune system” – can do it.\n\nBut it’s not easy to add the kind of adjuvants he’s thinking about to mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna’s. In this case, he says, judging by the study findings, it probably would have been better to update the vaccine by including only the components against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\n“For me, the take-home message is, if you want to boost and provide protection against Omicron, leave the original variant out of the vaccine.”\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, says the new studies bear out data that was presented to the FDA’s advisers in June.\n\nHe says it’s one of the reasons he voted against the FDA requiring companies to add an Omicron strain to the boosters used in the US.\n\n“Certainly, the hope that this would be significantly better in terms of protection against the circulating strains, I think, is unlikely to be realized,” said Offit, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWorobey says that when the strains are combined as they are in the updated boosters, they actually end up competing. The body’s response to the original strain is so strong, it will end up blocking the updated portion of the vaccine from stimulating those blank slate B cells against the newer variants and reshaping the immune response.\n\nThus, imprinting will complicate efforts to keep up with the virus, he says. We may need different kinds of vaccine technologies if the virus ever changes so much that it outcompetes our immunity altogether.\n\nThat’s something the FDA’s Marks has considered, too.\n\n“I would love to see us have a very ecumenical look over all of the available vaccines and all of the vaccines in development to try to see what’s best moving forward,” he told Stat. “Not to diss the current mRNA vaccines but because we owe it to the population to see what might provide the greatest breadth, depth and duration of immunity against Covid-19.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/12/17/week-covid-19-breakthrough-data-reveals-lopsided-pandemic/6464882001/", "title": "This week in coronavirus: New breakthrough data reveals a ...", "text": "“This week in coronavirus” is a weekly column summarizing Tennessee headlines about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination efforts.

The potential vaccine is one of many being developed around the globe, and it could still take more than a year for it to be widely available if it is proven safe.\n\n“We don’t know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response or whether it will be safe.

However, the protection is not as high as that provided by the original vaccine against earlier coronavirus variants, the researchers say.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, called the new data “really quite good.”\n\n“Please, for your own safety, for that of your family, get your updated Covid-19 shot as soon as you’re eligible to protect yourself, your family and your community,” Fauci said at a White House briefing Tuesday.\n\nUptake of the bivalent boosters, which protect against the BA.4/5 subvariants as well as the original virus strain, has been remarkably slow. Only 11% of eligible Americans have gotten them since they became available in early September.\n\nThe new study found that the updated boosters work about like the original boosters. They protect against symptomatic infection in the range of 40% to 60%, meaning that even when vaccine protection is its most potent, about a month after getting the shot, people may still be vulnerable to breakthrough infections.\n\nThat’s in about the same range as typical efficacy for flu vaccines. Over the past 10 years, CDC data shows, the effectiveness of the seasonal flu vaccines has ranged from a low of 19% to a high of around 52% against needing to see a doctor because of the flu. The effectiveness varies depending on how similar the strains in the vaccine are to the strains that end up making people sick.\n\nThe authors of the new study say people should realize that the Covid-19 vaccines are no longer more than 90% protective against symptomatic infections, as they were when they were first introduced in 2020.\n\n“Unfortunately, the 90% to 100% protection was what we saw during like pre-Delta time. And so with Delta, we saw it drop into the 70% range, and then for Omicron, we saw it drop even lower, to the 50% range. And so I think what we’re seeing here is that the bivalent vaccine really brings you back to that sort of effectiveness that we would have seen immediately after past boosters, which is great. That’s where we want it to get,” said Dr. Ruth Link-Gelles, an epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nVaccines are only one tool to stay well\n\n“This protection is not 100%, but it is something,” Link-Gelles said. “Especially going into the holidays where you’re likely to be traveling, spending time with elderly relatives, with vulnerable people. I think having some protection from infection and therefore some protection from infecting your loved one is better than having no protection at all.”\n\nLink-Gelles says it also means that people should continue to adopt a layered approach to protection, utilizing rapid tests, good-quality masks and ventilation as a comprehensive approach, rather than relying on vaccines alone.\n\n“This should be sort of one of the things in your toolbox for protecting yourself and your family,” she said. “Personally, we’re my family is all vaccinated up to date, but I think if we go to the airport tomorrow, we’ll be wearing our N95 [masks] because we’re seeing elderly relatives this weekend. And while we of course trust the vaccines, and I’m not super worried about a mild infection in myself or my healthy husband, we certainly would not want to infect his grandmother.”\n\nLink-Gelles added that she expects that vaccine protection against severe outcomes from Covid-19, like hospitalization and death, will be higher, but that data isn’t in yet.\n\nThe study, which was led by CDC scientists, relied on health records from more than 360,000 tests given at nearly 10,000 retail pharmacies between Sept. 14 and Nov. 11, a period when the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants were causing most Covid-19 infections in the US. The study included people ages 18 and up who had Covid-19 symptoms and were not immunocompromised.\n\nThe study looked at how effective the boosters were in two ways: Researchers calculated a value called absolute vaccine effectiveness, which compared the odds of symptomatic infection in people who received bivalent boosters with those who reported being unvaccinated. They also calculated relative vaccine effectiveness, which looked at the odds of symptomatic infection in people who received updated bivalent boosters compared with those who had two, three or four doses of the original single-strain vaccine.\n\nCompared with people who were unvaccinated, adults 18 to 49 who had gotten bivalent boosters were 43% less likely to get sick with a Covid-19 infection. Older adults, who tend to have weaker immune function, got less protection. Those ages 50 to 64 were 28% less likely, and those ages 65 and up were 22% less likely to get sick with Covid-19 than the unvaccinated group.\n\nThe relative vaccine effectiveness showed the added protection people might expect on top of whatever protection they had left after previous vaccine doses. If a person was two to three months past their last vaccine dose, the bivalent boosters added an average of 30% protection for those who were ages 18 to 49, 31% more protection if they were 50 to 64, and 28% more protection if they were 65 or older. At 3 months after their last booster, people ages 50 and older still had about 20% protection from Covid-19 illness, CDC data show. So overall, the updated boosters got them to around 50% effectiveness against symptomatic infection.\n\nIf a person was more than eight months away from their last vaccine dose, they got more protection from the boosters. But Link-Gelles said that by eight months, there was little protection left from previous shots against Omicron and its variants, meaning the vaccine effectiveness for this group was probably close to their overall protection against infection.\n\nThose ages 18 to 49 who were eight months or more past their last dose of a vaccine had 56% added protection against a Covid-19 infection with symptoms; adults 50 to 64 had 48% added protection, and adults over 65 had 43% added protection, on top of whatever was left from previous vaccinations.\n\nShort, modest protection from boosters\n\nJohn Moore, an immunologist and microbiologist at Weill Cornell Medicine, said it boils down to the fact that that boosters will probably cut your risk of getting sick by about 50%, and that protection probably won’t last.\n\n“Having a booster will give you some additional protection against infection for a short term, which is always what we see with a booster, but it won’t last long. It’ll decline, and it will decline more as the more resistant variants spread,” said Moore, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nThe immunity landscape in the United States is more complex than ever. According to CDC data, roughly two-thirds of Americans have completed at least their primary series of Covid-19 vaccines. And data from blood tests shows that almost all Americans have some immunity against the virus, thanks to infection, vaccination or both.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nA new preprint study from researchers at Harvard and Yale estimates that 94% of Americans have been infected with the virus that causes Covid-19 at least once, and 97% have been infected or vaccinated, increasing protection against a new Omicron infection from an estimated 22% in December 2021 to 63% by November 10, 2022. Population protection against severe disease rose from an estimated 61% in December 2021 to around 89%, on average, this November.\n\nAll of this means the US is in a better spot, defensively at least, than it ever has been against the virus – which is not to say that the country couldn’t see another Covid-19 wave, especially if a new variant emerges that is very different from what we’ve seen, if immunity continues to wane or if behavior shifts dramatically.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/20/health/johnson-and-johnson-covid-19-vaccine/index.html", "title": "Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine worked better than it gets ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US public and even some health experts may have underestimated the Covid-19 vaccine made by Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson, new data shows. And there’s emerging evidence that it could still play an important role ahead.\n\nA study published Thursday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open found that the J&J vaccine remains durable and effective, even through the surge of cases caused by the Delta variant. It was 76% effective overall in preventing Covid-19 infections and 81% effective in preventing Covid-related hospitalizations. The study also showed that it provided lasting immunity at least six months after the shots.\n\nAnd a CNN analysis of information collected by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed the J&J vaccine had the lowest breakthrough infection rate of all the vaccines since the week ending December 25, the latest five weeks of available data.\n\nIn January, during the Omicron surge, breakthrough infections were highest among those who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, followed by those who got Moderna. Those vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson shot had the lowest incidence of breakthrough infections.\n\nAs of the week ending January 22, there were 650 infections per 100,000 people with the J&J vaccine. With Moderna, there were 757 per 100,000, and with Pfizer, the rate was 862 per 100,000.\n\nUnvaccinated people were particularly vulnerable to getting sick during the Omicron and Delta surges, just as they were with the original version of the coronavirus. They were 3.2 times as likely to get sick as people who had the J&J vaccine. The unvaccinated were 2.8 times as likely to become infected than those who got Moderna and 2.4 times as likely as those who got Pfizer.\n\n“What we saw in the summertime and the fall during the Delta surge is that all three vaccines protected very, very well. But breakthrough rates in August, September of last year with the Janssen vaccine were slightly higher than Pfizer, and Moderna was slightly lower. But those differences were relatively small,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He helped to develop and study the J&J vaccine.\n\n“But what we saw over time is that those differences then narrowed,” he said. “And by the first week of December, what we saw in the data is that the lines cross,” with incidence rates for the J&J/Janssen vaccine becoming lower than the others.\n\n‘Reassuring’ data for J&J recipients\n\nIn March 2021, the J&J vaccine was the third to be authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration, and the initial response was more muted than the milestone authorizations of the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.\n\nThe vaccines work differently. The mRNA vaccines deliver blueprints, essentially, that train your body trains to fight that particular infection and any similar infection down the road. Adenovirus-vector vaccines, like J&J’s, use a virus that can act like a Trojan horse. But instead of soldiers jumping out, the adenovirus releases genes that encode the coronavirus’ spike protein.\n\nThe J&J vaccine stood out for other reasons, too: It came as a convenient single dose and didn’t require special refrigeration, whereas the mRNA vaccines required two doses, and Pfizer’s needed special cold storage. The flexibility was appealing for people who were afraid of shots or didn’t have the time to get two shots. It was also better for countries without a solid health care infrastructure.\n\nBut its performance tempered some of the enthusiasm around it, especially from the public.\n\nWhereas the mRNA vaccines were hailed for “astonishing” efficacy of more than 90%, the news that J&J was 65% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 among clinical trial volunteers underwhelmed some.\n\nFrom the start, the J&J vaccine supply was more limited. After after the vaccine was authorized, the federal government briefly paused its use due to safety concerns around rare blood clotting events. Even once vaccinations resumed, the pace of J&J vaccinations never recovered.\n\nIn December, the CDC changed its recommendations to say shots made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are preferred over J&J’s. It also urges people who got the J&J shot to get a booster of one of the mRNA vaccines two months later.\n\nThe protection that the Covid-19 vaccines offered has waned over time, and none of them works as well against the variants that have popped up since the original coronavirus surfaced. But the science is starting to show that people who got the J&J Covid-19 vaccine may have some advantage.\n\nBarouch told CNN that he “wasn’t surprised at all” to see that the durability of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine appears to be last longer than that of the mRNA vaccines – Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna – based on the incidence of breakthrough infections.\n\nThe mRNA vaccine technology has been shown to quickly elicit a potent and robust immune response after vaccination, but that can wane over time. Johnson & Johnson’s virus-vector platform may not spark as powerful of an immune response in the short term, but it is known to have strong durability.\n\n“Over time, the efficacy of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines goes down, the efficacy of the J&J vaccines remains stable, and so it is exactly as you would predict: that they will converge and they will then cross,” Barouch said.\n\nThe J&J vaccine also might have “a particular edge,” he said.\n\n“The immune system is actually made of two arms: the antibodies side and the T cells. And the type of T cells that are critical for prevention of serious illness are called CD8 T cells,” Barouch said. “The J&J vaccine raises better CD8 T cells than the Pfizer and other mRNA vaccines, so the J&J vaccine might have a particular edge for variants like Omicron that largely escaped from antibody responses.”\n\nOverall, Barouch called this data “very reassuring” for recipients of the J&J vaccine.\n\n“They should be reassured that they received a vaccine that gives very good protection for a long period of time,” Barouch said. “And I think the second message is that I think people should learn about these new data in terms of considering booster shots, as well.”\n\nProspects as a booster?\n\nDavid Montefiori, a virologist at Duke University Medical Center, said “the J&J vaccine has kind of gotten a bad rap because of the efficacy, but the stability of the response is intriguing.”\n\nThe antibody level went down with every vaccine during the Omicron surge, and that could mean people need an additional booster. More research is needed to find out.\n\nA yet-unpublished study by the National Institutes of Health looking at a mix-and-match vaccine strategy saw good results when J&J was included, Montefiori said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“In people who got the Pfizer vaccine initially and then a boosted with the J&J vaccine, those people made pretty high levels of neutralizing antibodies to Omicron: 10 times higher than people who got two shots with just the J&J vaccine,” he said. “So the J&J vaccine might be a good booster for people who got an mRNA vaccine initially.”\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson vaccine can be used for primary doses or as a booster, but the CDC says the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are recommended in most situations because of the risk of serious adverse events with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n\nThe J&J vaccine has been linked to rare cases of blood clots with low platelets, known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome or TTS. “It occurs at a rate of about 3.83 cases per million Janssen doses and has resulted in deaths,” the CDC says.\n\nDr. Angela Branche, an infectious disease specialist and associate professor of medicine at the University of Rochester, said the side effect profile of the J&J vaccine “remains something that’s of concern for some groups where that risk is high.” Women ages 30 to 49 years are at increased risk of this rare adverse event, the CDC says.\n\nBut if that research pans out, the J&J vaccine may be useful as a booster for only certain populations.\n\n“For some groups where that risk of developing serious blood clots is not very high, like older adults, this may be a good strategy,” Branche said.\n\nMontefiori said the vaccine deserves more study.\n\n“I think there might still be a place for the J&J vaccine in the long-term picture of this pandemic,” Montefiori said.", "authors": ["Jen Christensen Deidre Mcphillips", "Jen Christensen", "Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/05/03/fda-approves-first-rsv-vaccine-older-adults/70178303007/", "title": "FDA approves first RSV vaccine, shots to be available for older adults", "text": "The Food and Drug Administration approved Wednesday the first vaccine to combat severe respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.\n\nArexvy, the new vaccine developed by GSK, formerly known as GlaxoSmithKline, was approved for adults 60 and older and was 82% effective at preventing lower respiratory tract illness caused by RSV, according to trial data. It was also 94% effective in those who had at least one underlying medical condition.\n\n“Today’s approval of the first RSV vaccine is an important public health achievement to prevent a disease which can be life-threatening and reflects the FDA’s continued commitment to facilitating the development of safe and effective vaccines for use in the United States,\" said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\n\nRespiratory syncytial virus infects nearly everyone by age 2 and typically causes cold symptoms. But it’s also the leading cause of hospitalizations among newborns and younger children. Among those under 5, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports between 58,000 and 80,000 hospitalizations a year.\n\nRSV also strikes late in life, causing more than 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths among older adults each year.\n\nDuring an FDA advisory panel meeting in February, GSK researchers reported a few cases of neurological disorders post-vaccination, including one case of Guillain-Barré in a 78-year-old woman in Japan about nine days after receiving the shot.\n\nHowever, panel members voted to recommend the vaccine, saying it was still safe and effective for older adults.\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome, or GBS, is a rare neurological disorder in which the body’s immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis, according to the CDC. About 70% of people diagnosed with GBS make a full recovery, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Symptoms may persist for years, but experts say most people recover within a few months.\n\nRSV vaccinesShots for babies and adults are on the way. Here's what the CDC is saying about them.\n\nOther RSV vaccines in the works\n\nGSK’s vaccine is one of several RSV vaccines and treatments under review by regulatory agencies. Others include:\n\nSanofi’s monoclonal antibody for infants and toddlers: A monoclonal antibody from Sanofi and AstraZeneca,called nirsevimab, helps prevent RSV lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants entering or during their first RSV season. If approved, it would be the second monoclonal antibody on the market for infants.\n\nPfizer’s RSV vaccine for pregnant people: The FDA said it has agreed to review Pfizer’s vaccine candidate, RSVpreF, for approval and set an action date for August. If approved, the vaccine would be for pregnant people to help protect against RSV severe disease in infants from birth through 6 months.\n\nPfizer's vaccine for older adults: This vaccine candidate is under the same name as the maternal vaccine, RSVpreF.

The reduced volume and the arrival last week of the first tranche of vaccine for frontline health care workers provided a \"huge emotional lift\" to personnel and reduced, for now, the likelihood hospitals would need to ration health care resources, Scrase said.\n\nHe noted, however, that in the northwestern corner of the state, hospitalizations were not yet receding and workers there were still \"up against it\" and would remain on that footing for seven to ten days. He also reported that 158 patients statewide were on ventilators, indicating serious illness.\n\nNew Mexico announced 1,272 new cases statewide Tuesday, bringing the aggregate total to 132,075, of which 56,844 have been designated as recovered. As of Tuesday, 2,203 cases had resulted in death, including 23 new fatalities announced Tuesday.\n\n\"We can become numb to the number of people dying,\" Scrase observed on a day when U.S. deaths from COVID-19 had surpassed 318,000.\n\nGrim milestones: Over 3 million people died in 2020 – the deadliest year in US history\n\nScrase also noted that \"excess deaths,\" or fatalities attributed to causes other than COVID-19 in the midst of the pandemic, had also increased, possibly related to strain on the medical care delivery system and other potential factors.\n\nMore than 14,000 individuals spanning all regions of the state had received their first shot of the vaccine developed by Pfizer, which requires a second shot after three weeks, Collins reported.\n\nOf the initial 17,550 doses shipped to New Mexico last week, Collins said the only wasted doses known to the state were from a single shipment of 75 that were discarded due to having been stored at unsafe temperatures. The vaccines are required to be stored in ultra-cold temperatures of nearly 100 degrees below zero.\n\nA second, smaller tranche of the Pfizer vaccine began arriving in New Mexico Monday, while a second vaccine, developed by biotech company Moderna, also began distribution through New Mexico to be prioritized for staff and residents of long-term care facilities.\n\nOnline apps for tests, vaccinations\n\nOn Tuesday the state Department of Health launched an online application where the public may register their contact information to receive information in the future about how to obtain their vaccination. However, as limited supplies arrive in the state, officials are still developing their strategy for what groups will be eligible for the vaccine in what order after the health care force is vaccinated.\n\nThe vaccine will be administered to New Mexicans strategically, rather than on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nThe online registration address is http://CVvaccine.NMhealth.org.\n\nAdditionally, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham's office announced a partnership with Vault Medical Services to provide free saliva collection kits to test for COVID-19.\n\nRelated:New Mexico to boost coronavirus testing with saliva samples\n\nResidents may apply for the test kits online at http://learn.vaulthealth.com/nm/ and the kits will be shipped to them. In order to participate, residents need to have access to video conferencing so a technician can supervise them as they open a vial and provide their saliva sample live. The kit is then shipped to the laboratory for processing, with results available within 48 hours of receipt.\n\nThe application asks for insurance information but the service is available free of charge, regardless of insurance status. On Monday morning, the website asked for credit card information as well, which the governor's office later said was a technical error and had been corrected.\n\nMore testing is essential to New Mexico's COVID-19 response, Scrase said. With increased more testing, more cases are identified before individuals show symptoms, allowing them to isolate more quickly — and for those with whom they have had contact to be isolated and tested, slowing the spread of the virus.\n\nNM 'on the downside of the curve'\n\nScrase presented data that indicated New Mexico is 'now on the downside of the curve,' including a seven-day rolling average down to 1,143 cases daily last week. Downward trends in new cases are evident across all regions, except for a plateau in the northwest counties, including the Navajo Nation.\n\nScrase said positive cases, hospitalizations and fatalities all continue to occur at higher rates in areas of higher poverty around the state.\n\nIn better news, the transmission rate — which measures how many additional people are infected per each positive individual — had fallen below one, even though daily case counts are still six or seven times the goal set by the state for loosening restrictions on business and activities that gather people into groups.\n\nMore:New Mexico reports progress on COVID-19 spread; hospitals still under strain\n\nThe state's test positivity rate also fell to 12.1 percent, moving in the right direction toward the state's goal of five percent. Scrase noted that in long-term care facilities, the test positivity has remained below or close to five percent since July, with the most recent estimate at 5.13 percent.\n\nA plea for the holidays\n\nScrase and Collins jointly urged residents to \"stick with\" the COVID-safe practices of staying home as much as possible, avoiding gatherings with non-household members, and wearing masks when out on essential business. Maintaining physical distance from other individuals and washing hands frequently were also emphasized once more.\n\nWith more compliance to the guidelines, Scrase speculated that New Mexico might be at the halfway point in the COVID-19 health crisis, with better months ahead as vaccinations roll out to a majority of the population.\n\nWith regard to holiday activities, Scrase said that outdoor activities were safer than indoor activities as far as exposure to non-household members. However, he recommended planning ahead to \"avoid the indoor parts of outdoor activities,\" such as eating in cafeterias, or other activities in which groups of people congregate for several minutes or longer.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Collins issued a statement addressing Christmas directly, saying, \"The best gift you can give your loved ones is keeping them COVID-free — so please celebrate the holidays safely with your own household members. Gathering for Christmas this year with friends and family from outside your own household is an extreme risk to the health and safety of yourself and your community.\"\n\nAlgernon D'Ammassa can be reached at 575-541-5451, adammassa@lcsun-news.com or @AlgernonWrites on Twitter.\n\nOthers are reading:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/22"}]}

The regime launched an intercontinental ballistic missile in November 2017. Some experts said the regime no longer needs to conduct such tests because of advances in its nuclear weapons program.\n\nLess than a year ago, Trump and Kim held a historic meeting in Singapore. Since then, Trump has claimed North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat, but independent analysts have questioned that assessment.\n\nVietnam, which has diplomatic ties with both Washington and Pyongyang, offers advantages for both leaders. Vietnam is an easy flight for Kim's shorter-range aircraft, and for Trump, it offers a symbolic nod to a communist country that has improved relations with the United States since the end of the Vietnam War.\n\nTrump said last week that he may meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping as part of the summit as the United States and China work to head off an escalating trade war.\n\nPointing to an end of nuclear missile tests, Trump placed North Korea at the top of his foreign policy achievements. Trump and Kim have traded letters, and the president has repeatedly said he has a \"very good relationship\" with the reclusive leader.\n\n\"Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one,\" Trump said Tuesday night.\n\nMore:Read President Trump's full State of the Union address\n\nAnalysts questioned the decision to hold a second summit, arguing Trump should demand concrete steps toward denuclearization from North Korea – the original U.S. goal – before agreeing to another meeting. Trump unexpectedly announced at the first summit that the United States would suspend joint U.S. military exercises with South Korea.\n\nTrump’s special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, said last week that the United States and North Korea would hold working-level negotiations before the summit aimed at agreeing on concrete “deliverables” for that meeting.\n\nAt Stanford University, Biegun said North Korea has not provided the United States with an inventory of its nuclear arsenal, a step toward a denuclearization agreement.\n\nBiegun conceded that the United States and North Korea have “no detailed definition or shared agreement on what denuclearization entails.”\n\nTrump and Kim signed a vaguely worded agreement at their first summit in Singapore pledging to work toward full denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Members of Trump's administration acknowledge North Korea is still developing a nuclear weapons program, and U.S. sanctions on the country remain in place.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Dan Coats told lawmakers last week that \"North Korea will seek to retain its WMD capabilities and is unlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons and production capabilities.\" Coats said the U.S. intelligence community observed \"some activity that is inconsistent with full denuclearization.\"\n\nCoats said North Korea \"has halted its provocative behavior\" by refraining from missile tests and nuclear tests for more than a year.\n\nBiegun said Trump is ready to declare an end to the Korean War.\n\n“It’s over. It’s done.

Instead, he said, \"we're going to start a process\" on an agreement to have Kim eliminate the nuclear weapons that have generated global tensions for years.\n\n\"I think it's a 'getting to know you' meeting-plus, and that could be a very positive thing,\" Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nFriday's announcement capped eight days of uncertainty that started May 24, when Trump said he was canceling the June 12 summit because of offensive comments made by the North Korean government.\n\nIn the last week, Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in met in the Demilitarized Zone between the two countries, while North Korean envoys scrambled to the United States to meet with U.S. officials.\n\nTrump spoke warmly about the North Koreans Friday after receiving a letter from Kim concerning the prospects of a historic summit between the nuclear-armed leaders.\n\nKim Yong Chol, a former North Korean spy chief who is now a top aide to Kim Jong Un, entered the White House in the early afternoon to hand-deliver the letter to Trump during the Oval Office meeting with the U.S. president and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nTrump did not disclose the contents of Kim's message — \"Oh, would you like to see what was in that letter,\" he told reporters — but said he and the envoy discussed issues ranging from economic sanctions to a possible peace treaty between North and South Korea.\n\nThe president later said he had not even opened Kim's letter, saying he didn't want to do so in front of his guests and joking that \"I may be in for a big surprise, folks.\"\n\nThe White House said later that Trump did eventually read the letter.\n\nNorth Korea wants the United States and allies to remove economic sanctions that are crippling its economy.\n\n\"I look forward to the day when I can take the sanctions off of North Korea,\" Trump said, but he did not commit to such a step. He said additional sanctions are ready, but he will not apply them unless \"the talks break down.\"\n\nTrump's meeting with Kim Yong Chol and other North Korean officials lasted around an hour and 20 minutes. The president shook hands and posed for pictures outside the White House with members of the North Korean delegation.\n\n\"We will see you on June 12,\" Trump said.\n\nMore:Trump says North Korea delegates will deliver letter from Kim Jong Un about summit\n\nMore:Donald Trump team seeks to nail down details of Kim Jong Un meeting\n\nThe glad-handing marked a stark contrast to the past, coming less than a year after Trump attacked Kim Jong Un as \"Little Rocket Man\" and all but threatened to destroy his country. Meanwhile, North Korea continued to threaten the United States and it allies with nuclear weapons. For his part, Kim once referred to Trump as a \"dotard.\"\n\nKim Yong Chol was the highest-ranking North Korean official to visit the White House in 18 years — and he needed a waiver to get into the country. The United States has sanctioned the former spy leader for his suspected role in the cyberattacks on American companies.\n\nThe last such meeting came in late 2000, when lame duck President Clinton hosted an envoy who brought a letter from then-North Korea leader Kim Jong Il, the current leader's father. That session did not lead to a meeting between Clinton and the elder Kim.\n\nThis time around, U.S. and North Korean leaders will meet face-to-face for the first time. In addition to Kim's nuclear weapons, the summit may include withdrawal of some sanctions as well relations overall between North and South Korea.\n\nEnding the Korean War?\n\nThe Korean War between the split nations ended with an armistice in 1953. The two sides are again talking about a formal peace treaty, and Trump indicated that could be part of his meeting with Kim in Singapore.\n\n\"Can you believe that we're talking about the ending of the Korean War?\" Trump said at one point.\n\nTrump, who meets next week with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said Japan is also involved in the budding negotiations, and that \"South Korea's very much involved.\"\n\nTrump also said he may discuss human rights with Kim.\n\nIn his May 24 message to Kim, Trump noted \"the tremendous anger and open hostility\" of statements Kim made after the scheduling of the summit, including attacks on U.S. officials who called for verifiable denuclearization of North Korea.\n\nKim and aides have said they will never surrender their nuclear weapons programs, the key to any negotiations involving the United States and its allies.\n\nRight after the cancellation, however, Trump began talking about rescheduling the summit, citing more civil statements from Kim and the North Korean government.\n\nAlong with the Demilitarized Zone meetings, the U.S. also dispatched an advance team to Singapore to make logistical preparations for a summit.\n\nKim, meanwhile, has held meetings of his own, and some of them signaled possible trouble in forthcoming talks with the United States.\n\nThe North Korean leader welcomed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to Pyongyang this week. Russia supports lifting economic sanctions on North Korea.\n\nTrump told reporters he \"didn't like\" Kim meeting with the Russians, but added that \"it could be very positive, too.\"\n\nChina's role\n\nKim has also spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the up-and-down discussions about a Trump meeting. Trump suggested that Xi is the one who told Kim to take a harder line after the June 12 meeting was announced.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said he hopes China will \"help out\" in seeking a deal with Kim.\n\nThe North Korean leader is expected to press for a lifting of economic sanctions, and perhaps new forms of economic assistance, in exchange for an agreement on his nuclear weapons programs.\n\nLisa Collins, a fellow with the Korea Chair at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there is skepticism in the foreign policy community that Kim will dismantle all of his weapons programs, and that makes for a challenging set of negotiations.\n\n\"It all comes down to what the North Korean leader wants, which is difficult to answer unless you have a series of meetings,\" Collins said.\n\nShe added that the North Koreans \"won't be giving up anything for free.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/10/donald-trump-says-he-meet-north-koreas-kim-june-1-donald-trump-makes-long-awaited-announcement-summi/596715002/", "title": "Trump says he will meet North Korea's Kim Jong Un on June 12", "text": "WASHINGTON — President Trump announced Thursday that he will meet North Korea's Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore, setting up a historic summit in hopes of getting Kim to give up his nuclear weapons programs.\n\n\"The highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong Un and myself will take place in Singapore on June 12th,\" Trump tweeted. \"We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!\"\n\nTrump will be the first sitting U.S. president to meet with a leader of North Korea, which emerged as a communist state from the dusk of World War II and the dawn of the Cold War.

They noted that North Korea has failed to honor previous agreements.\n\nOver the years, North Korea has demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea and the elimination of the nuclear defense umbrella that covers the Korean Peninsula.\n\nHistorian Michael Cohen, author of American Maelstrom: The 1968 Election and the Politics of Division, said Kim might offer \"a vague pledge\" to denuclearize that Trump would declare as a victory, but North Korea would decline to follow through.\n\nThe potential pitfall is that Trump thinks that denuclearization is \"going to happen and becomes angry when it doesn't,\" said Cohen, who writes a column for The Boston Globe.\n\nRothkopf said any substantial agreement between the United States and North Korea would have to define denuclearization, provide a timeline and include provisions for inspections.\n\nQuestioning whether Kim would get that specific, Rothkopf said the North Korea leader knows what happened to Libya's Moammar Gadhafi — he gave up weapons of mass destruction and nuclear programs in 2003 and was overthrown and killed in 2011.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump viewed North Korea's prisoner release as \"a positive gesture,\" but \"total denuclearization will remain the top priority.\"\n\nTrump had discussed meeting with Kim in the Demilitarized Zone at the border between North and South Korea.

KCNA/KCNA\n\nIn Monday’s report, KCNA said North Korea’s recent missile tests showed the country’s forces were “fully ready to hit and wipe out the set objects at the intended places in the set time.”\n\nKim Jun-rak, a spokesperson for South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed that North Korea launched two cruise missiles from the Kaechon area, South Phyongan province, from 2 a.m. local time Wednesday over the West Sea, also known as the Yellow Sea.\n\n“The South Korean military was aware of the situation in real time and maintained a readiness posture by closely cooperating with the US while strengthening surveillance and vigilance,” Kim said at a briefing on Thursday.\n\nThe US Indo-Pacific Command said it had no comment on the reports of Wednesday’s test.\n\nThe KCNA report claimed the cruise missiles tested Wednesday flew oval and figure-8 patterns for almost three hours above the sea before hitting their target.\n\nNuclear test fears\n\nAnalysts stressed caution over the KCNA reports.\n\n“It is worth remembering that the details of these reports cannot be trusted,” said Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “The Kim regime is sometimes surprisingly transparent about weapons development goals, but it also tends to exaggerate strength and capabilities.”\n\nBut Easley and others stressed that the North Korean reports should not be dismissed as pure bluster by South Korea and the West.\n\nKim Dong-yub, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said North Korean missile tests show a progressing program even if current strengths are exaggerated.\n\n“The fact that Kim Jong Un oversaw this missile launch suggests that the cruise missile is at the final stage of development,” he said.\n\nCruise missiles have substantial differences with ballistic missiles, which have formed the large majority of North Korea’s tests this year.\n\nA ballistic missile is launched using a rocket or rockets, then travels outside of Earth’s atmosphere, gliding in space before reentry and then descending powered only by gravity to its target.\n\nA cruise missile is powered by a jet engine, stays inside Earth’s atmosphere during its flight and is maneuverable with control surfaces similar to an airplane’s.\n\nCruise missiles have smaller payloads than ballistic missiles, so would require a smaller nuclear warhead than a missile designed to hit the mainland United States, such as an intercontinental ballistic missile.\n\nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions ban North Korea from testing ballistic missiles, but no such restriction applies to the testing of cruise missiles.\n\nNorth Korea’s ability to deploy a nuclear warhead on any kind of missile is unproven.\n\nShin Beom-chul, South Korea’s vice defense minister, told local radio station SBS Thursday morning the spate of missile testing and threatening announcements from Pyongyang shows North Korea may be building up to testing a nuclear device for the seventh time. Its last test was in 2017.\n\n“North Korea is testing various missiles. And now they’ve tested cruise missiles, and I think they’ll test the tactical nuclear weapon part that can be loaded on each warhead,” Shin said.\n\n“North Korea hasn’t conducted a tactical nuclear test, so it needs to make the nuclear warheads smaller and verify them,” he said.\n\nEven if it doesn’t test a nuclear weapon, North Korea’s new propaganda campaign presents a problem, said Easley, the Ewha University professor.\n\n“Pyongyang’s military threats are a chronic and worsening problem for peace and stability in Asia,” Easley said.\n\n“Policymakers in Seoul, Tokyo and Washington should not allow domestic politics and other challenges such as Russia’s war in Ukraine to prevent them from increasing international coordination on military deterrence and economic sanctions” on Pyongyang, he said.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon Yoonjung Seo", "Brad Lendon", "Yoonjung Seo"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/22/trump-long-way-north-korea-meeting-kim-jong-un/540084002/", "title": "Trump: We are still 'a long way' from North Korea meeting with Kim ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — President Trump said Sunday he is still hoping for an unprecedented meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but many details remain and it may not happen.\n\n\"We are a long way from conclusion on North Korea, maybe things will work out, and maybe they won’t - only time will tell,\" Trump tweeted about efforts to get North Korea to give up nuclear weapons.\n\nWhile Trump has praised some of Kim's recent moves — including his announcement he will suspend nuclear and long-range missile tests — he and aides are still negotiating details of a prospective summit, from its location to a specific agenda.\n\nNegotiations included a secret trip to North Korea by CIA director — and secretary of State nominee — Mike Pompeo to meet with the reclusive Kim.\n\nMore:North Korea to suspend nuclear missile tests and will close nuke test site\n\nMore:Trump voices hope for North Korea summit but warns he may 'leave the meeting' if not fruitful\n\nWhile Kim has reportedly offered to discuss \"denuclearization,\" some analysts said it is uncertain how he defines that term; they also said that his test suspension is meaningless and could be easily reversed.\n\nSen.

KCNA\n\nIn response, Kim said in the coming year that Pyonyang must mass produce tactical nuclear weapons while developing a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that would give the North a “quick counterstrike capability,” according to the KCNA report.\n\nKim’s comments come at the end of a year that saw his regime test more missiles than at any time in North Korean history, including an ICBM that could in theory strike the US mainland.\n\nOn Saturday, in its 37th day of missile tests in 2022, North Korea fired at least three short-range ballistic missiles from a site south of Pyongyang, according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nIt followed that early Sunday with another test. North Korea said both Saturday’s and Sunday’s tests were of a 600mm multiple-launch rocket (MRL) system. Most multiple-rocket launch systems in service around the world are around 300mm in size.\n\nThe 600mm MRL was first introduced three years ago, and production has been increased since late October of 2022 for deployment, Kim said in his speech to the plenary session on Saturday, according to KCNA. He later added that an additional 30 of the 600mm MRL will be deployed to the military simultaneously.\n\nKim said the weapon is capable of overcoming high landforms, can consecutively strike with precision, has all of South Korea in its shooting range and can be loaded with tactical nuclear warheads, according to the KCNA report.\n\n“Prospectively, as a key offensive weapon of our military forces, it will carry out its own combat mission to overwhelm the enemy,” Kim said.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, pictured on November 2, 2022, said his country should respond with clear retaliation to North Korea's provocations. Yonhap/Reuters\n\nSouth Korea’s Defense Ministry later responded to Kim’s comments, calling them “provocative language that seriously harms peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula.”\n\nThe ministry urged Pyongyang to “immediately stop” developing nuclear weapons and return to the path of denuclearization, warning that the “Kim Jong Un regime will come to an end if North Korea attempts to use nuclear weapons.”\n\nThe ministry vowed to maintain its military readiness posture to “firmly respond” to any North Korean threats, adding that the military will strengthen its “three-axis” defense system designed to counter North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats.\n\nThe three-axis defense system consists of the Kill Chain preemptive strike system, the Korea Air and Missile Defense system and the Korea Massive Punishment and Retaliation plan, an operational plan to incapacitate the North Korean leadership in a major conflict.\n\nSouth Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Sunday during a phone call with military chiefs that North Korea will continue to conduct constant nuclear and missile provocations, and South Korea’s military should respond with clear retaliation, his office said.\n\nExpert: North Korea expanding capabilities\n\nLeif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said Pyongyang has used the past year to demonstrate its ability to perform a range of military strikes.\n\n“Its recent missile launches were not technically impressive. Instead, the high volume of tests at unusual times and from various locations demonstrate that North Korea could launch different types of attack, anytime, and from many directions,” Easley said.\n\nEasley also noted that it’s not just missiles that North Korea is using to up the military pressure on the South. Last week, Pyongyang flew five drones into South Korean airspace, forcing Seoul to scramble fighter jets and helicopters to track them and later to send its own drones into North Korean airspace.\n\nIt all leads to an escalation of tensions, according to Easley.\n\n“Such provocations, including drone incursions, appear excessive for deterrence and may be intended to scare South Korea into taking a softer policy. But with Kim disavowing diplomacy and threatening to mass produce nuclear weapons, the Yoon administration is likely to further increase South Korea’s defense capabilities and readiness,” Easley said.\n\nFor its part, South Korea is beefing up forces, too.\n\nSeoul’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) announced last month it will spend more than $2.7 billion over 10 years to strengthen the mission capabilities and survivability of its fleet of F-15K fighters, jets that would play a key role in any possible strikes on North Korea.\n\nWashington is also not standing still. As well as deploying assets like F-22 fighters and B-1 bombers to the exercises around the Korean Peninsula, the US military recently activated its first Space Force command on foreign soil in South Korea, with the unit’s new commander saying he is ready to face any threat in the region.\n\nThe new unit “will be tasked with coordinating space operations and services such as missile warning, position navigation and timing and satellite communications within the region,” according to US Forces Korea.\n\nEven before Kim’s latest remarks, experts had noted the big strides Pyongyang had made in its missile forces over the past year.\n\nAnkit Panda, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN in mid-December that Pyongyang has emerged as a missile power.\n\n“The bigger picture is that North Korea is literally turning into a prominent operator of large-scale missile forces,” Panda said. “The word test is no longer appropriate to talk about most North Korean missile launches.”\n\n“Most of the missiles they’ve launched this year are parts of military exercises. They are rehearsing for nuclear war. And that, I think, is the big picture this year,” Panda said.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon Gawon Bae", "Brad Lendon", "Gawon Bae"], "publish_date": "2022/12/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/06/putin-russia-north-korea-weapons-ukraine/70767153007/", "title": "Why Russia is tapping North Korea for weapons help in Ukraine war", "text": "WASHINGTON − A potential high-stakes meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin is just one of several indications that the Russian president may be getting nervous − even desperate − as Moscow's war in Ukraine grinds on into its 18th month.\n\nAs Ukraine makes some limited progress in its counteroffensive, Russian troops in the hotly contested southern coastal area of Ukraine are cracking down on an apparent resurgence of national patriotism, launching surprise checks and propaganda efforts to stave off a possible revolt, a senior Ukrainian defense ministry official said Monday.\n\nCuba, one of Russia's most stalwart allies, is publicly accusing Moscow of trying to bolster its war effort by conscripting Cuban men and forcing them to fight against their will in Ukraine, a top Cuban official said Tuesday.\n\nAnd perhaps most tellingly, the Russian president is trying to double down on his alliance with North Korea – a pariah state sanctioned and shunned by most of the world’s nations – in an apparent attempt to get more ammunition and weapons for use in Ukraine, U.S. national security officials said.\n\n\"I think it says a lot that Russia is having to turn to a country like North Korea to seek to bolster its defense capacity in a war that it expected would be over in a week, that in September of 2023 it is going to North Korea to get munitions to try to continue to grind out on the battlefield in Ukraine,\" national security adviser Jake Sullivan said at a White House briefing Tuesday.\n\nA new post-Cold War alliance?\n\nRussia and North Korea have had a complicated and on-again off-again relationship in recent decades.\n\nBut there are indications that the two countries are forging a closer-than-ever alliance, in part because of Putin's need for help in Ukraine − and North Korea's need for influential allies in the region, according to U.S. officials and former top national security officials, including John Bolton and Anthony Ruggiero.\n\nDig deeper:Will Vladimir Putin keep his grip on power? Coup attempt dials up pressure over Ukraine war\n\nBoth countries are becoming increasingly isolated on the world’s geopolitical stage. In Russia's case, it is because of the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. North Korea has become more isolated because of its escalation in test-launching missile systems in violation of international treaties.\n\nLast July, Kim invited Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to a major military parade in the capital of Pyongyang while pledging to expand military cooperation between the two countries. Current and former U.S. officials and North Korea analysts say that would primarily involve North Korea filling a crucial void by supplying Russia with artillery and other ammunition.\n\nPutin has been reaching out to presumed allies and even neutral countries in an effort to replace ammunition that is being used up increasingly quickly since Ukraine launched a counteroffensive in June.\n\nIn recent weeks, Kim and Putin exchanged official letters discussing the possibility of North Korea sending more munitions to Russia to help in its war effort. And on Monday, The New York Times reported that Kim plans to travel to Vladivostok, Russia, to meet with Putin to discuss supplying Russia with more weapons.\n\nThe agreement would help both countries, according to Bolton, a former national security adviser in the Trump administration, and Ruggiero, senior director for North Korea and weapons proliferation issues on the White House National Security Council until 2021.\n\nPutin wants Kim to send Russia artillery shells and other materiel, including guided missiles designed to destroy heavily armored tanks, while Kim wants advanced nuclear and satellite technology to hit and destroy powered submarines, The Times said, citing unnamed U.S. officials.\n\nKim also is seeking food for North Korea’s 25 million people, who are suffering from severe food shortages. At least 60% of North Koreans live in extreme poverty, according to analysts.\n\nBoth leaders would be on the campus of Far Eastern Federal University in the Russian port city just north of North Korea for the Eastern Economic Forum, which is set to run Sept. 10 to 13, according to The Times and other media outlets. They said Kim also plans to visit Pier 33, where naval ships from Russia’s Pacific fleet dock.\n\nGrowing concern in Washington\n\nWhite House officials told USA TODAY they could not comment on The Times report or on the top-secret intelligence they have gathered on military cooperation talks between the North Korean and Russian leaders.\n\nSullivan told reporters the United States' visibility into the quality and quantity of the weapons North Korea could provide is \"somewhat constrained,\" but Washington will continue to look at the question carefully.\n\nBut National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement to USA TODAY that “as we have warned publicly, arms negotiations between Russia and the DPRK are actively advancing,” using the official name of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\nWatson said Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, traveled to North Korea in July “to try to convince Pyongyang to sell artillery ammunition to Russia.”\n\n“We have information that Kim Jong-Un expects these discussions to continue, to include leader-level diplomatic engagement in Russia,” Watson said. “We urge the DPRK to cease its arms negotiations with Russia and abide by the public commitments that Pyongyang has made to not provide or sell arms to Russia.”\n\nAfter Shoigu met with Kim in July, “another group of Russian officials traveled to Pyongyang for follow-on discussions about potential arms deals between the DPRK and Russia,\" White House spokesman John Kirby said last week. \"Following these negotiations, high-level discussions may continue in coming months.”\n\nKirby also said U.S. officials warned at the end of last year that North Korea had “delivered infantry rockets and missiles into Russia for use by Wagner,” Moscow’s paramilitary proxy group. Wagner was headed by former Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin until his death in a plane crash last month after mounting an aborted uprising against Putin.\n\nIn response, Kirby said, “We will continue to identify, expose, and counter Russian attempts to acquire military equipment from the DPRK or any other state that is prepared to support its war in Ukraine.”\n\nAn 'extraordinary' expenditure of ammunition\n\nIn an interview, Bolton – an expert on North Korea − said he wasn’t surprised by Putin’s overtures to Pyongyang for help in Ukraine.\n\n“The Russians are expending ammunition in this war in Ukraine at extraordinary rates,” Bolton said. “Of course, so are the Ukrainians.”\n\nThe difference is that a massive U.S.-led coalition has been helping Ukraine with ammunition, heavy weapons, tanks, missile systems and warplanes, while Russia has been forced to persuade allies and neutral countries to risk global isolation by helping Moscow, Bolton said.\n\nBolton also said it makes sense for Russia to seek military aid from North Korea, a fellow communist nation that uses similar, if not identical, Soviet-era weapons systems. “The artillery shells are interchangeable in most cases, and it's a perfectly logical place to go.”\n\nA burgeoning alliance between key U.S. adversaries\n\nThe weapons talks between North Korea and Russia are also likely to expand the broader alliance between the two U.S. adversaries.\n\n“We can see here a real looming kind of restoration of the Cold War blocs,” with Russia, North Korea and China all jockeying for position in a new anti-Western alliance, said Ingu Hwang, a Boston College professor, author and longtime expert on modern Korean history and Cold War East Asian diplomacy.\n\nEven if Kim doesn’t travel to meet Putin at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok next week, a summit is inevitable given the two nations’ diplomatic trajectory, Hwang told USA TODAY.\n\n“Even if it actually does not take place this month, we cannot and will not be surprised if it takes place in two months or three months,” Hwang said. “It’s very predictable.”\n\nMore:War would end within days if West stopped arming Ukraine, Russia says: Live updates\n\nRussia also is believed to have proposed that North Korea participate in three-way naval exercises with China, South Korean National Intelligence Service Director Kim Kyou-hyun said. That's according to The Associated Press, which cited a lawmaker who attended a closed-door briefing Monday with the head of South Korea's top spy agency.\n\nIn that meeting, the South Korean spy leader said he believed Shoigu, the Russian military chief, likely proposed including North Korea in the drills during his visit to Pyongyang in July.\n\nConscripted soldiers from Russia − and Cuba?\n\nOn Tuesday, the Cuban government issued a statement saying it had detected and “is working to neutralize and dismantle a human trafficking network that operates from Russia in order to incorporate Cuban citizens living there and even some living in Cuba, into the military forces that participate in military operations in Ukraine.”\n\nRussian officials had no immediate response to the charges, or to Cuba’s claims that those involved in the trafficking were trying to promote “distorted information that seeks to tarnish the country’s image and present it as an accomplice to these actions that we firmly reject.”\n\n“Attempts of this nature have been neutralized and criminal proceedings have been initiated against those involved in these activities,” according to the statement by the Cuban Foreign Ministry.\n\nLast year, Russia announced a plan to boost the size of its armed forces by more than a third, in part because of heavy casualties in the war in Ukraine.\n\nRuggiero said that North Korea has also sent conscripted workers to Russia to help in various civilian work projects, including the Sochi Olympics, and that it was a profit center for the Pyongyang government, which kept 90% of the wages paid to the workers by Moscow.\n\nSo far, Ruggiero said, there were no indications that Russia is using North Koreans in the war effort. But he said it probably plans to use them in rebuilding efforts in Ukraine if and when a cease-fire or end of hostilities is enacted.\n\n“I think that's another area that Russia will probably be interested in,” Ruggiero said. “And, of course, North Korea will be happy to do it. They’re already making hundreds of millions of dollars on this overseas labor front.”\n\nRecent Russian losses in Ukraine\n\nThere are also signs that Ukraine's oft-stalled counteroffensive is making progress, including eradicating Russia's network of trenches, minefields and underground tunnels.\n\nThe Kyiv government has confirmed it has captured a key village on the southern Zaporizhzhia front, which could allow it to seize more territory in the crucial overland route to Crimea. One photo published by Reuters shows an obliterated Russian tank on the side of the road near Robotyne last Friday.\n\nDeputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Monday that Ukrainian forces had liberated the village of Robotyne, bringing Ukraine into contact with Russia’s main defense line to the south covering routes to the Sea of Azov.\n\nMaliar said Russian occupation authorities are increasingly trying to crack down on the spread of pro-Ukrainian sentiment in contested areas, including through the use of planned and unannounced inspections and special propaganda campaigns, according to one translation on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nUkraine's progress there is relatively modest, Maliar said, but indicative of Kyiv's slow and steady progress since the start of its counteroffensive in June. \"Offensive is a long process, and war is long,\" she said, according to another English-language translation on X. \"Now we can see that our offensive is happening. For example, in one place certain milestones were passed, in another - the first line of defense. We move on.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/04/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-gop-desantis-pence/70286150007/", "title": "Trump praises Kim Jong Un; DeSantis, Pence and other GOP rivals ...", "text": "WASHINGTON − Republican presidential candidates and other GOP leaders shed their reluctance to criticize Donald Trump this weekend after the ex-president served up an unusual political issue: North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nTrump's praise of Kim for a new position with the World Health Organization drew attacks from Florida Gov.

Col. George Bivens said at a news conference.\n\nThe plane zeroed in on Cavalcante's location after a burglar alarm alerted authorities to his presence shortly after midnight. After waiting out a storm overnight, law enforcement closed in on the area early Wednesday.\n\n“They had the element of surprise,” Bivens said. “Cavalcante did not realize he was surrounded until that had occurred.”\n\nCavalcante, 34, tried to escape, crawling through thick underbrush with a rifle he stole from a homeowner earlier in the week, Bivens said. A search dog was released and “subdued him,” Bivens said, adding that Cavalcante sustained a “minor” dog bite and was “forcibly” taken into custody as he continued to resist.\n\nDeputy U.S. Marshal Robert Clark told The Associated Press the dog latched onto the fugitive's thigh, forcing him to submit. “He was probably in excruciating pain,” Clark said.\n\nA photo displayed at Wednesday's news conference shows Cavalcante, wearing long pants and a Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt, being held by uniformed authorities after his capture. Later, after he was arraigned on escape charges, Cavalcante was led out with his hands and bare feet shackled.\n\n“Our nightmare is finally over, and the good guys won,” Chester County District Attorney Deb Ryan said.\n\nCavalcante to be questioned, taken to state prison to serve life sentence\n\nBivens said Cavalcante was taken to the Avondale state police station to be questioned. He will ultimately be taken to a state correctional facility where he'll begin serving a life sentence after being convicted of murder last month.\n\nFootage from a local TV station showed law enforcement officials escorting Cavalcante, draped in a silver blanket, out of an armored vehicle and into the Avondale State Police Barracks on Wednesday at about 9:45 a.m.\n\nOnlookers got out of their cars, waving and watching from overpasses as a column of law enforcement vehicles took Cavalcante into custody.\n\nCavalcante escaped from Chester County Prison on Aug. 31 while he was awaiting transfer to a state facility to serve the life sentence for stabbing a former girlfriend, Deborah Brandao, in 2021. He also is wanted in a 2017 murder in his native Brazil.\n\nEmotional toll:The escaped prisoner Danelo Cavalcante was caught. Why the ordeal scared us so much.\n\nArrest caps intensive manhunt, several sightings\n\nThe fugitive's arrest ends a search involving about 500 officers who used dogs, helicopters and horses to scour dense woodlands across Chester County. Police most recently focused their pursuit on South Coventry Township in northern Chester County, roughly 20 miles north of the prison he escaped.\n\nOn Monday night, Cavalcante was spotted there several times, including when he walked into the open garage of a home in a rural area 40 miles northwest of Philadelphia, stole a rifle and fled as the homeowner shot at him several times with a pistol.\n\nAuthorities closed roads and released warnings urging residents to stay inside and lock their doors Tuesday. One local school district canceled classes twice this week. Two other school districts near Longwood Gardens, a popular tourist destination, closed twice last week after sightings of Cavalcante in the area.\n\nOfficers' celebratory photo with fugitive draws reproach\n\nAfter two intense weeks pursuing the elusive fugitive, several of the law enforcement agents involved in the effort celebrated his capture − too much in the eyes of some.\n\nMore than two dozen officers in tactical gear posed for a group photo with a handcuffed Cavalcante in front of them shortly after nabbing him, a move Bivens said he didn't object to but that drew rebukes from other sources, including fellow police.\n\n“It is not appropriate. It is not ethical. It’s really inhumane,” said Niles R. Wilson, a former police captain and now the senior director of law enforcement initiatives at the Center for Policing Equity. \"In my law enforcement experience I know how amped up police can get, but that’s not an excuse to mistreat someone.”\n\nThe Pennsylvania State Police forbids posting or forwarding images of state police investigations or operations, but it’s not clear whether simply taking the picture is covered by those rules. The moment of the photo was captured from a news helicopter by Philadelphia's KYW-TV.\n\nRegardless, Bivens said he was fine with it. “They’re proud of their work,” he said. “I’m not bothered at all by the fact that they took a photograph with him in custody.”\n\nPolice say they thwarted attempts to aid Cavalcante\n\nAt the news conference Wednesday, Bivens said there were people intent on helping the fugitive, but law enforcement was able to forestall the aid.\n\n“We had been successful to the best of my knowledge in preventing that assistance from reaching him,\" Bivens said.\n\nCavalcante illegally immigrated to the U.S. and found himself in Pennsylvania because he had family and friends there. Authorities have been tight-lipped about whether any of them cooperated with police or Cavalcante.\n\nCavalcante’s sister was arrested by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and could face deportation over \"some immigration issues,” Bivens has said. Clark, the deputy U.S. marshal, said Eleni Cavalcante gave police conflicting information while her brother was on the run.\n\n“We believe that she was trying to mislead law enforcement. And she quite possibly had the resources to aid her brother should he be able to get in contact,” Clark told AP. “We thought she needed to be taken out of the equation.”\n\nFamily of slain ex-girlfriend can 'sleep again'\n\nRyan said Brandao's family was relieved and thankful to law enforcement.\n\n“They can now finally sleep again,” Ryan said.\n\nRyan had said the family had been holed up in their house and terrified during the search for Cavalcante. USA TODAY has reached out to the family.\n\nDays before his escape, Cavalcante was sentenced to life in prison for stabbing Brandao in front of her 7-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son. Prosecutors say he killed her to stop her from telling police he was wanted for murder in Brazil. The jury took just 15 minutes to decide his guilt.\n\nCavalcante was in a relationship with Brandao for about a year and a half and \"engaged in a horrific pattern of domestic violence,\" Ryan said. He stabbed Brandao 38 times in broad daylight, she said.\n\n\"His depravity knows no bounds,\" she said the day of his escape.\n\nCavalcante unlikely to be deported to Brazil, where murder charge awaits\n\nCavalcante is accused of fatally shooting 20-year-old Válter Júnior Moreira dos Reis in November 2017 in the rural municipality of Figueiropolis over an alleged car repair debt, according to records by Brazilian prosecutors in the state of Tocantins. In records, Cavalcante’s first name is listed as “Danilo,” the more traditional Portuguese spelling.\n\nCavalcante fired several shots at Moreira dos Reis before taking his cellphone and fleeing in a truck, prosecutors said. U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement confirmed Cavalcante entered the country illegally.\n\nRafael Pinto Alamy, a homicide prosecutor on the case, told USA TODAY the case was suspended because Cavalcante fled Brazil. Cavalcante remained a fugitive with a warrant for his arrest issued days after the killing.\n\nPinto Alamy also confirmed the case has a hearing on Oct. 11 in Gurupi, Tocantins, but said Cavalcante is unlikely to be sent back to his home country if convicted of the 2017 murder because he would face a lesser punishment to the life imprisonment he has been sentenced to in the U.S.\n\nPeople accused of crimes in Brazil can still be charged even if they aren't in the country, Marcio Santoro, a federal judge in Rio de Janeiro state, told USA TODAY. The person could appear virtually before a judge and be entitled to a public defender. However, life in prison without parole remains a foreign concept in Brazil, a predominantly Catholic country that maintains concepts of forgiveness, Santoro added.\n\n\"We're happy Danilo has been judged there in the United States,'' Moreira dos Reis' sister, Dayane, told USA TODAY. \"Here there's no justice, there's no law!\"\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas and Will Carless\n\nFugitive's presence 'traumatizing' for community\n\nCarla Moliterno, 53, lives in an apartment building a couple hundred yards from where Cavalcante was found. Her community had been locked down since Monday, her road closed and her daughter’s school shuttered.\n\nMoliterno bolted a window closed in her apartment because it was over a small roof − she feared the fugitive would climb up and try to enter the apartment. She would not let her daughter go out on their deck for fear she would be shot. They remained huddled in the apartment, Moliterno sleeping in her living room because it is closer to her daughter’s bedroom.\n\n“We had constant police activity out front and constant police helicopters overhead,” Moliterno said. “This morning I was thinking, ‘I can’t do this one more day.'”\n\nHours later, a text came in saying Cavalcante had been captured.\n\n“It was all very traumatizing,” Moliterno said. “There were many tears when it finally ended. I think I might sleep for a month tonight.”\n\n− John Bacon\n\nHow Cavalcante escaped from prison\n\nCavalcante broke free by \"crab-walking'' his way up two walls in the exercise yard, breaking through razor wire and running across a roof. A watch tower officer, who has since been fired, didn't see him slip away.\n\nSecurity footage shows the moment at about 8:50 a.m. on Aug. 31 when Cavalcante used his outstretched arms and legs to brace himself between the walls and \"crab walk\" up before disappearing.\n\nIt was the second escape from the facility in recent months.\n\nIn May, inmate Igor Bolte broke out from the same location in a similar way but was seen by the tower officer on watch and quickly recaptured. Cavalcante's escape differed in two important ways: He had to get through razor wire that was added after Bolte's escape, and nobody saw him do it.\n\nCavalcante's disappearance was discovered nearly an hour later during an inmate count after the block returned from the yard.\n\nPrison officials have since pledged to increase staff and install a fence to close the space above the prison yard wall that Bolte and Cavalcante scaled.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/08/danelo-cavalcante-escape-timeline/70795355007/", "title": "Danelo Cavalcante news timeline: What led to prisoner's capture?", "text": "A convicted murderer's escape from a Pennsylvania prison Aug. 31 triggered a massive manhunt that finally came to an end Wednesday after the man eluded capture for nearly two weeks.\n\nHundreds of law enforcement agents descended in the past couple weeks on small suburban communities in southeastern Pennsylvania intent on the capture of convicted murderer, 34-year-old Danelo Cavalcante. But for days, helicopters, drones and dogs searching an ever-shifting perimeter could not get the fugitive back behind bars.\n\nHere’s a timeline of what we know of Cavalcante's escape and subsequent manhunt.\n\nCavalcante has eluded police for days:What will it take for him to get caught?\n\nAugust 2023: Cavalcante sentenced to life in prison after 2021 killing\n\nCavalcante faces life behind bars after he was convicted last month of murdering his former girlfriend in front of her two young children.\n\nIt took a jury 15 minutes of deliberation before returning a guilty verdict against Cavalcante for stabbing 33-year-old Deborah Brandao to death in 2021 while her 7-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son were present, according to the Chester County District Attorney’s Office.\n\nIn April 2021, Cavalcante went to Brandao’s home, about 30 miles northwest of Philadelphia, and stabbed her 38 times. The two dated for about a year-and-a-half, during which time Cavalcante had \"engaged in a horrific pattern of domestic violence,\" District Attorney Deb Ryan has said.\n\nCavalcante, a Brazilian national and former agricultural worker, is also wanted for a 2017 murder of a 20-year-old man over a car repair debt in his native country, the district attorney's office has said. Investigators learned that Cavalcante fatally stabbed Brandao because she had learned about his open murder warrant in Brazil and had “threatened to expose him to the police,” according to the district attorney's office.\n\nWhen he escaped, Cavalcante was being temporarily held at Chester County Prison, about 25 miles west of Philadelphia, while awaiting transfer to a state facility to serve his sentence.\n\nMore:Prison escapes are rare, and most are soon caught\n\nAug. 31 around 9 a.m.: Cavalcante escapes\n\nCavalcante made his escape around 9 a.m. on Thursday, Aug. 31. His disappearance prompted an immediate search of the area as police and prison authorities deployed helicopters and dogs to locate the fugitive.\n\nAt the time, authorities said Cavalcante was last seen wearing a white T-shirt, grey shorts and white sneakers. A witness also initially spotted him almost an hour after his escape walking on Wawaset Road in nearby Pocopson Township.\n\nRyan had said early on that officials were concerned Cavalcante may get help from friends and family. The concern sprang from the fact that after Cavalcante murdered his girlfriend in April 2021, he was aided by others until he was apprehended in Virginia, authorities have said.\n\nLaw enforcement made it clear from the beginning that Cavalcante is considered extremely dangerous and that anyone who spots him should refrain from approaching him and call 911.\n\nSept. 1: U.S. Marshals join the hunt\n\nAt a press conference Friday, Sept. 1, it was announced that the United States Marshals Service was joining the search.\n\nAt the time, Ryan said officials no longer believed anyone to be helping Cavalcante evade authorities, and that the assumption was that he was hiding alone in the area. Ryan said Cavalcante has “nothing to lose,” and he could be capable of more dangerous crimes.\n\nLabor Day Weekend: Cavalcante spotted multiple times\n\nThe manhunt soon brought hundreds of law enforcement officers to southeastern Pennsylvania, disrupting the lives of thousands of residents, many of whom remain on edge about the fugitive's whereabouts.\n\nOn Monday, Sept. 4, the hunt for the Cavalcante led officials to scour a small area near the prison where they believed the fugitive was hiding.\n\nPolice initially set up a perimeter around Pocopson Township, a residential neighborhood near the Chester County Prison, where Cavalcante had been sighted multiple times over Labor Day weekend. A state trooper even spotted the fugitive, leading to a brief chase.\n\nJust after midnight on Saturday, Sept. 2, a residential surveillance camera captured Cavalcante about a mile and a half from the prison with a backpack, according to the Chester County District Attorney's Office.\n\nAnother resident reportedly saw Cavalcante in a creek bed behind their house in Pennsbury Township, a residential area several miles east of a popular botanic garden called Longwood Gardens.\n\nSept. 4 at 8:21 p.m.: Cavalcante seen on trail cam\n\nIn fact, Cavalcante was seen on Monday, Sept. 4 on a trail camera at Longwood Gardens, a popular tourist destination of about 200 acres of rolling meadows and brimming gardens. The gardens' private trail camera captured the most recent images of Cavalcante, in which he has a backpack, duffel bag and a hoodie.\n\nSecurity at Longwood Gardens notified investigators that a private camera showed Cavalcante walking north around 8:21 p.m. and then south through the same location at 9:33 p.m., Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens previously said.\n\nSept. 5: Search shifts south\n\nThe sighting prompted officials on Tuesday, Sept. 5 to shift the search perimeter south of the initial target zone.\n\nFrom speakers in cars and helicopters, authorities have blasted a recording they obtained from Cavalcante’s mother in Portuguese, asking her son “to surrender peacefully.\"\n\nAs the search unfolded, the family of Brandao, the woman slain by Cavalcante, has been barricaded inside their homes under constant protection in case the fugitive decides to come after them.\n\nSept. 6: Released security footage shows escape\n\nOn Wednesday, Sept. 6, officials released security footage that showed Cavalcante breaking free by \"crab-walking\" up a wall before he reportedly pushed through razor wire and ran across a roof to freedom.\n\nThe escape was revealed to have taken place while his prisoner block was outside in the exercise yard. An officer in a tower who didn't see him slip away has been put on administrative leave, Chester County Prison Howard Holland previously said.\n\nThe footage begins at about 8:50 a.m. when Cavalcante used his outstretched arms and legs to brace himself between two walls and \"crab walk\" up before disappearing out of sight. From there, he pushed through razor wire, ran across the roof, and scaled a fence lined with razor wire, Holland said.\n\nCavalcante's disappearance was discovered nearly an hour later during an inmate count after the block returned from the yard. Holland has said officials determined that the razor wire was insufficient as planning is underway to better secure the prison with physical barriers and increased staff.\n\nGeorgia:After body slamming student during arrest, Georgia school police chief placed on leave\n\nSept. 7: Search crews battle heat, humidity\n\nThroughout the week, the heat and humidity was posing challenges for the searchers, who Bivens said were dedicated to capturing Cavalcante as they hoped he grew tired, hungry and desperate.\n\nAs temperatures reached 94 degrees Thursday, Sept. 7 the hundreds of law enforcement officials combing through the search perimeter were bogged down in not only full uniforms and weapons, but bullet-resistant vests.\n\nThe heat even got to the technology being used to track Cavalcante, Bivens said. For example, it was possible that thermal imaging might pick up additional hot spots, though Bivens assured said it wasn't a deterrent to using the resources.\n\nMeanwhile, the two school districts that had canceled classes Sept. 5 and 6 − Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County and the Unionville-Chadds Ford School District − largely reopened on Sept. 7.\n\nBoth districts said local law enforcement will provide additional security and that they are excusing absences of students whose families prefer to keep them home.\n\nWhat we know about Ta'Kiya Young:A pregnant Ohio mother's death by police sparked outrage\n\nSept. 9: Cavalcante steals van\n\nAs the search stretched into its second week, Cavalcante somehow managed to sneak past the police perimeter during the weekend, stealing a van and changing his appearance.\n\nOfficials announced at a press conference Sunday, Sept. 10 that Cavalcante had stolen a 2020 Ford Transit van the previous night outside the search perimeter before traveling further to the home of an acquaintance he'd known several years ago. Cavalcante unsuccessfully attempted to speak to the person through his doorbell security system, which captured the fugitive's new clean-shaven face, Bivens said.\n\nCavalcante was also dressed in a dark-billed baseball cap and green hooded sweatshirt in photos released by authorities.\n\nThe sighting means the search has now shifted to the area where the stolen van was found abandoned and empty of gas in a field behind a barn farther west in West Nantmeal Township, a rural area in northern Chester County.\n\nSept. 12: Cavalcante arms himself with stolen gun\n\nCavalcante reportedly stole a .22 rifle with a mounted flashlight and scope from the garage of a Chester County homeowner, Bivens announced Tuesday, Sept. 12.\n\nThe owner of the house in South Coventry Township, a rural area in northern Chester County, fired a pistol when he saw Cavalcante, though Bivens said there's no evidence to suggest the fugitive was injured.\n\nThe homeowner called police, who arrived within minutes to find Cavalcante gone. However, near the house, law enforcement found a green sweatshirt and white T-shirt matching the clothing Cavalcante was recently seen wearing.\n\nAuthorities urged nearby residents to stay inside and lock their doors. At least one school district has closed after the latest report.\n\nSept. 13: Cavalcante captured\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the Pennsylvania State Police wrote on social media that Cavalcante was captured.\n\nThe agency said further details would be released at news conference.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Col. George Bivens said.\n\nOfficials have said they hope the pressure being put on Cavalcante through the exhaustive search will cause him to make a mistake, leading to his capture, especially as he grows tired, hungry and desperate.\n\n\"I'm quite confident that we're wearing him down,\" Bivens said.\n\nMeanwhile, the heat and humidity was posing challenges for the searchers, who Bivens said were dedicated to the hunt.\n\nCavalcante, a Brazilian national and former agricultural worker, is considered extremely dangerous by authorities. In August, he was sentenced to life in prison for brutally stabbing his former girlfriend Deborah Brandao in front of her two young children. He is also wanted in connection with a murder in Brazil.\n\nBrandao's family has been \"barricaded\" inside their homes during the search and are under protection, District Attorney Deborah Ryan said Thursday.\n\n\"They are terrified,\" Ryan said.\n\nBrandao's sister, Sarah Brandao, told CNN she is caring for the two children and is afraid Cavalcante could come after their family. USA TODAY has reached out to Brandao's family.\n\n\"I haven't slept for many days,\" Sarah Brandao told CNN. \"I have been waking up with fright at night.\"\n\nThe combined total reward for information leading to Cavalcante’s capture is at $20,000 as of Wednesday.\n\n\"We are not going any place until we have him in custody,\" Bivens said. \"We will continue the manhunt.\"\n\nSearch crews are battling heat, humidity in manhunt\n\nThe hundreds of law enforcement officials combing through the search perimeter were bogged down in bullet-resistant vests, full uniforms and weapons while the temperature got up to 94 degrees with humidity making it feel like 103 on Thursday, according to AccuWeather.\n\nSearchers are taking water breaks as necessary and morale is high, Bivens said Thursday.\n\n\"I have not heard a single complaint,\" he said. \"I believe our people are up to the task.\"\n\nBivens said even the technology being used to try and track Cavalcante is being impacted by heat. For example, thermal imaging might pick up additional hot spots that require searchers to \"check a few more things,\" but said it wasn't a deterrent to using the resources.\n\nSchools, Longwood Gardens reopen after most recent perimeter shift\n\nWith the changing area of focus, the two school districts that canceled classes Tuesday and Wednesday largely reopened on Thursday.\n\nKennett Consolidated School District in Chester County reopened all its schools except for one elementary school that remains in the new perimeter. The Unionville-Chadds Ford School District reopened all its schools.\n\nBoth districts said local law enforcement will provide additional security and that they are excusing absences of students whose families prefer to keep them home.\n\n\"We appreciate the impact of prolonged stress and know that normalcy is needed,\" read a statement from John Sanville, superintendent of the Unionville-Chadds Ford School District, to parents. \"We share your hopes that the prisoner is captured today.\"\n\nLongwood Gardens, a popular tourist destination of about 200 acres of rolling meadows and expansive vistas, partially reopened Thursday after the police perimeter shifted eastward. The most recent images of Cavalcante, in which he has a backpack, duffel bag and a hoodie, were shot by a private trail camera at the botanical gardens Monday night.\n\nVideo shows Cavalcante's escape\n\nAn officer in a tower missed Cavalcante's stealthy walk up the wall the morning of Aug. 31 while his prison block was outside in the exercise yard, Howard Holland, acting warden of Chester County Prison, said at a news conference Wednesday.\n\nThe guard officer in the tower has been put on administrative leave, Holland said.\n\nSecurity footage shows the moment at about 8:50 a.m. that Cavalcante used his outstretched arms and legs to brace himself between two walls and \"crab-walk\" up before disappearing out of sight. From there, he pushed through razor wire, ran across the roof and scaled a fence lined with more razor wire, Holland said.\n\nIt's the second escape from the facility in recent months. In May, inmate Igor Bolte broke out from the same location in a similar way but was seen by the tower officer on watch and was quickly recaptured. Cavalcante's escape differed in two important ways: He had to get through new razor wire that was added after Bolte's escape and nobody saw him flee.\n\nCavalcante's disappearance was discovered nearly an hour later during an inmate count after the block returned from the yard.\n\nHolland said officials now realize the razor wire wasn't enough, and are working on plans to better secure the prison through physical barriers and increased staff. Instead of a fence with an open top, Holland said engineers are working on a plan to enclose fencing to make it more like a cage that can't be scaled.\n\n“While we believed the security measures we had in place were sufficient, they have proven otherwise,” Holland said.\n\nCavalcante killed ex-girlfriend to silence her about Brazil murder\n\nIn April 2021, Cavalcante went to Brandao’s Schuylkill Township home, about 30 miles northwest of Philadelphia, and stabbed her 38 times, killing the woman in front of her 4- and 7-year-old children, according to the Chester County District Attorney’s Office. The two dated for about a year-and-a-half.\n\nParamedics rushed Brandao to a nearby hospital, where she was soon pronounced dead.\n\nWith the help of others, Cavalcante fled but was eventually tracked down and arrested in Virginia.\n\nIn multiple domestic violence attacks, Calvalcante had previously “threatened to kill” Brandao, investigators found. They said Cavalcante fatally stabbed Brandao because she had learned about his open murder warrant in Brazil and had “threatened to expose him to the police,” according to the DA’s office.\n\nRafael Pinto Alamy, a homicide prosecutor in the Brazilian state of Tocantins, previously told USA TODAY that Cavalcante is accused of fatally shooting Válter Júnior Moreira dos Reis on Nov. 5, 2017, in the rural municipality of Figueiropolis.\n\nThe killing allegedly occurred over a car repair debt Moreira dos Reis, a 20-year-old-student, owed to Cavalcante, the Tocantins public ministry said in an email.\n\nThe case was suspended when Cavalcante fled to the United States, Pinto Alamy previously said. He added that Cavalcante, whose first name is listed as \"Danilo\" in his native country's records, lived on a farm and was an agricultural worker in Brazil.\n\nCavalcante first went to Puerto Rico, where he got a fake ID, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. He eventually moved to Chester County in southeast Pennsylvania because he had a sister and friends who were living in the area, the outlet reported.\n\nCavalcante most recently lived in Royersford, a small town 32 miles northwest of Philadelphia, according to court records.\n\nContributing: Eduardo Cuevas", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/05/danelo-cavalcante-prison-escape-chester-county-search/70763712007/", "title": "Pennsylvania manhunt for escaped killer Danelo Cavalcante ...", "text": "The search for convicted killer Danelo Cavalcante who fled a Pennsylvania prison intensified Tuesday on its sixth day after a new sighting was captured on a trail camera at a popular botanic garden.\n\nTwo nearby school districts canceled classes. Officials urged local residents to be wary and keep homes and cars locked, and police broadcast a plea for surrender from the convict's mother.\n\nA massive dragnet initially focused on an area within a 2-mile perimeter largely around Pocopson Township, a residential neighborhood near the Chester County Prison. Officials on Tuesday expanded the perimeter to encompass an area south of the small town because it appeared Cavalcante had traveled farther away.\n\nCavalcante, 34, escaped from of the Chester County Prison on Thursday, about 25 miles from Philadelphia, where he was waiting to be sent to a state facility. His escape comes a week after Cavalcante was sentenced to life in prison without parole for fatally stabbing his ex-girlfriend, Deborah Brandao, in front of her children. He's also wanted in connection with a 2017 murder in his native Brazil.\n\nSecurity at Longwood Gardens notified investigators that a private camera on Monday captured Cavalcante walking north around 8:21 p.m. and then south through the same location at 9:33 p.m., Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said during a news conference Tuesday morning. The gardens, about 200 acres of rolling meadows, brimming gardens and winding paths, is usually packed with visitors but has closed during the search for the escaped inmate, WFMZ reported.\n\nThe photos show that Cavalcante obtained a backpack, a duffel bag, \"clothing and other items,\" Bivens said.\n\nBecause of the expanded perimeter, the Unionville-Chadds Ford School District and the Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County canceled classes for Tuesday.\n\n“That pressure that we’ve been putting on him is working,” Bivens said. “We squeezed him hard enough over a period of a few days and he was not able to get any relief, and (he) managed to find a place to get out.”\n\n“Obviously I wish we would have been able to capture him without him getting through that perimeter, but it's also not shocking,” he added. “It’s dark, it’s a large area. Not to make excuses, it’s just difficult terrain.”\n\nSuspected Cavalcante sightings\n\nThere have been five credible sightings of Cavalcante from witnesses since he fled the prison, including one instance in which a state trooper briefly chased him but was unable to capture the fugitive.\n\nLocal Pocopson Township resident Ryan Drummond told WPVI he believes Cavalcante got into his home and stole food late Friday night. Drummond told the outlet he got up after hearing a noise downstairs and, from his upstairs landing, watched a man matching Cavalcante's description walk out of the house.\n\nBy the time police arrived, the man was gone into the thick brush, Drummond told WPVI.\n\n\"Peaches, apples, green snap peas were missing,\" he said. \"We have a bunch of little steak knives and he could have taken one of those.\"\n\nJust after midnight on Saturday, Cavalcante was seen on a residential surveillance camera about a mile and a half from the prison with a backpack, according to the Chester County District Attorney's Office.\n\nCavalcante's mother aids authorities\n\nFrom speakers in cars and helicopters, authorities have blasted a recording they obtained from Cavalcante’s mother in Portuguese, asking her son “to surrender peacefully,” Bivens said.\n\nBivens urged local residents to familiarize themselves with Cavalcade's appearance, lock their doors, monitor their home security systems and check on their neighbors.\n\n\"You’re dealing with someone who is desperate and doesn’t want to be caught,” Bivens said. “If he can find some shelter, if he can find some food, he’s going to take advantage of whatever he finds.”\n\nA reward of up to $10,000 is being offered for any information that leads to Cavalcante's capture.\n\nHow exactly Cavalcante managed to escape the Chester County Prison remains unknown. A joint investigation into the matter is being handled by the Chester County District Attorney's Office and Pennsylvania State Police.\n\n'We miss normal'\n\nEileen Blass, a former USA TODAY photographer who lives about two miles from the prison, said the presence of law enforcement in her neighborhood over recent days has been constant.\n\nFrom her home in Pennsbury Township, she’s heard and seen police helicopters, drones and security checkpoints up and down the road she lives on.\n\nAccording to the Chester County District Attorney's Office, hundreds of law enforcement officers are involved in the manhunt. Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Customs and Border Protection were deployed on Monday to help in the search.\n\nBlass is one of many people within a 3-mile radius of the camera that captured Cavalcante on Monday night to receive a reverse 911 text notifying them that the search area had stretched farther south and encompassed Longwood Gardens.\n\n“We miss normal,” she said in an email.\n\nContributing: Ken Alltucker, USA Today; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/08/danelo-cavalcante-chester-county-prison-escape-khalife-haynes/70793518007/", "title": "Prison escapees elude police without violence. Will they be caught?", "text": "Though three prisoners managed to escape custody in the last two weeks, the odds of maintaining their freedom are overwhelmingly against them, an expert says.\n\nDanelo Cavalcante, imprisoned for killing his ex-girlfriend Deborah Brandao in front of her two children, has eluded hundreds of law enforcement agents who've bore down on small suburban communities in southeastern Pennsylvania. Cavalcante, 34, escaped the Chester County Prison by, in part, crab-walking up a wall, passing over a roof and blasting through razor wire on Aug. 31. A guard responsible for keeping watch that day has been fired, officials said Friday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Daniel Abed Khalife – a former British soldier awaiting trial on charges of planting fake bombs, and accused of attempting to leak information to Iran – snuck out of a London prison, sparking a country-wide manhunt. Khalife, 21, got out by allegedly strapping himself to the bottom of a food delivery truck.\n\nThe same day as Khalife's escape, a homicide suspect and hospital patient in Washington D.C., Christopher Haynes, fled from George Washington University Hospital.\n\nAll three men remained at large early Friday.\n\nHow long a fugitive can evade capture can depend on how much planning went into their escape, said Anthony Cangelosi, an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former U.S. Marshal and Secret Service agent.\n\nIf they put a significant amount of time into the plan, they are usually motivated to not get caught.\n\nIn Cavalcante’s case, his motivation to escape was high, Cangelosi said; he’d just been sentenced to life in prison without parole and he was pending transfer to a state prison.\n\n“You have a very desperate individual there. He doesn’t want to spend the rest of his life in jail, and he’ll probably take extreme measures to get away,” Cangelosi said. “I wouldn’t think this guy’s going to surrender easily.”\n\nFugitive manhunts sometimes end in suicide, violence if the fugitive uses force to steal a car, or a confrontation with law enforcement could lead to the escapee's death, Cangelosi said.\n\n“In the Marshal Service, they teach in the Academy, every prisoner thinks about escape at some time or another, particularly if they’re doing a significant amount of time,” he said. “Whether or not they go through with the plan is another story, but they think about it – they’ve got a lot of time on their hands.”\n\nPrison breaks relatively rare\n\nResearch on prison escapes is scarce. However, one study published in 2016 analyzed over 500 prison escapes in 2009 and discovered the wide majority of escapees, over 92%, were captured. And most of them, research shows, fled low-security facilities seemingly on a whim – making the escapes of Cavalcante and Khalife standouts.\n\nBryce Peterson, the researcher whose team conducted the report, previously told USA TODAY prison escapes, while uncommon in general, usually happen in low-security and locally-run facilities. In many cases, offenders may simply walk away, or don’t return if they’re out on a work release.\n\n“That happens much more frequently than people breaking out of a facility, overcoming a barrier, overcoming a guard,” said Peterson, an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and senior research scientist at the CNA Center for Justice Research and Innovation.\n\nIt is, however, hard to estimate how many prison breaks happen in the U.S. because there’s no comprehensive national data on them, he said.\n\nViolence by escapees is uncommon\n\nPeterson said in his research, less than 9% of escapees used violence in the community. He added one caveat: the more motivated someone is to stay out, the more likely they are to use violence.\n\nCavalcante's pending transfer to a state facility could have been a “catalyst event” prompting his escape, which Peterson said makes him more motivated to not get caught.\n\n“The two things that are important are: It’s unlikely he will use violence – not to say it can’t happen,” Peterson said. “Almost always in these situations … people are going to get caught.”\n\nHunt for Cavalcante enters day 9\n\nCavalcante's escape has raised criticism about the prison’s security considering Cavalcante used the same route as another inmate, Igor Bolte, who escaped the facility in May before being caught just minutes later when a guard saw him fleeing.\n\nCavalcante's method of escape differed in key ways from the other prisoner: He pushed through razor wire that was added after the first escape, and a guard on watch in a tower didn't see him do it.\n\nThe 18-year-veteran of the Chester County Prison was fired Thursday, county spokesperson Michelle Bjork told the Associated Press, adding that he violated protocol by having his personal cell phone on him at the time of the escape. Cavalcante was gone for nearly an hour before his absence was noticed during a head count.\n\nChester County Prison officials did not immediately return USA TODAY's request for comment on Friday about the criticism they face.\n\nAt a press conference Thursday afternoon, authorities said Cavalcante was last spotted just east of the Longwood Gardens – a popular attraction in Chester County. This is the second sighting for the escaped prisoner near the attraction, who was also seen on trail footage at the garden on Monday.\n\nThe perimeter of the exhaustive manhunt has shifted over the last week as residents and, in one case, law enforcement report sightings. The search has brought hundreds of law enforcement officers to southeastern Pennsylvania, disrupting the lives of thousands of residents. Business has slowed and two school districts canceled classes for two days before partially reopening Thursday.\n\nThe reward for information leading to Cavalcante’s arrest is up to $20,000, as of Wednesday.\n\nCavalcante, a Brazilian native, illegally immigrated to the United States after a warrant was issued in Brazil for his arrest in connection with a 2017 murder. The fugitive was at Chester County prison temporarily awaiting transfer to a state facility when he fled.\n\nA former agricultural worker, Cavalcante is considered to be extremely dangerous. Officials have been authorized to use deadly force against Cavalcante if he is seen and does not surrender, Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens has said.\n\nCangelosi said investigators are probably looking into Cavalcante’s history to figure out who could potentially help him. They will likely check prison records to see who visited him recently and who had phone conversations with him.\n\nThey would likely visit those people and see if they knew anything about his whereabouts, he said.\n\nPrisoner strapped himself under delivery truck\n\nAuthorities did not know how Khalife managed to escaped the Wandsworth prison until, when searching a food delivery truck, they discovered strapping underneath it, according to a statement from Alex Chalk, British secretary of state for justice.\n\nSince the escape, police in London began searching Richmond Park, the largest of the city's Royal Parks, near the last location of the van that Khalife used to break out of prison.\n\nKhalife, a former soldier stationed at MOD Stafford military base, is believed to have attempted to provide information to Iran, the BBC reported. He was awaiting trial on terror charges for sparking a false threat of an attack by planting fake bombs on the base. Khalife allegedly placed three canisters with wires on the base, simulating a bomb, according to court documents viewed by Al Jazeera.\n\nPolice have dispatched a special team to track down Khalife and have asked the public to inform them immediately if they see him.\n\n“I am urgently appealing to the public to help us find Daniel Khalife, who could be at large anywhere in the U.K.,” said Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Commander Dominic Murphy in a statement posted to X, formerly know as Twitter, on Wednesday.\n\nMurder suspect flees university hospital\n\nHaynes was arrested on Wednesday in Virginia on a warrant related to a D.C. area homicide from August, according to a news release from the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nWhen he was being processed, Haynes complained about ankle pain from a pre-existing injury and was taken to George Washington University Hospital for treatment.\n\nWhile an officer was changing out his handcuffs, Haynes \"physically assaulted the officer and fled from the hospital,\" according to police. Two officers chased after him but were unable to capture him. George Washington University was under a shelter-in-place order through the evening.\n\nPolice released video of Haynes from a resident's security camera showing the murder suspect without shoes. Black handcuffs were hanging from his right wrist.\n\nThe combined total rewards for information leading to Haynes' capture was at $25,000, as of Thursday.\n\nHaynes' Wednesday arrest was in connection with a homicide that occurred in the neighborhood of Northeast Washington on Aug. 12. According to the Washington Post, two men were shot: Brent Hayward, 33, was pronounced dead at the scene, and the other was taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries.\n\nContributing: Cybele Mayes-Osterman, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2023/07/10/michael-c-burham-prison-inmate-escape-warren-county-pa-survivalist-investigation-kala-hodgkin/70397272007/", "title": "'Survivalist' Michael Burham remains on run after prison escape", "text": "WARREN, Pa. ― The latest on the search for escaped inmate Michael C. Burham in northwestern Pennsylvania. Return for updates:\n\nEarlier\n\nThe search for escaped inmate Michael C. Burham will stretch into its sixth day Wednesday, as state, federal and local police agencies continue to comb Warren County and areas of the nearby Allegheny National Forest for the homicide suspect and kidnapping defendant whom authorities described as a \"self-taught survivalist with military training.\"\n\nState police late Tuesday afternoon said troopers continue to follow up on leads to try to find the 34-year-old Burham, who escaped from the Warren County Prison in downtown Warren late Thursday night.\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday in Warren, Lt. Col. George Bivens, deputy commissioner of operations for the Pennsylvania State Police, said some of those leads included possible sightings Monday night and the breaking-in of unoccupied and unsecured structures or cabins in the national forest.\n\n\"It appears there may have been entry at some point in time in the past,\" Bivens said, referencing public and private cabins and structures associated with oil and gas wells in the forest.\n\n\"Some of these structures are not checked on very often and so the fact that we find one that it appears someone may have been in there, doesn't necessarily mean it was Burham,\" he added. \"That's where we use additional steps to try and determine whether it may have been or not.\"\n\nBivens said none of the possible sightings of Burham have \"panned out.\"\n\nHe added that police continue to find items connected to Burham that indicate he remains in the \"general area,\" which he defined as northwestern Pennsylvania. Bivens declined to identify those items.\n\nBivens reiterated that Burham should be considered armed and dangerous, and that Burham has been able to get a hold of firearms before and is likely to do so while on the run.\n\nBurham is accused of escaping by climbing on a pullup exercise machine in the prison recreation yard, getting on to a roof and then sliding off the prison roof with a rope made of bedsheets tied together, as the Erie Times-News has reported.\n\nBurham is from Russell, near Warren, and is still believed to be in the area of Warren County, east of Erie County. State police said searchers are using police dogs, drones and helicopters.\n\nHow dangerous is Michael Burham?\n\nBurham is wanted in connection with the May 11 fatal shooting of Kala Hodgkin, 34, of Jamestown, in Chautauqua County, New York, north of Warren. Though he has yet to be charged in that case, Burham is a \"prime suspect\" in the killing, the U.S. Marshals Service said. At the time of Hodgkin's death, Burham was wanted a charge that he had raped her, according to court records.\n\nBurham fled the area after Hodgkin's death. He is accused of kidnapping an elderly couple in Sheffield, in Warren County, on May 20, and stealing their SUV, which he used to drive to South Carolina. He was captured there on May 24 after a multi-agency manhunt. The couple was found unharmed in a cemetery in South Carolina.\n\nBurham was eventually returned to Warren. He was placed in the Warren County Prison on $1 million bond on June 19.\n\n\"Burham is a self-taught survivalist with military training and could potentially be holed up in a wooded area,\" state police said in a news release. \"He is to be considered armed and dangerous and we are asking the public not to approach.\"\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service, which is assisting the state police, said \"Burham has an extensive and violent criminal history and should be considered armed and dangerous.\"\n\nWhere might Michael Burham be?\n\nState police have indicated the search of Burham has stretched into the Allegheny National Forest. Stockpiles and small campsites believed to be connected to Burham have been in the area, police also said, without offering specifics.\n\n\"I don't want him to know what we have found or haven't found,\" Bivens said on Monday.\n\nBurham was last known to be wearing a prison-issued denim jacket, an orange-striped jumpsuit and orange Croc-style shoes, \"but it it possible for him to have changed clothing,\" state police said. He is 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighs 160 pounds, has brown hair and brown eyes and has a tattoo of a tiger on his right arm.\n\nHave any rewards been offered in the search for Michael Burham?\n\nState police urge those with information on Burham to call the state police command post at 717-265-9650. The public can also call the state police barracks in Warren at 814-728-3600.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service is offering a reward of up to $7,500 for information that helps lead to Burham's capture. Warren County Crime Stoppers is offering another $2,000. Pennsylvania Crime Stoppers added an additional $10,000 for a total reward of $19,500, and Bivens said on Thursday that the Marshals Service had also added to the award, bringing the new total to $22,000.\n\nAccording to the Marshals Service, other agencies involved in the manhunt for Burham include the city of Warren police, Warren County Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Border Patrol, Warren County sheriff, Chautauqua County sheriff, Jamestown Police, Bradford police and the Pennsylvania Game Commission.\n\nStaff writer Tim Hahn contributed to this report.\n\nContact Ed Palattella at epalattella@timesnews.com.

The resident was in his garage when Cavalcante grabbed the firearm. Despite the resident being several feet away and shooting at the escapee, the 34-year-old was not hurt.\n\nYet Cavalcante's luck ran out on Wednesday as police closed in, largely thanks to thermal imaging. A photo of his capture showed him wearing an Eagles sweatshirt and muddied and wet.\n\n\"They were able to move in very quietly they had the element of surprise,\" said Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens. \"Cavalcante did not realize he was surrounded until that had occurred.\"\n\nA TIMELINE OF THE ESCAPE AND CAPTURE:Danelo Cavalcante has been captured. A look at the weeks leading up to it\n\nCavalcante was arraigned that same morning with the charge of escape. He has a preliminary hearing scheduled for 9 a.m. on Sept. 27.\n\nWhere was he found?\n\nCavalcante was located near a large pile of logs at a John Deere store along Route 100 in South Coventry Township in northern Chester County around 8:15 a.m. Police said they had narrowed in on his location overnight but waited until dawn to arrest him.\n\nHe was within a perimeter law enforcement had set up Tuesday following several sightings of him Monday night.\n\nWhat led to his capture?\n\nThe cooler temperatures Tuesday night into Wednesday likely aided in Cavalcante's capture. Police had been using thermal, infrared mapping technology to track the man, but said that last week's scorching weather had interfered with it.\n\nBivens said the events leading to the capture began just after midnight Tuesday into Wednesday, when a residential alarm was triggered.\n\nWhile he was not found there, Bivens said, it \"started to bring some of our people into that area.\"\n\n\"We had been searching an area not far from there already with some tactical teams that night,\" Bivens said. \"There was an aircraft overhead utilizing FLIR (thermal) technology and close to 1 a.m., picked up a heat signal that they began to track west of PA 100 and north of Prizer Road.\"\n\nTUESDAY UPDATE:Chester County escaped killer Danelo Cavalcante now armed after shootout with homeowner\n\nTactical teams, Bivens said, began to converge on where the heat source was moving, but a thunderstorm required the Drug Enforcement Administration-operated aircraft to land.\n\nPolice decided to secure the area \"as best they could\" and hold it through the storm. Bivens said they held it \"until we could bring additional resources in and bring aircraft back overhead.\"\n\nShortly after 8 a.m., police moved in. But, Bivens said, that didn't stop Cavalcante from trying to escape.\n\n\"He began to crawl through thick underbrush taking his rifle with him as he went,\" Bivens said. \"One of the Customs and Border Control teams ... had a dog with them; they released the dog.\"\n\nUltimately, Cavalcante was found in a \"prone position\" near the logs. Though he suffered a dog bite, he was otherwise uninjured. No police were hurt.\n\nWho captured Cavalcante?\n\nBivens said the team that arrested Cavalcante consisted of about 20 to 25 people and included members of Pennsylvania State Police, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents from the El Paso, Texas, area and other state and federal partners.\n\nWhat tactics did Cavalcante use while on the lam?\n\nBivens said the way Cavalcante moved as he evaded police was \"fairly normal\" for fugitives.\n\nWhile he didn't follow the same pattern each day, he largely lay low during the day and moved at night.\n\nRELATED:Tips on escaped Chester County convicted killer keep coming in. Which are credible?\n\nBivens said the Brazilian native \"seemed to like to travel the creek beds.\"\n\n\"He liked other paths of less resistance − wood lines, power lines, gas lines, that type of thing,\" Bivens said. \"Nobody wants to have to force their way through very heavy underbrush and things.\"\n\nDid anyone help Cavalcante?\n\nLaw enforcement had said from the get-go they were concerned that Cavalcante would be aided by family or others.\n\nWhen asked, Bivens said Wednesday there were \"people who intended to assist him,\" but \"we have been successful in preventing that assistance from reaching out.\"\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nFollowing his capture, Cavalcante was transported to the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Avondale, arriving there around 9:45 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nHe was expected to be interrogated there, though Bivens said they would need a translator. He was escorted from the building in the afternoon to be transferred to a state prison.\n\nWhat changes are coming to Chester County Prison to prevent escapes?\n\nCavalcante's method to escape was similar to that of another inmate who tried to flee the county jail in May.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said while Chester County officials will have to \"answer those questions as to what occurred and what changes are ultimately going to be made,\" he said the state Department of Corrections will assist \"in any reviews or in any other work that they need done to make sure that that facility is secure.\"\n\n\"They obviously have a lot of work to do there,\" Shapiro said.\n\nGot a story tip or idea?

Col. George Bivens said Cavalcante stole a .22 caliber rifle – equipped with a flashlight and scope – from the garage of a Chester County home around 10 p.m. EDT Monday.\n\nThe homeowner saw Cavalcante, drew a pistol and fired at the fugitive. Bivens said there's no evidence to suggest Cavalcante was struck by the multiple shots.\n\n\"I think he was probably looking for a place to hide, ran for that garage, saw the firearm, grabbed that, encountered the homeowner and fled with the firearm,” Bivens said.\n\nThe homeowner called police, but Cavalcante had fled by the time officers arrived. Near the driveway, authorities found a green sweatshirt and white T-shirt believed to have belonged to Cavalcante. He was seen in a similar sweatshirt on surveillance video over the weekend.\n\n\"Cavalcante is considered armed and extremely dangerous,” Bivens said.\n\nVisual storyTrack manhunt for fugitive Danelo Cavalcante with maps\n\nAt the time of his escape Aug. 31, Cavalcante was waiting to be transferred from county to state prison to serve a life sentence for stabbing his ex-girlfriend, Deborah Brandao, to death in front of her two children in 2021. Cavalcante, a Brazilian national and former agricultural worker, is also wanted in the murder of a 20-year-old man over a car repair debt in his native country in 2017.\n\nNew search perimeter is set up\n\nPolice set up a new perimeter stretching several miles in each direction from the location of the shooting and began searching there overnight into Tuesday. At least 500 law enforcement officers from local, state and federal agencies were involved in the manhunt across the heavily wooded and hilly terrain, Bivens said, and more units were being brought in.\n\n“It will take a long time to clear that entire area,” he said, “but we will continue until we do locate him.”\n\nCavalcante's encounter with the homeowner occurred in South Coventry Township, a rural area in northern Chester County, not far from where Cavalcante ditched a van he had stolen over the weekend. The area is roughly 20 miles north of the prison Cavalcante fled and the area where police had focused their search.\n\nResidents in South Coventry Township were warned overnight to \"lock all doors and windows, secure vehicles, and remain indoors,\" a social media post from the Pennsylvania State Police said.\n\nFugitive's presence heightens locals' stress to pandemic levels\n\nKneehigh Farm, a local business close to the scene of Cavalcante’s sighting and firearm theft Monday night, is closing its doors as long as the escapee is at large in the area, the owner told USA TODAY Tuesday.\n\nSafety concerns and widespread road closures pushed Emma de Long to close her farm this week after reports of Cavalcante’s sightings reached her town of Pottstown.\n\n“I don’t feel like he’s on a serial-killing rampage. I feel like he’s trying to steal a vehicle and leave,” de Long said, adding that she has been diligent about locking vehicles the last few days. “We live in the rural area, and we’re not used to locking our doors or locking our cars.”\n\nAs a local business owner with a small child, de Long said the stress of the last few days has built and is reminiscent of the COVID-19 lockdown three years ago.\n\n“We’re just going to go stay with in-laws, because we just feel safer out of the area at night,” she said.\n\nSearch for fugitive keeps neighbors up at night\n\nRalph Romig and his wife, who are neighbors with the homeowner who shot at Cavalcante, were home Monday night when their street was suddenly swarmed by police. The couple had no idea the escaped killer was on the run nearby.\n\nRomig did not hear the shooting, but he and his wife “got very little sleep” because of the helicopters circling throughout the night.\n\n“I was just surprised that this is all happening so close to home, that's all,” Romig told USA TODAY. “It's a lot more drama than we usually get.”\n\nHe also said it doesn’t surprise him Cavalcante hasn’t been caught despite the exhaustive search, especially around his home, which is full of dense woodlands.\n\n“I just like to give the police the benefit of the doubt. It’s not an easy situation over here,” he said. “Hopefully they'll eventually get him flushed out here before he moves on to the next place that he terrorizes.”\n\nSchool district cancels classes\n\nCiting the threat posed by the fugitive and the heavy police presence in the area, the Owen J. Roberts School District canceled classes for Tuesday.\n\n\"As a result of increased police activity in our community related to the pursuit of an escaped inmate from Chester County Prison, and after consultation with state and local law enforcement, we have made the decision to close all schools and offices in our district today,\" read a statement to parents from Superintendent Will Stout.\n\n\"We know that this situation is stressful and upsetting for our entire community,\" the statement said. \"We thank you once again for your patience, support and understanding throughout the past several days.\"\n\nLaw enforcement received two other calls from nearby residents\n\nLaw enforcement was not far from the house when the homeowner called them to report his run-in with Cavalcante on Monday night. They were tracking him in that area after two other incidents believed to be related to the escaped convict were reported by residents.\n\nAt 8 p.m., a motorist driving in South Coventry Township said she saw a man crouching near the edge of a wooded area off a roadway. A border patrol team responded and began a search. They found footprints matched the prison-issued shoes worn by Cavalcante, Bivens said. They came upon the shoes nearby.\n\nAnother woman called a short while later, notifying police that a pair of work boots had been stolen from her front porch. From that location, police searched north. The shooting was reported about an hour later, Bivens said.\n\nCavalcante stole van, changed appearance over the weekend\n\nThe manhunt for Cavalcante intensified over the weekend after he stole a van, got well outside the police perimeter and was spotted on a home surveillance camera more than a week after he fled the Chester County Prison.\n\nOn Saturday night, about an hour after Cavalcante was suspected of stealing a 2020 Ford Transit van, he went to the home of a former co-worker and was seen on a doorbell security camera, Bivens said in a news conference Sunday.\n\nThe acquaintance was not home but saw the security footage when he returned and informed police, Bivens said. The footage revealed Cavalcante's new look, which included a clean-shaven face, a hooded sweatshirt, a black baseball-style hat, green prison pants and white shoes.\n\nCavalcante tried to contact another former co-worker that same night in Phoenixville, more than 20 miles northeast of the Longwood Gardens botanical park area, where a perimeter had been set up that apparently failed to contain him.\n\nAuthorities remain silent about people aiding Cavalcante\n\nWhile Cavalcante has friends and family in Chester County, authorities have been tight-lipped about whether they are cooperating with police or Cavalcante. Bivens on Tuesday declined to comment \"on whatever assistance he may or may not have received.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Bivens said Cavalcante’s sister was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and that she faces possible deportation over \"some immigration issues.\"\n\nAt a news conference Monday, Bivens said the sister \"chose not to assist\" police in their hunt for her brother; however, he did not say whether she was assisting the fugitive.\n\n“Her arrest was, again, because she's an overstay,” Bivens said. “That was a process that would play out for anyone in her same circumstance. And what I would say is ... she has failed to cooperate and so there was no value in law enforcement keeping her here at this point.”\n\nAuthorities defend manhunt strategy\n\nBoth the manhunt to find Cavalcante and the security at the facility he escaped have received criticism since Cavalcante fled the prison late last month.\n\nTo break out of the Chester County, Cavalcante crab-walked up a wall, blasted through razor wire and crossed a roof. The same route was used in May by another inmate, Igor Bolte, who was arrested within minutes.\n\nPrison officials have pledged to increase staff and install a fence to close the space above the prison yard wall that Bolte and Cavalcante scaled.\n\nThe prison tower guard on duty at the time of Cavalcante's escape was fired Friday after 18 years as a corrections officer. He was initially put on administrative leave in the days after Cavalcante’s escape, which went undetected for more than an hour until guards took a head count. The guard also had his personal cellphone on him at the time, a violation of jail protocol, said Chester County spokesperson Michelle Bjork.\n\nAt a news conference Monday, authorities defended their strategy in the search for Cavalcante and blamed the complex terrain in the initial perimeters for his ability to elude them.\n\nTop state and federal officials said the perimeter around the area where hundreds had been searching for Cavalcante includes heavily wooded terrain, underground tunnels and drainage ditches. They also said it took more than two hours for news to reach them that he had been spotted outside of the perimeter for the first time.\n\nBivens continued to stand behind law enforcement's handling of the manhunt Tuesday.\n\n\"Our people have done an amazing job. I'm very proud of the work that they've done and continue to do,\" he said. \"Nothing has gone wrong, our agencies are working very well together, and I believe we will be successful in the long run.\"\n\nChristopher Cann is a breaking news reporter for USA TODAY.

A plane using thermal imaging technology spotted Cavalcante's heat signal overnight, and by morning, crews were surrounding him.\n\n“They had the element of surprise,” Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said at a news conference after the arrest. “Cavalcante did not realize he was surrounded until that had occurred.”\n\nStill, Cavalcante kept trying to escape, crawling through the underbrush with the rifle. It took the bite of a police dog to ultimately subdue him, Bivens said.\n\n\"He definitely was going to continue to try to evade law enforcement, Clark said. \"He was going to run 'til the wheels fell off.\"\n\nInterrogation revealed escapee was motivated to outrun police\n\nCavalcante, 34, had just been sentenced to life in prison without parole and was being held at Chester County Prison when he escaped Aug. 31 by crab-walking up two walls from an exercise yard, pushing through razor wire and running across a roof. He was set to be transferred to a state correctional facility soon, officials have said.\n\nHe had recently been convicted of stabbing his ex-girlfriend to death in front of her two young children in 2021 and was wanted for another murder in his home country of Brazil.\n\nHe was desperate − and showed no signs of slowing down on his run from law enforcement, Clark said.\n\n\"He said that he knew we had to pay for what he had done. However, he wasn't willing to pay for it with his life,\" Clark said.\n\nCavalcante was taken to state police barracks in Avondale to be questioned Wednesday morning. He was hungry and was given food and medical attention, Clark said, and was cooperative with investigators questioning him.\n\n\"He was willing to talk,\" Clark said. \"There was really no attitude, there was no resistance to the questions. He answered everything to the best of his ability.\"\n\nCavalcante survived off watermelons, stolen supplies\n\nCavalcante told investigators he took measures to avoid capture as much as he could. He only moved around under the cover of nightfall. He hunkered down among thick vegetation to stay out of sight. He traveled along tree lines. When he saw lots of police activity nearby and helicopters overhead, he would hunker down for long periods of time.\n\nHe even buried his own fecal matter so investigators couldn't detect him, Clark said.\n\nHe survived by eating watermelons he said he found growing in the brush and drinking stream water, he told investigators. He broke into houses to recover supplies. In one house, he stole some fruit. From another, a pair of boots. Early on in the escape, he obtained a backpack that had a single razor in it, which he used to shave his face.\n\n\"This was just a desperate man. No resources. He didn't have any communication devices on him. He said nobody on the outside was helping him,\" Clark said.\n\nOn a few occasions over the last two weeks, Cavalcante claimed searchers and dogs were within 8-10 yards of \"stepping on him,\" Clark said.\n\nWith such a large search area, spanning neighborhoods and rural areas with thick vegetation, Clark said it was very difficult to track the escapee.\n\n\"It's the proverbial finding the needle in the haystack, and we found the needle a few times, it's just we couldn't dial in on it,\" Clark said.\n\nMeet Yoda, the dog who helped take down the fugitive\n\nIt was 4-year-old Yoda, a Belgian Malinois, who helped take Cavalcante down once and for all.\n\nYoda is a search dog and part of a Border Patrol Tactical Unit, called BORTAC. Yoda was deployed on Cavalcante after he didn't comply with verbal commands, Clark said. As Cavalcante tried crawling away, the dog bit him on the scalp.\n\nHe was also bitten in a lower extremity, Clark said, as dogs are trained to bite and hold onto subjects. That's when Cavalcante finally began to submit.\n\nFootage showed Cavalcante with blood on his face, wearing long pants, boots and a Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt during his arrest.\n\nSearch dogs were an integral part of the two-week manhunt, slogging through at times difficult conditions. Heat indexes on some days were over 100 degrees, and one dog was hospitalized earlier in the search because of heat illness but recovered.\n\nYoda was not hurt during the apprehension and is being hailed as a hero and a good boy.\n\n'We can put his all behind us:'Pennsylvania communities relieved after Danelo Cavalcante captured", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2023/07/14/police-escapee-michael-burham-seen-near-warren-county-prison-pa-several-days-ago-kala-hodgkin/70415220007/", "title": "Police: Escapee Burham spotted near Warren several days ago in ...", "text": "Michael C.

George Bivens, the state police's deputy commissioner of operations, said on Saturday. \"And while we can't say 100%, I no longer believe that that video is likely Burham.\"\n\nSaturday's full report: Police: Escapee Burham was not shown in recent doorbell video\n\nThe initial report from Friday's news conference:\n\nWARREN, Pa. — Escaped homicide suspect Michael C. Burham was seen in an area south of the city of Warren several days ago, a sighting captured on doorbell video at about 5 a.m., a top Pennsylvania State Police official said in a daily update eight days after Burham broke out of the Warren County Prison using a rope made of bedsheets tied together.\n\nBurham was caught on the video \"within the last couple of days,\" said Lt. Col. George Bivens, the state police's deputy commissioner of operations. He said Burham is walking past a residence \"headed toward the woods.\"\n\n\"We consider this to be a confirmed sighting,\" Bivens said.\n\nBivens declined to say when Burham was seen and where. He said police were notified of the video shortly after it was made.\n\nThe video shows a person walking slowly with a limp. The person does not appear to be wearing a prison uniform.\n\nBivens said police believe Burham, 34, was hurt when he escaped from the Warren County Prison at about 11:20 p.m. on July 6.\n\nBurham at the time was wearing a prison-issued blue denim jacket, an an orange-striped jumpsuit and orange Croc-style shoes, but Bivens said \"we don't believe it was prison attire\" that Burham was wearing when he was seen on the doorbell video.\n\nBivens said the state police would have no comment on whether Burham's prison garb has been found during the search. He said the video shows that Burham likes to travel at night.\n\n\"I think he is desperate to survive\" in the woods, Bivens said at the news conference, in the municipal building for Youngsville, outside of the city of Warren, about 66 miles southeast of Erie in northwestern Pennsylvania.\n\nBivens said state police still believe Burham is in the woods around Warren, a city of about 9,200 people on the edge of the 514,209-acre Allegheny National Forest. State police said the search has extended into the forest, and that investigators continue to probe whether Burham has had help from others as he stays on the run.\n\nPolice comment more on cache found in woods\n\nState police on Thursday released a photo of a cache of clothing, food and other items found partially hidden under a log in the woods not far from the city of Warren. Police said they are confident the cache belonged to Burham, whom police said has extensive experience in the outdoors.\n\nOn Friday, Bivens said state police believe the cache was from Burham's flight from authorities in the Warren area in May, when he was wanted for questioning in the fatal shooting of a woman in Jamestown, New York, north of Warren. But Bivens said state police \"also believe there might have been access to those areas since then.\"\n\nBivens reiterated on Friday that state police consider Burham to be armed and dangerous and able to survive in the outdoors for an extended period of time.\n\nBurham is still wanted in connection with a homicide in May in Jamestown, and he broke out of the Warren County Prison while awaiting prosecution on kidnapping charges related to the New York case. He used a rope made of bedsheets to slide off the prison's roof, police said.\n\n\"Burham is a self-taught survivalist with military training and could potentially be holed up in a wooded area,\" state police said in a news release after his escape. \"He is to be considered armed and dangerous and we are asking the public not to approach.\"\n\nBurham captured in South Carolina after fleeing in May\n\nIn the previous manhunt, Burham is accused of fleeing from New York by abducting an elderly couple in Sheffield, Pennsylvania, near Warren, stealing their SUV and forcing the two to drive with him to South Carolina, where he was arrested on May 24 after a manhunt. The couple was found unharmed.\n\nBurham was last know to live in Asheville, New York, near Jamestown. He also owned property in Russell, Pennsylvania, near Warren.\n\nHe has not been charged in the homicide, though authorities identified him as the prime suspect in that case, in which a 34-year-old woman, Kala Hodgkin, was found fatally shot at her residence in Jamestown on May 11. Burham at the time was wanted on a charge that he raped Hodgkin in a prior incident.\n\nContact Ed Palattella at epalattella@timesnews.com.

After four years, the groundbreaking InSight mission ended, but not before it detected space rocks slamming into the red planet and thousands of quakes.\n\nAnd some moments felt like they were lifted directly from a sci-fi film — like a heartbeat-like pulse in space and mysterious giant rings.\n\nA long time ago\n\nBack on Earth, ancient DNA helped to open hidden chapters of history.\n\nThis year, genomes were extracted from bones, teeth and even dirt to provide a genetic snapshot of a Neanderthal family, a Pompeii victim and remains found at the bottom of an 800-year-old well.\n\nAnalysis using DNA sequencing also helped to reveal the identity of a puzzling hybrid animal called a kunga and shed more light on the true identity of some of the first Americans.\n\nWild kingdom\n\nThis colorful damselfish was found living in the eastern Indian and western Pacific oceans.

Fatai Campbell/AP\n\nNigeria’s flood crisis has been disastrous this year, killing at least 300 people and affecting more than half a million people, NEMA said last month. NEMA warned of more catastrophic flooding for states located along the courses of rivers Niger and Benue, explaining that three of Nigeria’s overfilled reservoirs were expected to overflow.\n\nThe Anambra tragedy follows the devastating aftermath of a flood that swept through swaths of neighboring north-central Kogi state a week ago, leaving buildings submerged under water that rose to levels not seen in a decade, according to officials of the Kogi Red Cross Society.\n\nAt least six people, including a toddler, were reported to have died in Kogi’s worst-hit Ibaji district, which the state Governor Yahaya Bello said was “100% underwater.”\n\nBello described the flooding as a “humanitarian tragedy” in an October 1 address.\n\nKogi is located around 200 kilometers from Nigeria’s capital, Abuja. Kogi’s capital, Lokoja, is the meeting point for West Africa’s largest rivers, the Niger and Benue.\n\n“As the two major rivers meet in Lokoja, they overwhelmed the banks of the Lower Niger river, hence the inundation,” environmentalist Simi Adeodun told CNN.\n\n“Not only Lokoja is inundated right now, but most of the riparian communities along the fringes of River Benue in Nasarawa State … and River Niger traversing the boundary between Kwara and Niger states are also submerged.” he said.\n\nPeople are stranded due to recent floods in Kogi, north-central Nigeria. Abubakar Abdullahi\n\nThe Kogi Red Cross Society said: “Many people have been rendered homeless in Lokoja … as houses were submerged by flood,” adding that some major roads in the capital city had been submerged.\n\n“The roads served as a link between North Central and Southern parts of the country,” it said. “And many passengers were stranded.”\n\nThe Red Cross told CNN some of the deceased in Ibaji also lost their lives in a separate boat accident as they canoed through flood waters.\n\nBello said that nine areas along the Niger and Benue were affected.\n\n“Ibaji [district] is almost 100% under water while the rest range from 30% up … We therefore have a serious and humanitarian tragedy on our hands, but I wish to assure every person, family and community which has been affected that they are not alone and that help is coming,” he said.\n\n‘Terrifying’\n\nSome travelers said they were trapped for more than a day in flooded areas.\n\nI spent 2 nights on the road for a journey that should be for 5 hours between Lokoja-Abuja.

Fatai Campbell/AP\n\nA disastrous crisis\n\nAccording to NEMA, the release of excess water from a dam in neighboring Cameroon was bound to “complicate”” Nigeria’s already disastrous flood crisis.\n\n“The Lagdo dam operators in the Republic of Cameroun have commenced the release of excess water from the reservoir by 13th September, 2022. We are aware that the released water cascades down to Nigeria through River Benue and its tributaries thereby inundating communities that have already been impacted by heavy precipitation,” NEMA said in a statement on September 19.\n\n“The released water complicates the situation further downstream as Nigeria’s inland reservoirs … are also expected to overflow between now and October ending,” it stated, adding that: “This will have serious consequences on frontline states and communities along the courses of rivers Niger and Benue.”\n\nKogi and Anambra were among 13 Nigerian states predicted to be overrun by “the combined waters of rivers Niger and Benue as they empty into the region,” NEMA said.\n\nMany communities in Kogi are now underwater.\n\nThousands of travelers remained stranded in Nigeria's north-central Kogi state after major connecting roads to other parts of the West African nation were submerged in floods, locals and authorities said Thursday. Fatai Campbell/AP\n\nFlooding in Kogi this year had a more severe impact on communities than what was recorded during the last major flooding in 2012, Abubakar told CNN.\n\nAccording to Nigeria’s National Inland Waterways Authority, the 2012 flood rose to the level of 12.84 meters while the latest flooding was gauged at 13.22 meters.\n\nBut Kogi is not the only state reeling from the devastating impact of the latest flood.\n\nIn neighboring Nasarawa state, which is also grappling with flood water cascading down the River Benue, farmers are counting their losses from ravaged farmlands.\n\nIn northeastern Adamawa, more people are dying from flood-related incidents, NEMA said. Around 37 people have died during the current rainy season and more than 170,000 displaced, the agency stated.\n\nMany parts of Nigeria are prone to yearly floods with coastal cities like Lagos even more vulnerable to seasonal flooding.\n\nHere are the climate realities from Nigeria 👇\n\nThis is why addressing #LossAndDamage is central to climate justice.\n\nWithout #ClimateFinance, we cannot solve the climate crisis.\n\nThe danger of loss & damage is that it could become irreversible.\n\n\n\nPictures from Kogi state flood. pic.twitter.com/frjiyBOYkr — Adenike Titilope Oladosu (@the_ecofeminist) October 5, 2022\n\nClimate activists are intensifying the call for climate finance to address Nigeria’s climate crisis.\n\nNigerian authorities are heeding this call as the country joins its African counterparts to seek an expansion of climate financing ahead of next month’s COP27 climate summit in Egypt.", "authors": ["Nimi Princewill"], "publish_date": "2022/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/01/asia/pakistan-flooding-glacier-outbursts-climate-intl/index.html", "title": "'Eruptions' from Pakistan's melting glaciers have tripled this year and ...", "text": "Pakistan is home to more glaciers than anywhere in the world outside the polar regions, but as the climate warms, it’s becoming more vulnerable to sudden outbursts of melting glacier water that have the power to bring widespread destruction to its people.\n\nThe country’s chief meteorologist has warned that this year alone, Pakistan has seen triple the usual amount of glacial lake outbursts – a sudden release of water from a lake fed by glacier melt – that can cause catastrophic flooding.\n\nA bridge partially collapses due to flash flooding from a glacial lake outburst in Hassanabad village, in Pakistan's northern Hunza district in May.

At least 31 people died in New York’s Erie County as the storm buried Buffalo in up to 50.3 inches of snow. At least 25 others across 11 US states have been reported dead in the storm.\n\n“We’re, unfortunately, finding bodies on the street and in snow banks,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday evening.\n\n>> GET LIVE UPDATES\n\nMore than 7,000 utility workers were working around the clock to restore power in the area, navigating through broken trees and poles, according to Twitter posts from Poloncarz and National Grid US.\n\nLocal health officials were urgently responding to medical requests, including arranging transportation for people who need dialysis treatments – many of which were disrupted or delayed because of the storm. “Dialysis isn’t an optional or elective treatment. It has to be done regularly – several times a week – or that person dies,” the Erie County health department said.\n\nBuffalo police, meanwhile, arrested at least eight people by Tuesday afternoon in connection with business break-ins during the storm.\n\nAnd efforts of firefighters and other emergency vehicles working in the area were hampered by the hundreds of vehicles abandoned in the snow across Buffalo after fierce blizzard conditions made for blinding drives over the Christmas weekend, officials said.\n\nA driving ban remained in effect in Buffalo amid a two-day effort to clear at least one lane on every street to accommodate emergency responders, Poloncarz said at a news conference.\n\n“There’s a lot of roads that are completely blocked right now, that have no access whatsoever. And people are trying to drive on these roads or trying to get into these neighborhoods, and they can’t,” Poloncarz said.\n\n“Please, please,” he said. “I’m begging: Stay home.

New Jersey state police will fill in for New York officers diverted to Buffalo, he said.\n\n• Buffalo Niagara International Airport is expected to stay closed until late Wednesday morning, the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority said, after snow equipment was brought in from Pittsburgh to help it reopen.\n\n• More supermarkets in western New York were expected to reopen after road conditions had paralyzed earlier efforts to distribute stockpiled ready-to-eat meals to food banks, officials said.\n\n• Major highways – including the New York State Thruway, Interstates 20 and 990, and Routes 400 and 219 – have reopened, the state Transportation Department’s Rochester office announced.\n\nIt was a signal, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a tweet, “that we are finally turning the corner on this once-in-a-generation storm.”\n\n‘Gut-wrenching’ effort to check on residents plods on\n\nThe storm in Buffalo has been deemed more ferocious than the blizzard of 1977, which left 23 people there dead. The weekend weather “was just horrendous,” Poloncarz said earlier. “And it was horrendous for 24 hours in a row.”\n\nIndeed, blizzard conditions were recorded for 37.5 hours, CNN meteorologist Tom Sater said, noting, “That just doesn’t happen.”\n\nEven emergency and recovery vehicles were at times stuck in snow. “We had rescuers rescuing the rescuers,” Buffalo Deputy Mayor Crystal Rodriguez-Dabney told “CNN This Morning” on Tuesday, adding those problems have been resolved.\n\nHundreds of vehicles were abandoned in the snow in Buffalo, New York State Police Acting Superintendent Steven Nigrelli said, adding authorities were going door-to-door, car-to-car, checking for people.\n\nA utility worker straps a rope to a truck in an attempt to tow another in Buffalo, New York, on Monday.

Once roads are cleared, law enforcement planned to prioritize welfare checks, Erie County Sheriff John Garcia said Monday.\n\n“I have a bad feeling about that. I think the death toll is going to go up. When you have 420 EMS calls that are unanswered, it’s just gut-wrenching,” the sheriff said as his team planned to help get “people to doctors, nurses, to hospitals and … dialysis.”\n\nBy Tuesday evening, there were “just under 2,000” residents without power across Buffalo, Mayor Byron W. Brown said on Twitter, adding officials were still working to restore power to everyone.\n\nGetting the lights back on has been no easy task as utility crews have faced dangerous weather conditions, Hochul said.\n\nPeople and vehicles move about Monday on Main Street in Buffalo.

Yellowstone flooded in mid-June, followed by the torrential flooding in St. Louis, then Kentucky, and just this weekend we had major flooding in Death Valley.\n\n“On 5 August 2022, a flash flood hit the Death Valley National Park in California, USA. The amount of rain that fell in a few hours (34.5 mm or about 1.36 in) represented 75% of the volume that the area typically receives in a year, making 5 August the second-wettest day since the records started in 1911,” according to Copernicus, a European Earth observation program.\n\nThis resulted in numerous landslides, burying cars and cutting off roads – trapping roughly a thousand people inside the park.\n\nCars stuck in the mud and debris following the flash flooding over the weekend in Death Valley. National Park Service via AP\n\nAnother week of relentless rain for some of the hardest-hit areas\n\nThe last thing people want to hear this week is that more flooding is possible yet again for the Southwest and portions of eastern Kentucky. But the messaging is clear.\n\n“Heavy rainfall rates will be possible,” said the National Weather Service office in Jackson, Kentucky, adding, “Isolated to scattered instances of flash flooding will be a concern, especially in persistent activity, training storms,” including areas that are vulnerable to flooding due to recent events.\n\nWith the ground in eastern Kentucky already so saturated, and creeks still running high, it won’t take much additional rainfall to cause more flooding problems.\n\n“Unfortunately, any flash flooding on Tuesday will prime many of the same areas [in eastern Kentucky] for potentially worse and more widespread flash flooding on Wednesday,” the NWS said.\n\nThe Weather Prediction Center is forecasting “generally between 1 and 2 inches in 1 to 3 hours.” which is why that portion of the state is under a Level 2 of 4, slight risk of excessive rainfall on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n“Their slow movement, intensity, and abundant moisture to feed on will mean any of the more intense storms will be able to produce a quick inch or two of heavy rain over the local area,” said the WPC.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden traveled to eastern Kentucky today. They visited with families and surveyed the damage as many are still left without power and water.\n\nElsewhere, heavy rainfall is also possible for the Southwest this week – including hard hit Death Valley.\n\nEuropean Union, Copernicus Sentinel-2 imagery European Union, Copernicus Sentinel-2 imagery Move the slider bar to the left to reveal the flooding in Death Valley a day after the rainfall event.

Hermens/AP In pictures: Catastrophic flooding in Kentucky Prev Next\n\nThis summer seems to be different. We’ve seen so many historic events happening within just weeks apart – sometimes less. It seems extreme, even in this environment of “extremes” that we are currently living in.\n\nWe reached out to Greg Carbin, the forecast operations branch chief at the WPC to get his expertise on these frequent catastrophic flooding events. The first thing he mentioned was the heat.\n\n“Through early August, a large swath of the U.S. has experienced mean temperatures within the top 5 warmest summers of record,” said Carbin. Adding, “From eastern New Mexico across southeast Texas, and over central Florida, including Tampa and Orlando, it has been the warmest (hottest) summer on record in over 100 years.”\n\nHe went on to explain that many of the hottest areas have also been the driest. The dome of high pressure that we often refer to as a “heat dome” is locking in the heat (and keeping the rain out) across much of the South. On the periphery of that heat dome is where these storms are developing and causing so many problems.\n\n“The extreme rainfall events in Kentucky and St. Louis occurred on the edge of the hottest air where abundant moisture and instability were transported north and sustained in regions of focused atmospheric ascent. Thus, the hot conditions are a contributing factor to the extreme rainfall events,” explained Carbin.\n\nThe edges of the heat dome are essentially conveyor belts of moisture that have resulted in relentless rain following the same path for hours and days on end, which is what we saw unfold most recently in Death Valley.\n\nAnother reason for the historic rain is because of the warmer climate. Science has shown that a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapor – which can result in the ability for more rain to fall within the storm. While we can’t point at one single event and call it climate change, the wetter trend is.\n\n“We already know the potential exists for higher-end rainfall amounts in a warming climate, so it seems that some of these extreme rainfall events, while not necessarily a ‘new normal’, are certainly more likely to occur than our past records indicate,” said Carbin.", "authors": ["Jennifer Gray"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/09/11/libya-floods-storm-daniel/70824876007/", "title": "2,000 people feared dead in eastern Libya floods after weekend storm", "text": "Samy Magdy\n\nAssociated Press\n\nCAIRO − As many as 2,000 people were feared dead in Libya after Mediterranean storm Daniel caused devastating floods that swept away entire neighborhoods and wrecked homes in multiple coastal towns in the North African nation, one of Libya’s leaders said Monday.\n\nThe confirmed death toll from the weekend flooding stood at 38, according to health authorities. But the tally did not include Derna, the worst hit city, which had become inaccessible.\n\nVideo by Derna residents posted online showed major devastation. Entire residential blocks areas were erased along Wadi Derna, a river that runs down from the mountains through the city center. Multi-story apartment buildings once well back from the river were partially collapsed into the mud.\n\nIn a phone interview with al-Masar television station Monday, Prime Minister Ossama Hamad of the east Libyan government said 2,000 were feared dead in Derna, and thousands were believed missing. He said Derna has been declared a disaster zone.\n\nAt least 23 people were reported dead in the eastern town of Bayda, the town’s main medical center said. Another seven people were reported dead in the coastal town of Susa in northeastern Libya, according to the Ambulance and Emergency Authority. Seven others were reported dead in the towns of Shahatt and Omar al-Mokhtar, the minister said.\n\nThe Libyan Red Crescent said it lost contact with one of its workers as he attempted to help a stuck family in Bayda. Dozens of others were reported missing.\n\nDerna, which was the worst hit, has become inaccessible and local media reported that the situation there was catastrophic with no electricity or communications. Footage circulated on social media show flooding sweeping away residential buildings and other properties.\n\nEssam Abu Zeriba, the interior minister of the east Libya government, said more than 5,000 people were expected to be missing in Derna. He said many of the victims were swept away toward the Mediterranean.\n\nIn a telephone interview on the Saudi-owned satellite news channel Al-Arabiya, he urged local and international agencies to rush to help the city.\n\nOver the weekend, Libyans shared footage on social media showing flooded houses and roads in many areas across eastern Libya. They pleaded for help as floods besieged people inside their homes and in their vehicles.\n\nOssama Hamad, the prime minister of the east Libya government, declared Derna a disaster zone after heavy rainfall and floods destroyed much of the city, which is located in the delta of the small Wadi Derna on Libya’s east coast.\n\nThe government declared a state of emergency Saturday and suspended classes as a precaution ahead of the storm, which made landfall overnight.\n\nThe prime minister announced Monday three days of mourning and ordered flags across the country to be lowered to half-staff.\n\nControlling eastern and western Libya, Cmdr. Khalifa Hifter deployed troops to help residents in Benghazi and other eastern towns. Ahmed al-Mosmari, a spokesperson for Hifter’s forces, said they lost contact with five service members who were helping families in Bayda.\n\nLibya, a country with over 6 million people, suffers from debilitating infrastructure after more than a decade of conflict. The Mediterranean nation has plunged into chaos since a NATO-supported uprising in 2011 toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi who was later killed.\n\nThe oil-rich country has been divided for most of the past decade between rival administrations in the east and west. Each administration is backed by armed groups and militias, and foreign governments.\n\nDaniel is expected to arrive in parts of west Egypt later Monday, and the country’s meteorological authorities warned about possible rain and bad weather.\n\n'Challenges are vast':Here's how to help victims of the earthquake in Morocco", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/15/us/fema-kentucky-flood-insurance-climate-change-invs/index.html", "title": "Kentucky disaster shows how US is ill-prepared and under-insured ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen Bob and Debbie Smith signed up for flood insurance years ago, they never expected the storm that transformed the little river next to their backyard into a raging, muddy torrent. They never imagined that they and their cat would need to be rescued from their front porch by a neighbor with a boat as the floodwater reached up to their chests.\n\nBut after the historic floods that devastated Eastern Kentucky last month, that insurance is now a “game-changer,” Bob Smith said. While the more than $32,000 they’re set to receive won’t make up for the renovations the couple did on their now-ruined mobile home in Letcher County, “it’s enough to give me hope,” he said. “Other people, they don’t know what they’re going to do.”\n\nThe Smiths are in an extreme minority: Only about 1% of properties in the hardest-hit counties of the state have federal flood insurance, government records show, and general homeowners insurance policies don’t cover flood damage. That means most of their neighbors are struggling to find funds to rebuild from the deluge that killed 38 people in a rural corner of the state.\n\nIn this aerial photo, mobile homes are seen washed off their foundations on Saturday, July 30, 2022, after historic rains during the week flooded many areas of Kentucky. Michael Clevenger/AP\n\nThe destruction in Eastern Kentucky is a warning for other communities around the US that once-unthinkable floods are becoming more common due to climate change. Federal flood zone maps used by the insurance industry substantially underestimate the risk in many parts of the country, and the nation as a whole is underprepared for the financial ruin left in the wake of powerful floods, experts say.\n\nThe Kentucky communities suffering from the damage – coal mining towns tucked into the bends of winding river valleys – are especially ill-equipped. They include some of the poorest counties in the US, with little funding for rebuilding or flood resilience projects.\n\n“A lot of these places have never flooded,” Donald Mobelini, the mayor of Hazard, Kentucky, told CNN. “These people will not have flood insurance. So therefore, if they lose their home, it’s a total loss. There’s not going to be an insurance check coming to help that.”\n\nIn some of the flooded counties, only a few dozen federal flood insurance policies were in effect a month before the storm, according to Federal Emergency Management Association records. Residents without insurance could be eligible for temporary rental housing assistance from FEMA and potentially other aid approved by Congress, but experts said those payments will likely only cover a small fraction of the damages.\n\nRoy Wright, the former head of the National Flood Insurance Program, which is run by FEMA, said that the level of flood insurance in the area was “nowhere near the size and scope you’d hope to see given the risk of flooding.”\n\n“The realities are very harsh for a community like this,” he said.\n\n‘No home is completely safe’\n\nSo far, the flood insurance program has paid out more than $1.4 million to insured Kentucky households affected by the flooding, according to FEMA – likely a tiny fraction of the total damage costs in the region.\n\n“No home is completely safe from potential flooding,” FEMA official Paul Huang said in a statement. “With flood insurance, survivors have peace of mind knowing they are covered in the event of a major disaster.”\n\nSome of the Kentucky families who suffered damages have been especially shocked because their homes or businesses weren’t in a FEMA-designated flood zone, so they never thought they would need flood insurance.\n\nThe Kentucky Mist Distillery, which operates out of a nearly 100-year-old building in Whitesburg’s tiny downtown, was swamped with several feet of water during the floods, leaving its gleaming steel tanks caked with mud. Colin Fultz, the distillery’s owner, estimated that the inundation caused about $150,000 in damage, between ruined equipment and lost moonshine and vodka.\n\n“We weren’t in the flood zone, so we thought we were safe,” Fultz said. “I never would have dreamed it would get that high.”\n\nA view of a flooded street in front of the Kentucky Mist Distillery, following a day of heavy rain, in Whitesburg, Kentucky, on July 28, 2022. Amber Elise Carter/Reuters\n\nA growing body of research has found that the maps that people like Fultz rely on underestimate the risk of flooding, especially as climate change gets worse.\n\nAccording to FEMA’s flood maps, about 12% of the properties in three of the hardest-hit Kentucky counties are in what the agency calls a “Special Flood Hazard Area” – the zone that would be inundated during a 1-in-100-year flood event. When homeowners get mortgages in the area, they’re required to purchase flood insurance.\n\nBut a more accurate flooding model that takes climate change into account puts 51% of properties in those counties at risk during that kind of flood, according to estimates by First Street Foundation, a climate research nonprofit.\n\nThe difference is in part because FEMA’s maps don’t fully account for the impact of heavy rainfall on small rivers and creeks like those that cover the landscape of Eastern Kentucky, according to Jeremy Porter, First Street’s chief research officer.\n\nAnd Kentucky isn’t unique: Nationally, almost 6 million properties are at risk of damage during a 1-in-100-year flood even though they aren’t in the flood zone, First Street found.\n\n“There’s a huge discrepancy between the number of people that are at risk and the people who know they’re at risk,” Porter said.\n\nIn a statement, a FEMA spokesperson said the agency’s maps use the best available technology and that First Street’s analysis may overstate flood risk. FEMA’s flood maps reflect past flooding conditions, not future risk, the spokesperson said.\n\nOther research has also raised questions about the extent of flood risk. A North Carolina State University study published in February found that almost 85% of the flood damage events reported to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration between December 2006 and May 2020 took place outside FEMA’s flood risk zone.\n\n“It’s expensive and time-consuming to update our flood maps,” said Georgina Sanchez, a researcher at NC State and one of the study’s authors. “Many of the maps are quite old … and are not accounting for the changes we’re currently experiencing due to climate change.”\n\nIn Kentucky, FEMA flood maps for three of the hardest-hit counties – Breathitt, Clay and Perry – haven’t been updated in more than 14 years, according to federal records.\n\nDustin Elam, 31, stands in his children's former bedroom after his home was destroyed by flooding in Breathitt County, Kentucky. Chris Kenning/USA Today Network\n\nClimate change forcing homeowners to make tough choices\n\nVideos and photos of flooding reviewed and geolocated by CNN show that some of the areas that flooded in recent weeks were outside the current FEMA-designated flood zone, from parts of downtown Whitesburg to stretches of homes lining river mountain valleys outside of the town of Jackson.\n\nThe storm that deluged the state has been described by meteorologists as a 1-in-1,000-year rain-event – so the FEMA map, which designates zones at risk during 1-in-100-year and 1-in-500-year floods, wouldn’t necessarily capture all the flooded areas.\n\nBut as climate change advances, “what was a 1-in-100-year flood when these maps were created might now be a 1-in-50 or 1-in-40-year event going forward,” Porter said.\n\nEven more up-to-date and accurate flood maps wouldn’t necessarily have led to far more people in Eastern Kentucky getting flood insurance because many residents don’t have mortgages that would have required them to buy it, experts said. In less affluent rural areas like the flooded Kentucky counties, new housing construction is rare, and many homes are passed on to family members instead of being sold.\n\n“If you don’t have a mortgage, regardless of whether you’re in the highest hazard zone of flooding, it is the homeowner’s choice whether or not to have flood insurance,” said Wright, the former FEMA official.\n\nKirsten Gomez, right, cries to her family member Kathy Hall, after what she calls a quiet moment to reflect on what her family has gone through in the aftermath of massive flooding, Tuesday, August 2, 2022, in Hindman, Kentucky. Brynn Anderson/AP\n\nBob Smith, the Letcher County homeowner who was rescued from his porch, said he and his wife decided to keep their flood insurance even after they paid off the mortgage on their home because they live directly adjacent to a river.\n\nA better flood insurance system would help homeowners understand their relative level of risk, instead of making a simplistic distinction between properties inside and outside of a flood zone, Wright said.\n\nFEMA has acknowledged shortcomings with its flood insurance program, and recently urged Congress to pass reforms that would allow it to update its procedures for mapping flood risk and subsidize flood insurance for low-and-moderate-income homebuyers – helping more people afford insurance in poorer areas like Eastern Kentucky. Flood insurance premiums cost about $760 annually on average, but that varies depending on risk and other factors, according to the agency’s data.\n\nThe flood insurance program “continues to operate on a construct developed over 50 years ago,” David Maurstad, a FEMA official, told a Senate committee in June, saying the agency wanted to “reform how we measure and communicate flood risk” and “ensure more Americans are covered by flood insurance.”\n\nThe Biden administration and Congressional Democrats initially included funding to improve flood maps and subsidize flood insurance for low-and-moderate-income households in their Build Back Better package. But that money was cut during negotiations, and isn’t present in the final climate-and-health spending bill that Congress passed on Friday.\n\nAngie Hatton, a state representative who lives in Whitesburg, said the lack of flood insurance was a huge challenge as her region picks up the pieces and turns to charity. “We are facing every Appalachian person’s nightmare in that we hate to ask for help, especially from outsiders,” she said.\n\nHer fear, she said, is that some of her neighbors who aren’t getting an insurance check to rebuild their damaged homes will cut their losses and leave – hastening the decline of a community whose population has already fallen steeply in recent decades.\n\n“Sometimes the family home was the thing that was keeping them here,” she said. “If that home can’t be rebuilt, they might not be coming back.”\n\nHow safe are you from flooding?

And in South Africa, climate change made rainfall that triggered deadly floods heavier and twice as likely to occur.\n\nYet against the backdrop of these catastrophic events, this year also sparked some glimmers of hope:\n\nScientists in the US successfully produced a nuclear fusion reaction that generated more energy than it used – a huge step in the decades-long quest to replace fossil fuels with an infinite source of clean energy.\n\nAnd at the United Nations’ COP27 climate summit in Egypt, nearly 200 countries agreed to set up a fund to help poor, vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters they had little hand in causing.\n\n“There was some encouraging climate action in 2022, but we remain far off track to meet our goals of reducing global heat-trapping emissions and limiting future planetary warming,” Kristina Dahl, principal climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN. “There must be a stronger collective commitment and progress toward slashing emissions in 2023 if we are to keep climate extremes from becoming even more devastating.”\n\nHere are the top 10 climate and extreme weather stories of 2022.\n\n10. Tonga volcano eruption and global tsunami\n\nA zoomed-in view of the Tonga eruption, taken by Japan's Himawari-8 satellite, about 100 minutes after the eruption started. Simon Proud/Uni Oxford, RALSpace NCEO/Japan Meteorological Agency\n\nWhen the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano erupted in January, it sent tsunami waves around the world. The blast itself was so loud it was heard in Alaska – roughly 6,000 miles away. The afternoon sky turned pitch black as heavy ash clouded Tonga’s capital and caused “significant damage” along the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu.\n\nThe underwater volcanic eruption also injected a huge cloud of ash and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, more than 30 kilometers (around 19 miles) above sea level, according to data from NASA satellites.\n\nAt the time, experts said the event was likely not large enough to impact global climate.\n\nBut months later, scientists found that the eruption actually belched an enormous amount of water vapor into the Earth’s stratosphere – enough to fill more than 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. The massive plume of water vapor will likely contribute to more global warming at ground-level for the next several years, NASA scientists reported.\n\n9. Rivers hit record lows\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Severe drought reveals incredible discovery at bottom of Mississippi river 00:45 - Source: CNN\n\nSearing temperatures, lack of rainfall and low snowpack pushed some of the world’s most vital rivers to new lows this year.\n\nNorthern Italy saw its worst drought in more than 70 years. The 400-mile River Po hit a record low due to an unusually dry winter and limited snowpack in the Alps, which feeds the river. The drought impacted millions of people who rely on the Po for their livelihood, and roughly 30% of the country’s food, which is produced along the river.\n\nAlso fed by winter snowpack in the Alps along with spring rains, Germany’s Rhine River dropped to “exceptionally low” levels in some areas, disrupting shipping in the country’s most important inland water way. Months of little rainfall meant cargo ships began carrying lighter loads and transport costs soared.\n\nMeanwhile in the US, extreme drought spread into the central states and gauges along the Mississippi River and its tributaries plummeted. Barge traffic moved in fits and starts as officials dredged the river. The Mississippi River dropped so low that the Army Corps of Engineers was forced to build a 1,500-foot-wide levee to prevent Gulf-of-Mexico saltwater from pushing upstream.\n\n8.

Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nAfter more than a year of negotiations, Democrats in late July reached an agreement on President Joe Biden’s long-stalled climate, energy and tax agenda – capping a year of agonizing negotiations that failed multiple times.\n\nBiden signed the bill into law in August and signaled to the world that the US is delivering on its climate promises.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin was influential in delaying the bill’s passage. Multiple White House and Biden administration officials for months had tried to convince the senator to support the bill over dinners in Paris and ziplining in West Virginia.\n\nAn analysis suggests the measures in the bill will reduce US carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030 and would put Biden well on his way to achieving his goal of slashing emissions in half by 2030.\n\n7.

It was the first time wealthy, industrialized countries and groups, including longtime holdouts like the US and the EU, agreed to establish such a fund.\n\n“We can’t solve the climate crisis unless we rapidly and equitably transition to clean energy and away from fossil fuels, as well as hold wealthy nations and the fossil fuel industry accountable for the damage they have done,” Rachel Cleetus, policy director and lead economist for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN.\n\n5. A summer of flooding\n\nSubmerged vehicles in Jackson, Kentucky, in July. Between 8 and 10 inches of rain fell within 48 hours from July 27 to 28 across Eastern Kentucky. The month was Jackson's wettest July on record. Michael Swensen/Getty Images\n\nThe summer’s series of floods started off in Yellowstone National Park in June, when extreme rainfall and rapidly melting snow washed out roads and bridges in the park, causing significant damage to the nearby town of Gardiner, Montana, at the park’s entrance. Authorities had to rescue more than 100 people from the floods.\n\nThe year also brought several 1,000-year rainfall events. A 1,000-year rainfall event is one that is so intense it’s only seen on average once every 1,000 years – under normal circumstances. But extreme rainfall is becoming more common as the climate crisis pushes temperatures higher. Warmer air can hold more moisture, which loads the dice in favor of historic rainfall.\n\nDeadly flooding swept through Eastern Kentucky and around St. Louis in July after damaging, record-breaking rainfall in a short period of time.\n\nCalifornia’s Death Valley, after a yearslong dry spell, saw its rainiest day in recorded history.\n\nMeanwhile, down south, parts of Dallas, Texas, got an entire summer’s worth of rain in just 24 hours in August, prompting more than 350 high-water rescues.\n\n4. Europe’s deadly heat wave\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Wildfires threaten London during record-breaking heat wave 01:20 - Source: CNN\n\nEurope experienced its hottest summer on record in 2022 by a wide margin. While the heat kicked off early in France, Portugal and Spain, with the countries reaching record-warmth in May, the most significant heat came in mid-July, spreading across the UK and central Europe.\n\nThe UK, in particular, topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for the first time on record. Stephen Belcher, the UK Met Office’s chief scientist, said this would have been “virtually impossible” in an “undisrupted climate.”\n\nThroughout western Europe, the heatwaves gravely increased wildfire risk, with one London fire official noting that the 40-degree day led to an “unprecedented day in the history of the London Fire Brigade.”\n\n3. The West’s water crisis\n\nVideo Ad Feedback As water levels drop at this major lake, bodies begin to appear 03:19 - Source: CNN\n\nThe past few years have been a reality check for western states that heavily rely on the Colorado River for water and electricity. Plagued by decades of overuse and a climate change-fueled drought, the river that serves 40 million people in seven western states and Mexico is draining at an alarming rate.\n\nThe water levels in its two main reservoirs – Lake Mead and Lake Powell – have plunged rapidly, threatening drinking water supply and power generation. In late July, Lake Mead – the country’s largest reservoir – bottomed out and has only rebounded a few feet off record lows. Its rapidly plunging levels revealed human remains from the 1970s and a sunken vessel from World War II.\n\nThe federal government implemented its first-ever mandatory water cuts this year for states that draw from the Colorado River, and those cuts will be even deeper starting in January 2023.\n\n2.

More than a third of Pakistan was underwater, satellite images showed, and authorities warned it would take months for the flood waters to recede in the country’s hardest-hit areas.\n\nUN Secretary General António Guterres said the Pakistani people are facing “a monsoon on steroids,” referring to the role that the climate crisis had in supercharging the extreme rainfall. The hard-hit provinces Sindh and Balochistan saw rainfall more than 500% of average during the monsoon season.\n\nPakistan is responsible for less than 1% of the world’s planet-warming emissions, yet it is the eighth most vulnerable nation to the climate crisis, according to the Global Climate Risk Index.\n\n1. Hurricane Ian\n\nDestruction in the wake of Hurricane Ian on October 4 in Fort Myers Beach, Florida. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nHurricane Ian was a Category 4 storm when it made landfall in southwest Florida in late September and left a trail of destruction from the Caribbean to the Carolinas. Insured losses from Ian are expected to reach up to $65 billion, according to recent data from reinsurance company Swiss Re.\n\nThe storm first struck Cuba before undergoing rapid intensification from a tropical storm to a category 3 hurricane in just 24 hours – something scientists told CNN is part of a trend for the most dangerous storms. That same week, Super Typhoon Noru in the Philippines grew from the equivalent of a category 1 hurricane to a category 5 overnight as residents around Manila slept, catching officials and residents unaware and unable to prepare.\n\nHurricane Ian’s size and intensity allowed it to build up a storm surge higher than any ever observed in Southwest Florida, devastating Fort Myers and Cape Coral. Ian killed more than 100 people, most by drowning.

The city of Geneva, which is tucked into a bend in the river and between two lakes, is particularly inundated.\n\n“This area historically floods, and many residents stick it out” in their homes, Lerner told CNN in a phone interview. Lerner was not sure how many residents may have already left because of the flooding.\n\nThe St. Johns River begins southeast of Orlando and flows north through dozens of cities on the east side of the Florida Peninsula before it drains into the Atlantic Ocean in Jacksonville.\n\nThe river flows across 300 miles, yet only drops around 30 feet – making this river one of the slowest in the world, according to Scott Kelly, a forecaster at the National Weather Service in Melbourne.\n\n“It is a very, very lazy river,” Kelly told CNN. “Very slow moving.”\n\nKelly suspects the flooding could go on “perhaps for a couple of months,” and officials expect this slow-moving disaster to creep north over the next few weeks.\n\nThe water in Geneva “will eventually move to the Astor area,” Lerner said. “It’s a very slow trickle process.”\n\nAstor is an unincorporated community in Lake County and is on the west side of the river, just south of Lake George. Lerner said there is usually a two-week delay for water to flow from Geneva to Astor; so they should see the water level rise soon.\n\nWater pushes into homes and businesses along the St. Johns River in DeLand, Florida. Chris Fau\n\nForecasters say water levels will stay high on the St. Johns through Thanksgiving. Chris Fau\n\nBut already in DeLand – between Geneva and Astor – drone imagery shows homes and businesses inundated by dark brown water that has pushed beyond the river’s banks.\n\n“Geneva … DeLand and Astor have all seen record flooding with this event,” Kelly told CNN. “So this is not something anyone has seen at least in the last 70 years.”\n\nHurricane Ian dumped as much as 20 inches of rain on this part of Florida nearly two weeks ago – a tremendous amount of rain that is becoming more common as the planet warms. Scientists have shown that warmer air can hold more moisture, pushing hurricanes to produce harder rainfall.\n\nIan’s rainfall was at least 10% higher because of human-caused climate change, according to a rapid analysis by scientists at Stony Brook University and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nHurricane Ian pushed the St. Johns River higher than its been in the last 70 years. Chris Fau\n\nForecasters at the National Weather Service are warning of several weeks of flooding as the St. Johns slowly drains. Chris Fau\n\nThe National Weather Service expects more rain in the region over the next few days as a cold front pushes through Florida. But Kelly said it won’t push the river to rise any further than it already is.\n\n“It’s going to probably freak people out because it’s going to start raining again,” Kelly said. “It will be more spotty showers and should not have a significant impact on the river level.\n\nNow, forecasters are mostly concerned about preparing people for weeks of flooding.\n\n“We’re not sure that people understand fully that this river is not going to go down very quickly,” said Kelly. “And so, yes, it’s crested in most places but it’s going to stay near or at that crest for many days and we don’t think people are prepared mentally for that.”", "authors": ["Jennifer Gray Melissa Alonso Angela Fritz", "Jennifer Gray", "Melissa Alonso", "Angela Fritz"], "publish_date": "2022/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/weather/california-megaflood-study/index.html", "title": "A disastrous megaflood is coming to California, experts say, and it ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMany Californians fear the “Big One,” but it might not be what you think.\n\nIt’s not an earthquake. And it isn’t the mega drought. It’s actually the exact opposite.\n\nA megaflood.\n\nA new study by Science Advances shows climate change has already doubled the chances of a disastrous flood happening in California in the next four decades. And experts say it would be unlike anything anyone alive today has ever experienced.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter shows impact drought has had on California river 02:37 - Source: CNN\n\nDaniel Swain, a climate scientist with UCLA and a researcher involved in the study, describes a megaflood as, “a very severe flood event across a broad region that has the potential to bring catastrophic impacts to society in the areas affected.” He said a megaflood is similar to the 1,000-year flash flood events seen this summer in the St. Louis area and Kentucky, but across a much wider area, such as the entire state of California.\n\nThese massive floods, which experts say would turn California’s lowlands into a “vast inland sea,” might have previously happened once in a lifetime in the state. But experts say climate change is increasing the likelihood of these catastrophic disasters, causing them to occur more like every 25 to 50 years.\n\nClimate change supercharges heavy rain events, making flash floods occur more regularly, as has been noted several times this summer in Eastern Kentucky, St. Louis, and even in California’s Death Valley National Park.\n\nCalifornia is prone to these floods from atmospheric rivers naturally, and major floods from them have happened before – but climate change is upping the ante, and millions of people could be impacted.\n\nThe study said atmospheric rivers could become consecutive for weeks on end, like seen in this animation. Xingying Huang, one of the authors of the study, made this loop, which illustrates the water vapor transportation and potential precipitation accumulation at selected time slices during the 30-day scenario.\n\nThe area with the most destruction would be the Central Valley of California, including Sacramento, Fresno and Bakersfield, the study’s authors project. The Central Valley, roughly the size of Vermont and Massachusetts combined, produces a quarter of the nation’s food supply, according to the US Geological Survey.\n\nA flood with the size to fill this valley has the potential to be the most expensive geophysical disaster to date, costing upwards of $1 trillion in losses and devastating the state’s lowland areas, including Los Angeles and Orange counties, according to the study.\n\nThat would be more 5 times the cost of Hurricane Katrina, the current costliest disaster in US history.\n\n“Such a flood event in modern California would likely exceed the damages from a large magnitude earthquake by a considerable margin,” the study showed.\n\nIn this photo provided by the National Park Service, Mud Canyon Road is closed due to flash flooding in Death Valley, California. National Park Service/AP\n\nThis study is the first phase of a three-part series studying the effects of a future megaflood event in California. The next two phases are expected to be released in two to three years.\n\n“Ultimately, one of our goals is not just to understand these events scientifically, but it’s also to help California prepare for them,” Swain said. “It’s a question of when rather than if (the megaflood) occurs.”\n\nIt’s happened before. It will happen again, but worse, warns scientists\n\nOver 150 years ago, a strong series of atmospheric rivers drenched the Golden State, causing one of the most exceptional floods in history following a dry spell that had left the West parched for decades.\n\nCommunities were demolished in minutes.\n\nThis 1861 photograph shows flooding in Sacramento. Sacramento Public Library\n\nIt was the winter of 1861-1862 and a historic megaflood transformed the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys into a “temporary but vast inland sea,” according to the study. Some areas had up to 30 feet of water for weeks, obliterating infrastructure, farmland, and towns.\n\nSacramento, the new state capital at the time, was under ten feet of debris-filled water for months.\n\nThe catastrophe began in December 1861, when nearly 15 feet of snow fell in the Sierra Nevada. Repetitive atmospheric rivers dropped warm rain for 43 days thereafter, dumping water down the mountainous slopes and into the valleys.\n\nFour thousand people lost their lives, one-third of the state’s property was destroyed, a quarter of California’s cattle population drowned or starved, and one in eight homes were a complete loss by floodwaters.\n\nIn addition, one-fourth of California’s economy was obliterated, resulting in a state-wide bankruptcy.\n\nSwain warns a megaflood like this will happen again, but worse and more frequent.\n\nDowntown Sacramento today, which was raised 10-15 feet after the historic floods. Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\n“We find that climate change has already increased the risk of a (1862) megaflood scenario in California, but that future climate warming will likely bring about even sharper risk increases,” the study warns.\n\nMany of today’s major cities with millions of residents are built directly on top of the ancient flood deposits, Swain added, putting far more people in harm’s way.\n\nAbout 500,000 people lived in California in 1862. Now, the state’s population is over 39 million.\n\n“When this (flood) occurs again, the consequences would be wildly different than they were back in the 1860s,” Swain said.\n\nClimate change increases the amount of rain the atmosphere can hold and causes more water in the air to fall as rain, which can lead to immediate flooding. Both are and will continue to occur in California.\n\nThe new study shows a rapid increase in the likelihood of week-long, recurring strong-to-extreme atmospheric rivers during the cool season. An atmospheric river is a long, narrow region of heavy moisture in the atmosphere that can transport moisture thousands of miles, like a fire hose in the sky. They usually bring beneficial rainfall to drought-prone regions like California but could quickly become hazardous with a warming climate.\n\nHistorically these winter atmospheric rivers dump feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada, but as climate warms, more of the snow will fall as rain. Instead of melting slowly over time, it all runs off, piles up, and floods immediately.\n\nCalifornia's Central Valley, which produces one-fourth of the nation's food, will be ravaged by a megaflood. Citizen of the Planet/UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nWith a neighbor like the Pacific Ocean, California has “an infinite reservoir of water vapor offshore,” Swain added.\n\nCalifornia’s mountainous terrain and wildfire risk make it especially vulnerable to flooding. Lingering burn scars from wildfires can create a steep, slick surface for water and debris to flow off. With wildfires becoming larger and burning more area thanks to climate change, more areas are susceptible to these debris flows.\n\nAlthough models show this megaflood is inevitable, experts say there are ways to mitigate excessive loss.\n\n“I think the extent of (megaflood) losses can be significantly reduced by doing certain sorts of things to revamp our flood management and our water management systems and our disaster preparedness,” Swain said.\n\nHuang, a project scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and a researcher involved in the study, said everyone can make a small effort in combating climate change.\n\n“If we work together to decrease future emissions, we can also reduce the risk of extreme events,” Huang said.", "authors": ["Payton Major Judson Jones", "Payton Major", "Judson Jones"], "publish_date": "2022/08/12"}]}

Apple has delivered on two of its most requested features: the ability to edit and unsend iMessages.\n\nThis week, Apple released its latest operating system, iOS 16, which lets users edit an iMessage up to five times within 15 minutes after sending it and unsend any message up to 2 minutes after it’s sent. Users just need to tap and hold the sent message, then select “edit” or “undo send.”\n\nBut there are some caveats. For starters, it’s not exactly a stealthy effort: recipients receive an alert that the message was unsent or edited but don’t see the specific change.\n\nBoth users also need to be messaging on Apple devices, so it won’t work for Android exchanges. It works best when the recipient is also using iOS 16 — otherwise they’ll receive an awkward timeline of the changes made. SMS messages can’t be unsent or edited either.\n\nAnd the sender must hope the recipient didn’t see a preview of the original message on the lock screen before it was edited or unsent.\n\nApple (AAPL) is playing catchup to platforms such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Gmail, which also offer options to edit or delete messages after they’re sent. Twitter recently announced it’s testing the ability for users to edit tweets.\n\n“With Twitter and Apple now also enabling this feature, it is clear that this is a trend that many mobile users demand from these platforms,” said Lian Jye Su, research director at market research firm ABI Research. “Since the barrier to switching messaging platforms is near zero, rich and user-friendly features have become a critical competitive advantage.”\n\nWhile they’re popular requests, editing and unsending messages could have an unintended impact on transparency and accountability, especially on public platforms, by removing or altering the written record. By making it clear the message was edited, Apple could help maintain some transparency, according to Ramon Llamas, an analyst at IDC.\n\nEven with these new options, however, Lllamas recommends people read over what they send “because it can come back to haunt you … even if you edit it.”\n\niOS 16 is now available for any iPhone model dating back to the iPhone 8, which was released in 2017.

A fresh Twitter account created by CNN that opted for the paid feature did not show the checkmark on its public profile. Twitter also still appeared to be charging $4.99, an outdated price.\n\nThe decision to delay the rollout comes as the entire decision to charge users for verification has faced wide public backlash. In a display of defiance, some celebrities on the platform posed as Musk over the weekend and revealed a potential flaw in the “Blue Check” system.\n\nComedian Sarah Silverman used her verified account to troll Musk, copying his profile picture, cover image and name. The only thing distinguishing a tweet coming Silverman’s account was the @SarahKSilverman handle.\n\n“I am a freedom of speech absolutist and I eat doody for breakfast every day,” Silverman tweeted Saturday. Her account also retweeted posts supporting Democratic candidates.\n\nSilverman’s account was labeled as “temporarily restricted” Sunday, with a warning that “there has been some unusual activity from this account” shown to visitors before clicking through to the profile. The comedian then changed her account back to its usual form, complete with her own name and image.\n\nTelevision actress Valerie Bertinelli similarly changed her account name to the Twitter CEO’s, tweeting Friday that “[t]he blue checkmark simply meant your identity was verified. Scammers would have a harder time impersonating you. That no longer applies. Good luck out there!” She then answered a follower who asked how the checkmark no longer applies, writing, “[y]ou can buy a blue check mark for $7.99 a month without verifying who you are.”\n\nAfter changing her profile name to Musk, Bertinelli tweeted and retweeted support for several Democratic candidates and hashtags, including “VoteBlueForDemocracy” and “#VoteBlueIn2022.”\n\nThe actress changed her account name back to Valerie Bertinelli Sunday, tweeting, “[o]key-dokey I’ve had my fun and I think I made my point.”\n\nOn Sunday, Musk tweeted that, “Going forward, any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying ‘parody’ will be permanently suspended.” He also tweeted that a name change on Twitter will “cause temporary loss of verified checkmark.”\n\nAdditionally, Musk said Twitter users will no longer receive warning before being suspended. “This will be clearly identified as a condition for signing up to Twitter Blue,” he tweeted.\n\nComedian Kathy Griffin’s account was also suspended for impersonating the Twitter CEO.\n\nThe trolling activity comes in the wake of Musk purchasing the company and pledging to restore the accounts of users who were previously banned from the platform, most notably former President Donald Trump. Musk has also said he will limit the company’s content restrictions and require the paid subscription for account verification.\n\nIn recent months, Musk has shared conspiracy theories about the attack on Paul Pelosi, called Democrats the party of “division & hate,” compared Twitter’s former CEO to Joseph Stalin and warned that “the woke mind virus will destroy civilization.”\n\n— CNN’s Brian Fung contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Jennifer Korn Donie O'Sullivan", "Jennifer Korn", "Donie O'Sullivan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/05/22/have-sticky-broken-keys-your-macbook-apple-may-fix-free/3765163002/", "title": "Have sticky, broken keys on your MacBook?

Looks effortless.\n\n2:20 p.m.: It looks like users will be able to shop on the Apple TV. Exploring suits from John Varvatos, the demo offers an option to zoom in and make a payment through Apple Pay. The Apple TV remote lets users view an item, hit play, and get a peek at an item without clicking on the page.\n\n2:15 p.m.: John Carter of Harmonix -- the makers of Rock Band -- are up to show off the game Beats Sports. Users interact with music and time their moves with the beat with swings of the Apple remote. (Side note: am I seeing things or is Apple taking several pages from the Nintendo Wii playbook?).\n\n2:13 p.m.: The Apple TV version of Crossy Road will feature a cooperative and mulitplayer element, as another player performing as a Mallard Duck works to cross the street. The game launches along with Apple TV.\n\n2:11 p.m.: Games take the stage, starting with the hit Crossy Road. If you have never heard of Crossy Road, it's basically Frogger with a chicken. It looks really sharp, but begs a larger question: do you want to play mobile games on your TV?\n\n2:09 p.m.: Cue returns to talk more Apple TV, focusing on the App Store. Cue says they will introduce tvOS, based on the iOS platform, using similar tools to create apps. Featured apps include Netflix, HBO Now, Hulu as well as games such as Galaxy on Fire, Disney Infinity and Guitar Hero.\n\n2:07 p.m.: You can ask Siri for any thing while you watch, such as who stars in the movie you're watching, to sports and weather updates.

If you've ever used the Remote app on an iPhone or iPad, it appears similar. Search appears very detailed, too. \"Show me that Modern Family episode with Edward Norton,\" says member of the Apple TV team. It points right to the episode. The voice search seems to work really well. If you miss something, tell Siri \"what did she say?,\" it flips on captions and replays the scene.\n\n2:00 p.m.: Eddy Cue is up to discuss Apple TV. He starts with the remote, with a glass touch surface and a microphone button for voice commands. \"Show me funny TV shows,\" Cue asks before displaying a list of TV comedies sorted by popularity.

The Apple Pencil sells for $99, while the keyboard starts at $129. They all launch in November. Now time for what sounds like a Jony Ive narrated sizzle video.\n\n1:44 p.m.: Health care is a clear theme here, as another app for doctors and patients is showcased. The doctor in this demo discusses a knee injury using a skeleton on the iPad Pro, adding muscles and skin to provide more detail. Clearly Apple sees the health and medical industries as opportunities to push its devices.\n\n1:42 p.m.: Snowden shifts to Adobe PhotoShop Sketch, using the Pencil to add and blend colors in real time. Looks really sharp.\n\n1:40 p.m.: Director of design at Adobe, Eric Snowden, is up next to discuss how their apps will leverage the iPad Pro. One design app allows users to quickly create frames with quick strokes of his finger. In a matter of seconds, he creates an elegant design with image, headline and text in a magazine-like layout.\n\n1:39 p.m.: If you're following the chatter on Twitter, then you may have spotted a video of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 2007 discussing his dislike for the stylus. How times have changed. You can watch the Jobs clip here:\n\n1:37 p.m.: This, also, is not a typo: one of the demos is being handled by Microsoft. Yes, THAT Microsoft. The demo is showcasing how users can mark up notes in Office.\n\n1:35 p.m.: The Pencil will work on apps in iOS, including the Notes app or in Mail through a new markup feature. New apps will take advantage of the Pro display and the Pencil, including a new offering called YouMake. Here come the Pencil demos. You're not reading that incorrectly. PENCIL DEMOS.\n\n1:33 p.m.: The back of the Apple Pencil features a Lightning connector to plug into the iPad Pro and charge.\n\n1:32 p.m.: Drawing and illustration will feel better on the Pro, too, says Schiller. The iPad Pro will also support a stylus, called the Apple Pencil.\n\n1:30 p.m.: Despite the size, iPad Pro is almost as thin as the iPad Air 2 -- its tablet predecessor -- and it weighs slightly more than the original iPad. Schiller says it will introduce a Smart Keyboard that adds a physical keyboard to the tablet. Cue every Microsoft Surface Pro owner screaming \"We already have this!\"\n\n1:27 p.m.: Schiller demonstrating the value of that massive 12.9-inch screen, featuring apps like Autocad and iMovie. The iPad Pro will boast 10 hours of battery life, says Schiller. For the first time in an Apple product, iPad Pro will have a four-speaker audio system.\n\n1:25 p.m.: The iPad Pro will boast an A9X chip, 1.8 times faster than the previous chip, says Schiller. \"This is desktop class performance.\" Graphics processing is twice as fast.\n\n1:23 p.m.: The display measure 2732 x 2048 resolution, or 5.6 million pixels. \"It is a beautiful display,\" says Schiller. \"This is the most advanced display we've ever built.\"\n\n1:22 p.m.: Phil Schiller hits the stage to talk iPad Pro. The 12.9-inch screen is big enough to support a full-sized keyboard.\n\n1:20 p.m.: Cook boasts \"the biggest news in iPad since the iPad.\" It's the iPad Pro. And it looks really big. Certainly much bigger than the standard iPad.\n\n1:18 p.m.: WatchOS 2 will launch on September 16, while the new finishes for Apple Watch are available starting today. Cook returns on stage to talk iPad.\n\n1:16 p.m.: Video montage time. Lots of Apple Watches on screen. Seeing one with a red strap and a newer model in what looks like a pinkish color. Gold and rose gold are among the two new Watch finish. They're available in 38mm and 42mm for the same price as the Sport lineup. The red band option is part of Product(Red), with a portion of proceeds from sales going to AIDS research.\n\n1:14 p.m.: Williams returns to talk about offering more Apple Watch choices. Luxury designer Hermes will partner with Apple on a watch with leather strap and special watch face. The Apple Watch Hermes arrives in October.\n\n1:12 p.m.: The AirStrip demo shifts to how doctors can talk with patients. Using a feature Sense4Baby, the doctor asks for a non-stress test. The monitor can read a mother's heart rate, a baby's heart rate and contractions. Mothers can even hear the baby's heart rate through the wrist. After reviewing results, the doctor can message the patient with details.\n\n1:10 p.m.: A demo of AirStrip shows how doctors can use AirStrip. Medical professionals can view patient info, vitals, lab results and other details. The user is authenticated throughout the experience as long as the watch remains on their wrist. Professionals can even view real-time vital signs. Very cool.\n\n1:08 p.m.: Apple's Jeff Williams talks about the next phase of Apple Watch. Maps will add transit, and fresh apps such as Facebook Messenger will join the selection of more than 10,000 apps available on the device. There's also iTranslate, which translates vocal commands into 90 languages, GoPro, and AirStrip, a health-based app.\n\n1:05 p.m.: Cook sings the praises of Apple Watch, sharing how much consumers love their wearable device.

The event starts with Apple CEO Tim Cook taking the stage to loud applause. \"We could not be more excited to be here this morning,\" says Cook. He adds many of Apple's employees are also among attendees. Explains the very loud cheers.\n\n12:55 p.m. ET: The stream on Apple's website has already started, with attendees settling in as music from the live radio station Beats 1 plays. Remember, everyone: it's ALWAYS ON and WORLDWIDE. In case you forgot.\n\nORIGINAL STORY\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Apple shut down its online store ahead of its announcement in San Francisco.\n\nHowever, that's not the device that seems to be capturing the most buzz. It's Apple TV, the set-top box expected to undergo a major overhaul. The gadget is also expected to make an appearance at Apple's event.\n\nThe next Apple TV will reportedly boast a faster processor, an interface resembling the iPhone and iPad experience, a revamped remote with touchpad and physical buttons, and support for voice controls through Siri.\n\nSpeaking of the digital assistant, judging by Apple's invite, get ready to hear a lot more about Siri.\n\nAs for the next iPhone, prepare for the usual perks such as a better processor and improved camera (and, if we're lucky, better battery life). The big feature expected to appear on the next iPhone is Force Touch, which allows the touchscreen to recognize inputs based on the amount of pressure applied by the user.\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/business/southwest-airlines-service-meltdown/index.html", "title": "Flight cancellations: Why Southwest Airlines is melting down | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nA punishing winter storm that dumped multiple feet of snow across much of America led to widespread flight cancellations over the Christmas holiday. By Monday, air travel was more or less back to normal – unless you booked your holiday travel with Southwest Airlines.\n\nMore than 90% of Wednesday’s US flight cancellations were Southwest flights, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Southwest canceled more than 2,500 flights. The next highest: SkyWest, with 77.\n\nSouthwest warned that it would continue canceling flights until it could get its operations back on track. The company’s CEO said this has been the biggest disruption he’s seen in his career. The Biden administration is investigating.\n\nWhat gives? Southwest had a combination of bad luck and bad planning.\n\nThe storm hit Chicago and Denver hard, where Southwest has two of its biggest hubs – Chicago Midway airport and Denver International airport.\n\nMore bad luck: The storm hit just as the so-called tripledemic surged across America, leaving people and their families sick with Covid, the flu and RSV. Although Southwest says it was fully staffed for the holiday weekend, illness makes adjusting to increased system stress difficult. Many airlines still lack sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they’re allowed to work under federal safety regulations.\n\nUnderinvestment\n\nBut Southwest (LUV) also hurt itself with an aggressive schedule and by underinvesting in its operations.\n\nSouthwest’s schedule includes shorter flights with tighter turnaround times, which are causing some of the problems, Kathleen Bangs, a FlightAware spokesperson, told CNN.\n\n“Those turnaround times bog things down,” Bangs said.\n\nStranded customers have been unable to get through to Southwest’s customer service lines to rebook flights or find lost baggage.\n\nEmployees also said they have not been able to communicate with the airline, the president of the union that represents Southwest’s flight attendants told CNN Monday.\n\n“The phone system the company uses is just not working,” Lyn Montgomery, President of TWU Local 556, told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “They’re just not manned with enough manpower in order to give the scheduling changes to flight attendants, and that’s created a ripple effect that is creating chaos throughout the nation.”\n\nOn a call with employees Monday, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson explained that the company’s outdated scheduling software quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the storm cleared, according to a transcript of the call that was obtained by CNN from an aviation source.\n\nThe extreme cold, ice and snow grounded planes and left some crew members stranded, so Southwest’s crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight crews can work, complicating Southwest’s scheduling efforts.\n\n“The process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our technology,” Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew, but the company’s scheduling software wasn’t able to match them quickly and accurately, Watterson added.\n\n“As a result, we had to ask our crew schedulers to do this manually, and it’s extraordinarily difficult,” he said. “That is a tedious, long process.”\n\nWatterson noted that manual scheduling left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.\n\n“They would make great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would unravel their work,” Watterson said. “So, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.”\n\nIn reducing the company’s flights by two thirds, Southwest should have “more than ample crew resources to handle that amount of activity,” Watterson said.\n\nThe problems Southwest faces have been brewing for a long time, said Captain Casey Murray, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.\n\n“We’ve been having these issues for the past 20 months,” he told CNN. “We’ve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.”\n\nHe said the airline’s operations haven’t changed much since the 1990s.\n\n“It’s phones, it’s computers, it’s processing power, it’s the programs used to connect us to airplanes – that’s where the problem lies, and it’s systemic throughout the whole airline,” he said.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan, in a message to employees obtained by CNN, acknowledged many of Murray’s concerns, and promised the company will invest in better systems.\n\n“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Jordan told employees. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”\n\nHe said the airline is “committed to and invested in” improving its systems, but “we need to be able to produce solutions faster.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday urged consumers to check if they’re eligible for compensation as cascading airline delays have disrupted holiday travel across the country.\n\n“Our Administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable,” Biden tweeted.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation said it is investigating.\n\n“USDOT is concerned by Southwest’s unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays & reports of lack of prompt customer service,” the agency tweeted. “The Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan.”\n\nTo recover, Jordan told the Wall Street Journal the company plans to operate just over a third of its schedule in upcoming days to give itself the ability for crews to get into the right positions.\n\nNot Southwest’s first rodeo\n\nIf this is all ringing a bell, that’s because this isn’t the first time Southwest’s service melted down in epic fashion. In October 2021, Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over a four-day period, costing the airline $75 million.\n\nSouthwest blamed that service meltdown on a combination of bad weather in Florida, a brief problem with air traffic control in the area and a lack of available staff to adjust to those problems. It has admitted it was having service problems caused by short staffing even before the thousands of canceled flights stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nSimilar to this month’s service mayhem, Southwest fared far worse than its competitors last October. While Southwest canceled hundreds of flights in the days following the peak of October’s disruption, competitors quickly returned to normal service.\n\nLater that month, on a call with Wall Street analysts, then-CEO Gary Kelly said the company had made adjustments to prevent a similar meltdown in the future.\n\n“We have reined in our capacity plans to adjust to the current staffing environment, and our ontime performance has improved, accordingly,” said Kelly on October 21. “We are aggressively hiring to a goal of approximately 5,000 new employees by the end of this year, and we are currently more than halfway toward that goal.”\n\nAnd, just like the latest disruption, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association claimed the cancellations were due to “management’s poor planning.”\n\n– CNN’s Ross Levitt contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/tech/iphone-14-lock-screen/index.html", "title": "The biggest change to the new iPhone isn't the hardware | CNN ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nWhen iPhone 14 users aren’t using their new Apple device, the screen is hardly asleep. It’ll remain lit with prominently displayed widgets such as alarms, calendar appointments and sports scores flittering with real-time updates, and be at the ready if you glance down or inevitably pick it back up.\n\nApple’s new flagship lineup, which goes on sale in stores on Friday, features the biggest ever change to the lock screen – precious real estate that had mostly been a wasteland of alerts up until this point. It’s not a new concept; Android has supported an always-on-display for a while but this is a first for Apple. Not only is it a way to keep users more tethered to their devices in a more passive way, the notion of finding something new to do with old space comes as purse-strapped consumers must find a reason to trade in or buy devices without major hardware upgrades.\n\n“This was like an empty garage now being fully utilized,” said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “It will clearly increase time spent on the phone. … We view it as a genius strategic move.”\n\nWhile interactive lock screens are typically limited – allowing for a quick check of notifications, the time, reminders, calendar appointments, and writing notes – Apple is adding more customization and flexibility to the lock screen. It’ll also show, for example, the progress of takeout delivery and an Uber arriving at your home — information previously found only inside apps. (For those who find it too complicated, they can quiet any and all widgets.)\n\nThe new lock screen also gives a way to showcase photos, select custom font styles and colors, and provides better placement of notifications now at the bottom of the screen.\n\n“Apple isn’t always first and increasingly they may seem behind the curve, but when they bring something to market, it tends to be very well executed,” said Michael Inouye, a principal analyst from ABI Research.\n\nInouye, however, believes an always-on display could reduce the amount of time spent on the device, allowing users to do more without having to search through apps and make the most of multitasking. “When it’s only a quick notification on the lock screen and it’s not interactive, that prevents those unanticipated deviations from our initial task,” he said.\n\nWhether the lock screen saves time or pulls a user deeper into a time suck will likely be dependent on the individual. Apple told CNN that what a user interacts with on their lock screen will not impact their Screen Time, the iPhone’s internal tracker that monitors a user’s engagement throughout the week.\n\nApple’s new lock screen joins a handful of buzzy changes coming to the iPhone 14 lineup, such as the Dynamic Island, a pill-shaped area at the top of the screen that replaces the much-maligned notch. It enlarges and shrinks when calls come in, music is played or other features are in use.\n\nBut much like the lock screen, Apple is trying to get the most out of what minor areas have largely been untouched for years.\n\n“These are all things companies are doing to show improvements when it’s becoming increasingly difficult to do so from the hardware side,” Inouye said. “Even though the hardware certainly makes advancements, from most consumers’ perspective they aren’t going to notice the differences in their normal day to day usage. But these changes are noticeable.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewed/2021/09/17/how-pre-order-new-iphone-13-ipad-ipad-mini/8350240002/", "title": "Here's how to pre-order the new Apple devices, announced Tuesday", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

There's also a new iPad (9th gen) and iPad Mini, and a new Apple Watch. The new iPads went up for pre-order earlier in the week, but we've had to wait patiently for the new phones.\n\nGet expert shopping advice delivered to your phone. Sign up for text message alerts from the deal-hunting nerds at Reviewed.\n\nWell, the wait is over! The new iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max are available for pre-order now, starting at $699. Here's what you need to know about Apple's new lineup—and how you can lock in a pre-order right now to get one for yourself.\n\nThe iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini (starting at 128Gb storage sizes for $799 and $699, respectively) offer slightly modified designs across five fetching color schemes: Product Red, Starlight, Midnight, Blue, and Pink.\n\nApple SVP of Worldwide Marketing, Greg Joswiak, has claimed that both the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini will be \"more powerful, more capable, and more fun to use,\" citing improvements such as advanced camera systems, better durability and waterproofing, and superior battery performance as powered by the new A15 Bionic chip.\n\nBoth the iPhone 13's 6.1-inch display and iPhone 13 Mini's 5.4-inch display come equipped with Ceramic Shield, which Apple claims is the strongest screen protection, and both devices boast IP68 dust/waterproofing so you'll never have to worry about dunking them. New Super Retina XDR displays deliver up to 800 nits of peak brightness with regular content, and up to 1,200 nits while playing HDR content.\n\nCamera designs and components have also been improved. The iPhone 13 and Mini feature redesigned rear camera layouts with diagonally arranged lenses, enabling a dual-camera system that features Apple's TrueDepth and Face ID technology. Apple has also added an exciting new video mode, Cinematic Mode, which not only records live in Dolby Vision HDR but also automatically tracks subjects and racks focus to give video a cinematic feel.\n\nIf all of this sounds like it will drain your battery in a hot second, there's good news: both the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini also boast improved battery life over the previous generation, up to two and a half hours more in a day for the regular 13, and 90 minutes for the Mini.\n\nBoth the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini are available for pre-order today, and will ship by September 24th.\n\nApple also unveiled the new iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max, also starting at 128Gb configurations (with the possibility of up to 1TB) for $999 and $1,099, respectively. This year's Pro models are available in Graphite, Gold, Silver, and Sierra Blue finishes.\n\nJoswiak called the new 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max Apple's \"most pro\" lineup ever, specifically citing their professional-grade camera capabilities and improved displays as exciting developments.\n\nThe phones' rear cameras have new ISPs (image signal processors) powered by the same A15 Bionic chipset, as well as larger 1.9 µm sensors and f/1.5 apertures. These upgrades should make for better low-light shooting during photo and video. Both the Pro and Pro Max also feature a new 77mm Telephoto lens for distance photography, a feature that sets them apart from the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini models.\n\nThe array of camera improvements mean iPhone's traditional Night mode can be applied to every camera lense—even the Telephoto lens. Additionally, each can shoot in Smart HDR 4, boosting aspects like color saturation and perceptual contrast.\n\nThe iPhone 13 Pro models have also been given souped-up screens. Super Retina XDR with ProMotion supports up to 1,000 nits brightness and adaptive refresh rates from 10Hz to 120Hz. This allows the refresh rate to scale as needed to match your content. This should not only make for an experience that's adaptively smooth, but it should also help to conserve battery life.\n\nNaturally, Apple has also boosted the 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max battery life, claiming the 13 Pro will get a 90-minute bump over the 12 Pro and the 13 Pro Max will get 2.5 hours more. Both the 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max naturally also feature Apple's Ceramic Shield protection and IP68 dust/waterproofing.\n\nBoth the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max are available for pre-order now, shipping September 24th.\n\nPre-order the new iPad and iPad Mini\n\nThe newest iPad (9th gen) takes advantage of iPadOS 15 and a new A13 Bionic chip to make wholesale improvements over the previous (8th gen) model. According to Apple, the A13 chip makes for 20% faster CPU, GPU, and neural engine functions.\n\nApple also claims the new iPad is three times faster than the best-selling Chromebook, and as much as six times faster than the best-selling Android tablet, while iPadOS 15 enables faster multi-tasking and easier note-taking.\n\nThe new iPad's cameras have also been improved: the front camera now supports 12MP ultra-wide photography and has inherited Center Stage capabilities from the iPad Pro. This allows the camera to digitally follow subjects during video chats. The A13 chip works in tandem with the improved camera and an updated image processor to offer better image capturing capabilities than any previous iPad.\n\nIf you'd prefer something smaller, Apple claims the latest upgrade to the iPad Mini is its biggest update ever. A new enclosure, made from 100% recycled aluminum, showcases an 8.3-inch \"All Screen\" design designed to minimize bezels and maximize screen coverage. The Liquid Retina display boasts low reflectivity and up to 500 nits of brightness.\n\nThe Mini has also received wholesale improvements to its components. Apple showcased an improved neural engine supporting downloads of up to 3.5 Gbps, 40% better CPU, 80% better GPU, and a new stereo speaker system in landscape mode.\n\nThe cameras have also been improved. Like the iPad, the Mini is getting Center Stage support with 12MP rear and front cameras and a larger aperture with improved pixel sensors.\n\nThe new 10.2-inch iPad is available in Space Gray or Silver, with options for cellular models, starting at $329. The iPad Mini is available for pre-order in Purple, Pink, Starlight, or Space Gray for $499.\n\nNeed help finding products? Sign up for our weekly newsletter.

Your Apple Watch checks for irregular rhythms, sends you a notification and records the data in the Health app.\n\nIrregular rhythms could indicate atrial fibrillation (Afib), where the heart’s upper chambers beat out of sync with the lower chambers. Seriously dangerous stuff.\n\nHere’s how to check up on your HRV data:\n\n• Open the Health app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap Browse in the bottom right corner.\n\n• Tap Heart > Heart Rate Variability.\n\n• At the top, choose to view your data by day, week, month, half-year, and year.\n\nHere’s how to enable irregular rhythm notifications:\n\n• Open the Health app.\n\n• Tap Browse in the bottom right corner.\n\n• Tap Heart > Irregular Rhythm Notifications.\n\n• Once enabled, turn irregular rhythm notifications on or off in the Apple Watch app on your iPhone:\n\n• Open the Apple Watch app, tap the My Watch tab, then go to Heart > Irregular Rhythm.\n\nA nursing student said an Apple Watch notification helped detect a rare abnormality. Amazing stuff.\n\n3. High and low heart rates\n\nYour Apple Watch checks for low and high heart rates that could indicate an underlying condition. You can be notified when your heart rate goes above 120 bpm or drops below 40 bpm while inactive for 10 minutes.\n\nYou can turn on heart rate notifications when you first open the Heart Rate app on your Apple Watch or at any time from your iPhone:\n\n• Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap the My Watch tab, then tap Heart.\n\n• Tap High Heart Rate and choose a BPM.\n\n• Tap Low Heart Rate and choose a BPM.\n\n4. Respiratory rate\n\nYour respiratory rate refers to the number of times you breathe in a minute. This goes up as you exercise and down as you sleep. When you wear your Apple Watch to bed, it automatically measures and records your respiratory rate.\n\nWhen your respiratory rate is significantly higher or lower than usual while you sleep, it could indicate illness or a health condition.\n\nTo track your respiratory rate, you’ll need to set up the sleep features on your iPhone:\n\n• Open the Health app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap Get Started under Set Up Sleep and tap Next.\n\n• Follow the onscreen prompts.\n\n• Turn on Track Sleep with Apple Watch. This option is available during setup if you’ve paired your Apple Watch with your iPhone beforehand. If you pair your Apple Watch after setup, you can turn on Track Sleep with Apple Watch later.\n\nTo view your respiratory heart rate:\n\n• Open the Health app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap Browse at the bottom right of the screen.\n\n• Tap Respiratory > Respiratory Rate.\n\n5. Activity\n\nActivity Rings track your movement, exercise, and time on your feet. The rings fill up as you go through the motions. Addicting, right?\n\nYou can check your daily progress and activity history on your iPhone at any time:\n\n• Open the Fitness app on your iPhone.\n\n• Tap Activity in the Summary tab to see details about your activity.\n\n• Tap the calendar to see your progress for the month. To see more details, tap a day.\n\n• To get information about a workout, such as your route or total distance, scroll down to the Workouts section, then tap the item.\n\nTECH SMARTS ON THE GO: Long-lost Bible passage, 800+ free TV channels & the secret to cheap flights\n\nPlus, popular apps have ties to Communist China.

Yet as broader economic forecasts get downgraded left and right, it might be a hard time to convince people to upgrade their iPhones.\n\n“Apple faces a real conundrum of pricing,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at market research firm CCS Insight. On top of inflation and cost-of-living pressures wreaking havoc on consumers, he noted that Apple simultaneously faces rising costs associated with iPhone components and transportation.\n\n“My expectation is that Apple will probably have to nudge prices up,” Wood told CNN Business. But given the strain consumers are facing, he thinks Apple will also do “everything they can to make that as minimal as possible.”\n\nBeyond the broader signals of a worsening economy, Apple is also facing other headwinds as it prepares for the product launch next week. Supply chain hiccups stemming from China’s zero-Covid policy were partly linked to the company’s 11% year-over-year drop in quarterly profits reported last month. Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call, however, that there was “no obvious evidence of macroeconomic impact” to iPhone sales. Cook added that the company even set a third-quarter record “for both revenue and switchers to iPhone,” adding that “customers continue to find that iPhone remains the gold standard for smartphones.”\n\nSteadfast iPhone sales are linked in part to other the predictions from some industry insiders that Apple will hike up the price of its newest iPhones – though it is difficult to predict by just how much.\n\nMing-Chi Kuo, an influential Apple analyst based in Asia, tweeted earlier this month that he expects Apple to raise the average selling price of the iPhone 14 lineup by some 15% compared to the iPhone 13 lineup. (Currently, the regular, non-mini, iPhone 13 starts at $799, the iPhone 13 Pro starts at $999 and the iPhone 13 Pro Max starts at $1,099.)\n\nIn a research note Monday, analysts Dan Ives and John Katsingris of Wedbush Securities predicted that Apple would raise the price of its newest higher-end models by some $100. “We believe a $100 price increase on the iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max is likely in store given component price increases as well as added functionality on this new release,” the note stated. The cameras on the upcoming iPhone Pro models are rumored to be upgraded to possibly justify the price increase, among other enhancements.\n\nThe Wedbush analysts also predicted strong underlying demand for the next iPhone, estimating that some 240 million out of 1 billion iPhone users worldwide have not upgraded their phones in over three and a half years.\n\nWood also noted that Apple’s iPhones are in some ways insulated from macroeconomic pressures. Consumers are also increasingly looking at smartphones as “almost essential,” compared to some other tech gadgets. “Whether you really need an iPhone or not, that’s open to questions, but people who have an iPhone already are unbelievably loyal,” Wood said.\n\n“I think that Apple has some advantages over rivals,” he added. “There are people who are always waiting for a new iPhone.”\n\nApple, in its famously tight-lipped fashion during the the lead-up to its product launches, did not respond to CNN Business’ request for comment Monday on the latest iPhone prices. The company sent out invites last week for its September 7 event, which has been cryptically dubbed: “Far out.”\n\nThe event will be broadcast on Apple’s website from the company’s Cupertino, California, headquarters starting at 1 p.m. ET.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}]}

This is why we decided to take a look at the biggest, baddest national parks on the planet. These are the places where you can truly escape and travel for hundreds -- or thousands -- of miles through backcountry ranging from African savanna to alpine meadows.\n\nOf course, when speaking of these huge protected areas, using the word \"national park\" is a bit misleading. While some -- such as the only American destination to make the list -- fall under this category, others are called \"reserves\" or \"conservation areas,\" among other titles. The diversity continues from there. While the entirety of some wilderness areas falls in one country, others span several to create massive, trans-boundary escapes. To further differentiate, some protected areas are marine parks, while others are some of the most arid regions of the world. Still, they all have one thing in common: They preserve the idea of wilderness better than any other spot on the planet simply based on their sheer size. Nowhere else on Earth can you wander so far without the sights or sound of civilization.\n\nIt's also interesting to note that, in recent years, some protected areas have been expanding thanks to the work of International Peace Parks in North America, Europe and Asia, as well as efforts by Transfrontier Conservation Areas in southern Africa.\n\nExpanding the wilderness across country borders has numerous positive impacts. For instance, large mammal herds can migrate over their historic territory regardless of political borders and governments can boost eco-tourism by allowing visitors to cross areas covering several countries without legal concerns.\n\nWhile none of the Transfrontier Parks made this list, Peace Parks include the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park and the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area. Odds are, the world's largest parks will shift over the next several decades as these organizations begin to play a greater role in conservation.\n\n1. Northeast Greenland National Park, Greenland\n\nSize: 927,000 square kilometers\n\nDate established: 1974\n\nWhen Denmark decided to establish a wilderness area in its protectorate Greenland, the country did it once and did it right. The only national park on the world's largest island is bigger than all but 30 countries. Forty percent of the world's musk ox population, as well as polar bears, walrus, arctic fox, snowy owls and numerous other species call this place home. If you want to visit, make sure to plan your trip and pack carefully. This area stays in near-darkness for four months out of the year and summer temperatures are rarely above 40 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n2. Chagos Marine Protected Area, British Indian Ocean Territory\n\nSize: 640,000 square kilometers\n\nDate established: 2010\n\nThis marine reserve, located in the central Indian Ocean, is twice the size of the UK and protects the world's largest coral atoll and one of the most pristine reefs in the world. Thanks to a generous donation from the Bertarelli Foundation (funded by Italian-born Swiss billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli), the policing of this no-take protected area will be funded through 2015. The Chagos Archipelago comprises 55 tiny islands home to 20 species of coral, 784 different species of fish, green and Hawksbill turtles, 18 species of birds, and the world's largest terrestrial arthropod: the coconut crab.\n\n3. Phoenix Islands Protected Area, Kiribati\n\nSize: 408,250 square kilometers\n\nDate established: 2008\n\nAlthough this protected area is roughly the size of California, its total land area is just 9.7 square miles. PIPA includes all eight atolls and low reef islands of the Kiribati section of the Phoenix Islands, and its abundance of extinct underwater volcanoes provide a variety of marine habitats. Conservation International named the Phoenix Islands as a Key Biodiversity Area and five of the eight islands were named Important Bird Areas by Birdlife International. This area is home to what is believed to be the the largest concentrations of some species in the world, including the vulnerable white-throated (Polynesian) storm-petrel, lesser frigatebird and blue noddy.\n\n4. Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, Hawaii and the Midway Atoll\n\nSize: 360,000 square kilometers\n\nDate established: 2006\n\nPapahanaumokuakea became the first mixed UNESCO World Heritage Site when it made the list on July 30, 2010. The unique nomination recognized the area's significant biological and cultural importance. Indigenous Hawaiians navigated these waters for thousands of years and modern Hawaiians still travel through the area in traditional double-hulled sailing canoes for navigational training. In addition, Papahanaumokuakea is a nesting and foraging ground for 14 million seabirds and one of the last predator-dominated coral reef ecosystems on Earth with an abundance of sharks and jacks.\n\nThis protected area includes ten islands and atolls in the northwest main Hawaiian Archipelago and includes the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, Battle of Midway National Memorial, Hawaii State Seabird Sanctuary at Kure Atoll and the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands State Marine Refuge.\n\n5. Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia\n\nSize: 345,400 square kilometers\n\nDate established: 1975\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef (and largest living structure) on the planet, and was elected a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1981. The marine park includes 3,000 coral reefs, 600 continental islands, 300 coral cays and approximately 150 inshore mangrove islands. Home to 1,500 species of fish, 4,000 types of mollusk and endangered species including the dugong and the large green turtle, this area is of significant scientific interest and biological importance.\n\n6. Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe\n\nSize: 287,132 square kilometers\n\nDate established: 2010\n\nThis extensive network of parks (also called KAZA) provides vital transfrontier wildlife corridors for species such as lion, zebra, wildebeest and Africa's largest contigous elephant populations. KAZA includes 17 different game and national parks including Victoria Falls National Park (pictured) and Zambezi National Park.\n\n7. Galápagos Marine Reserve, Ecuador\n\nSize: 133,000 square kilometers\n\nDate established: 1986\n\nWhen Charles Darwin first visited the Galápagos in 1835, he was struck by how much species varied from island to island. In fact, his observations of the different iguanas, tortoises and -- in particular -- finches during his initial five-week visit inspired his theory of evolution. Found at the confluence of three ocean currents, the Galápagos has a unique mix of marine species, such as sharks and rays. In addition, the unique altitude, orientation and extreme isolation of the islands led to the evolution of an unusual array of terrestrial wildlife. The Galápagos boasts many different reptiles including lizards, geckos and 11 subspecies of giant tortoises. With the exception of two marine tortoises, these reptiles are all endemic. Notable birds include a vast array of Darwin's finches, the Galápagos flightless cormorant, Galápagos penguin and lava gull.\n\n8. Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe\n\nSize: 99,800 square kilometers\n\nDate established: 2002\n\nGreat Limpopo Transfrontier Park covers regions of Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe, creating a transborder wilderness including some of the most established wildlife areas in Southern Africa such as Kruger National Park and Limpopo National Park.

Everglades is a lot more subtle on the views.”\n\nThe park’s website notes Everglades boasts the “largest continuous strand of sawgrass prairie in North America” and “largest mangrove ecosystem in the western hemisphere.”\n\nBut as Gantt notes, “It doesn’t always wow people at first sight. It’s really in the details.”\n\nHere’s what travelers should know about Everglades, the latest national park in USA TODAY’s yearlong series.\n\nWhat is the Everglades famous for?\n\nEverglades is known for its wildlife.\n\nThe park is home to nine unique habitats, hundreds of bird species, as well as endangered West Indian Manatees and Florida panthers, but its most famous residents may be alligators and crocodiles.\n\n“South Florida is the only place in the world where you get alligators and crocodiles together,” Gantt said.\n\nShe explained it’s the southernmost range for alligators and the northernmost range for the American crocodile. And while alligators are generally a freshwater species and crocodiles usually live in salt water, she said they can both be found in brackish water within the park.\n\nWhat are five other interesting facts about the Everglades?\n\nWhich part of Florida is the Everglades?\n\nEverglades National Park spans more than 1.5 million acres of South Florida.\n\nVisitors may enter from Miami, Homestead or Everglades City, near Naples, by land, and should note that the park’s entrances are not connected by road.\n\n“There are a little more creative ways by boat, but not by car,” Gantt said. “And we do have a lot of people coming into the park from the Florida Keys by boat.”\n\nThe nearest major airport is Miami International Airport.\n\nWhat is the best time to visit Everglades National Park?\n\nThere are two main seasons in the park: the wet season from May to November and the dry season from December through April.\n\nThe popular dry season offers cooler temperatures, lower humidity and fewer mosquitoes.\n\n“It’s the best time for (viewing) wildlife,” Gantt said. “As water concentrates, the fish concentrate, which pulls in all of the birds and alligators and turtles, and you can just see everything in concentrated areas.\"\n\nThe wet season has its own perks.\n\n“Summer’s a great time to get out on the water,” Gantt said. “We get some amazing cloud formations in the summer … I think of them as our mountains. And you see different things. It’s a little bit greener. The park looks lush because there’s water everywhere.\" Plus there are fewer people.\n\nShe noted the shoulder months of November and May can offer a bit of both seasons, including storms. She added that September and October are the busiest times for hurricanes, and the week between Christmas and New Year’s is the busiest time for visits.\n\nWhat kinds of activities can you do in the Everglades?\n\nLike other national parks, Everglades offers opportunities for bicycling, bird watching, camping, hiking and more.\n\nOne of the more unique activities is slough slogging, a wet guided walk through sawgrass prairies and cypress forests. It’s one of several ranger-led programs at the park. Visitors can also book airboat, kayak and tram and other tours through authorized third-party providers.\n\nIs it safe to swim in the Everglades?\n\n“Swimming/snorkeling is prohibited in all canals, ponds, freshwater lakes, marked channels, and boat basins inside the park,” according to the park.\n\nAdditionally, the park warns that while nature provides Everglades’ alligators and crocodiles plenty to eat and they don’t actively seek people or pets, visitors should still keep a safe distance of at least 15-20 feet from them and any wildlife.\n\n“They look like they’re napping, basking in the sun. A lot of people think they’re statues,” Gantt said of the gators and crocodiles. “But they’re wild animals.”\n\nCan you just drive through Everglades National Park?\n\nA car or other form of transportation is required to visit Everglades because there is no public transportation in the massive park.\n\nAn entrance pass is also needed, except on fee-free days. Passes are good for a whole week. They cost $30 for private vehicles or vessels, $25 per motorcycle and $15 for individuals over age 15 entering on foot, bike or paddle-craft.\n\nFree national park access for families:What to know about Every Kid Outdoors\n\nWho are the Native people of the Everglades?\n\nThe historic Calusa, Tequesta, Jega and Ais tribes all had ties to the area, according to the park.

But over the centuries, logging, farming and the expansion of cities wiped most of those forests out.\n\n“There's a big cultural aspect to our landscape, as well,” Manchester said. From early Native American inhabitants to Spanish explorers to English settlers to enslaved people seeking refuge in the wilderness, people have interacted with the land for thousands of years.\n\nWhat happened to the Congaree people?\n\nCongaree National Park is named after the Congaree people who once lived there.\n\n“Unfortunately, not much is known about the Congaree as a significant number of their population is thought to have died in the 17th and 18th century, likely due to warfare and disease brought on by European colonization,” according to the park’s website. “Over time, remaining Congaree would have been absorbed into neighboring tribes.”\n\n“This area probably was within territory that was used by three of the major Southeastern tribes: the Cherokee, the Catawba and the Creek or Muskogee,” Manchester said. “Those three would have had interactions with this landscape, and the Congaree would have been one of those tribes that actually lived within this landscape.”\n\n'This is a different world':What to know about Channel Islands National Park\n\nHow much time should I spend at Congaree National Park?\n\nVisitors can get a taste of Congaree National Park within a few hours or spend a full day exploring its more than 26,000 acres.\n\nCongaree offers several free ranger-led programs, which can be found on its schedule of events online, but most adventures are self-guided.\n\nThe park’s 2.6-mile Boardwalk Loop is accessible to visitors of various ages and abilities. Kayaking, canoeing and fishing are other popular activities. Visitors should note the park doesn’t rent kayaks or canoes, but they are available through third-party outfitters. And a valid South Carolina fishing license is required for fishing. Freshwater licenses cost $11 for 14 days for out-of-state residents.\n\nWhat is the best time of year to visit Congaree?\n\nSpring and autumn are among the best times to visit. Spring means lots of green and temperatures are relatively mild, and autumn brings out beautiful colors.\n\nSummer can be hot and thunderstorms can pop up unexpectedly. Flooding is most frequent in the winter. Manchester says visitors are sometimes disappointed when there is flooding, but “without that flooding, we don't have the park.”\n\n“We wouldn't have the big, old-growth trees. We wouldn't have the diversity of plant life,” he said. “So coming to see it even when it's flooded, even if it does limit how far you can go, you're seeing what makes the park what it is.”\n\nDoes Congaree have alligators? Bears?\n\nIn the summertime, Manchester says, one or two gators hang out in Weston Lake and head out by winter. There are also gators near Bates Old Landing, which is not easily accessible by most vehicles.\n\nHe said any bears would be rare and would be only visiting the park, not living there.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/national-parks/2021/02/07/most-visited-national-parks-great-smoky-mountains-grand-canyon/4404666001/", "title": "America's most-visited national parks: Great Smoky Mountains ...", "text": "Julie Loffredi\n\nBroadry Newsroom\n\nPraised for their preserved land that can instantly transport you into a time before humans made their mark on the world, each of America's national parks offers a different way to take in the great outdoors just as it was intended to be.\n\nBased on the latest annual visitation records from the National Park Service, here’s a list of the most visited national parks across the country – and why travelers say it's worth the trip.\n\nSomething to keep in mind: As of Feb. 2, the National Park Service now requires visitors and employees to wear masks inside buildings and facilities and on NPS-managed lands \"when physical distancing cannot be maintained,\" according to the website for the Department of the Interior.

Yosemite National Park\n\nNumber of visitors: 4.5 million in 2019\n\nTaking in the largest waterfall in North America (Yosemite Falls) and the world’s tallest granite monolith (El Capitan) are just two of the reasons why Yosemite National Park in California is one to check off-your bucket list. Get lost in its picturesque Crane Flat area, go horseback riding, or take a guided nature walk of the Sequoia Parks.\n\nOff-premise, you can also fill your calendar with activities like art workshops, visit a local history center, take a ghost tour, dine at an organic farm-to-table cafe, rent a bike to take the trails, spend a day at the nearby aqua park, go white water rafting, take an aerial tour or stop by the local winery.\n\nNote: With the California regional stay-at-home order lifted, the park is no longer closing early. But beginning Feb. 8, you need a reservation if you plan on driving into Yosemite.\n\nTie for No. 4: Zion National Park\n\nNumber of visitors: 4.5 million in 2019\n\nUtah’s first national park is one of the most visited in the nation. It comes in at number four on the list. Zion is known for its massive sandstone cliffs and vast array of plants and animals. Birdwatchers can get a shot at viewing up to 291 species of birds, including the peregrine falcon, the Mexican spotted owl and the proud bald eagle (check out the full Zion bird list here).\n\n3. Rocky Mountain National Park\n\nNumber of visitors: 4.7 million in 2019\n\nRocky Mountain National Park in Colorado is a hiker’s paradise and comes in at No. 3. There’s over 300 trails to choose from (find a full list here). It also has the highest paved roads of any park. Although it's currently closed for the winter, Trail Ridge Road crests at over 12,000 feet and offers many opportunities to stop and gaze at the subalpine and alpine ecosystems (call 970-586-1222 to see which roads are open due to weather conditions). During the winter months, outdoor enthusiasts can try snowshoeing or snowmobiling.\n\nNote: The park recently announced that timed-entry reservations are no longer required. The reservation system was implemented last year for visitors during the pandemic.\n\n2. Grand Canyon National Park\n\nNumber of visitors: 6 million in 2019\n\nLocated entirely in North Arizona, the Grand Canyon is a one-of-a-kind trip with more to do in one place than in any other park. Home to over 300 different species of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, the vast array of wildlife combined with beauty scenery leads many outdoor enthusiasts craving to explore this well-known wonder.\n\nThe South Rim of the park gets the warmth of Arizona while the North Rim is prone to snowfall. So, there’s a much shorter window to enjoy the season on the northern side. Be sure to stop for gas, check the weather, pack plenty of food and clothes and make any camping reservations in advance.\n\n1. Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n\nNumber of visitors: 12.5 million in 2019\n\nThe Great Smoky Mountains, nestled on the Tennessee-North Carolina border, attracts the most recreational visitors out of any other national park in the US.\n\nVisitors can start the day with a kid-friendly hike and explore captivating waterfalls, or plan a picnic in Cades Cove while keeping an eye out for those famous black bears.\n\nGuests can enjoy the preserved history of the national park’s historic homes set among a pristine mountain landscape. Overnight visitors may choose backpack camping, rent a cabin or check into one of their nearby condos. If you prefer to spend your time traveling via horseback, take in all the park has to offer from the saddle.\n\nAdditional reporting by Emmalyn Reid, a freelance writer for Broadry Newsroom", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/national-parks/2023/07/29/top-10-national-parks-for-birding/70410092007/", "title": "Top 10 national parks for birding, plus interactive species map", "text": "Birds’ spring migration and mating season comes to a close by mid-summer as warmer temperatures arrive.

The woman was walking with another person when they encountered two bison. As they turned to walk away from the animal, one of the bison charged at her, causing severe injuries to her chest and stomach, the park said.\n\nMedical personnel and park officials treated the woman on the scene in North Dakota until she could be picked up by an ambulance.\n\nThe woman was transported to a local hospital a short time later, where she is recovering.

They can turn quickly and outrun humans, according to the National Park Service.\n\nIts especially important to keep a distance around this time of year because bulls can be aggressive during mating season, which occurs mid-July through August.\n\nPark regulations require that visitors stay at least 25 yards away from large animals like bison, elk, deer, pronghorn, and horses.\n\nTo avoid interacting with a wild animal at a close distance, turn around and go the other way.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/10greatplaces/2019/01/25/unesco-world-heritage-sites-north-america/2614030002/", "title": "UNESCO World Heritage Sites in North America", "text": "Larry Bleiberg\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nIf Earth had a greatest hits list, it would look something like the roster of World Heritage Sites, which preserve the globe’s most significant locations. “These are very special places,” says Mechtild Rössler, director of the World Heritage Centre in Paris. “You see both cultural and natural beauty.” The list, which celebrated its 40th birthday last year, started with 12 places, and has expanded to nearly 1,100. Almost all are profiled in a new book, \"World Heritage Sites: A Complete Guide\" (Firefly, $35), now in its eighth edition. The list was developed by UNESCO, and while the U.S. withdrew from the U.N. agency last month, it still participates in the World Heritage program. Rössler shares some notable North American places.\n\nEverglades National Park, Florida\n\nSouth Florida’s massive wetlands preserves a complex ecosystem. Sometimes called a river of grass, it also has the largest mangrove forest in the Western Hemisphere. “It’s a sanctuary for very rare and threatened species, a subtropical wilderness reserve on the North America continent,” Rössler says. nps.gov/ever\n\nMonticello and the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia\n\nThomas Jefferson’s architectural masterpieces have drawn international attention since the moment they were constructed, Rössler says. “This is a very special site for the U.S. It reflects Jefferson’s personal aspirations for the character of the new American republic.” Jefferson’s home, Monticello, remains as he built it, with preserved Blue Ridge Mountain views. The university he designed recently restored its rotunda as part of its bicentennial celebration. monticello.org and virginia.edu\n\nSan Antonio Missions, Texas\n\nA chain of five missions reflects how San Antonio once stood on the frontier of the Spanish Empire. While the Alamo’s best known for its role in Texas independence, the other missions are equally impressive, showing how the Spanish drew on natural and Native American symbols to bring Catholicism to its colonies. “There’s quite a linkage in this history,” says Rössler. nps.gov/saan\n\nMammoth Cave National Park, Kentucky\n\nThe world’s largest cave system is a natural for the World Heritage list, says Rössler. “No cave has more types of formations,” she says. “It’s quite exceptional. It shows the stages of the Earth’s evolutionary history, and the ongoing process.” nps.gov/maca\n\nStatue of Liberty, New York\n\nRössler says this towering figure welcoming immigrants to New York Harbor is one of her favorites. “For us in Europe and for many people around the word, it’s a symbol of the United States,” she says. The statue, a gift from France for the U.S. centennial, was built in the then-popular art nouveau style, and placed on a frame designed by Gustave Eiffel, who would soon build his famed tower in Paris. nps.gov/stli\n\nPapahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, Pacific Ocean\n\nAlthough difficult to pronounce, this Pacific preserve is hard to overlook. As the largest protected place on the planet, it covers more than a half-million square miles of islands and atolls. Visits to Midway Island’s bird sanctuary were once possible, but have been restricted due to government cuts. Now one of the only ways to come is as a volunteer. papahanaumokuakea.gov\n\nLa Fortaleza and San Juan National Historic Site, Puerto Rico\n\nThis fort overlooking San Juan was built on a strategic site in the Caribbean between the 16th and 20th centuries. “It’s a kind of European military architecture adapted to the American continent,” Rössler says. Now a park, the prime seaside location makes it popular with locals and visitors alike. nps.gov/saju\n\nRedwood National and State Parks, California\n\nThese parks are devoted to the tallest living things on earth, and what Rössler calls the most impressive trees in the world. “It was quite amazing when I first saw the redwoods. I could never imagine them so big,” she says. “They are a remnant of a huge forest which existed for 160 million years. This is the last bit, so it’s really, really important we preserve it.” nps.gov/redw\n\nTaos Pueblo, New Mexico\n\nPubelo Indians have lived in this northern New Mexico village for nearly 1,000 years, making it one of the oldest continually inhabited communities on the continent. Rössler was visiting when the pueblo won World Heritage status. “We were all dancing together,” she says. taospueblo.com\n\nKluane/Wrangell–St. Elias/Glacier Bay/Tatshenshini-Alsek national parks, Alaska and Canada\n\nThis bi-national collection of parks preserves the rugged scenery and diverse ecosystems on the U.S.-Canada border. Its complex name reflects how the site expanded over time, but even if it’s a mouthful, it’s worth visiting, Rössler says. “It’s one of the biggest sites on the list.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nRecently exposed sandbars along the drought-stricken Mississippi River have caught the attention of fossil hunters, leading to two exceptional finds from a rare ice age species.\n\nWiley Prewitt was exploring a newly exposed area on October 26 when he came across a rather large tooth poking out of the sand. The Oxford, Mississippi, resident would soon learn it was a fossilized jawbone from a giant American lion, a species that has been extinct for roughly 11,000 years.\n\n“I knew immediately just by the shape of the teeth that it was a carnivore fossil, but of course, I did not know that it was (an American) lion. We all know about those, but you never dream that you’re going to find one,” Prewitt said. “I just couldn’t believe it. It was hitting the fossil lottery. ”\n\nA rare American lion fossil has been discovered near the Mississippi River. The tooth, pictured, has a fragment of the jawbone still attached. George Phillips/Mississippi Museum of Natural Science\n\nThe American lion was the largest extinct cat to live in North America during the last ice age, according to the National Park Service. Known by its scientific name, Panthera atrox, meaning “fearsome panther” in Latin, the species was 25% larger than a present-day African lion, standing at 4 feet tall at the shoulders and measuring 5 to 8 feet in length. American lions weighed between 500 to 800 pounds on average, although some of the biggest may have topped 1,000 pounds, the park service notes.\n\nThree days after Prewitt’s find, the Mississippi Fossil and Artifact Symposium & Exhibition hosted an event featuring previously discovered American lion fossils. Prewitt took the fossil in the hope of having experts identify it, but he didn’t know how significant his find would be to understanding a little more about Mississippi’s past.\n\n“When (Prewitt) whipped out that anterior portion of a lion jaw, I knew right away what it was,” said George Phillips, curator of paleontology at the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science, who was at the event. “Who would have thought in a million years that another lion fossil would show up, considering that they’re rare, at an event (in) which the theme was the American lion?”\n\nWhile the fossil was not a complete jawbone, plenty was left to identify the specimen easily, Phillips said: It had a significant gap between the canine and the premolars that could only belong to the American lion. After observing other fossils from the same species at the event, Phillips said it was easy to narrow down the other carnivore possibilities and confirm that he was looking at another fossil from the lion.\n\nThe American lion stood 4 feet tall at the shoulders and measured 5 to 8 feet in length. A femur from the species is the newest addition to the MMNS collection. It is pictured next to other femurs of predators commonly found today. George Phillips/Mississippi Museum of Natural Science\n\nOne week after that surprising discovery, a local wildlife officer pulled a large American lion femur from the river’s sediment, resulting in another fossil from the same scarce species being added to the museum’s collection, Phillips told CNN.\n\nCarnivore fossils are much harder to find in comparison with their prey counterparts, according to Phillips. Two American lion bone discoveries within a week or so is unbelievable, he said, calling it “just an incredibly rare fossil.”\n\nA growing American lion collection\n\nPrewitt plans to donate the fossil he found to the museum in Jackson, which would make it the fourth addition to the institution’s collection of American lion bones, counting the addition of the newly found femur.\n\n“The interesting thing about the river is that every year is different. When the river comes up, the high water exposes different things and covers up other things. So here, you are always looking at new sites,” Prewitt said. “The fossils really make you contemplate deep time, and I think that, for me, that is really part of the magic of it.”\n\nThe first fossil of the American lion was a lower jawbone, found in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1836. It was identified nearly 20 years later by paleontologist Joseph Leidy. George Phillips/Mississippi Museum of Natural Science\n\nThe first fossil of the American lion was found in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1836, but paleontologist Joseph Leidy didn’t identify it until nearly 20 years later. Leidy found that the fossil, a lower jawbone, belonged to a never-before-discovered species. It was larger than the extinct European cave lion, the largest known member of the cat family at the time. Before then, it was unknown that giant lions had roamed North America.\n\n“I think people take greater pride in an area when they realize that something like this exists — some aspect of the antiquity of the area where they live,” Phillips said. “Archaeologists try to do the same thing, to show that there were people that were here before you. Well, there are also extinct, weird-looking creatures that were here before you.”", "authors": ["Taylor Nicioli"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}]}

That's what House Democrats said in 2019 when former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced an impeachment inquiry into former President Donald Trump. Pelosi had long faced calls from Democratic lawmakers to open an impeachment inquiry, but the former speaker publicly downplayed the prospect.\n\nBefore the House, then controlled by Democrats, began its impeachment inquiry into Trump over his dealings with Ukraine, Pelosi stressed that investigations “may take us to a place that’s unavoidable, on impeachment, or not.”\n\nRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., former House Majority Leader, also said at the time that an inquiry is “not” an impeachment, but an investigation.\n\nToday, Republicans control the House, and GOP lawmakers calling to bring an impeachment inquiry against Biden are echoing their Democratic colleagues when they controlled the chamber in 2019.\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has chided reporters for asking questions about impeachment, accusing them of conflating an inquiry with a formal impeachment process.\n\n“There is a big difference” between an inquiry and impeachment, McCarthy said. An impeachment inquiry, he added, is “simply an investigation, and providing Congress the power to do that investigation.\"\n\n'They're trying to deflect':Democrats link GOP push to impeach Biden to Trump indictments\n\nMcCarthy said Democrats have an 'obsession' with impeaching Trump\n\nIn October 2019, when the House approved rules for the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry against Trump, Pelosi argued that an inquiry was not a surefire path towards impeaching the then-president.\n\n“Once the inquiry proceeds, we’ll decide whether we’ll go forward with impeachment. That decision has not been made,” Pelosi said at a press conference.\n\nEven before Pelosi’s cautious remarks and the formal vote on an inquiry, House Republicans blasted Democrats over the proceedings and claimed the inquiry was a clear first step towards impeachment.\n\nThen-House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., accused Democrats of possessing an “impeachment infatuation.”\n\nMcCarthy, who was House Minority Leader then, claimed House Democrats had an “obsession” with impeaching Trump.\n\nHouse Democrats ultimately voted on two articles of impeachment in December 2019, sending the matter to the Senate to hold an impeachment trial, where Trump was acquitted.\n\nTrump, Biden and impeachment timing\n\nThe timing of an impeachment inquiry against Biden is familiar for the House.\n\nTalks of an impeachment inquiry among House Democrats reached a crescendo in September 2019, when Pelosi formally announced her caucus would pursue an inquiry.\n\nIf House Republicans decide to move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry when lawmakers return to Washington in September after their August recess, the timing would be nearly identical.\n\nAt the time, Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., now chair of the House Oversight Committee, argued that instead of beginning impeachment proceedings for a long-shot chance of ousting Trump, Democrats should have placed more attention on defeating him in the upcoming presidential election.\n\n“If they’re confident that Donald Trump is a terrible president, if they’re confident he is a corrupt president, then they have the right to make that case over the next 12 months,” Comer said on C-SPAN at the time.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who is chair of the House Judiciary Committee today, made a similar argument at a press conference after House Democrats formally voted on Trump's impeachment inquiry − and one that's not so far from today's political landscape.\n\n“They are trying to impeach the president of the United States less than 13 months before an election.” Jordan said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/13/joe-biden-impeached-how-many-presidents/70840773007/", "title": "Will Joe Biden be impeached? How many presidents have been ...", "text": "WASHINGTON - House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., announced Tuesday that Republicans in the lower chamber are launching an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.\n\nThe inquiry comes as Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., have long alleged that Biden was improperly involved in his family’s business dealings. GOP lawmakers have particularly targeted the work of Biden's son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThe White House immediately dismissed the inquiry, with special assistant to the president Ian Sams calling the move \"extreme politics at its worst.\" Meanwhile, moderate Republicans have held mixed views on whether an inquiry is the right path forward before their colleagues have laid out more evidence against the president.\n\nThe inquiry also comes at a critical time for Congress, which only has 10 working days to avoid a looming government shutdown, and Biden, who’s seeking reelection in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nBut what is an impeachment inquiry? Will Biden be removed from office? Here's what you need to know.\n\nWhat is an impeachment inquiry?\n\nAn impeachment inquiry is an investigation into a federal official, such as a president or judge, for wrongdoing. It can include public hearings or witness testimony. Typically, there’s a House vote to launch an inquiry into a president, but McCarthy on Tuesday called for the investigation without a vote in the chamber.\n\nThe House has initiated impeachment proceedings more than 60 times, but “fewer than a third of all proceedings have led to full impeachment,” according to the House of Representatives' website.\n\nThe House can impeach an official by a majority vote on articles of impeachment, a written statement of charges against an official.\n\nAfter the House sends articles of impeachment to the Senate, the Senate acts as a court to \"consider evidence, hear witnesses and vote to acquit or convict the impeached official,\" according to the Senate's website. The Constitution requires a two-thirds vote for conviction, in which the penalty would be removal from office.\n\nWhat are the chances of Biden getting impeached and convicted?\n\nCurrently there are not enough votes in the House to impeach Biden, according to David Bateman, a professor of policy and government at Cornell University.\n\nMcCarthy has given conservative Republicans \"a concession they've been demanding since before Biden was president,\" Bateman said. \"But by calling it an impeachment inquiry, and by not requiring the House to vote to authorize it, he has avoided having to force the rest of his conference from voting on it.\"\n\nThere are likely several Republican House members who represent more moderate districts and wouldn't vote for impeachment unless there is actual evidence Biden committed actual treason or a high crime or misdemeanor, said Marc Scholl, a former prosecutor in New York now counsel to the firm Lewis Baach Kaufmann & Middlemiss. The Constitution says the president can be removed from office over \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\n\nEven if the House found a majority to bring charges, it's not likely that two-thirds of the Senate, controlled by Democrats, would convict Biden, Scholl said.\n\nBateman agreed, noting that \"if clearly compelling evidence of extraordinary wrongdoing were discovered, it's possible - though still very unlikely - that there would be enough votes to convict Biden in the Senate.\"\n\nHow many presidents have been impeached?\n\nThree former presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump.\n\nJohnson was impeached in 1868 after he fired Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, an ally of the so-called \"radical Republicans\" in Congress who opposed Johnson's Reconstruction policies. The move, which Johnson's opponents alleged violated the Tenure of Office Act, led to Johnson being impeached with high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nClinton was impeached in 1998 for perjury before a federal grand jury and obstructing justice, according to the Library of Congress. The impeachment revolved around evidence that Clinton had an affair with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern at the time, and tried to cover it up.\n\nTrump was impeached twice. In 2019, he was impeached after he allegedly withheld funds to Ukraine in an attempt to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden, his political rival. The House voted to impeach Trump for two charges – abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Trump was impeached again in 2021 for his alleged incitement of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.\n\nNone of these presidents were convicted by the Senate.\n\nWhat happens if the 2024 election has two impeached presidents?\n\nIn terms of holding office, nothing would change since both candidates would only be impeached, not convicted, according to Scholl.\n\nIf Biden were convicted, he would be precluded from holding office since Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution says a convicted person is “disqualif[ied] to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.\" Though Trump was never convicted in the Senate, some groups have filed lawsuits to get Trump off the ballot in 2024 using the 14th Amendment, which some legal experts argue might not work.\n\nBut impeachment efforts against Trump and Biden could fuel their respective supporters.\n\nKevin Wagner, a political science professor at Florida Atlantic University, previously told USA TODAY that an impeachment inquiry itself will likely rally the GOP base and may increase partisan turnout. But it can also alienate moderate independents in crucial swing states that Trump or Biden would need to cinch in the 2024 race for the White House.\n\n“Crossover votes are important in the general election and the inquiry is likely to hurt efforts to broaden the base, especially in battleground states,\" Wagner said.\n\nCan Supreme Court justices be impeached?\n\nYes, Supreme Court justices can be impeached.\n\nFor instance, Samuel Chase, an associate justice of the Supreme Court, was impeached in 1804 on grounds of allegedly refusing to “dismiss biased jurors and of excluding or limiting defense witnesses in two politically sensitive cases,\" according to the U.S. Senate. He was acquitted by the Senate, however.\n\nScholl said that Article III, Section 1, of the Constitution provides that Justices hold their offices “during good Behaviour.” So, presumably, if the House concludes a justice is not showing “good Behaviour” there can be an impeachment charge brought by the House for the Senate to determine, he said.\n\nBut some have argued that Constitution's standards surrounding \"Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors\" can also apply to Supreme Court justices, since that section involves all civil officers of the federal government, Scholl explained.\n\nRegardless of the logistics, impeachment efforts against Supreme Court justices are extremely rare in modern times.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/12/iowa-delegation-supports-impending-gop-impeachment-inquiry-into-biden/70832886007/", "title": "Iowa Republicans back impending GOP impeachment inquiry into ...", "text": "Members of Iowa's House delegation are backing the impending Republican impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, formally announced Tuesday by Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nSpeaker Kevin McCarthy said he was instructing House committees to open the inquiry, escalating a Republican-led investigation into Biden and his son Hunter's dealings with foreign operatives.\n\nU.S. Rep.

Lindsey Graham indicates he may support Trump impeachment if inquiry establishes 'quid pro quo'\n\nGraham called for the House to give the “same rights to Trump as Clinton and Nixon,” two former presidents, had during their investigations. The measure calls on House Democrats to hold a formal vote to open an impeachment inquiry.\n\nIt also calls for allowing Trump to bring forth witnesses in his defense and give Republicans, who hold the minority in the House, the ability to issue subpoenas, reiterating, \"House Democrats are even denying their own Republican colleagues basic procedural rights that the minority party was granted throughout previous impeachments.”\n\nGraham's resolution comes the day after about three dozen Republican lawmakers protested how Democrats are conducting the inquiry, and temporarily halted the testimony of Defense Department official Laura Cooper by storming the secure briefing room. 47 Republicans on the three committees leading the investigation have access to the closed-door depositions.\n\nGraham also stated Thursday that Republicans are pressuring him to call House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff to testify, but said that would \"cause a lot of damage to the country.\"\n\nHolding a formal vote on opening an inquiry is not required under the Constitution. Schiff has said they will eventually release the transcripts of the closed-door proceedings, and hold public testimonies.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said such a vote is unnecessary under House rules.\n\nSenate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, hit back after Graham’s press conference, staying that “If the White House & its congressional allies truly wanted an open, transparent process: The White House would provide documents Congress requests, not defy subpoenas.”\n\n“Rather than stomp feet in a fit of staged political theater—House Republicans must join us in getting the facts,” he continued.\n\nThe White House has said they will not provide documents or witnesses to House impeachment investigators because it considers their investigation to be unfair and illegitimate.\n\nMore:Donald Trump applauds congressional Republicans for disrupting impeachment investigation\n\nGraham also stated during the presser Thursday that the White House is currently working on assembling a team to work on messaging surrounding the impeachment inquiry.\n\n“I talked to Chief of Staff [Mick] Mulvaney.

Senior GOP sources close to leadership say it’s a matter of when – not if – House Republicans initiate an impeachment inquiry and that Mayorkas has become their No. 1 target, with their base itching for revenge after Trump’s two impeachments.\n\nImpeaching a Cabinet official has only happened once in US history, and the issue would become moot if Mayorkas were to resign. But talk of impeaching Mayorkas already has prompted internal pushback among some veteran Republicans who are skeptical that their policy disputes with the Cabinet secretary meet the bar of charging him with committing “high crimes and misdemeanors.”\n\nYet as they have railed over the migrant crisis in their push to regain the House, a number of leading Republicans fully endorse the idea and acknowledge it’s one that McCarthy will have to deal with if he wins the speakership following the midterms.\n\n“Mayorkas deserves (impeachment) for sure, because we no longer have a border,” said Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a McCarthy ally who is in line to chair the powerful House Judiciary Committee, which oversees impeachment proceedings.\n\nBut while Jordan personally supports the idea, he believes it will be “a conference decision,” saying, “I think we’ll all sit down. Kevin is open to sitting down and figuring out what we do.”\n\nAdded Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, a freshman GOP firebrand who has already endorsed impeachment articles for both Biden and Mayorkas: “Secretary Mayorkas should be a priority. Joe Biden’s his own demise.”\n\nYet McCarthy must also contend with a larger yet less vocal group of moderate and mainstream Republicans, who are wary of the potential political blowback over such a move and warning their colleagues not to weaponize the most powerful oversight tool at their disposal.\n\nGOP Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas said Republicans “should focus on policy” and “leave some of the other more emotional topics for another day.”\n\n“The risk is if people lose faith in the ability of Congress to even do its basic function,” Womack said of voter blowback for impeaching Mayorkas. “The people that I talk to from all stripes tell me they want a Congress that works – not a Congress that is preoccupied with kind of revenge-type agendas. Because then a lot of other things (that) need to happen don’t get to happen. And then that hurts the country.”\n\nSo far, McCarthy has carefully sidestepped impeachment questions, insisting Republicans are not going to pre-determine the outcome but are willing to go wherever the facts and the law lead them.\n\nYet McCarthy has not shut the door on the idea either, particularly when it comes to Mayorkas. And when pressed by CNN on whether Mayorkas is vulnerable to impeachment in a GOP-led House, he replied: “What happens at the border is above everything else.”\n\nDemocrats argue the talk is politically motivated and have instead called for Republicans to revisit immigration legislation that they say would alleviate the influx at the border. Biden’s Homeland Security Department has strongly defended its handling of the migrant crisis at the border, and said Mayorkas is solely focused on his mission at the agency — and has no intention of stepping down.\n\n“Secretary Mayorkas is proud to advance the noble mission of this Department, support its extraordinary workforce, and serve our country,” a DHS spokesman said in a statement. “He has no plan to resign.”\n\nInside the strategy shift\n\nHow McCarthy handles the impeachment drive from his right flank will be a defining moment of his potential speakership. Those calls — while doomed in the Senate — may be difficult, if not impossible, to resist if McCarthy is working with narrow margins in the House, and those demands are only going to grow louder in the immediate aftermath of a potential GOP takeover next month.\n\nSome lawmakers think McCarthy may be more amenable to impeaching Mayorkas than Biden, describing it as a release valve for the inevitable pressure from his right. Going after Mayorkas, even if it’s a fruitless endeavor that would almost certainly fail in the Senate, would also force more attention on immigration and the border, two issues that rile up the GOP base and that Republicans are eager to keep in the spotlight.\n\nIndeed, part of the reason for the shift in strategy: These Republicans believe they’ll have an easier time convincing McCarthy and their GOP colleagues to go along with impeaching a Biden political appointee versus a President who was elected to his position, a more politically tenable move that still would throw red meat to the base, according to GOP sources familiar with their thinking.\n\nAnd of all the various impeachment articles already filed by House Republicans, the resolution calling for Mayorkas to be removed from his post has by far the most cosponsors, with 31 GOP lawmakers backing the effort thus far – including Rep. Yvette Herrell of New Mexico, who is in a competitive reelection race, and Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, who is poised to take over the conservative Republican Study Committee next year.\n\n“There is a greater appetite among Republicans to impeach Mayorkas,” said conservative Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, a member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus. “The reason is, in my opinion, some don’t have the stomach for impeaching Biden or are fearful of the political impact of impeaching Biden. So, (the thinking is) here’s a consolation prize.”\n\nRepublicans say there’s ground to impeach Mayorkas over allegedly failing to maintain operational control of the border, which they argue caused an influx of fentanyl and illegal immigration, while accusing him of standing in the way of more stringent border controls like constructing Trump’s border wall. One GOP congressman, Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, accused Mayorkas of lying to him under oath.\n\nThe DHS has begun staffing up and taking other steps to prepare for potential investigations and impeachment proceedings in a GOP-led House, according to sources familiar with the situation. But the agency has defended how it has handled the situation at the border, while arguing they’re dealing with a broken immigration system.\n\nThe Biden administration is still implementing a Trump-era pandemic emergency rule, known as Title 42, that allows authorities to turn away migrants at the US-Mexico border following a court order earlier this year. But that authority has limits, and border officials have been overwhelmed by shifting demographics – many of the migrants are now from Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua.\n\nThe department maintains that the border is secure, but the change in people arriving at the US southern border has posed a steep challenge given in part frosty relations that largely bar the US from removing those nationalities. DHS has also noted that more individuals encountered at the border will be removed or expelled this year than any previous year, while the agency has stopped over 10,000 pounds of fentanyl from coming into the country during the first six months of this year, though the majority of fentanyl drug smuggling attempts occur at ports of entry.\n\nIf Mayorkas were to be impeached, he would join the ranks of William Belknap, the secretary of war, who was the only Cabinet official ever to be impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors by the House before being acquitted by the Senate in 1876, according to congressional records.\n\nSome Republicans don’t think it would be the right move to have Mayorkas meet the same fate.\n\n“I don’t think it’d be a very wise decision, and I don’t think (premature impeachment talk) would be appropriate to engage in,” said veteran Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who is the ranking member of the House Rules Committee.\n\n“Even talking about that impeachment right now is irresponsible, because it’s a very serious thing. And it’s gotta be handled seriously.” said moderate Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee. “I felt the same way about the previous attempts as well. We have to restore it to what it was always intended to be, which is a last resort.”\n\nRepublicans setting stage for impeachment inquiry\n\nRegardless of whether Republicans end up going the impeachment route, there will be aggressive oversight of Mayorkas in a GOP-led House, as well as fierce funding fights over border security.\n\nOf the more than 500 preservation letters that House Republicans have sent to the Biden administration, a substantial chunk of them have been focused on the border, according to sources familiar with all the requests.\n\nRepublicans are seeking more information from the Department of Homeland Security about who is coming across the border; the status of the border wall; the administration’s plan to stem the flow of fentanyl and other drugs coming across the border; and how they define “operational control” of the border.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana, quipped to CNN that Mayorkas “might have a reserved parking spot (at the Capitol) he’s gonna be up here so much.” But Scalise stopped short of calling for his impeachment.\n\nWhile hardliners aren’t backing away from saying Biden ought to be removed from office, they think they should primarily direct their energy toward Mayorkas.\n\n“I believe Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors. You might see some (impeachment pushes) on Biden, but certainly Mayorkas, what he has done, has just been unconscionable,” said Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, the former chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. “I’m pushing hard.”\n\n“It seems to me Secretary Mayorkas is deserving of a look (on impeachment),” Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, the current Freedom Caucus chief, said last week. “Let’s talk about it in 40 days.”\n\nRep. Brian Babin of Texas, who co-chairs the Border Security Caucus, told CNN that Mayorkas “certainly deserves” to be removed from office. Earlier this year, he spearheaded a letter along with GOP Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana that put Mayorkas on notice – and it was signed by every member of Republican leadership.\n\n“We didn’t use the word impeach, but it was pretty plain: if you don’t do your job, you could be removed from office,” Babin said. “It’s going to be something we look at.”\n\nSome hardliners are signaling they could back impeachment but they say they’re not there yet.\n\n“I think that’s something that we ought to consider,” said Roy, the Texas Republican. “But impeachment cases are something you build.”", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/09/24/tennessee-republican-lawmakers-react-alexander-blackburn-roe-pelosi-trump-impeach-ukraine-transcript/2433181001/", "title": "Tennessee's Republican lawmakers react: Formal impeachment ...", "text": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday into President Donald Trump over his efforts to get Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden.\n\n\"The president must be held accountable.

Jim Cooper joined the growing number of Democrats calling for impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump on Tuesday, a stance that has spread within the caucus.\n\nA whistleblower in the federal government filed a complaint over a phone call Trump made in July to Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, encouraging him to investigate the former vice president's son Hunter Biden and his business dealings in the Ukraine. Trump announced he planned to release transcripts of the call with Zelensky on Wednesday.\n\n\"This is a very serious step, but the president’s continuing misconduct requires that Congress uphold our Constitution and the laws of the land. No one, not even the president, is above the law,\" Cooper said.\n\nLawmakers react\n\nU.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander withheld judgement of the impeachment proceedings, issuing only short statement after the announcement.\n\n“The Senate Intelligence Committee is determining the facts in the Ukraine whistleblower matter, and I want to know the facts before I comment.”\n\nU.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn took to the Senate floor on Wednesday to denounce the move by Democrats. She said Tennesseans don't approve.\n\nFrom their perspective, yesterday’s announcement was the culmination of a three year witch hunt born of a grudge they’ve been holding against the President since their chosen candidate failed to win the 2016 election.\n\nIt was painfully obvious that Congressional Democrats had finally given up, and embraced politics as usual. They see this for what it is: anger, vitriol, jealousy and spite. They know that President Trump and a Republican-led House and Senate delivered much needed tax and regulatory relief, which was just what the American people wanted. We are a nation built on the rule of law, and adherence to that law. Tennesseans, and the American people, want fairness, equal treatment, and justice, not a breathless revenge scheme orchestrated by a political party.\n\nU.S. Rep. Phil Roe, R-Johnson City, condemned the move for impeachment on Tuesday afternoon, but expressed his support for releasing the transcript and said he was glad it would be made public.\n\n“Half of the Democratic caucus believed impeachment was warranted after Robert Mueller declared he found no evidence of collusion,\" Roe said in a statement released by his staff. \"Now the other half appears headed towards impeaching the president before seeing evidence of wrongdoing and based on a thinly-reported, third-hand account. \"From the moment Democrats took House majority, they have been foaming at the mouth to begin impeachment proceedings against the president. Democratic leadership wants the public to believe they are reluctant to begin an impeachment inquiry, but the truth is this is 100 percent calculated and political.”\n\nA similar sentiment was echoed by U.S. Rep. Mark Green, R-Ashland City, in a statement released Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“Over the past nine months, Speaker Pelosi and her Democrat committee chairs have turned every committee they could into an investigations committee. Ways and Means, Financial Services, Intelligence, Oversight, Judiciary—nearly every Democrat committee chairman is investigating some aspect of the President,” Green said. “Democrats failed to make the case for impeachment with the Mueller investigation, and Democrats failed to make the case for impeachment with each of their other investigations. They've been in charge for nearly a year and have nothing to show for it. Instead of trying to impeach the President, let’s get to work for the American people.”\n\nU.S. Rep Scott DesJarlais, R–South Pittsburg, echoed the statements of his colleagues, indicated he felt the push for the impeachment inquiry came from a \"radical element\" within Congress.\n\n“Before and after last year’s midterm elections, a few of us predicted Democrat leadership would fall prey to their most strident members and move to impeach President Trump. Sadly, having accomplished nothing but fruitless investigations in this Congress, Speaker Pelosi has allowed this radical element to dictate another partisan investigation,\" his statement indicated. “An overwhelming majority of the American public rejects impeachment. However, some individuals, who still cannot accept that their candidate lost the 2016 presidential election, are pursuing a purely political agenda. Congress must reject it.”\n\nThe investigation into Trump, U.S. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, R–Ooltewah, said, has been going on almost since he was elected.\n\n“Democrats have been investigating for months – frankly since President Trump was elected – and they have come up dry. Today’s announcement is more of the same, the beginning of another baseless investigation from a so-called source that admittingly does not have firsthand knowledge of the exchange in question. \"The President made the correct decision to release the transcript of his call tomorrow, giving the American people the transparency they deserve. What the American people do not deserve are Democrats’ continued relentless attacks on our President. When the Mueller report didn’t placate their far-left base, their narrative quickly turned and here we are today. It is sad, it is not good governance, and it is dividing our country.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, R–Knoxville, denounced the impeachment inquiry in strong terms Tuesday evening.\n\n“I do not support the Democrats’ efforts to impeach President Trump and undermine his presidency. I am not surprised with Speaker Pelosi’s decision to give-in to ‘the Squad’ and the far left. No matter what Speaker Pelosi and ‘the Squad’ say, there are no grounds for impeachment, and all the uproar about the President’s call with Ukrainian President Zelensky is both premature and hypocritical. President Trump has already said he would voluntarily release the transcript of his call,\" Burchett said. \"Worse, the Democrats were silent when Vice President Biden and President Obama did exactly the same thing they’re accusing President Trump of. Speaker Pelosi is letting the tail wag the dog. Imagine what Congress could accomplish if Democrats put this kind of effort into passing a budget or securing our border.”\n\nU.S. Rep. David Kustoff, R–Germantown, called the decision to move to formal impeachment stages \"reckless and irresponsible\" in a statement Tuesday evening. He went on to say he felt it was a distraction from the lawmaking purpose of Congress.\n\n“Following two years of failed investigations into President Trump and three already failed impeachment votes, Nancy Pelosi is now making the reckless and irresponsible call for a formal impeachment of the President of the United States over unconfirmed and unsubstantiated accusations. Our constitutional duty as Members of Congress should not be abused in order to settle political scores. The call for impeachment sets a dangerous precedent. If this is the standard, then every president should be on impeachment watch,” Kustoff said. “You elected me to Congress to legislate, not waste time and resources on baseless political investigations.

You don't impeach people because you disagree with their policy positions or because you need to gain some political leverage.\"\n\nHunting for evidence\n\nGOP lawmakers are hunting for evidence that Biden was involved as vice president in his son Hunter's business dealings with foreign companies. They are hinging their calls for an impeachment inquiry on uncorroborated information in an FBI document that Trump's Justice Department and a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney looked into and decided not to escalate.\n\nConservatives are trying to prove the existence of audio recordings in which Biden and his son allegedly solicited and accepted bribes from a Ukrainian businessman.\n\nBribery would meet the impeachment standard for graft, Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who wants to see the House launch an inquiry, said before Congress departed for summer recess.\n\n\"What we do not know is if the allegations are true. And so, what I have called for is an impeachment inquiry. The president deserves an opportunity to present a defense, to present evidence, that he is not guilty of the charges that were raised,\" Cruz said.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on Cruz's remark or the GOP's motivations for pursuing an impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn response to earlier calls from GOP lawmakers for Biden's impeachment, White House spokesman Ian Sams said allegations against Biden have been \"debunked for years.\" Sams said the allegations were scrutinized during Trump's first impeachment trial and \"have been found to lack credibility.\"\n\nTrump has egged Republican lawmakers on.\n\n“They impeach me over a ‘perfect’ phone call, and they don’t impeach Biden,” he said in an all-caps social media post.\n\nIn another, Trump said of impeaching Biden: \"Republicans in Congress just TALK - Nothing will happen. Some actually say they “have other things to do.” What a difference!\"\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy tripped alarms when he said last week that the accusations against Biden are “rising to the level of impeachment inquiry.” He later sought to draw a distinction between launching a formal inquiry, which he says would give the House more tools to investigate Biden, and impeaching the president for committing alleged crimes.\n\nMcCarthy denied that he was under pressure from Trump, who he has not endorsed, to launch an impeachment inquiry, and defended the potential use of precious calendar time for an investigation when the House returns from recess.\n\n\"How productive have we been so far? I can walk and chew gum at the same time,\" McCarthy said.\n\nTrump supporter and South Carolina Republican Sen.

Vance, an Ohio Republican who has also endorsed Trump, said he's seen \"pretty troubling signals\" about Biden's conduct as vice president, but he believes \"it would be a mistake to commit to an impeachment inquiry\" at this time \"because we have to learn a lot more information, and that's what the House is doing.\"\n\n\"The question really is, does it tie directly to the president in a way that can be proven, and if it does, then certainly he should be impeached,\" Vance said.\n\nDemocrats hit back\n\nJust three U.S. presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson in 1868, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Trump, twice, in 2019 and 2021. Congress opened an inquiry into Richard Nixon over Watergate, however, he resigned before he could be impeached.\n\n\"They're convinced, I think, that the impeachments of Trump hurt Trump, and it's a tit for tat, and I think they think they can get political advantage out of it,\" Brock said.\n\nDemocratic strategist Leslie Dach, a former Obama administration official who is advising a group that is focused on defending Biden in House investigations, pointed to Trump's comparison of his first impeachment to the allegations Republicans have levied against Biden.\n\n\"Trump is very clear, as he always is, it is always about him,\" Dach, a senior advisor to the Congressional Integrity Project, said.\n\nDach said he sees a direct correlation between Trump's comments and House Republicans' support for a possible impeachment inquiry into Biden.\n\n\"I think it's very clear that Trump is calling a lot of the cards on this, pushing impeachment, both directly and because his allies want to defend them and distract from his legal problems,\" Dach said.\n\nLongtime Democratic strategist Donna Brazile said that McCarthy, who fought an uphill battle to become speaker and has a narrow majority, is raising the prospect of an impeachment inquiry to help himself politically.\n\n“Basically, it’s the only strategy that Kevin McCarthy has at this time, which is to appease Donald Trump,” Brazile said. “At every turn, when former President Trump talks to the public, he talks about two things: revenge and retribution. And this is part of the same pattern. It’s all about retribution.”\n\nBrazile added: “Kevin McCarthy has no power, or no ability, to get his ultra right-wing base behind anything else other than trying to hurt the president.”\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said the GOP’s threat to open an impeachment inquiry into Biden “reeks of not having a plan, not ready to govern.”\n\nSwalwell, an impeachment manager in the second Trump case, said the GOP undermines its own credibility by focusing on impeaching Biden.\n\n“They promised that they have the goods on corruption, and they go between calling him sleepy Joe and corrupt Joe. I know people are sleepy. I know people are corrupt. I don't think you can be both,\" he said. \"I think that just reflects that they don't know how to define him and they're still struggling to do that.\"\n\nThe White House bulked up its legal team and communications staff in anticipation of the GOP-led House's aggressive use of investigations and impeachment threats against members of the Biden administration. It mocked the threat last week by Republicans to launch a formal inquiry into Biden as a strategy to impeach \"someone… somewhere… for something.\"\n\nBiden at an event in Maine on Friday tied the push to his economic record.\n\n\"While there's more work ahead, earlier this week, the Washington Post suggested Republicans may have to find something else to criticize me for now that inflation is coming down. Maybe they'll decide to impeach me because it's coming down. I don't know. I love that one,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden's son Hunter plead not guilty earlier in the week to misdemeanor tax offenses after a plea deal fell apart that would have seen him avoid felony firearm charges.\n\n\"We've been in the Oversight committee for the last seven months and say what you will about Hunter Biden, who was clearly a troubled and drug addicted man, no one has laid a glove on Joe Biden and no one has connected Joe Biden to any credible allegations of corruption,\" Raskin said.\n\nStaff writers Joey Garrison, Rachel Looker and Ken Tran contributed reporting.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/politics/house-republicans-white-house-hunter-biden/index.html", "title": "House Republicans vow to investigate Biden and his family's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter clinching the majority in the House of Representatives in the midterm elections, top Republicans on Thursday outlined a broad range of investigative targets focused on President Joe Biden and his family’s business dealings.\n\n“In the 118th Congress, this committee will evaluate the status of Joe Biden’s relationship with his family’s foreign partners and whether he is a President who is compromised or swayed by foreign dollars and influence,” said Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee. “I want to be clear: This is an investigation of Joe Biden, and that’s where the committee will focus in this next Congress.”\n\nIn a wide-ranging news conference flanked by GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, who is expected to become chair of the House Judiciary Committee, and other Republicans on the oversight committee, Comer said Republicans have made connections between the president’s son, Hunter Biden, and the president that they believe requires further investigation. Comer said his team has spoken with multiple whistleblowers who say they were involved in schemes involving the Biden family, reviewed Hunter Biden’s laptop, and received “previously unknown transactions.”\n\nComer is specifically zeroing in on more than 100 bank activity reports – known as Suspicious Activity Reports – that are allegedly related to the Biden family and says that the Treasury Department has ignored his repeated requests when Republicans were in the minority to hand over them over.\n\nSo far, Comer says he has only seen two of those reports, and he renewed his request for the remainder of them today. Such reports are not always indicative of criminal activity or wrongdoing.\n\nAs part of his investigation, Comer said, “We would love to talk to people in the Biden family, specifically Hunter and Joe Biden.”\n\nThe White House said the investigations are politically motivated and a waste of time.\n\n“Instead of working with President Biden to address issues important to the American people, like lower costs, congressional Republicans’ top priority is to go after President Biden with politically motivated attacks chock full of long-debunked conspiracy theories” spokesmen for the White House Counsel’s office, Ian Sams, said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“President Biden is not going to let these political attacks distract him from focusing on Americans’ priorities, and we hope congressional Republicans will join us in tackling them instead of wasting time and resources on political revenge,” Sams added.\n\nA spokeswoman for Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, Nelly Decker, said the Republicans “rehashed the same, partisan talking points” that have been circulating for years.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback President Biden on his son Hunter: 'I have great confidence in my son. I love him' 01:17 - Source: CNN\n\n“Now that former President Trump is running for office again, House Republicans’ top priority is attacking President Biden and his family in a desperate attempt to return Mr. Trump to power,” Decker said in a statement.\n\nRepublicans had little ability to enforce their document requests while they were in the minority. But once the new Congress is sworn in in January, Republicans will gain subpoena power, a more powerful enforcement mechanism to try to compel individuals and government entities to hand over information.\n\nPrivate attorneys representing Biden family members did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nZeroing in on suspicious activity reports\n\nAt the heart of Comer’s investigation is digging into a series of suspicious activity reports that Republicans claim banks have filed related to Hunter Biden’s financial activities. In a letter to the Treasury Department on Thursday, Comer sought any such reports related to various members of the Biden family, their business associates and companies linked to Hunter Biden.\n\nComer also is seeking communications within the Treasury Department, its financial crimes enforcement division and the White House regarding those family members and related businesses and associates.\n\nWhile Republicans have seized on the suspicious activity reports as evidence that Joe Biden’s son was involved in problematic activities, such reports are not conclusive and do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing. Financial institutions file millions of suspicious activity reports each year and few lead to law enforcement inquiries.\n\nComer sent a letter to a financial adviser, who Comer has said was managing Hunter Biden’s finances, seeking any suspicious activity reports, as well as financial information about Hunter Biden. He is also seeking information from one of Hunter Biden’s former business partners, including communications related to Hunter Biden and Joe Biden’s finances, taxes and debts.\n\nThe letters were part of a new round Comer fired off to various government agencies and individuals Thursday seeking more information to further his probe.\n\nHe also asked the National Archives for flight manifests and other documents related to Air Force Two and Marine Two during Biden’s tenure as vice president, as well as communications related to Russia, Ukraine and Hunter Biden during his vice presidency.\n\nFrom the FBI, he’s seeking any documents related to “foreign intelligence services’ efforts to compromise the Biden family” and information about Timothy Thibault, a former FBI agent that Republicans have accused of politicizing investigations. Thibault has denied wrongdoing.\n\nAnother letter went to Georges Bergés, the gallery owner who showcased and sold Hunter Biden’s artwork. Among the documents requested were communications with the White House and Hunter Biden, discussions about the pricing of Hunter Biden’s work, and rosters of those who attended Hunter Biden’s art shows and purchased his work.\n\nAlleged ‘politicization’ at the FBI\n\nFederal prosecutors have been investigating Hunter Biden since 2018 and have not brought any charges yet. When asked by CNN if they know whether the claims presented Thursday have already been investigated by federal prosecutors, Jordan said: “We don’t know.”\n\nJordan also said that under his leadership, the House Judiciary Committee will look into alleged “politicization” at the FBI. Jordan and other Republican lawmakers previously claimed that they’ve heard from FBI insiders about anti-conservative bias fueling FBI decision-making, especially at the FBI’s Washington Field Office.\n\n“I’ve been in Congress a few years now, and I’ve never seen anything like it,” Jordan said. “Fourteen (FBI) agents come talk to us while we’re in the minority about how political that place has become.”\n\nAccording to Jordan, the alleged politicization might include attempts by the FBI to suppress media coverage of the Hunter Biden story in 2020.\n\nMany of these claims have been circulating in GOP circles during Biden’s administration – with Republicans taking over the House next year, they’ll have an official platform to investigate these matters and put them on full display.\n\nAt least one of the FBI agents that the GOP lawmakers are scrutinizing has previously denied any wrongdoing. The “whistleblowers” are anonymous and haven’t testified at any public Congressional hearings.\n\n“The FBI has testified to Congress and responded to letters from legislators on numerous occasions to provide an accurate accounting of how we do our work” an FBI spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“The men and women of the FBI devote themselves to protecting the American people from terrorism, violent crime, cyber threats and other dangers,” the spokesperson said. “Put quite simply: we follow the facts without regard for politics.”", "authors": ["Annie Grayer Sara Murray Marshall Cohen", "Annie Grayer", "Sara Murray", "Marshall Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/01/donald-trump-impeachment-joe-biden-house-republicans/70499842007/", "title": "Donald Trump threatens House GOP to impeach Joe Biden: 'Get out'", "text": "WASHINGTON − House Republicans have been talking a lot about impeaching President Joe Biden over what they say is his improper involvement in his family’s business dealings.\n\nBut with a long to-do list when lawmakers return to Washington after August recess, for now, it's all talk.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump however, is pressuring GOP lawmakers to put action behind their words and begin the impeachment process against Biden − or face electoral consequences.\n\n“Any Republican that doesn’t act on Democratic fraud should be immediately primaried and get out,” Trump told supporters at a campaign rally Saturday in Erie, Pennsylvania. “We got a lot of good, tough Republicans around. People are going to run against them and people are going to win.”\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has dismissed the notion that he is facing pressure from the former president to go after Biden, calling an impeachment inquiry an appropriate course of action.\n\n“If (the Biden administration) does not provide the information we need, then we would go to an impeachment inquiry,” McCarthy said at a news conference last week, referencing House Republicans' various investigations into whether Biden benefited from Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings.\n\n'They're trying to deflect':Democrats link GOP push to impeach Biden to Trump indictments\n\nRepublican lawmaker: Impeachment is walking 'the plank'\n\nMcCarthy and other GOP lawmakers are finding themselves in a political bind over Trump’s comments. House Republicans have roughly three weeks when they come back to Washington in September to approve must-pass spending bills, and an impeachment inquiry could take up valuable time needed to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nThere are also multiple House Republicans representing districts Biden won in the 2020 presidential election. Proceeding with an impeachment inquiry could put those vulnerable lawmakers in a politically fraught position heading into the 2024 election, something House GOP leaders want to avoid considering their razor-thin five-seat majority.\n\nRep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., warned that impeachment could force vulnerable members to “walk the plank.”\n\n“Every time we walk the plank we are putting moderate members, members that won Biden districts, we are putting those seats at risk for 2024. We are putting the majority at risk,” Mace said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nTrump urges GOP lawmakers to fight back for him\n\nTrump’s attempts to pressure House Republicans to impeach Biden comes as he faces a multitude of legal troubles, including a possible indictment for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nIn the face of those legal woes, Trump has accused Biden and the Department of Justice of targeting him because he is the front-runner in the 2024 Republican presidential primary. As a result, Trump has implored GOP lawmakers to fight back on his behalf.\n\n“They impeach me, they indict me,” Trump said at his rally in Erie. “And the Republicans just don’t fight the way … they’re supposed to fight.”\n\nRepublican leaders also face pressure from their right flank in the conference as members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus call for impeaching Biden.\n\n“I don’t know how anyone, any objective reasonable person couldn’t come to the conclusion that this appears to be impeachment-worthy,” Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., a member of the Freedom Caucus, said last week, reiterating unsubstantiated claims that Biden was involved as vice president in his son’s business dealings.\n\nRelated:Meet Devon Archer, Hunter Biden's former business associate answering questions in Congress\n\nHouse Republicans walk fine line between investigations and impeachment\n\nStuck between the former president’s warnings and the upcoming 2024 elections, GOP lawmakers are struggling between continuing to investigate Biden or swiftly moving to impeach the president.\n\n“We’re working through the process, our constitutional duty to have oversight over the executive branch,” Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., chair of the Republican Study Committee, told reporters last week.\n\nHern said Republicans are thoroughly investigating whether the president had connections to Hunter Biden’s business dealings and said Democrats “jumped to conclusions” when they impeached Trump.\n\n“The speaker has said that there may be an impeachment inquiry. That is not impeachment. That is Congress continuing its responsibilities to look into the issues that have been raised,” said Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., who represents a district Biden won in 2020.\n\n“It’s just an ability to get more information,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said at a news conference last week, and an inquiry is “not in of itself an impeachment.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/11/florida-republican-greg-steube-introduces-biden-impeachment-articles/70574797007/", "title": "Florida Republican Greg Steube calls to impeach President Biden", "text": "U.S. Rep.

Not now.\n\nGrass vs. turf.\n\nMaybe no NFL player said it better this week – after Aaron Rodgers suffered a season-ending ruptured Achilles tendon while playing on artificial turf at MetLife Stadium on Monday night – than Green Bay Packers offensive tackle David Bakhtiari in expressing disdain for playing on fake grass.\n\n“It sucks,” Bakhtiari, who was Rodgers' blindside protector from 2013-22, said during an appearance on the \"Rich Eisen Show.\" “No one enjoys playing on it. Everyone is too scared to talk about it. NFL, just do better, be better, be an advocate for us and help us out.”\n\nDon’t hold your breath.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nWhile the NFL has been so aggressive in recent years when instituting rules designed to reduce head injuries and protocols to promote treatment of concussions, there apparently is no rush to react to the chorus of dissent from NFL players who contend they are getting the short shrift on another health and safety issue that confronts the league.\n\nMaybe the injury that took out Rodgers, a four-time NFL MVP, will add fuel to the give-us-grass movement among NFL players. Never mind that it hasn’t been determined how much of a role the turf played in his injury.\n\nRodgers' incident brings attention to the issue, intended or not, because he’s one of the NFL’s biggest names.\n\nThis, while a double standard exists with cases where some stadiums have switched from turf to grass to accommodate international soccer matches – and more cases coming when the World Cup comes to North America – then switching back to turf for NFL games like a slap in the face.\n\nOn Wednesday, Lloyd Howell, the new executive director of the NFL Players Association (NFLPA), issued a statement imploring that the NFL ban all artificial surfaces and play games only on grass fields. At the moment, 15 of the NFL’s 30 stadiums utilize grass fields.\n\nHow is Howell’s demand for all grass playing on Park Avenue?\n\n“They have said that in many cases,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said during an interview with Stephen A. Smith on ESPN’s \"First Take.\" “But you have other players who like playing on the turf field, because it’s faster. So, you’ve got mixed opinions.”\n\nFunny, but I’ve not heard many players express a preference for playing on turf.\n\nAfter Monday night’s game, New York Jets receiver Randall Cobb was adamant.\n\n“Never been a fan of turf,” Cobb said. “Never will be a fan of turf.”\n\nAnd Breece Hall, the Jets running back coming off a torn ACL that ruined his rookie season, told The Athletic: “Grass. That’s my answer. We want grass. I busted my knee on turf. I want grass.”\n\nWill players supposedly in the turf-is-better camp that Goodell referenced please make themselves known?\n\n“What we want to go on is the science,” Goodell added, repeating the typical NFL response. “We want to go on what’s best from an injury standpoint to prevent injuries and give our players the best possible surfaces to play on.”\n\nThat sounds good until the NFL and NFLPA clash on what the science says. Last year, when the NFL touted that there was virtually no gap between the rate of lower extremity injuries suffered on turf when compared to grass in 2021, some, including Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, expressed that the statistics compiled by an independent third-party agent, IQIVA, backed up the contention that turf was as safe as grass.\n\nJ.C. Tretter, the NFLPA president, shot back hard. Tretter, a former NFL center, said the 2021 statistics represented an “outlier year” and that a longer-term study from 2012-2020 proved that turf was more dangerous. Also, in April, the NFLPA released figures from the 2022 season that were more consistent with the statistics from the longer-term study.\n\nDuring a media conference call this week, Jeff Miller, an NFL executive vice president, again contended that the data shows that some grass fields have a lower injury rate than synthetic surfaces and some turf field have a lower rate than grass.\n\n“Our efforts are to drive down those rates on both surfaces,” Miller said.\n\nLast year, the NFLPA pushed for the elimination of “slit-film” turf surfaces that data showed increased injury risk. While monofilament infill consists of single blades of fake grass, slit-film has openings in the blades that make it more likely for cleats to get tangled.\n\nOf the six NFL stadiums with slit-film surfaces last season, three have converted this year to turfs that are considered safer, including MetLife Stadium. New Orleans and Detroit have also done away with slit-film surfaces. But three stadiums with slit-film surfaces remain: in Minnesota, Indianapolis and Cincinnati.\n\nWhile the adjustments with the style of turf in some stadiums may represent a measure of progress, it still doesn’t address the principle issue for many NFL players: They want to play on grass.\n\n“The biggest thing, really, is about risk of injury,” Atlanta Falcons defensive lineman Calais Campbell, a member of the NFLPA’s executive committee, told USA TODAY Sports in June.\n\nThen again, significant injuries in football can occur anywhere at any time. While Rodgers was injured while playing on the new FieldTurf CORE installed at MetLife Stadium, Baltimore Ravens running back J.K. Dobbins suffered a torn Achilles tendon, too, during his season opener.\n\nA difference? Dobbins was injured while playing on grass. Miller maintained that according to injury data dating to 2015, “there’s no difference” in the rate of Achilles tendon injuries between synthetic surfaces and grass.\n\nWhile the injury analysis in each of these cases will consider multiple variables in addition to surface (including style of cleats, impact of collisions, etc.), the real game-changer might come with some stadiums temporarily converting to grass fields for soccer matches.\n\nIn his statement this week, Howell said “it makes no sense” that NFL stadiums will switch from turf to grass surfaces to accommodate soccer matches, as will be the case for the FIFA Club World Cup in 2025 and the World Cup in 2026.\n\nLast year, Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte installed grass for an exhibition soccer match between Charlotte FC and Chelsea. In July, the surface at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, was switched to grass for the CONCACAF Gold Cup, then converted back to synthetic turf for the Rams and Chargers games.\n\nIf grass is good enough for the soccer players, why not for the NFL?\n\n“If they spend the money to turn it to grass, we’re hoping that they keep it as grass,” Campbell said.\n\nHe knows. Grass is not as cost-efficient as turf. Stadiums can stage other events, such as concerts, without the worry of damaging the grass when they have turf fields.\n\n“But if you’re going to turn it to grass, I think there should be a strong push to keep it as grass,” Campbell said.\n\nIt’s also gotten to the point where grass works at domed stadiums. Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas and State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, use grass that is grown and maintained outdoors, then brought in for games on huge trays.\n\nSo, basically, if there’s a will there’s a way.\n\nUltimately, this debate may not be fully resolved without it being included in the collective bargaining agreement. It was hardly an issue when the last labor pact between the league and players was struck in 2020. Apparently, there were more pressing economic matters to hash out.\n\nIt could be a long time before it gets to a bargaining table, with the current CBA running through March 2030.\n\n“As a union, we’ve talked about all the different ways we can try to make that happen,” Campbell said. “It’s something we want. Over time, it will work itself out. But if we have a leverage point for it to happen sooner, it will.”\n\nBakhtiari issued a warning to the NFL during his chat with Eisen.\n\n“Quit ignoring it and address it now,” he said. “It not, it’s going to get bigger and bigger.”\n\nWe’ll see. Goodell indicated on \"First Take\" that he would be open to discussing it before the CBA expires following the 2030 season.\n\n“It’s important to address issues now,” Goodell said. “Let’s not wait until the end of the collective bargaining agreement. These issues, if they should be accelerated, let’s get to it. If there are other issues, let’s get to it. Let’s find solutions and let’s make the game better.”\n\nGoodell’s words sounded promising to the players’ agenda. Yet given big-business ramifications and labor talks that are often difficult, history suggests that a resolution for this debate won’t happen anytime soon.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnists/kathy-mcclellan/2017/11/06/look-first-half-nfl-surprises-and-disappointments/835230001/", "title": "A look at NFL surprises and disappointments in first half", "text": "Kathy McClellan\n\nTRN Sports\n\nWith every team having played at least eight games, the NFL’s 2017 season officially hit the halfway point this past weekend. And what a first half it has been.\n\nFrom injuries to star players to teams off to surprising starts to disappointing teams and everything else in-between, the first half of the season has been anything but boring.\n\nFor Dallas Cowboys fans, the season has turned from disappointing to promising, as the team is 5-3 and riding a three-game winning streak after knocking off Kansas City last Sunday. While the Cowboys’ play on the field is definitely holding our attention, so is the seemingly never-ending saga of Ezekiel Elliott’s suspension.\n\nI really doubt I am the only person who just wants a final answer to the weekly “will he play or will he be suspended” question. One way or the other, I’m just ready for the situation to be decided so we can move on.\n\nInjuries were a dominating factor in the first half of the season. Houston lost defensive stars J.J. Watt and Whitney Mercilus five games into the season, and Week 5 is the same week New York Giants’ hotshot receiver Odell Beckham Jr., suffered a broken ankle. A week later Green Bay lost superstar Aaron Rodgers and in Week 7 Arizona’s Carson Palmer went down.\n\nAll of those injuries were devastating to their teams, but last week the Texans were hit with what could very well be the toughest loss of all when superstar rookie QB DeShaun Watson suffered a torn ACL during practice and will miss the rest of the season. Watson, who had already laid claim to being one of the most exiting young players in the game, was on pace to break all kinds of rookie records and had the Texans thinking playoffs. Now, they’re just thinking about next season.\n\nSo far in 2017 second-year quarterbacks are making a lot of noise. Of course, in my opinion, Dak Prescott, is leading this group. There’s definitely been no “sophomore slump” for the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year. While Prescott has picked up where he left off last season, two other sophomore QBs have taken big steps forward. Jared Goff and Carson Wentz are playing exceptionally well and have their teams in first place.\n\nIn fact, Goff’s Los Angeles Rams has been one of the most surprising teams so far this season. With new head coach Sean McVay everyone expected both Goff and the Rams to be better this year, but I don’t think anyone suspected a 6-2 start.\n\nWentz has the Eagles sitting atop the NFC East at 8-1 heading into their bye week, which is the best record in the NFL. Another surprise has been the New Orleans Saints, who are leading the NFC South at 6-2, and who are actually playing defense this season.\n\nWhile they’re not leading their division, the Buffalo Bills (5-3) are second in the AFC East under first-year head coach Sean McDermott.\n\nMany expected the NFC Champion Atlanta Falcons to be one of the best teams in 2017 just like they were in 2016, but that hasn’t been the case. They’re struggling at 4-4 right now. But, the biggest disappointment in the NFC though has to be the New York Giants, who are 1-7 after many picked them to win the NFC East.\n\nOver in the AFC there are several teams that could be deemed as disappointing. Fourteen of the16 teams have at least three losses and nine teams have five losses or more. But for me, the most disappointing team so far has been the Oakland Raiders. They won Sunday night to improve to 4-5, but coming off last season’s 12-4 mark seeing the Raiders with a sub-.500 mark halfway through this season is not what was expected of them.\n\nWho knows what the second half of the season is going to bring, but whatever it is I’m sure it is going to be exciting.\n\nKathy McClellan writes sports columns twice per month for the Times Record News", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/09/sport/aaron-rodgers-packers-giants-london-nfl-spt-inl/index.html", "title": "Aaron Rodgers makes long-awaited London debut but Green Bay ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA person wearing a cheese wedge on their head might seem odd to most, but when the Green Bay Packers are in town it’s just part and parcel of game day.\n\nThe Packers played in London on Sunday, the first time the franchise has played in the UK – and the last of the NFL’s 32 teams to play there.\n\nAlthough some of London’s games often have had split crowds – with many just there to watch the sport they love – Green Bay’s game against the New York Giants at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was definitely a home game for the team from Wisconsin.\n\nAnd one jersey in particular was popular than the rest – a green and yellow one with the name ‘Rodgers’ and No. 12 on the back.\n\nPackers fans arrive at the stadium prior to the match between the Packers and the Giants.

And who could blame them, even at 38 years old he is still amongst the league’s best quarterbacks.\n\nBefore Sunday’s game, Rodgers expressed his personal excitement to do more than just play in London.\n\n“I wanted to go over early to experience a bit of that culture, to be able to get out, see some sights and interact with fans, go to a pub and have a Guinness or whatever the local brew is,” he said.\n\n“I’ve been talking about doing this for years, since they started this – I couldn’t wait to get over. But nobody wants to give up a Green Bay home game, so it’s exciting to finally get a chance to go over.”\n\nAnd for those who traveled from all over to see the storied quarterback for the first time, as many had, they were treated to a special first half performance by Rodgers, but a quiet second half.\n\nRodgers threw for two touchdowns, one each to Allen Lazard and Marcedes Lewis, as the Packers raced into a first half lead only for the Giants to come back and win 27-22.\n\nGreen Bay built up a 10-point half-time lead as they looked to be rolling but some offensive miscues and some good Giants defense halted the Packers and eventually turned the tide towards New York.\n\nGiants running back Saquon Barkley continued his strong start to the season, finishing the game with a touchdown and 106 total yards as New York’s defense put the clamps on Rodgers late in the fourth quarter to seal victory.\n\nWith under two minutes to play, Rodgers had driven the offense to within the Giants 10-yard line. However, Giants defensive linemen and linebackers deflected Rodgers’ passes and allowed the Giants to run the clock down.\n\nOn the final play of the game, with just one final opportunity to pull a win out the bag, Rodgers was sacked by Oshane Ximines and fumbled the ball, handing the win to Giants.\n\nRodgers throws a pass in the first half against the Giants.

Rodgers got to his feet, limped a few steps, stopped and then sat down on the turf. Trainers guided him off the field as backup Zach Wilson checked in.\n\nRodgers had not yet completed a pass in his debut, with one attempt. He played just four snaps and was subsequently ruled out for the rest of the night. The Jets went on to win in overtime, 22-15, on a punt returned for touchdown by Xavier Gipson.\n\nJets coach Robert Saleh indicated after the game that he feared Rodgers had incurred an Achilles injury, which figures to hold him out for a significant period of time, and likely for the entire 2023 season. They expect a Tuesday MRI will confirm the tear. X-rays at the stadium showed no fractures.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nRodgers was shown on the Monday Night Football broadcast limping under his own power to the locker room with some assistance. Mike Garafolo of the NFL Network reported that Rodgers was taken for X-rays at the stadium and emerged from the X-ray room with a boot still on his foot as he returned to the locker room.\n\nAs part of the conditions for the trade that sent Rodgers to the Jets this offseason, the Packers will receive the Jets' first-round pick if Rodgers plays 65% of his team's offensive snaps this season. The pick will be a second-rounder otherwise.\n\nRodgers famously left the first half of the season opener on Sunday Night Football in 2018, then came back in the second half to lead an unbelievable comeback against the Chicago Bears, a 24-23 Packers win. The Packers also beat the Bears on Sunday in the 2023 opener with new quarterback Jordan Love at the helm.\n\nFloyd, who spent the first four seasons of his career in Chicago, was part of that team and sacked Rodgers seven times from 2016-19, then twice more last year as a member of the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nRodgers received an uproarious ovation when he ran onto the field at MetLife Stadium for pregame introductions, hoisting an American flag as the city commemorated 9/11.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/09/14/vikings-eagles-score-thursday-night-football-predictions-odds-watch-stream/70855617007/", "title": "Thursday Night Football highlights: Eagles-Vikings score, top plays", "text": "PHILADELPHIA — Even on a night the home team controlled the game, the Philadelphia Eagles could not shield themselves from the home fans’ inaugural boos of the 2023 season. In all likelihood, they won’t be the last. But as has been the case since Jalen Hurts and Co. have turned Philadelphia back into a winning machine, there hasn’t been much reason for negativity in the City of Brotherly Love.\n\nAs the Eagles outlasted the Minnesota Vikings, 34-28, on the first “Thursday Night Football” game of the season, the offense at times looked sluggish, more of the same from last week’s performance in the season opener against the New England Patriots, a 25-20 win. Nonetheless, the Vikings had no answer for the Eagles’ defensive front, with Minnesota’s starting center Garrett Bradbury (lower back) and left tackle Christian Darrisaw (ankle) unavailable on the short week.\n\nMaking his home debut, Philadelphia native D’Andre Swift (28 rushes, career-high 175 yards) paced the offense on the ground. Last week, Swift carried the ball just once for 3 yards.\n\nA drive lasting 7 minutes, 55 seconds in the second quarter consisted of 13 run plays compared to three passes, with the offensive line leading the charge. Quarterback Jalen Hurts pounded in two rushing touchdowns via the patented “Philly Push” play near the goal line. And receiver DeVonta Smith wiggled loose and displayed his catch-making abilities on the way to four catches for 143 yards, including a 63-yard touchdown catch.\n\nHurts threw one interception and was 18 of 23 for 193 passing yards. He also rushed 12 times for 35 yards.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nThe Vikings didn’t make it easy on themselves, either, evidenced by four turnovers. Punt returner Brandon Powell coughed up what would have been sublime field position by fumbling his first return of the game in the first quarter. Wide receiver Justin Jefferson posted another absurd stat line (11 catches, 159 yards) but committed the gaffe of the game by fumbling while trying to extend the ball over the goal line following a huge completion. A replay review determined the ball flew over the deadline, thus invoking the touchback rule and completely changing momentum prior to halftime. Kicker Jake Elliott tied his career high by drilling a 61-yard field goal 34 seconds before halftime to make it 13-7.\n\nRunning back Alexander Mattison and quarterback Kirk Cousins each coughed up a fumble, with the latter’s coming on a Josh Sweat strip sack that gave the Eagles prime field position inside the Vikings’ 10-yard line.\n\nAt one point up by 20, the Eagles didn’t blow out the Vikings like they did in Week 2 of last season, a “Monday Night Football” matchup. Kirk Cousins found a wide open K.J. Osborn wide open in the back of the end zone to make it a one-possession game with 7:41 remaining. Before that, Cousins found rookie Jordan Addison for a 62-yard touchdown, answering Smith’s long touchdown.\n\nThe Eagles had a 15-play, 44-yard drive that lasted approximately nine minutes and resulted in no points to move the game along in the fourth.\n\nOn their next drive, Swift broke through the line for a 43-yard gain to put the Eagles four yards away from the end zone. Fittingly, Swift punched it in for his first Eagles touchdown, giving Philadelphia a 34-21 advantage.\n\nBy the time Vikings tight end T.J. Hockenson (seven catches, 66 yards) caught his second short touchdown of the game, 70 seconds remained on the clock, and the six-point margin stood.\n\nEagles-Vikings highlights\n\nThe Eagles held on to defeat the Vikings 34-28 on Thursday night. D'Andre Swift did the heavy lifting for the Eagles, carrying 28 times for 175 yards and a touchdown. Kirk Cousins led the way for the Vikings with 364 yards and four touchdowns but Minnesota was undone by four fumbles that helped lead to a 27-7 deficit that the Vikings could never fully overcome.\n\nWinners and losers of 'Thursday Night Football'\n\nThe best and worst from \"Thursday Night Football,\" which saw the Eagles move to 2-0 with a win over the Vikings for the second straight year.\n\n***\n\nEagles 34, Vikings 28: T.J. Hockenson scores again\n\nHockenson found the end zone on a five-yard touchdown catch with under two minutes remaining to give the Vikings some life. The tight end’s touchdown close Minnesota’s deficit, 28-24.\n\nThe Vikings attempted on onside kick after Hockenson’s touchdown, but it was unsuccessful.\n\nHockenson’s totaled seven catches, 66 yards and two touchdowns on the night. — Tyler Dragon\n\nEagles 34, Vikings 21: D'Andre Swift makes it a two-score game\n\nThe Eagles running back D'Andre Swift is taking full advantage of the start tonight. Swift scored on a 2-yard touchdown run with 4:13 left in the fourth quarter to make the score 34-21.\n\nSwift’s totaled a career-high 170 rushing yards on 25 carries. — Tyler Dragon\n\nEagles 27, Vikings 21: Kirk Cousins finds wide open K.J. Osborn to close gap\n\nThe Vikings went on a nine play, 86-yard touchdown drive midway through the fourth quarter to make the score 27-21. Justin Jefferson had three catches during the series, but on the touchdown Kirk Cousins found K.J. Osborn wide open in the end zone to make it a one-score game.\n\nThe drive gave Cousins 284 passing yards and three touchdowns on the night. — Tyler Dragon\n\nVikings OT Olisaemeka Udoh carted off field\n\nOlisaemeka Udoh required the assistance of the cart to leave the field after suffering an injury on a key Vikings’ third-down conversion. Udoh hit the ground hard and landed awkwardly while absorbing a bull rush.\n\nHe was filling in for starting left tackle Christian Darrisaw, and Udoh was replaced by David Quessenberry, a sixth-year player who played last season with the Buffalo Bills.\n\nUdoh was ruled out of the game with a knee injury. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nEagles enter fourth quarter in (ground) control\n\nFor the last 5:19 of the third quarter, the Eagles slowly pushed the ball back into Vikings territory. D’Andre Swift, making his homecoming debut in his native Philadelphia, is up to 107 rushing yards on 18 carries and has been the Eagles’ featured back with Kenny Gainwell out with an injury. All but 50 of Hurts’ passing yards (173) have gone to Smith.\n\nPrime Video cameras showed A.J. Brown and Hurts having a heated conversation, with head coach Nick Sirianni involved. Brown entered the fourth quarter with three catches and 17 yards; the first play of the fourth quarter was a short pass to Brown that fell incomplete. Four plays later, Brown temporarily hauled in a 25-yard touchdown pass, but the play was negated by a holding penalty. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nEagles 27, Vikings 14: Jordan Addison pulls Vikings closer\n\nAt their lowest, the Vikings and Kirk Cousins looked for the rookie to make a play. They were rewarded.\n\nFacing a third-and-5 and down by 20, with all momentum slipping away, Cousins fired a ball downfield to Jordan Addison, the 23rd overall pick in the 2023 draft.\n\nAddison slipped behind the defense and strutted into the end zone, an appropriate answer to DeVonta Smith’s long touchdown the prior series. The Vikings still trailed 27-14. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nEagles 27, Vikings 7: Jalen Hurts, DeVonta Smith combine for long TD\n\nDeVonta Smith is having himself a night.\n\nSmith ran right by Vikings cornerback Akayleb Evans and Jalen Hurts hit the wideout right in stride for a 63-yard touchdown.\n\nSmith has caught two deep passes on the night. The Alabama product has three catches, 123 yards and a touchdown already in the third quarter. — Tyler Dragon\n\nEagles 20, Vikings 7: Another fumble leads to touchdown\n\nAll the Vikings needed was another touchdown drive like the one they put together in the second quarter to retake the lead.\n\nInstead, Josh Sweat sacked Cousins and clubbed the ball out with a big swing of his right arm. Fletcher Cox recovered and the Eagles were in business inside of the Minnesota 10-yard line. And Hurt scored his second rushing touchdown of the game from one yard out two plays later for a dramatic swing in the first 67 seconds of the second half. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nHalftime: Eagles extend lead on Jake Elliott's 61-yard field goal\n\nEagles kicker Jake Elliott hit a 61-yard field goal as time expired in the first half to push Philadelphia lead to 13-7.\n\nThe first half featured four turnovers (three for Minnesota and one for Philadelphia) in what was a sloppy 30 minutes of football.\n\nThe Eagles’ lone turnover didn’t hurt them much because they were able to make up for it by imposing their will on the ground. Philadelphia gashed the Vikings for 133 rushing yards on 26 attempts. Eleven of the Eagles' runs resulted in first downs.\n\nPhiladelphia has 209 total yards. Minnesota has 142 rushing yards (nine rushing). — Tyler Dragon\n\nPylon possession rule strikes again\n\nThe fumbling into the end zone touchback rule may play a factor in this game.\n\nJustin Jefferson hauled in an out route from Kirk Cousins inside of the five yard line and reached for the end zone. The ball came loose as Eagles safety Terrell Edmunds hit the 2022 offensive player of the year. Officials initially ruled that the ball went out of bounds before the pylon and marked the Vikings inside the one-yard line. However, an official review — there was 33 seconds before halftime — determined the ball went over the pylon, therefore triggering the much-maligned rule that such a fumble results in a touchback.\n\nThe Eagles took over at the 20-yard line in a huge momentum swing, as the Vikings could have taken the lead or at least tied it before half. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nEagles 10, Vikings 7: Eagles use running game to take lead back\n\nThe Eagles answered Minnesota’s touchdown drive with a touchdown of their own. Philadelphia went on a run-oriented 16-play drive and fittingly scored on a quarterback sneak from Jalen Hurts.\n\nThe touchdown put the Eagles up, 10-7.\n\nAt the end of the drive, the Eagles had produced a total of 96 rushing yards to just four by the Vikings. — Tyler Dragon\n\nEagles dealing with injuries\n\nAs the Eagles took the lead 10-7, they are navigating two key injuries.\n\nAvonte Maddox (shoulder) is questionable to return. On the other side of the ball, the Eagles might not have receiver Quez Watkins due to a hamstring injury that also limited him during training camp. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nVikings 7, Eagles 3: T.J. Hockenson finds end zone\n\nAfter Eagles kicker Jake Elliott missed a 55-yard field goal wide right, the Vikings went on a nine play, 55-yard touchdown drive that was capped off by a five-yard touchdown catch by tight end T.J. Hockenson.\n\nHockenson had a few nice catches during the series, including a 24-yard catch on third down.\n\nThe Vikings tight end has three catches, 33 yards and a touchdown early in the second quarter. — Tyler Dragon\n\nDeteriorating into typical sloppy TNF game\n\nThe third turnover in a matter of minutes in a classically sloppy Thursday night game. And the boo birds are out in Philly.\n\nPhiladelphia was actually the team on the receiving side of this giveaway, with Alexander Mattison fumbling and Justin Evans recovering. When the first play of the drive, another unsuccessful designed quarterback run for Hurts, the crowd unleashed a round of boos.\n\nThe boos were even louder when the Eagles went three-and-out. Kicker Jake Elliott's 55-yard field goal was wide right. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nJalen Hurts throws pick\n\nThe Eagles didn’t capitalize off the Vikings fumble. A few plays after Brandon Powell lost a fumble on a punt return, Hurts threw a pass that was picked off by Vikings safety Theo Jackson.\n\nTwo teams traded turnovers on back-to-back possessions. — Tyler Dragon\n\nEagles force first turnover of the night\n\nBrandon Powell wasted a nice punt returned when he fumbled that football as he was tackled to the ground in Philadelphia territory. The loose football was recovered by Eagles LB Nicholas Morrow at the 27-yard line.\n\nPowell knew he had made a mistake. He put his head down before running to the sideline. — Tyler Dragon\n\nChristian Darrisaw doesn't start for Vikings\n\nThe Vikings were going to have a difficult time against the Eagles with a healthy roster. And their challenge Thursday became tougher with left tackle Christian Darrisaw unavailable to start the game.\n\nOlisaemeka Udoh, a 2019 sixth-round pick from Elon, is filling in for Darrisaw.\n\nHe saw action in seven games over his first two seasons before starting 16 games in 2021. Last season, he transitioned to a backup role with one start, but played in all 17 games.\n\nDarrisaw was working during warmups but was clearly limited. On the Vikings’ first offensive drive, the Eagles hit Cousins twice. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nEagles 3, Vikings 0: DeVonta Smith catch sets up field goal\n\nDeVonta Smith climbed the ladder over Vikings safety Theo Jackson to haul in a 54-yard reception on the Eagles’ opening drive.\n\nSmith’s catch set up an Eagles field goal that open up the scoring for the night. — Tyler Dragon\n\nBald eagle flew during anthem, Michael Buffer belts famous phrase\n\nA bald eagle flew around the stadium during the closing notes of the national anthem (and safely made its way back to its carrier). The Vikings won the toss and deferred, so the Eagles will start with the ball.\n\nDuring pregame introductions, running back D’Andre Swift was announced with the starting offense, with the public address announcer noting his hometown of Philadelphia.\n\nFamed ring announcer Michael Buffer unleashed a patented “Let’s Get Ready to Rumble” as the chorus of “Gonna Fly Now” rang throughout the stadium. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nWhat time is kickoff for Vikings vs. Eagles?\n\nThursday night's matchup between Minnesota and Philadelphia is set to kick off at 8:15 p.m. ET.\n\nHow can I watch Vikings vs. Eagles on 'Thursday Night Football'?\n\nAmazon Prime Video will broadcast Vikings vs. Eagles nationally.\n\nAndrew Whitworth carries Kevin Hart off set\n\nKevin Hart got a helping hand from Andrew Whitworth, literally.\n\nHart stopped by Prime Video’s pregame broadcast to talk about the comedian’s beloved Philadelphia Eagles ahead of their \"Thursday Night Football\" matchup against the Minnesota Vikings.

Still, many of Minnesota’s issues against Tampa Bay were self-inflicted with center-snap exchange problems and turnovers. The Vikings should clean that up, but I don’t see them taking Philly’s home opener.\n\nTyler Dragon: Eagles 30, Vikings 20\n\nThe Eagles underwhelmed by their standards in a Week 1 win but expect “fly Eagles fly” chants in the team’s home opener. The Eagles will be the more talented team on the field. Philadelphia held Vikings WR Justin Jefferson to six catches for 48 yards in their meeting last season. Jefferson had nine receptions for 150 yards in Week 1.\n\nVictoria Hernandez: Eagles 27, Vikings 20\n\nThe Eagles are playing at home and showed last week they still have the juju for a strong season. I hate the idea of Kirko Cousins (not a typo) and Justin \"Jets\" Jefferson being 0-2, but that doesn't mean they can't piece some things together after this.\n\nJordan Mendoza: Eagles 28, Vikings 19\n\nBoth teams looked rusty offensively Week 1, but I'll give Philadelphia the benefit of the doubt in dealing with the weather in Foxborough. The Eagles will be back at home, and the Linc will be rocking to create havoc for the Minnesota offense. Eagles get back on track, while the Vikings are quickly descending.\n\nFantasy football rankings for Week 2\n\nFollowing devastating season-ending injuries to Aaron Rodgers and J.K. Dobbins, fantasy managers will hope for better things as Week 1 seemed to provide more disappointments than triumphs. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen will be among several key players looking to show they're much better than they were in their openers.\n\nThese position-by-position fantasy football rankings for Week 2 are based on the point-per-reception (PPR) scoring used in most seasonal and daily fantasy football formats.\n\nNFL broadcast teams: Meet all the announcers for 2023 season\n\nThe NFL is back, and with that, so are the announcing teams that will be the soundtrack of the games.\n\nKeeping track of who is behind the microphone for which game on what network can be difficult to keep track of. We’re here to help and break down the main broadcast players for the 2023 NFL season inside the booth. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nWho is the highest-paid NFL player?\n\nThe NFL's top 15 players in average annual salary are all quarterbacks, according to OverTheCap.com. As Joe Burrow proved in his new deal with the Cincinnati Bengals, teams place a huge priority on having a top-flight QB under center. Burrow's five-year, $275 million contract extension made him the league's highest paid player at a staggering average annual value of $55 million. San Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa is the highest-paid non-quarterback in the league after signing a five-year, $170 million extension.\n\nWho are the highest paid NFL players at each position?\n\nWe have a complete list at every position:\n\nHow much does the average NFL ticket cost?\n\nThe average price of a 2023 NFL ticket is $377, according to TicketSmarter data. It’s a major jump from last season, when the average price was $235. Leading the NFL in ticket costs is the Las Vegas Raiders, which has an average cost of $582 per ticket. Behind the Raiders are the Super Bowl 57 contestants: the Kansas City Chiefs at $578 and Philadelphia Eagles at $559. Here are the five highest ticket averages:\n\nLas Vegas Raiders: $582\n\nKansas City Chiefs: $578\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles: $559\n\nDallas Cowboys: $545\n\nNew England Patriots: $534\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, the Atlanta Falcons have the cheapest average price at $225. They are followed by the Houston Texans ($236) and Arizona Cardinals ($250). Here are the lowest five ticket averages:\n\nAtlanta Falcons: $225\n\nHouston Texans: $236\n\nArizona Cardinals: $250\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers: $263\n\nTennessee Titans: $265\n\n— Jordan Mendoza\n\nGannett may earn revenue from sports betting operators for audience referrals to betting services.

Just more Ryan Tannehill ...", "text": "Not long after ESPN’s Bill Barnwell lit a fuse by mentioning the Tennessee Titans as one of seven potential trading partners for the Green Bay Packers and Aaron Rodgers, the eruption reached Nashville.\n\nSports talk shows have been all over it. And who can blame them? It is a great discussion, a fascinating idea, idle speculation as it was.\n\nFar-fetched perhaps, but it’s not absurd. Not many quarterbacks would be an upgrade on Ryan Tannehill, and Rodgers would be. Everyone knows his credentials. He’s Aaron freakin’ Rodgers, and he’s only 37, not too far gone in QB years.\n\n\"For the Titans, this would be a move to get over the hump,” Barnwell wrote. \"… This would be a two- or three-year window to try to win with Rodgers and (Derrick) Henry as a devastating one-two punch.\"\n\nOK.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nBut let's think about this. Is the gap between quarterbacks large enough to justify the Titans giving up Tannehill in addition to two first-round picks, as Barnwell wrote would be necessary to make a deal happen (and others agree)?\n\nNo, it’s not.\n\nAny argument for the Titans to pursue this is born out of a stubborn instance that Tannehill – fueled by a couple of playoff losses – will never be good enough to take this franchise where it wants to go, and the time to get there is right now.\n\nWin now? Tannehill has been winning. He's why the window is open.\n\nGENTRY ESTES: With Rashad Weaver, Titans didn't know. And that's the problem.\n\nEXAMINING THE ROSTER:How do Titans look after 2021 NFL Draft?\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: Titans fall in post-draft rankings\n\nHenry obviously deserves ample credit, too, but the Titans wouldn’t have been anywhere near as successful the past two seasons if they hadn’t traded for Tannehill, a move that has proven to be Jon Robinson’s greatest as general manager.\n\nMaking a case for Tannehill is perhaps the easiest column that I regularly write, yet I’ve had to keep writing it. No other quarterback in the NFL is so thoroughly underrated.\n\nLook around the league right now: Tannehill’s stock should be soaring.\n\nWhat’s happening in Green Bay, for one, reflects terribly on Rodgers. Any player, no matter his reasons, reportedly aiming to oust a general manager whose Packers went 13-3 last season should give other GMs pause on welcoming him into their organization at a steep cost.\n\nRodgers’ actions are in fashion, occurring in an offseason already marked by grumbling star quarterbacks. We’ve had Russell Wilson’s growing discontent in Seattle. We had Deshaun Watson demanding a trade out of Houston before an avalanche of problems off the field.\n\nAnd then there’s Tannehill, who this past weekend was texting Titans draft picks as soon as they were selected.\n\n“He just said that he’s excited for me to come down and he felt like that was a good pick for them,” Louisville wide receiver Dez Fitzpatrick said, “and he likes my game and I’ve got to be a weapon with this offense. … I felt great that he texted me.”\n\nTannehill isn’t applauded enough for what he means to the Titans. In part, that’s because he doesn’t crave the attention or power in the organization. There’s no ego, and the Titans have to love that about him.\n\nHe’s kind of an NFL unicorn in that way, unique in that he is starring for a team that didn’t draft him. That makes him deeply invested and humble. He understandably appreciates his role in Tennessee more because he knows what it’s like to lose a starting spot elsewhere.\n\nAnd yet, what happened during his tenure in Miami still keeps him from being considered one of the NFL’s elite quarterbacks when his Titans resurgence has justified that status.\n\nThe playoffs? Sure, that’s a reasonable gripe with Tannehill after last season’s Wild Card loss. But Henry’s postseason heroics the prior season shouldn’t be counted against his quarterback. Tannehill made throws to help beat the Patriots and Ravens that get ignored in hindsight.\n\nThe Titans wouldn’t have made the playoffs the past two seasons without Tannehill. He salvaged a sinking ship when he took over for Marcus Mariota in 2019. Then with many doubting he’d retain that form in 2020, he pitched a Pro Bowl-caliber season despite a season-ending injury to his star left tackle, Taylor Lewan, and an inferior defense that repeatedly demanded clutch, late-game heroics that Tannehill routinely provided.\n\nHis presence and good health – alongside Henry – should mean the Titans continue to win and challenge for the postseason despite some glaring weaknesses.\n\nEntering 2021, the Titans’ roster remains far from complete, but in the NFL, an effective quarterback can make up for a lot.\n\nThe Titans are lucky. They have such a quarterback – and no drama accompanying him.\n\nWhy would they mortgage their future to create some?\n\nReach Gentry Estes at gestes@tennessean.com and on Twitter @Gentry_Estes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2019/11/08/nfl-players-most-overlooked-players-tyler-lockett-matthew-stafford/2527088001/", "title": "Who is NFL's most-overlooked, top-performing player in 2019 season?", "text": "USA TODAY Sports\n\nNot everyone can receive the recognition that Russell Wilson and Lamar Jackson do.\n\nBoth of the quarterbacks have been at the forefront of discussion about the NFL's MVP this season, and their contributions have been lauded on a weekly basis. For many of the league's other standouts, however, widespread praise can be more difficult to come by. Whether it's a function of their production outpacing their reputation or being overshadowed by their peers, several of the NFL's most accomplished players this season haven't had their time in the spotlight.\n\nWith that in mind, we asked reporters and editors from USA TODAY Sports and around the USA TODAY Network: Putting aside star players like Wilson and Jackson, who is the most overlooked top-performing player in the NFL this season?\n\nTheir answers:\n\nWhile I could make a case for Richard Sherman and/or Nick Bosa, and considered doing so, I have to go with Teddy Bridgewater.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nWhen Drew Brees injured his thumb in Week 2, it was not an overreaction to write New Orleans off. Yes, Bridgewater was a former first-round pick who made the Pro Bowl in his second season. But the knee injury he suffered before his third season was devastating, and it was bound to have a detrimental impact on his skills. The question was how much, and Bridgewater hadn’t played enough in the last few years for the Saints to have total confidence that he could carry the load for an extended stretch.\n\nBut he could. And he did.\n\nNew Orleans’ defense is phenomenal, and it no doubt made Bridgewater’s job easier. Same for Sean Payton’s game plans. But Bridgewater still had to make plays, and he did. He completed almost 68 percent of his passes and threw for nine touchdowns while throwing just two interceptions, compiling a 98.9 rating in Brees’ absence.\n\nThe most impressive stat, though, was 5-1. That was New Orleans’ record while Brees was out, and that loss came in the game where the future Hall of Famer got hurt. Instead of coming back to a team in disarray or one that’s just trying to stay afloat, Brees returned to a team that is oozing confidence and has to be considered the favorite for the NFC title. The Saints have Bridgewater to thank for that.\n\nDid somebody mention Russell Wilson? Well, the Seahawks’ MVP-mode QB is a factor in this equation, too, as his brilliance overshadows the consistent punch that running back Chris Carson brings. Seattle has a top-10 rushing attack largely because of Carson, who ranks fifth in the NFL with 764 yards – and is among the best runners in the NFL for breaking tackles and piling up yards after contact, to a degree reminiscent of the “Beast Mode” component that Marshawn Lynch once delivered for the ‘Hawks. With four 100-yard games, Carson has taken some of the pressure off Wilson and the much-maligned O-line to provide a measure of balance for the offense. Sure, the Seahawks’ pattern has been to get into shootouts that go down to the wire and without the dominant defense once enjoyed in the Pacific Northwest, allow Wilson (4 fourth-quarter comeback W’s this season) to typically pull out some magic at the end. That’s a big reason why Carson is overlooked, which is par for the course for running backs supplemented by star quarterbacks.\n\nThe same can be said for Green Bay’s Aaron Jones, playing in the shadow of Aaron Rodgers. But every championship-contending team needs the ability to run the ball when it needs to or wants to – to move the chains, or control tempo and pace, or close out games that don’t require a furious finish. That’s what Carson offers. Yet there’s also a need for improvement in an area where he’s drawn attention for a not-so-good reason: 5 fumbles (4 lost) in 9 games. All in all, the Seahawks have scored another hit with a late-round draft pick, getting way more bang from a seventh-rounder (249th overall in 2017) than you’d expect. Guess he was overlooked coming into the NFL too.\n\nNate Davis\n\nIs anyone talking about Leonard Fournette? ICYMI, he’s the AFC’s No. 1 rusher right now with 831 yards. He’s had at least 72 yards from scrimmage in every game – largely because a guy some scouts didn’t think could catch the ball has already established a new career best with 40 receptions. In my estimation, Fournette has kinda been backburnered on the national stage following a disappointing sophomore season and then getting outshined by Minshew Mania this year. But make no mistake, Jacksonville’s rookie passer was successful in Nick Foles’ absence because Fournette was really the guy driving this bus – almost exclusively on crowded roads with seven, eight, nine defenders in the box. He deserves a lot more credit than he’s gotten to date.\n\nNo question, Buccaneers outside linebacker Shaquil Barrett is having a career year. He’s already tied his best season mark for forced fumbles, and is half a sack away from doubling his best season on that front as well … with eight games to play. In his first year in Tampa, Barrett leads the league with 10 1/2 sacks. No one has forced more fumbles than his four (some have tied). There has been no transition lull in Barrett’s move from Denver, where he spent the last five years, to Tampa. Instead, he’s hit a groove in helping the Bucs to wins over talented teams like the Panthers and Rams. Barrett’s imposing force won’t salvage an offense ranking among the league-worst in sacks, fumbles and interceptions. But when this one-year, $4 million deal in Tampa ends, Barrett should cash in.\n\nI’m going to go with Cleveland Browns running back Nick Chubb. He’s overlooked because the rest of his team is such a disappointing mess, but Chubb is quietly having a very good season and the Browns would be in even worse shape if it weren’t for him. The second-year pro is averaging 100.4 yards per game (second most behind Christian McCaffrey) and 5.2 yards per carry (fourth-most among running backs). What makes Chubb’s production even more impressive is the fact that he’s doing this despite running behind a line that has a lot of underperforming pieces.\n\nMichael Middlehurst-Schwartz\n\nBefore I give my answer, two players who warrant mention in this space: Minnesota Vikings defensive end Danielle Hunter, who will become the youngest player (currently 25) to reach 50 sacks so long as he gets his next 1 1/2 at some point this year, and Arizona Cardinals outside linebacker Chandler Jones, who has been among the league's elite tier or pass rushers in recent years yet been perpetually underrated since he was discarded by the New England Patriots. But it's time to give Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Tyler Lockett the national recognition he deserves.\n\nWhen Russell Wilson established a perfect 158.3 passer rating on the 70 throws he made to Lockett last season, the stat was treated mostly as an intriguing factoid rather than reflective of the receiver's ability. But with Lockett taking over as the unquestioned primary target after Doug Baldwin's retirement this offseason, the fifth-year veteran is delivering incredible efficiency in a featured role. He's ranked fourth in both receiving yards (767) and catches (59), and Wilson has a league-best 158 passer rating when targeting him.\n\nOperating primarily out of the slot at 5-10 and 182 pounds, Lockett isn't reminiscent of the prototype for a No. 1 receiver established by the likes of Julio Jones and Mike Evans. Yet on a team that includes physical one-percenters in DK Metcalf and newcomer Josh Gordon, it's Lockett and his on-field mind meld with Wilson that remain the key to those crazy completions and the offense establishing itself as one of the league's best units.\n\nI’m going to go with Matthew Stafford. Considering all the questions he faced entering the season about his health and about his future with the team, he is playing at an extremely high level. He ranks fourth in the NFL in passing yardage (2,499), has an impeccable 19:5 TD-to-interception ratio and his QB rating of 106 ranks him fifth in the league and would be a career best, by a wide margin. Yet, Stafford isn’t getting any love whatsoever in the MVP conversation. A big reason, likely, is because the Lions are just 3-4-1 and aren’t as relevant as the teams of players who are getting mentioned – the Seahawks, Ravens, Texans, Packers, etc. One more reason why I find Stafford’s year to be exceptional is because Detroit’s rushing game has been so inconsistent. The Lions rank 21st in rushing yards, with just 96 per game. Stafford has elevated the players around him; just look at the numbers Marvin Jones and Kenny Golladay have put up.\n\nWithout getting super philosophical here about what constitutes an \"overlooked\" player, I'm going to go with New Orleans Saints wide receiver Michael Thomas. Yes, I know he's the best wideout in the league. And yes, he's been elite for several years now. But I still don't think he's gotten enough credit for what he's done so far this season, amassing 73 catches, 875 yards and four touchdowns despite the extended absence of quarterback Drew Brees.\n\nThomas, 26, is currently on pace to finish with 146 catches (which would be an NFL single-season record) and 1,750 receiving yards (which would rank sixth all-time). But even if his production dips a bit in the second half, he will still likely put together one of the best statistical seasons by a wide receiver in the history of the league; Only three wideouts, for example, have ever recorded 120 receptions and 1,500 receiving yards in the same season.\n\nJim Ayello, Indianapolis Star\n\nMatthew Stafford. In his 11th season, Stafford is quietly enjoying his finest year as a pro. Despite a Week 5 bye, he’s second in the league in touchdowns passes (19) and fourth in yards (2,499). The only quarterbacks ranked ahead of him have yet to hit their bye weeks.\n\nHe’s also been hyper efficient throwing just five interceptions, resulting in a passer rating (106.0) that tops MVP candidate Aaron Rodgers (104.3).\n\nBob McManaman, Arizona Republic\n\nHe leads the league in rushing, is second in rushing touchdowns and is tied for second in most rushing first downs. So why aren’t we hearing enough about Dalvin Cook? The Vikings are 6-3 and have a very viable chance to make the playoffs, thanks to Cook. He’s on pace to finish with nearly 1,600 yards and 16 touchdowns. Those are All-Pro numbers and really, it should be impossible to overlook this top-performing player.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' NFL coverage on Twitter @usatodaynfl.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

But since no team in the league has clinched a playoff spot yet, the stakes remain high across the NFL with a month and a half of regular season left to play.\n\nHere are the winners and losers from Sunday’s slate of games.\n\nWinners\n\nDallas Cowboys: They might have just saved their season. The Cowboys battled back on the road to topple the Falcons, 22-19, on a game-winning field goal. Now, they sit at 5-5 and in second place in the NFC East. And, if they beat the Redskins on Thanksgiving, they’ll be tied atop the division. But even though Dallas won its pivotal game, it still has plenty to improve upon. The passing game, even with Amari Cooper (three catches for 36 yards), remains quite pedestrian. And, though unfortunate it might be (and more on that later), but a significant injury to a division foe could end up helping the Cowboys.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nAndrew Luck: Forget comeback player of the year, the Colts' quarterback is playing his way into the MVP conversation after yet another sterling performance in a 38-10 beating of the Titans. It was such a thorough domination that the Colts rested Luck with more than 10 minutes to play in the fourth quarter with the game out of hand. Luck now has seven consecutive games with at least three passing touchdowns, leaving him within striking distance of the all-time record. He trails only Peyton Manning (eight, in 2004) and Tom Brady (10, in 2007). He also became just the third player — joining Dan Marino and Aaron Rodgers — in league history to have at least 160 passing scores through their first 80 career games. And for the fifth game in a row, Indy didn’t allow Luck to get sacked — a big reason for his resurgence.\n\nSaints defense: Everyone expects New Orleans to light up the scoreboard — and they did just that in a 48-7 thumping of the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles — but it might be the team’s defense that truly makes it a legitimate Super Bowl contender. They forced three interceptions and three sacks, and limited the Eagles to just 13 first downs and three-of-10 on third-down conversions. They might give up a lot of points against other high-powered offenses (like 35 in their Week 9 victory against the Rams), but that’s also a product of playing opposite an offense that churns through points and possessions. This is a defense that can shut opponents down.\n\nJoe Flacco: It wasn’t quite the crisp performance Ravens rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson needed to unseat Joe Flacco (hip injury) as Baltimore’s clear starter, but it was a solid debut. Making his first career start, Jackson relied on his legs to help topple the division-rival Bengals, 24-21. Jackson finished with 27 carries — the most for a quarterback since 1950 — for 117 yards and completed 13 of 19 throws for 150 yards with one interception. His speed and elusiveness are unique, but Jackson showed he’s too limited as a passer to be relied upon as a week-to-week starter.\n\nLosers\n\nMinnesota Vikings: A slow start and sloppy, turnover-prone play put the Vikings in a hole they couldn’t climb out of. And in a battle for first place in the NFC North, they slipped and let the Bears take command of the division, 25-20. The Vikings (5-4-1) slid into the final playoff spot in the NFC. Pass protection, carelessness with the ball and a dormant rushing game all need to be fixed. The Bears (7-3), meanwhile, now have a nice cushion that puts them in the driver’s seat for the division. Still, a Week 17 rematch in Minnesota could ultimately decide who wins the NFC North, but the path for the Vikings to get there just got a lot harder.\n\nWashington Redskins: It’s bad enough when you’re a team in first place in a wide-open NFC East and lose, 23-21, to the Texans. It’s much worse when your starting quarterback, Alex Smith, breaks his tibia and fibula and requires immediate surgery, ending his season. That means Washington — unless they add a veteran free agent — will try to reach the playoffs with backup Colt McCoy leading the offense. Washington’s (6-4) next three opponents are all division foes, with the next two against the Cowboys (5-5) and Eagles (4-6) coming on the road. And if McCoy doesn’t step up, the team’s postseason hopes could crumble.\n\nDoug Pederson: This was the worst loss of Pederson’s head coaching career and the biggest margin of defeat by a defending Super Bowl champion. The Eagles offense is in disarray and has struggled to start games quickly. Injuries along the offensive line and in the secondary have decimated the depth chart. So, now Pederson needs to — very quickly — figure out solutions to solve the various problems (third-down ineptitude, red zone offensive inefficiency are atop the list) facing the team. Philly has lost two in a row and is 2-3 in its last five and the remaining schedule is unforgiving. Missing out on the playoffs is a very real possibility.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars: They held a 16-point lead late in the third quarter against a Steelers team they had dominated in recent history, but allowed Pittsburgh to score 20 unanswered to win the game. And now, the Jaguars (3-7) have lost six in a row, are currently the 14th seed — out of 16 teams — in the AFC playoff chase, and look like a long shot to play in January. So after last year’s AFC title game appearance, it’s clear that the Jags are one of this season’s most disappointing teams.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

After a frustration like this, the last thing you want is to respond in emotion,” said the 38-year-old Rodgers.\n\n“So take a beat, let it sit.

Joshua Bessex/Getty Images\n\nThe poor results on the field follow an offseason of turmoil for the Packers.\n\nAfter speculation that Rodgers could either retire or be traded by the team he’s played his whole career for, the four-time MVP signed a three-year contract extension which made him the highest-paid player in US sports on a per yearly basis.\n\nHowever, just days later, Rodgers’ favorite wide receiver and one of the league’s best, Davante Adams, was traded to the Las Vegas Raiders to the surprise of many.\n\nIt left Rodgers with a cast of inexperienced wide receivers and two star running backs heading into a season where expectations were once again sky high.\n\nThe Packers opened its season with a 23-7 loss to division rivals Minnesota Vikings though, but got back on track by winning three straight games.\n\nHowever, four consecutive defeats has completely altered the expectations surrounding the Packers, who were predicted to challenge for a Super Bowl title come February.\n\nGreen Bay is now three wins behind the Vikings who sit atop the NFC North, and raises the question: in a season when Rodgers turns 39 years old, can the quarterback and the Packers turn things around?", "authors": ["Ben Morse"], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/columnist/nate-davis/2023/09/14/aaron-rodgers-injury-jets-curse-super-bowl-new-york/70849594007/", "title": "Aaron Rodgers' injury deepens Jets' unparalleled run of misery", "text": "On the first day at his new Florham Park, New Jersey, office in April, Aaron Rodgers noted how the New York Jets’ \"Super Bowl 3 trophy is looking a little lonely.\"\n\nThat singular Lombardi is going to remain an only child for the foreseeable future.\n\nBy now you’ve surely heard – after his breathlessly hyped acquisition, starring role in \"Hard Knocks\" and man-about-town summer revival – Rodgers’ 2023 season is over after four snaps, his left Achilles snapping during his NYJ debut Monday night.\n\nMy USA TODAY Sports colleague Mike Freeman has written, \"Jets fans are the meanest in the league.\" Whether that's true or not, Monday exemplifies why they’re so forlorn and maybe a little hardscrabble and, yes, temperamental and perhaps too often less than sober. A friend of mine – a longtime Jets fan – texted right after Rodgers went down, \"This is the most Jets thing ever.\"\n\nPretty much.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nThe Jets and their fans – most of them born well after Joe Namath and Co. incredibly won that epic Super Bowl, perhaps the biggest upset in league history, to cap the 1968 season – just can’t have nice things. There’s a widely held, uh, \"belief\" among post-Super Bowl Gang Green supporters that Namath, now 80, struck some sort of Faustian bargain while guaranteeing his legendary upset of the justifiably favored Baltimore Colts in the days before that game was contested on Jan. 12, 1969.\n\nOn Feb. 11, 2024, Super Bowl 58 will be played in Las Vegas, but the Jets will have already come up with snake eyes. That game will mark 55 years without another NYJ championship. And while they watch two other teams vie for NFL supremacy, Jets fans will be crying in their poison of choice, armed with at least 55 reasons why their seemingly cursed club – among the 20 which have won a Lombardi Trophy – is furthest removed from Super Sunday glory. (Writer's note: Jets fans are encouraged to read no further as it may be harmful to their feels.)\n\nOnward:\n\n1. Aaron Rodgers\n\nNamath is the most legendary of all Jets. But Rodgers is the best quarterback to ever don a Jets uniform. Period. End of story. The four-time league MVP was finally going to pilot Flight NYJ back to the postseason and maybe even end the decades-long absence from the Super Bowl. But nope. Nope. Not this year. And maybe not ever given the vagaries of decades-old Achilles tendons.\n\n2. Another Achilles\n\nJets fans have been here before. Rodgers hit the deck almost 24 years to the day after QB Vinny Testaverde’s Achilles ruptured in the 1999 regular-season opener. Those Jets also had serious summertime Super Bowl aspirations on the – yes – heels of a run to the AFC championship game. They finished 8-8, good for fourth place in the AFC East. Your team may have multiple rings, but has it had multiple star QB1s succumb to blown Achilles in Week 1? Didn’t think so.\n\n3. Joe Willie\n\nNamath still casts a wide shadow over this franchise nearly five decades after he took his last snap in green and white – and justifiably so given the title he delivered and the flair with which he did it. Yet it’s remarkable that this many years later, every subsequent quarterback is still measured by his worthiness to succeed Namath – a guy who had 47 more career interceptions (220) than TD passes (173) and a passer rating of 65.5. It’s not necessarily fair to compare numbers from his era to the current one given how much the game has evolved, and his massive persona – off the field and on, where the oft-injured passer could be seen wearing fur and bell bottoms on the sideline when he wasn’t healthy enough to play – was a huge component of his aura. Still, hard to believe if Namath had played anywhere but New York that he’d warrant these amount of callbacks.\n\n4. No party on Revis Island\n\nHall of Fame CB Darrelle Revis is arguably the best overall player J-E-T-S fans have ever cheered on. However his first glorious stint with the team ended prematurely with a torn ACL early in the 2012 season. The Jets traded him to Tampa Bay the following year, the Buccaneers granting him the massive contract (6 years, $96 million) he'd sought. But it didn't work out in Tampa, and Revis wound up with the hated (by Jets fans) New England Patriots in 2014 ... where he helped end the Pats', uh, 10-year Super Bowl drought. The Jets subsequently re-signed Revis to another huge deal (5 years, $70 million) in 2015, but by then he was a steadily declining player who was unable to do for NY what he'd done in NE.\n\n5. Down goes Pennington ... again and again\n\nComing off a division crown in 2002 – the Jets’ last as it turns out – New York was riding high going into the 2003 campaign. Then, emergent fourth-year quarterback Chad Pennington broke his non-throwing wrist against the Giants in preseason, grounding the Jets – who wound up 6-10. A first-round pick in 2000, Pennington never had a howitzer arm, accuracy and touch his calling cards. But he was left with a slingshot after enduring two shoulder operations in 2005.\n\n6. Down goes Sanchez\n\nMore efficient than Pennington in the adversity department, QB Mark Sanchez, the fifth overall pick of the 2009 draft, managed to get hurt against the Giants in preseason and require surgery on his throwing shoulder in one fell swoop in 2013. Sanchez, who helped guide the Jets to consecutive AFC title games in his first two seasons, would never play for New York again.\n\n7. Butt Fumble\n\nGood as Sanchez and the Jets were early in his career, his infamous Thanksgiving night turnover against the archrival Patriots in 2012 – losing the ball after running into the backside of G Brandon Moore – was a lowlight “SportsCenter” would never let him live down and became the epitaph of the \"Sanchize.\"\n\n8. Richard Todd\n\nLike Namath, the quarterback was a first-round pick (1976) out of Alabama. Otherwise, he was unlike Namath, uncomfortable in the media spotlight and often between the lines, Todd’s record with the Jets 42-51-1. In the Jets’ own long-running version of “Succession,” Todd was the first of many who failed to fill Namath’s famous white cleats.\n\n9. Simpson!\n\nAfter leading the league with 30 (!!!) interceptions in 1980, Todd played much better in 1981 – largely thanks to the emergence of the “New York Sack Exchange.” But he reverted in the wild-card round – the Jets’ first playoff appearance in 12 years – as the team fell into a 31-13 fourth-quarter hole. But Todd engineered two late touchdown drives and was marching for the game-winning score deep in Bills territory … until he served up his fourth interception on his final throw to Buffalo's Bill Simpson.\n\n10. Richard … Todd\n\nHe threw five picks in the 1982 AFC championship game – three to Miami LB A.J. Duhe – in a 14-0 defeat to the Dolphins. Todd would never appear in another playoff game.\n\n11. Mud Bowl\n\nTodd’s meltdown in the muck wasn’t entirely responsible for derailing a talented ’82 Jets squad. The Dolphins let a deluge swamp the untarped Miami Orange Bowl, the sloppy field conditions negating the Jets’ speed advantage and perhaps costing them a legitimate shot at reaching Super Bowl 17.\n\n12. Kleck-No\n\nYet maybe those ’82 Jets are hosting the AFC title tilt if future Hall of Fame DE Joe Klecko, runner-up for Defensive Player of the Year in 1981 after recording 20½ sacks (unofficially), didn’t rupture his patella tendon in the game before the players’ strike and miss most of the season.\n\n13. Little brother\n\nThe Jets have spent most of their 64-season existence as second-class citizens at multipurpose Shea Stadium beneath baseball’s New York Mets – at least it was in Queens – or subletting a “home” in New Jersey dubbed \"Giants Stadium.\" They’re now officially co-tenants with the Giants at suburban MetLife Stadium, though neither club has been especially good – overall – since occupying it in 2010 (though the G-Men did win Super Bowl 46 following the 2011 campaign). The Giants needed 18 years to match the Jets with a Super Bowl victory following the 1986 season. Big Blue is now up 4-1.\n\n14. Home-field disadvantage?\n\nThe Jets have never even hosted a postseason game at MetLife.\n\n15. Tim Tebow\n\nGawd.\n\n16. Jets self-disadvantage?\n\nSince the AFC East was formed after the 1970 AFL-NFL merger, the Jets have won it … twice (1998, 2002).\n\n17. Not-so-Mean Green?\n\nThe Jets have played the Philadelphia Eagles 12 times – and never beaten them. They’ll host the reigning NFC champs in Week 6 … obviously minus Rodgers.\n\n18. Grounded\n\nSince the merger, the Jets have never had a 4,000-yard passer. Only Ryan Fitzpatrick, in 2015, had as many as 30 TD passes (31) in a season. Rodgers was supposed to eclipse both benchmarks in 2023.\n\n19. Not enough Fitz-magic\n\nWhile Fitzpatrick may have had one of Jets’ best fantasy quarterbacking efforts (those 31 TDs accompanied by 3,905 yards in 2015), his three fourth-quarter interceptions in the regular-season finale – a 22-17 loss to a Bills squad that was 7-8 entering the game – cost the Jets an all-too-rare playoff spot. Worse, Buffalo was coached by former Jets HC Rex Ryan.\n\n20. No Fitz-magic\n\nFitzpatrick and the Jets had a contractual standoff during the 2016 offseason even though he had no other serious opportunities in free agency and the team had no better option behind center. He eventually re-signed before training camp, but a six-interception performance in Week 3 against Kansas City led to multiple benchings during the season. Unsurprisingly, Fitzpatrick became a Buccaneer in 2017.\n\n21. Captain Rex\n\nRyan may have been a bit of a caricature given how he played to the New York media and might be best remembered for his “Let's go eat a goddamn snack” rant during the 2010 edition of “Hard Knocks.” Yet he was also generally beloved by his players and a defensive savant, always able to apply copious pressure despite never having an elite pass rusher in New York. Ryan’s first two seasons ended with defeats in the AFC championship game, then his tenure was slowly unraveled by injuries and drama. Still, probably no Jets HC was better, save Super Bowl winner Weeb Ewbank.\n\n22. Doug Brien\n\nHad the Jets kicker made either of his field-goal attempts – both inside 50 yards – in the final two minutes of regulation, the Jets would have upset the 15-1 Steelers at Heinz Field and advanced to the 2004 AFC championship game. Alas, too much to ask as Pittsburgh prevailed in overtime.\n\n23. Fading stars\n\nDid you remember eventual Hall of Famers Steve Atwater, Alan Faneca, Ty Law, Ronnie Lott, Art Monk, Ed Reed, Jason Taylor and LaDainian Tomlinson played for the Jets? All had brief stints with the team, most completely forgettable.\n\n24. Rising star burns brighter elsewhere\n\nEventual Hall of Famer John Riggins was also a Jet, though he started his career in New York. But despite being the team MVP twice in his first five seasons, including a Pro Bowl effort in 1975, he and the club couldn’t get on the same page financially or philosophically. Riggins left for Washington in 1976 and went on to be a league MVP and Super Bowl 17’s MVP.\n\n25. The Brett Favre Experience\n\nYou probably didn’t forget the three-time MVP joined the team in 2008 after another retirement reversal in Green Bay led to his departure and Rodgers' ascendance. And though Favre sexually harassed a club employee, and the team kicked Pennington to the curb, it almost worked – the Jets starting 8-3 and looking like a legit Super Bowl threat. Then Favre tore his biceps, tried to play through it, the team failed to report it … and finished 9-7.\n\n26. The Favre near-miss\n\nIronically, the Jets were desperate to draft Favre in 1991 but didn’t have a first-round pick. They almost got him anyway – except the Atlanta Falcons snatched him with the 33rd overall selection. The Jets picked 34th and wound up with Louisville QB Browning Nagle, who won three of 13 starts in New York.\n\n27. Pennington’s revenge\n\nAfter being dumped for Favre, Pennington joined the division-rival Dolphins in 2008. He led Miami to a 24-17 victory at the Meadowlands in the regular-season finale, giving the Fins the AFC East crown, eliminating the Jets and cementing Comeback Player of the Year honors for himself.\n\n28. 'Mangenius'\n\nPerhaps trying to replicate some of Bill Belichick’s success, the Jets raided his New England staff for defensive coordinator Eric Mangini, perceived as a rising star, prior to the 2006 season. It went well at first, Mangini leading the Jets to a wild-card berth – they were smoked by the Patriots 37-16 – and earning a cameo on “The Sopranos.” Then he initiated the Spygate controversy against Belichick and things went … less well. After 2008’s Favre-ian collapse, Mangini was fired having never returned the Jets to postseason.\n\n29. Zach Wilson\n\nYou can’t miss on the second pick of the draft, and maybe the Jets didn’t when they selected Wilson in 2021. But his ineffectiveness wrought the Rodgers trade in the first place, though Wilson now gets another shot at redemption.\n\n30. Sam Darnold\n\nYou can’t miss on the third pick of the draft, either, but the Jets pivoted from Darnold to Wilson after just three seasons – though in part to reset the quarterback position financially. And, in Darnold’s defense, the organization came up woefully short in regard to constructing a supporting cast around him.\n\n31. Mono?\n\nThe NFL isn’t high school, but Darnold was nevertheless knocked out for three games in 2019 with the virus.\n\n32. Ghosts?\n\nShortly after returning from the mono, Darnold was picked off four times in a Monday night loss to the Patriots, an NFL Films mic catching him saying, “I'm seeing ghosts.” Little more than a year later, the Darnold era had been exorcised.\n\n33. Trevor Lawrence\n\nHowever before Darnold was traded to the Carolina Panthers to make way for Wilson, he led the previously 0-13 Jets to wins over the Rams and Browns, a pair of teams that reached the playoffs in 2020. The wins proved catastrophic for the Jets, costing them the chance to take Clemson’s Lawrence, widely considered a generational prospect, atop the 2021 draft.\n\n34. Geno\n\nA second-round pick in 2013, QB Geno Smith replaced injured Sanchez. But Smith’s forgettable four-year hitch with the team is best remembered for the broken jaw he suffered after being punched by a teammate in a locker room argument over a debt.\n\n35. Hack\n\nAt least Smith, whose career finally took off with the Seattle Seahawks in 2022, got on the field. New York has butchered plenty of drafts through the years, but most quarterback busts at least earn one regular-season snap before being Jet-tisoned. Not so for 2016 second-round Penn State product Christian Hackenberg, whose selection was widely derided in the moment.\n\n36. Mari-no\n\nPerhaps you’re familiar with the legendary 1983 draft – the one that produced eight Hall of Famers, three of them quarterbacks? The Jets didn’t get any of them. They could have had Dan Marino, who would go on to torment them for years in Miami, with the 24th selection but took UC-Davis’ Ken O’Brien instead. Rock on.\n\n37. No repeat\n\nThe Jets’ Super Bowl reign lasted one year after the Chiefs dethroned them at Shea Stadium in the divisional round of the 1969 AFL playoffs. Namath’s ability to pass was compromised on a gusty day, and the game turned when the Jets were stonewalled despite a first-and-goal from the Kansas City 1-yard line in the fourth quarter. New York lost 13-6 in what turned out to be Namath’s final postseason appearance.\n\n38. 1986 Jets …\n\n… fundamentally different than the legendary, World Series-winning 1986 Mets. The Jets actually started the season 10-1, including an unforgettable 51-45 overtime thriller over Miami in Week 3. But the Dolphins doused that hot start with a 45-3 rout on Monday night in Week 12. The Jets never won another regular-season game.\n\n39. 1986-87 Jets\n\nDespite ending the regular-season on a five-game skid, New York recovered enough to beat the Chiefs in the wild-card round. But a week later, they coughed up a 20-10 fourth-quarter lead in Cleveland – assisted by DE Mark Gastineau’s roughing penalty on QB Bernie Kosar on a second-and-24 pass. The Browns prevailed 23-20 in double overtime on Jan. 3, 1987.\n\n40. Slater and the sack dance\n\nGastineau was a great player in his prime, leading the league in sacks in 1983 and 1984 with a staggering total of 41, 22 in the latter season when he set the (since broken) single-season standard. But his pursuit of stats and maybe actress Brigitte Nielsen didn’t always endear him to teammates. And opponents were none too fond of his (ridiculously bad) celebratory post-sack dances. This was especially true of Hall of Famer Jackie Slater, who shoved Gastineau after he bagged QB Vince Ferragamo in 1983, inciting a bench-clearing melee between the Jets and Rams. The NFL outlawed excessive celebrations like Gastineau’s in 1984, the league acronym alternately interpreted as “No Fun League.”\n\n41. 1980 Saints and 1991 Colts\n\nBoth teams went 1-15. Both teams beat the Jets.\n\n42. 'Heidi Game'\n\nThe Jets were beating the Oakland Raiders, a bitter AFL rival at the time, 32-29 in the 10th game of the 1968 season. However the game ran long, and NBC cut away from it and instead offered East Coast viewers the film “Heidi” at 7 p.m. Oakland won with a pair of touchdowns in the final minute, winning a 43-32 stunner most of the country was deprived of. Didn’t take long for the league and its broadcast partners to ensure games were aired until conclusion in affected markets … though that didn’t help the Jets.\n\n43. Vernon Gholston\n\nThe Ohio State pass rusher was the sixth overall pick of the 2008 draft. He collected exactly zero sacks in the NFL.\n\n44. Blair Thomas\n\nThe Penn State tailback was the second overall pick of the 1990 draft … and averaged about 500 rushing yards over his four seasons in Gotham. To think future Hall of Famers Cortez Kennedy and Junior Seau were on the board with Thomas. Or, if New York really had to have a runner, eventual all-time leading rusher Emmitt Smith was around until No. 17.\n\n45. Sal Alosi\n\nThe Jets’ strength and conditioning coach for four years, he tripped a Dolphins player running down the sideline during a 2010 game (among various other misdeeds during his employment). Alosi was suspended after the incident and never returned to the team.\n\n46. Fake spike\n\nA play that's become quasi-common was a revelation on November 27, 1994. The Jets, 6-5 at the time under first-year coach Pete Carroll and driving toward the playoffs, led the Dolphins 24-6 in the second half. But Marino brought Miami back and delivered the coup de grâce with 22 seconds remaining, an 8-yard TD pass to Mark Ingram – after faking out the NYJ defense by pretending to spike the ball and stop the clock – and giving the Dolphins a 28-24 victory. The Jets didn’t win again that season, and Carroll was fired.\n\n47. Richie\n\nOn the heels of canning then-unproven Carroll, then-Jets owner Leon Hess turned to Rich Kotite, saying: \"I'm 80 years old and I want results now.” Kotite lasted two years … and the results were the Jets going 4-28.\n\n48. Peyton: No thanks\n\nMuch of Jets’ fans angst might have been alleviated – had Peyton Manning decided to leave the University of Tennessee after his junior season and entered the 1997 draft, when the Jets held the No. 1 pick. However he returned to the Vols, and then things got worse for Gang Green …\n\n49. 1997 draft\n\nComing off a 1-15 season, and with Manning not in play, newly acquired HC Bill Parcells decided to restock his roster. So he dealt down from No. 1 to No. 6, passing on the opportunity to snatch future Hall of Fame LT Orlando Pace. Then Parcells dropped from No. 6 to No. 8, passing on the opportunity to get future Hall of Fame LT Walter Jones. (Ugh and ugh.) LB James Farrior, who was much better in Pittsburgh later in his career than during his Gotham stint, \"headlined\" New York's forgettable haul, which could have also included Hall of Fame TE Tony Gonzalez, who went 13th.\n\n50. Lou Holtz and the ’76 Jets\n\nWhat a Bicentennial for Jets fans as the successful college coach took over their team. Holtz made his players learn a fight song, then fled to the University of Arkansas with a game left to play. No other Jets squad was outscored by this many points (214), until the 2020 team matched the differential (though it played two more games). The pre-Holtz 1975 Jets were only slightly more competitive. Collectively, the 1975 and ’76 Jets both went 3-11 while chewing up and spitting out four head coaches. Namath won four of 21 starts and threw 44 INTs (against 19 TDs) during his final two years with the team.\n\n51. Johnny ‘Lam’ Jones\n\nNew York hoped his Olympic speed would translate into stardom. Not so much. The No. 2 pick of the 1980 draft never looked natural as a receiver, often leaving his feet while trying to catch easy passes. The next player taken was Hall of Famer Anthony Munoz, arguably the best left tackle of all time. The next receiver selected was Monk.\n\n52. Kyle Brady\n\nNew York could have had Warren Sapp ... or Law ... or Derrick Brooks. But in typical J-E-T-S fashion, they screwed it up royally and took the plodding Penn State tight end with the ninth pick of the 1995 draft. (And the availability of Law and Brooks didn't deter the Jets from choosing DE Hugh Douglas 16th overall, either.) How cruel have the Nittany Lions been to the Jets?\n\n53. Bill Belichick\n\nHe never coached a game for the Jets but was twice their interim boss, bookending Parcells’ 1997-99 tenure. The second time, Belichick stepped down after a day, rendering his decision on a napkin that read, “I resign as HC of the NYJ.” He subsequently took over the Patriots for the 2000 season … and proceeded to give the Jets a few problems over the coming decades.\n\n54. The other Brady\n\nIn their first game after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the Jets gave their fans a minor lift by beating Belichick’s Patriots 10-3 in Foxborough. Footnote: During that game, Jets LB Mo Lewis nearly killed – seriously – New England QB Drew Bledsoe with a hard hit on the sideline. With Bledsoe headed for the hospital, QB2 Tom Brady entered that game … and basically didn’t leave for 19 miserable seasons (for Jets fans anyway).\n\n55. No playoff pain\n\nIt’s been some time since the Jets tormented their fans with gut-punching postseason pitfalls – basically because they haven’t qualified since 2010. (No other team has a playoff drought that extends further than 2015.) Rodgers was going to change that in 2023 but, barring an ability to warg Wilson, he won’t.\n\nBut there’s always next year – a phrase Jets fans know only promises misery with a new, unimaginable twist.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on X, formerly Twitter @ByNateDavis.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/14"}]}

The fact that this is a fan-voted award means so much to me,” Swift said in her acceptance speech. “It's really felt like the adventure of a lifetime this past year. I cannot believe that it was a year ago at the VMAs that I announced the 'Midnights' album. All I have to say tonight is thank you.\"\n\nDiddy's twin daughters, son King Combs join him on stage at VMAs as he accepts Global Icon Award\n\nDiddy has been a global icon but Tuesday night, he was awarded with the official honor at the MTV VMAs.\n\nBefore accepting the Global Icon Award from Mary J.

That's the only intention.\"\n\nShakira hits VMAs stage after 17 years to perform medley of hits, receives Vanguard Award\n\nShakira made history Tuesday night as the first South American artist to be honored with the Video Vanguard Award at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nBefore being honored, the Grammy-winning singer returned to the MTV VMAs stage for the first time in 17 years. Shakira hit the stage with an electric 10-minute bilingual medley of her decades of hits — \"She Wolf,\" her collaboration with Rauw Alejandro \"Te Felicito,\" the viral, record-breaking \"Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53\" with Bizarrap among them — in a set introduced by her \"Hips Don’t Lie\" collaborator Wyclef Jean.\n\nWhile accepting her honor, Shakira gave an extra thanks to the \"amazing women\" who helped her push industry boundaries while \"wearing so many hats.\" She also thanked her two sons Milan, 9, and Sasha, 7, for believing she could do it all.\n\nNSYNC reunites at VMAs to present Taylor Swift the best pop award\n\nNSYNC reunited during the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards Tuesday night to the delight of '80s and '90s kids across the country.\n\nThe five-piece boyband consisting of Justin Timberlake, Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, Chris Kirkpatrick and JC Chasez took to the stage to present the best pop award. The winner was none other than Swift, a fan herself who was visibly excited as she accepted the award.\n\n\"I had your dolls,\" she told the former boy band members. \"What’s going to happen now? They’re doing something and I need to know what it is. You’re pop personified.\"\n\nNSYNC hasn't released new music in two decades. After several years of chart-topping hits, the band's fourth and last album, \"Celebrity,\" released in 2001. They went on hiatus the following year, which is also when Timberlake's Grammy-winning debut solo album, \"Justified,\" released.\n\nBrutally honest reviewsof every VMAs performance, including Shakira, Nicki Minaj and Demi Lovato\n\nPeso Pluma makes history as the first Mexican performer at the VMAs\n\nAmid columns of white light, the cool Mexican hotshot strutted around a circle of musicians waving his hands and bobbing through “Lady Gaga.” Even behind his ebony shades, Pluma’s intensity shot between the beams. Sprightly horns and upright bass colored the song, a hit from his third album, “Genesis.”\n\nAhead of his performance, Pluma received death threats from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel due to a concert scheduled for Oct. 14 at Caliente Stadium in Tijuana, which could be canceled.\n\nEarly Tuesday morning, a banner threatening the singer was found on a vehicular bridge located at Prolongación Calle Segunda and Mirador Boulevard in La Isla subdivision of Tijuana.\n\n“This goes to Peso Pluma, refrain from presenting yourself on October 14, because it will be your last show due to your disrespect and loose tongue, you show up and we are going to (break you),” reads the banner signed by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.\n\nContributing: Jennifer McClellan, Melissa Ruggieri, Anthony Robledo, KiMi Robinson, USA TODAY; Diana Garcia, Mexico City correspondent for Arizona Republic\n\nThe full VMAs winners list,including Taylor Swift and Stray Kids", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/09/28/fall-concerts-phoenix-2019-upcoming/2280708001/", "title": "Fall concerts in Phoenix: Ariana Grande, Jonas Brothers, A$AP Ferg", "text": "There are hundreds of touring acts making their way through Phoenix in the next few weeks, from Ariana Grande to the hippest up-and-coming artists still working their way up the food chain in the Valley's more intimate venues.\n\nHere's a guide to the best of the bigger tours headed our way, from Post Malone and Grande to the Jonas Brothers, Summer Walker, Cher and one of country's hottest acts in recent memory, Luke Combs.\n\nBe sure to check our monthly concert guides to stay up on those smaller, up-and-coming artists in the clubs.\n\nA$AP Ferg\n\nPitchfork praised this A$AP Mob sensation for having brought \"a tantalizing skill set to the table, a startling versatility and an electricity that not even his more famous friend can touch\" in response to his first album, \"Trap Lord.\" Ferg's more famous friend, of course, is A$AP Rocky, who remains more famous six years later.

The album follows 2017's “Moh Lhean,” which found him adopting a more reflective world view in the wake of a health scare while at the same time drifting into haunted psychedelic folk.

They're fronted by singer-guitarists Devon Allman (Gregg's son) and Duane Betts (Dickey's son, whose first name is a tip of the hat to the late Duane Allman). And their bassist is Berry Duane Oakley, the son of Allmans bassist Berry Oakley. None of this would matter if they didn't rise to the occasion with an album that honors the family tradition in style and substance.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, Sept. 10-11.

They're playing Mesa on a tour celebrating their 20th anniversary. \"The Wilderness,\" their latest album, earned a perfect score from the reviewer at the Austin Chronicle, who called it \"textured, ornate, and somehow seeping into the deepest parts of you.\" The Line of Best Fit also loved \"The Wilderness,\" calling is \"thrillingly foreign yet familiar in its finest moments.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 11.

But despite the introspective nature of the lyrics and the way the first song sounds like it was captured in the middle of a dream, it doesn’t feel like the work of a bedroom-pop auteur. Too many of the album’s highlights rock too much to warrant that description, from the richly orchestrated pop charms of “The Bus Song” to the post-punk grinding of “1 Billion Dogs.” And the followup will be here by the time she gets to Phoenix.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 11.

We’re a new band. We just came out.\" They've actually been doing this since 1991, and it shows. In a good way.

Well, he's still on the road five years later, offering the upscale country hits (and pop crossovers) that gave him more than 30 chart-toppers. The 74-year-old's best moments — \"Daydreams About Night Things,\" \"(There's) No Gettin' Over Me\" and his oh-so-smooth take on Burt Bacharach's \"Any Day Now\" — have certainly held up well.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 6.

And they do it all while weighing in on topics as dark as anxiety, oppression, exploitation and the problematic patriarchy, a bracing reminder that there's more than one path to catharsis.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 6.

From \"Planet Claire\" to \"Dance This Mess Around,\" it still sounds like it dropped in from another, much quirkier planet, wrapped in kitschy day-glo yellow.

And given the strength of the writing and singing on “Lush,” it’s easy to hear what made them want to go that heavy on the praise.\n\nIt’s like a hit parade of introspective bedroom-pop as Jordan spills the contents of her diary in songs about boredom and sadness and feeling alone with the vulnerability it takes to put those kind of songs across while staying in her comfort zone, with bittersweet on one side, melancholy on the other.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 20.

The line got a huge applause.\n\nCarey was the headliner, following the inductions of the weirdly cool producers the Neptunes, the British electro-pop band Eurythmics, psychedelic bluesman Steve Miller and the iconic Isley Brothers. Special guests included Smokey Robinson, Leslie Odom Jr. Questlove, Jon Batiste and Usher.\n\nSongwriters are eligible for induction after writing hit songs for at least 20 years and the hall includes such iconic songwriters as Burt Bacharach, Missy Elliott, Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon, Billy Joel and Carly Simon. New annual slates are voted on by the membership.\n\nSt. Vincent kicked off the night with a blistering cover of Eurythmics' “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This).” She later came to the podium to recount the time she first caught a glimpse on MTV when a “beautiful, orange-haired androgynous creature appeared wearing a suit and tie.”\n\nThat was Annie Lennox, who with Dave Stewart led the New Wave charge in the 1980s. “They were scary, they were sexy, they were smart and they were impossibly cool,” St. Vincent said. The Eurythmics then reunited for a rendition of “Here Comes the Rain Again.” Lennox, looking out at the audience, said everyone had gone through so much during the past few years. “I feel like it's a miracle that we're here tonight,” she said.\n\nBryan Cranston introduced his friend Miller, who perfected a psychedelic blues sound with such hits as “Take the Money and Run,” “Abracadabra,” “The Joker,” “Jet Airliner” and “Jungle Love.” Miller took to the stage for a spacy, effect-heavy version of his hit “Fly Like an Eagle.” Cranston jokingly called Miller \"the space cowboy himself.\"\n\nLil Nas X was honored with the Hal David Starlight Award, which recognizes “gifted young songwriters who are making a significant impact in the music industry via their original songs.” He took the award wearing a white tuxedo and a mob of frizzy blond hair, tweaking the usual acceptance speech: “Thank you to my imaginary husband and kids,” he said.\n\nRepresenting the Isley Brothers, were Elaine Isley Goodstone, Ernie Isley and Ronald Isley. Ernie Isley reminded the guests that their early hit “Shout,” was recorded 63 years ago and their music would go on for decades, prompting the Beatles to cover them. The two men then joined up for a medley of hits that included “That Lady,\" “It’s Your Thing” and “Between the Sheets.” Lil Nas X was one of the members of the audience on his feet bopping along.\n\nJimmy Jam and Terry Lewis introduced another songwriting duo — Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo who as the Neptunes shaped pop and urban radio from the ’90s well into the 2000s thanks to crafting hits for Britney Spears, Jay-Z, Justin Timberlake, Usher and Beyoncé.\n\nPre-pandemic announcement:Mariah Carey, Pharrell Williams, Eurythmics among 2020 Songwriters Hall of Fame inductees\n\nWilliams tried to give advice to up-and-coming songwriters, warning them that the music industry was an often dangerous place. “Life is like Legos. Songs, like life, are put together piece by piece,” he said. “If you build a really strong foundation, you won't fall.”\n\nQuestlove introduced Carey and regretted that all too often her songwriting chops were often overlooked. With 19 No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, she is only behind the Beatles, and Questlove remined the crowd that she did it as a Black woman. “Success at this level, especially for Black artists, is a real obstacle course,” he said.\n\nCarey said a dysfunctional background prompted a dark vision of the world as a 6-year-old, so music and melodies and lyrics were her escape. She said she always has to remind people she's a songwriter first, but the diva label seems to stick more. She left the crowd revved up for a performance but other artists came onstage to sing a medley of her songs, including “Fantasy,” “Hero,” “Make It Happen” and “We Belong Together.”\n\nNon-performing solo nominees this year were William “Mickey” Stevenson, a producer during Motown's golden era, who was serenaded by Robinson, calling Stevenson “my brother brother,” and Rick Nowels, who co-wrote over 60 Top 20 singles worldwide, including Belinda Carlisle’s global hit “Heaven is a Place on Earth.”\n\nMaster songwriter Paul Williams received the Johnny Mercer Award, and Universal executive Jody Gerson received the Abe Olman Publisher Award.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/12/30/winter-concert-picks-phoenix-tempe-guide/77978126/", "title": "Winter concert picks for Phoenix", "text": "Ed Masley\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nThere may be fewer artists on the road in winter than in other three seasons. But there are still plenty of highly recommended concerts swinging through the Valley, from Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band blowing the dust off \"The River\" to Meat Wave exploding on impact at the Valley Bar.

And he's not finished adding to that history. He topped the country charts with last year's \"Band of Brothers,\" his first release to focus on predominantly new material in nearly 20 years. Of course, he'll probably just play some subtle variation of the set he always plays, but it's a good one, from \"Crazy\" and \"Funny How Time Slips Away\" to \"On the Road Again.\" Nelson also is known for such classics as \"Red Headed Stranger,\" \"Hello Walls,\" a heartbreaking cover of \"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain\" and the great Waylon Jennings duets \"Good Hearted Woman\" and \"Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys.\"\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 5.

Their latest single, \"Downtown,\" peaked at No. 12 and boasted guest appearances by Eric Nally and hip-hop pioneers Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee and Melle Mel.

But that year's Grammy-nominated \"New York City\" was a multilingual masterpiece of cultural cross-pollination that found the Sabina Sciubba and her bandmates expanding the scope of their sound without turning their backs on the dance floor. And they've apparently been working on a new one since returning from a temporary breakup, so there is a chance they'll want to share some new material at this, their first performance of the new year.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, Jan. 12.

That same year, they spent the summer in the H.O.R.D.E. Festival, recording \"Big Head Todd and the Monsters Live\" along the way. Four years later, John Lee Hooker joined them on a charting cover of his \"Boom Boom.\" So what have they done for us lately? They were in fine form on last year's \"Black Beehive,\" setting the tone with the swaggering blues-rock of an opening track called \"Hey Delila.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 24.

Kerrang! summed it up rather nicely with \"They continue to blast out their post-punk hymns to the end of the world with a wild-eyed mania that's genuinely scary\" while PopMatters wrote that the album \"reminds us that no one can make a soundtrack for the apocalypse quite like Killing Joke.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Monday, Jan. 25.

Old-timey roots music (country blues, gospel, ragtime) lends itself, it would appear, to such topics as waking the dead, praying to the moon and digging in the ground for a stranger’s bones. Their latest album, “I’m a Stranger Here,” was produced by alternative-country icon Buddy Miller in Nashville (the establishment of which would have nothing to do with this record — in a good way).\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 30.

And they're still going strong with a great new album \"Silence in the Snow.\" It's their seventh release and as the review in Alternative Press was right to note, \"the Florida foursome still manage to top themselves with each outing.\" The twin-guitar solos alone would make this album — and this concert — worth your while.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 30.

And here's what's truly great about this tour: It also features A$AP Ferg, the A$AP Mob sensation who inspired Pitchfork to praise his work for having brought \"a tantalizing skill set to the table, a startling versatility and an electricity that not even his more famous friend can touch.” His best-known songs are “Work” and “Shabba.” But that list will grow.\n\nDetails: 6 p.m. Friday, Feb. 5.

Her other hits include the equally infectious “Good Time” (with guest vocals by Owl City) and “I Really Like You,” a song whose music video includes a very entertaining Tom Hanks mouthing Jepsen's words.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 24.

Last year's \"Allergic to Water\" more than lives up to the singer's legacy, from the gently grooving funk of an opening track on which she memorably rhymes \"Mama look at this headline / They say we’re getting dumber\" with \"They keep doing them tests on stuff / And coming out with new bummers.\"\n\nDetails: 9 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 24.

You can sample the catalog on \"A Document of Dissent: 1993-2013,\" a powerful overview that hit the streets in mid-2014. Or check out their latest political broadsides on this year's \"American Spring,\" a collection of tracks as explosive (and urgent) as any of their earliest releases.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 24.

As Absolute Punk responded to \"Around the World & Back,\" their second album, while they're \"not necessarily reinventing the idea of what it means to be a pop punk band, they’ve sure as hell perfected it.\"\n\nDetails: 5:30 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 27.

The touring lineup features Dave Mustaine (of course), Kiko Loureiro (formerly of Angra) on guitar, David “Junior” Ellefson on bass, and drummer Chris Adler (Lamb of God), all of whom are featured on \"Dystopia.\" Mustaine and Ellefson formed Megadeth in 1983, shortly after Mustaine's dismissal from Metallica. The thrash-metal pioneers are considered one of the genre's \"big four,\" alongside Metallica, Anthrax and Slayer. Their brilliantly titled debut, \"Killing is My Business... And Business is Good\" failed to chart, but second album \"Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?\" began a string of platinum releases, including \"So Far, So Good... So What?,\" \"Rust in Peace,\" the double-platinum \"Countdown to Extinction,\" \"Youthanasia\" and \"Cryptic Writings.\"\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 27. Comerica Theatre, 400 W.

This year brought their second post-reunion effort, \"Mono,\" which more than lived up to their legacy. Lead singer Raul Malo, with his Roy Orbison-esque tenor, is one of Nashville's most distinctive vocalists.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 27.

This tour will feature the E Street Band playing \"The River\" in its entirety. Released in 1980, \"The River\" was the Hall of Famer's first chart-topping effort, sending \"Hungry Heart\" to No. 5 and \"Fade Away\" to No. 20. The tour is timed to coincide with the release of a box set called \"The Ties That Bind: The River Collection,\" a comprehensive look at one of Springstreen's most enduring efforts. Rolling Stone has called \"The Ties That Bind\" the best archival Springsteen package yet. The set also includes a two-DVD film of never-released, newly edited multi-camera footage from a 1980 show in Tempe, described by NPR as something of a \"holy grail.\"\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Thursday, March 10.

The siblings have been on hiatus from Fiery Furnaces since 2011, the same year Eleanor went solo with \"Last Summer.\" By the time she gets to Phoenix, she'll be touring on \"New View,\" which follows the excellent \"Personal Record,\" an album as intensely introspective as the title would suggest, despite the fact that the songs are all co-writes with John Wesley Harding.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Saturday, March 12.

That makes it a big deal that this year's \"The Color Before the Sun\" isn't based on the Armory Wars at all, setting aside the science fiction so Claudio Sanchez could share the real-life details of his own experiences. And yes, I'm well aware that this concert is actually on the second day of spring, but I'd already written this before I checked the calendar.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Monday, March 21.

The first of three self-titled Weezer albums, it sold more than 3million copies, largely on the strength of three great videos: \"Undone – The Sweater Song,\" the \"Happy Days\"-themed \"Buddy Holly\" and \"Say It Ain't So.\" \"Pinkerton,\" a second album based in part on \"Madame Butterfly,\" killed the momentum, but it's now remembered in some circles as the greatest Weezer album ever.

And Homme was even more effective on \"Kalopsia,\" a waltz-time gem that takes the whisper-to-a-scream approach Nirvana borrowed from the Pixies to infectious new extremes. \"My God Is the Sun,\" a dark, dramatic goth-blues anthem with a million-dollar chorus hook, gave them their highest-charting rock hit since 2005's \"Little Sister\" for a reason.

And it ended on a high note with Huffington Post premiering their new video for “One Time,” which the critic hailed as “premium!”\n\nThe article goes on to say, “Two factors make ‘One Time’ wickedly powerful and evocative: first, the song’s Spartan melody, which is totally bereft of harmonic layering and digital enhancement, just a single acoustic guitar. And second, the spine-chilling, devouring potency of (Jordan) White’s highly charged vocals.”\n\nIt's a striking video, shot by Brian Dellis, who complements the understated, acoustic-guitar-and-voice recording by keeping the camera trained on White, a captivating presence, as she walks the streets singing the bittersweet lyrics (in a really nice coat).\n\nThe song was recorded at Switchblade Studios in Tempe as a demo while working on pre-production for the upcoming Jane N' The Jungle project. As White says, the \"raw demo recording captured something uniquely beautiful and pure with having no added effects, overdubs, vocal correction, and very little production.\"\n\nThey also felt it didn't really fit the album they plan to release in 2018, so they decided to share it as a single and release it as \"an end-of-the-year reflective song.\"\n\nThe video was directed by Dellis with the same intention as the demo, to keep it simple hoping to capture raw authentic moments.\n\nRolling Stone names Phoenix native Tommy Ash a country artist you need to know\n\nPhoenix native Tommy Ash, a veteran of the local scene who now resides in Nashville, was named to a Rolling Stone magazine's list of 10 New Country Artists You Need to Know.\n\nThe magazine described her sound as \"country shuffles, train beats and honky-tonk heartbreak, all delivered by a magnetic entertainer who's been serenading barflies since the age of 13.\" The writer cited Dwight Yoakam, Waylon Jennings and Margo Price as fairly spot-on frames of reference.\n\nAnd Ash is quoted in the article as saying, \"I make revved-up honky-tonk bar-room music. It's not mellow. It really moves.\"\n\nThe story talks about the singer growing up \"a bar-room baby,\" hanging out at country gigs in Arizona with her mom and dad before taking the stage in her early teens, where she sang country covers every Friday and Saturday night at a Phoenix roadhouse.\n\nAsh, who moved to Nashville in 2016, shared a link to Rolling Stone on Facebook, where she wrote, \"Umm Holy S--t guys!!!!!! I am so BEYOND EXCITED to share this with you! ROLLING STONE included me in The Top 10 New Country Artists You Need to Know!!!!

It’s all about International Jazz Day. I done got caught up in this for the last seven years. And I think it’s wonderful, man.”\n\nInternational Jazz Day was founded in 2011 by Herbie Hancock, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz \"to highlight jazz and its diplomatic role of uniting people in all corners of the globe.\"\n\nJones held the first International Jazz Day celebration in the Valley in 2013, a year after attending Jazz Day in New Orleans.\n\n“They had 7,000 people out there at about 8 o’clock in the morning,” he recalls. “It was a phenomenal site. And after the concert, which was simulcast around the world, I had an opportunity to talk to Herbie Hancock for 5 or 10 minutes. I showed him my jazz magazine that I published in New Orleans. And Herbie said, “Doc man, you’ve got a platform. You need to be marketing this day. It’s gonna be big one year.”\n\nAfter getting City Council member Michael Johnson on board, Jones arranged an introduction with George Benson, who as Jones says, “allowed me to use his personality and his image for the first two years as my guest speaker and we were off and running.”\n\nThis past April, Governor Doug Ducey declared April 30th International Jazz Day, a proclamation he presented at the day’s events at Cityscape.\n\nIn the proclamation, Ducey called jazz “the universal language of freedom spoken eloquently by people in the United States and abroad” and “an international language that bridges differences and brings people together regardless of race, age, gender or socio-economic class.”\n\nNext year’s Jazz Day Celebrations will begin on April 7 at the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts followed by the 2nd Annual Jazz at Lunchtime event at the State Capitol on April 18 and an event on April 28 in Surprise before concluding a month-long celebration of the music April 29 at Mesa Arts Center.\n\nJones is currently looking for sponsors and partners to underwrite his efforts.\n\n“To do it correctly, we need to raise $150,000 to $200,000, to do what I’ve been trying to do,” he says. “The biggest cost is the talent. Eventually, when we have the budget, we’ll be able to put super talent on. I’ve been talking with Kenny Garrett, Jonathan Butler, Stephanie Jordan, Azar Lawrence. I’ve got artists ready to go. And then the model I believe in, some people have been mentoring me out of New Orleans, they said, “Doc, man, always have 80 percent local talent.” That’s what they do in New Orleans.”\n\nEventually, Jones says, he’d like to do a Jazz Day celebration that felt a little more Viva PHX but for jazz, held on multiple stages, with artists playing different kinds of jazz in different locations.\n\nTo learn more about Jazz Day here in Arizona, you can visit Jones’ site at http://www.jazzdayaz.com/.\n\nAvondale's Halocene win YouTube's 'Best.Cover.Ever'\n\nThe members of Halocene have been “rockifying” pop songs, as they call it, for at least four years now, uploading the finished products on their YouTube channel at an average of one clip a week to satisfy the more than 57,000 fans who subscribe to the channel.\n\nThat made the Avondale rockers a natural fit for \"Best.Cover.Ever,\" a YouTube music competition that premiered in late November and featured Halocene as finalists, thanks to their spirited cover of Flo Rida's \"My House.\"\n\nAnd now, they've won their round, performing a track called \"Dancer\" with the multi-platinum rapper.\n\nAfter performing the song on YouTube, Halocene's singer Addie Nicole Amick said, \"I think we've waited our entire lives just to be in this moment right here.\"\n\nAnd things got even better when Ludacris shared a surprise, bringing Amick to tears.\n\n\"Flo Rida was so impressed with your cover,\" he said. \"We know that you guys live together. Flo Rida wants to give you guys $10,000 towards your own home studio.\"\n\nAmick says she and her bandmates chose to do \"My House\" because \"it’s a super-fun song and it was really easy to turn into a rock song.\"\n\nThey entered their take on the song in the contest and didn't think anything of it, Amick says. Until they heard from YouTube.\n\n\"I mean, we make covers every week so why would this be anything special?,\" she says, with a laugh. \" The next thing you know, we’re being flown out to L.A. and performing in front of Flo Rida and Ludacris, who’s the host for the show. The whole crazy ride has just been absolutely insane.\"\n\nThe series is executive produced by Ryan Seacrest, with Demi Lovato, Katy Perry, Keith Urban, Jason Derulo, Charlie Puth, Backstreet Boys, Flo Rida, Nicky Jam, DNCE and Bebe Rexha as musical guests who challenge competing musicians to perform a cover of one of their original songs.\n\nThe musicians can perform the song in their own style as they battle for the opportunity to perform a duet with the visiting artist. Viewers will witness every part of the planning and behind-the-scenes process as the collaboration comes together before premiering on YouTube.\n\nIt's been a long road to \"My House\" for Halocene, who started doing YouTube covers in their own house as a way to reach a bigger audience.\n\nAs guitarist Brad Amick (Addie's husband) says, \"Our band has been together for about 10 years total. We used to do the whole touring thing and that grind and about five years ago we started finding success online. As the climate started to change, people started consuming music and entertainment differently. So we uploaded a couple of videos and they did really well and the next thing you know the gap between the videos we were uploading was getting smaller and smaller. Now we do it every single week. We try to do it every Friday. Sometimes it’s hard to stick to that schedule. Sometimes we do even more.\"\n\nThey've been distracted lately, though, by the prospect of putting the finishing touches on their latest album of original material, \"Refraction,\" which arrives on Jan. 1.\n\n\"That kind of slows things down,\" Addie says. \" But we’re trying to keep up on it as much as we can.\"\n\nAsked if doing a cover a week has had an impact on their own sound, Addie says, \"We’ve done the most growing that we’ve ever done between the last album and now. We’ve experimented with new genres. We’ve learned things from playing songs that we might not have normally played. And we took all that and wanted to move forward in a new direction. Our new album is called Refraction, which means when light passes through an object and appears different on the other side. So we are basically the light or sound waves passing through something and ending up different on the other side. This new album was the most challenging thing we’ve ever done and the covers have really helped us grow and expand our horizons a lot.\"\n\nBrad says, \"This has a more modern sound, the way that pop music is kind of evolving. But at the same time, this is the first time we’ve had trumpets on an album. We invited Danny from the band Captain Squeegee to play on it. So it’s really all over the place. It’s kind of a fusion of funk and pop. And there’s rock, of course, because we’re a rock band. But we even have a little bit of EDM influences on some of the tracks. It’s kind of our identity crisis.\"\n\nAddie says after their last album, it was decided was decided that they had \"kind of mastered the rock sound\" and wanted to move on and do something different.\n\nIt helps that the recording studio is in their home, where they also do jingles for commercials and custom songs for people. \"That’s kind of our quote-unquote day job if you want to call it that,\" Addie says.\n\n\"It was really awesome getting to meet him, especially in the way we did,\" says drummer Joe Polizzi. \"On the show, you’re supposed to be performing for the artist’s producers and the artist ends up coming in in a unique way and surprising the two people that are gonna be performing for them. So we didn’t even know that he was in the building. But he was a really cool guy. And it was definitely a great experience meeting him.\n\nThey also met Ludacris, who hosts the series. \"They both have just a rock star presence that you really can’t describe, says Addie. \"We had no idea that they were going to be there. We thought we were just going out there to perform for the producers and they surprised us and said we were the final two and we would be performing directly in front of them.\"\n\nThe singer laughs then says, \"So that was a challenge.\"\n\nKWSS-FM Fall Fundraiser brings night of guilty pleasures to Last Exit Live\n\nKWSS-FM, an independent station widely known for its support of local music, teams with 80/20 Records to combine their annual fall fundraiser with 80/20's Guilty Pleasures show this weekend at Last Exit Live.\n\nAnd it's a killer lineup: Captain Squeegee, the Glides, Ben Anderson Music, Vintage Wednesday, People Who Could Fly, Bear Ghost, Daisy, Panic Baby, Good Boy Daisy, Nothing on the Moon and DJ sets by MRCH.\n\nAs to what constitutes a guilty pleasure, they're promising songs by Madonna, NSYNC, Foo Fighters, Smash Mouth, TLC, Celine Dion, Limp Bikit, Carrie Underwood and more.\n\nYou could even show up just to argue against the concept of Madonna or the Stray Cats as a guilty pleasure.\n\nAs Dani Cutler, host of Dani's Diner, which airs from 10 a.m.- 2 p.m., at 93.9 FM, says, \"One person's guilty pleasure is another person's all-time greatest artist ever.\"\n\nCutler was talking to Michael Zimmerlich of 80/20 Records about his Guilty Pleasures show when it occurred to her that it would make more sense for everyone involved to just join forces.\n\n\"I was like 'Why don't we just combine them and make it one show, that way we're helping each other and we won't be fighting for the same people to come to both of our shows. Just have everybody come to one.\"\n\nFor the past few years, the fall fundraiser has been the station's main fundraising drive.\n\n\"Beef Vegan started it with his Tequila Sunrise shows and when he left to go to Tucson, I kind of took it over,\" Cutler says. \"But we also didn't have a morning show and I didn't want to get up at 6 in the morning to do a big fundraiser.\"\n\nCutler laughs, then says, \"So I kind of made it my own. Or our own, I should say. It's not my fundraiser.\"\n\nAdmission to the show is free if you purchase a $20 KWSS T-shirt by Nov. 8. All proceeds go towards the station, which is non-profit and 100 percent independently owned and operated.\n\nLike NPR and PBS, KWSS relies on listener support for operational costs, including music licensing, promotional materials, broadband connectivity, studio and transmitter facilities, insurance, power, web hosting and phones.\n\n\"We're non-profit and independently own here in Phoenix,\" Cutler says. \"And we don't make our money the way other radio stations do. It's along the lines of NPR and PBS. We have to do pledge drives and fundraising so that listeners will donate to the station.

The entertainment and travel website went ahead and chose one band from each state.\n\nIts pick for Arizona? The underground legends who found themselves suddenly thrust into the zeitgeist of the post-Nirvana '90s after being hand-selected by the late great Kurt Cobain to join Nirvana on the set of \"MTV Unplugged,\" where they performed their own songs. That's good work if you can get it.\n\nNow, a few months after taking their well-deserved place in the The Arizona Music & Entertainment Hall of Fame, they've been selected as the best band in the history of Arizona music.\n\nAs the Thrillist editors explain it, \"While 'Hey Jealousy' by the Gin Blossoms might be the most immediately recognizable song by a band with Arizona origins — unless you grew up yelping along to Jimmy Eat World's pop-punk anthem \"The Middle\" — the Meat Puppets are the quintessential Arizona band.\n\n\"They might not have the hits of an act like Alice Cooper or the chops of a group like Calexico, but their combination of punk ideals, eclectic taste and untamed spirit speaks to the mysterious character of the Southwest.\n\n\"While blending country, hardcore and psychedelic rock, the Meat Puppets have endured longer than many of their SST Records peers of the 1980s, crafting a quirky legacy — and a lengthy discography — that's difficult to pin down but impossible to deny.\"\n\nSo what exactly constitutes an Arizona band? Thrillist laid out criteria as follows:\n\n\"The band must have been formed in or primarily based in the state in question. Lots of groups move to Los Angeles or Nashville or New York City after scoring a record deal, but they're not from those cities.\n\n\"Only groups, not individual artists, are considered. This admittedly skews the list away from hip-hop and country, but it also skews toward not driving us totally insane trying to wade through every musician from every state.\n\n\"We limited ourselves to bands who rose to prominence after World War II.\n\n\"These are not simply our favorite bands from every state; we considered a secret recipe of historical significance, influence, popularity and the nebulous 'quality' factor.\"\n\nGiven all that? I'd have gone with Alice Cooper, but the Kirkwood brothers are a solid and perhaps a more intriguing choice\n\nPhoenix's Christopher Shayne Band give impromptu a cappella concert at Southwest Airlines gate\n\nChristopher Shayne and his bandmates treated Southwest Airlines passengers to an impromptu a cappella concert at the Louis Armstrong Airport in New Orleans as they waited at the gate.\n\nThe local rockers had just wrapped a weekend in New Orleans, playing the St. Charles Rockin River Fest with Molly Hatchet, Shooter Jennings and Blackfoot, and an acoustic set on The Musicians, Mentors and Bar Room Heroes show on Whivfm.\n\nThe Southwest attendant was calling for people to come up and sing and when no one stepped up, she called out Shayne, who harmonized with lead guitarist Dave Lansing and keyboard player Zach Hughes on an Allman Brothers classic and a Shayne original, \"When I Come Down\" from the \"Turning Stones\" album.\n\n\"It was a weirdly intimidating task,\" says Shayne. \"She came over the speaker and stated 'I'm not sure you're familiar with what gate you are at, but at this gate we like to have fun. Anyone who comes up has to sing and we're all going to tell them to do it!'\"\n\nThen she noticed Shayne.\n\n\"When we travel,\" he says, \"we like to keep our instruments close, and gate-check them. She had one look at our long hair and beards and asked us to approach the podium – 'You look like musicians!' – and then proceeded to ask they crowd what they wanted us to do. So after some quick boot-strap pulling, we just went into the songs we sing in our set.\"\n\nLocal filmmaker Matty Steinkamp's 'Play the Documentary' headed to Amazon\n\n\"Play the Documentary,\" an independent film by Phoenix-based director Matty Steinkamp, will be available at Amazon beginning Sunday, Oct. 15, for download, rental and/or streaming on Amazon Prime worldwide.\n\nSteinkamp's goal for the film is to raise awareness regarding the struggle to keep music in schools when faced with dwindling education budgets for the arts. Proceeds from every download, rental and stream will help benefit music non-profits all over the country, working hard to give children the chance to play music.\n\n\"Play\" explores alternative solutions to getting instruments in the hands of students and relevant music curriculum in the hands of teachers. The doc was an official selection at Phoenix International Film Festival, the Boost Film Festival in Palm Springs and Cobargo Docos in Australia. It also had four sold-out world premiere screenings in the U.S., in addition to special engagements at the Herberger Theatre, Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, and Alice Cooper’s Rock Teen Center.\n\nSteinkamp says, \"Music is at the root of everything in my life.

In addition to performing three songs from their latest album, “Medicine,” they spoke to the students about their experience working as professional musicians.\n\nDrummer Danny “Chico” Diaz told the students, “If you believe in something, never give up. Be prepared for hard work. And if you put your mind to something, you can achieve anything.”\n\nSinger-guitarist Josh Kennedy says, “If we did it right, some kids will go home tonight and ask for a guitar, or want to take lessons.”\n\n“Also, I take the blame for that,” he jokes.\n\n\"It was a lot of fun,\" says Diaz. \"I couldn’t believe how responsive the kids were. When we got in there, they were so happy. We were blown away. It’s just something we like to do, give back to the community.\n\nPerformers from South Mountain High School’s performing arts magnet program, where Diaz’s father was principal, once showed up at Diaz’s grade school in Tolleson.\n\n\"I remember them coming to my school,\" he says. \"That was the first time I ever performed in front of people. It was something that stuck with me. If we can inspire one child to become a musician? Right on.\"\n\nThe Black Moods intend to perform and speak at other schools throughout the Valley about their experience working in the industry.\n\nHaving recently welcomed bassist Jordan Hoffman to the lineup, the Tempe rockers have been working the local circuit in addition to frequently touring in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\nTheir local shows regularly sell out, and they have opened for national acts including Heart, Doors’ guitarist Robby Krieger, Lil Jon, Adelita’s Way and Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers.\n\nLater this month, they headlining two Oktoberfest events, Rocktoberfest at Rockbar on Oct. 7, and Four Peaks Oktoberfest at Tempe Town Lake on Oct. 14.

Then he ran on stage and held up our new LP and said 'The Darts! they rock! Everyone go to the merch booth over there and buy this record!!'\"\n\nWith a laugh, she adds, \"We were stoked.\"\n\nCarey was there to MC the event, which was sponsored by Little Steven's Underground Garage, a Sirius XM station on which Carey does an occasional show.\n\n\"Lots of the Underground DJs were there,\" says Laurenne, naming Michael Des Barres and John Carlucci.\n\nAs for Carey, she says, \"We were taking Polaroids for our pre-orders up in the green room before the show and he jumped into one of them. Someone is going to get that Polaroid in their pre-order package this week!\"\n\nCarey introduced their set as well. \"He just said 'Please welcome a band that's gonna knock your socks off. Here are the darts!\"\n\nThe show was at the Echo with the Woggles, whose singer, the Mighty Manfred, is also a DJ on the Underground Garage and invited the Darts to perform.\n\n\"He called us while we were on tour in Seattle,\" Laurenne says, \"and we quickly shuffled our tour dates around to make it happen. Anything for Underground Garage. They are so good to us.\n\nCavalera Conspiracy share video from 'Psychosis'\n\nRevolver magazine has premiered a suitably insane lyric video for Cavalera Conspiracy’s “Insane” from their forthcoming album, “Psychosis,” due Nov. 17 on Napalm Records.\n\nThe conspiracy began when brothers Max and Iggor Cavalera formed Sepultura as teenagers in 1983 while living in Brazil.\n\nA decade after Max left Sepultura, moving to the Valley and releasing seven albums at the helm of Soulfly, the brothers reunited in 2006, forming the Cavalera Conspiracy.\n\n\"Insane\" is the opening track on \"Psychosis,\" the fourth Cavalera Conspiracy album, following 2014's \"Pandemonium.\"\n\nAnd Max Cavalera has a message for the fans: \"Let's open the mosh pit and go insane!!!!!!\"\n\nIn a recent interview with Revolver, the singer talked about the album, which they recently finished recording at Platinum Underground Studio in Mesa.\n\n\"It's got everything, man,\" he said. \"We have songs that sound like [the first Sepultura full-length, 1986's] 'Morbid Visions' and [1989's] 'Beneath the Remains.' There's the thrash element of [1991's] 'Arise.' And then there's new stuff on there that sounds like the stuff we enjoy right now, like Full of Hell, Nails and Godflesh.\"\n\nU.K.'s Dirty Water Records launches U.S. sister label in Phoenix\n\nDirty Water Records, the U.K. label that signed local rockers the Darts and Playboy Manbaby, has expanded its global operations with a new U.S. label based in Phoenix.\n\nIn addition to distributing releases from the U.K. catalog, the local imprint will release and promote its own product and retain independent creative and financial control.\n\nThe two labels are \"jointly committed to giving both rosters the best platform to release and perform their music overseas, and to give all our fans the least expensive option to harass their neighbours with their loud rock’n’roll records,” a press release said.\n\nThe London-based label was founded in 2004 by club DJ and promoter PJ Crittenden (who ran the now infamous Dirty Water Club). At first, it was limited runs of releases for friends’ bands, but it quickly developed into a full-on record label, riding the wave of the near legendary North London club night known for celebrity regulars and wild DJ stomp parties that continue to rage on after more than 20 years.\n\nThe club and label’s name is a tribute to The Standells' 1966 hit “Dirty Water,” a song whose chorus is, “I love that dirty water / Boston, you’re my home.”\n\nThe original, long-term home of the Dirty Water Club was a North London pub called the Boston Arms, but US ex-pat Paul Manchester (aka Boston Paul) engineered the label’s first big title: a reissue of Boston garage-rock group the Lyres’ 1979 classic, “Don’t Give It Up Now” backed with “How Do You Know.”\n\nSince then, the label has released a world-class selection of American acts, from Boston’s Muck and the Mires to L.A.’s Mr. Airplane Man, Detroit's The Hentchmen, Cleveland's Archie and the Bunkers, New York City’s Dirty Fences and a supergroup, of sorts, called Magic Christian (featuring the talents of Blondie’s Clem Burke and Cyril Jordan of the Flamin’ Groovies).\n\nSo why Phoenix, not Boston?\n\nLast summer, while on sabbatical in Phoenix, the label’s publicity and A&R man Matt Hunter met Nicole Laurenne, who in addition to fronting the Love Me Nots, Zero Zero and Motobunny, ran her own label, Atomic A Go Go Records. Laurenne had just started The Darts at that point and Hunter was intent on signing them after randomly finding them on Facebook before they’d even played their first show.\n\nThe two met up one evening at Valley Bar, where they started mapping out a strategy for world domination with an eyeliner pen and upside-down beer mats. And thus Atomic A Go Go Records was replaced by Dirty Water Records USA, with Laurenne assuming the role of proprietor.\n\n“I always envisioned the label having some kind of U.S.-based operation; I just never imagined it would be located in the middle of a desert,” says Hunter. “After that first meeting with Nicole, who was already a big fan of Dirty Water, I knew this just had to happen by any means necessary, and signing The Darts was the ultimate cherry on top of this whole beautifully amazing endeavor taking shape.”\n\nLaurenne says, “I'd been trying to get the attention of Dirty Water for years with the Love Me Nots but they never seemed to take notice. When Matt wrote to me out of the blue that he was interested in The Darts and my little DIY label, I almost fell off my chair.\n\n\"After five minutes together, we knew we had a lot in common in musical tastes, mutual friends, business ideas and more. We were both so psyched, we couldn't get this off the ground fast enough.”\n\nAfter several weeks of long-distance discussions and planning, Hunter flew back to London with two Phoenix bands on the roster, The Darts and Playboy Manbaby.\n\nA licensing deal has been struck between Dirty Water Records Ltd. and Laurenne to effectively spin off a separate label to her, with full creative and financial control that will in turn carry the Dirty Water Records brand name to help promote and distribute the London roster while creating a whole new label.\n\n“The tastemakers involved with DWR USA have kind of eclectic taste — but with a common theme of loving music that tears your face off in its awesomeness and power and leaves you on the floor. That's our goal,\" Laurenne says.\n\nCrittenden says, “This is the next logical move for us. From a very young age I was completely into American music — rock and roll, blues, soul, proper old rhythm and blues, ’60s garage, psych and so on, the kind of music that I see as the real deal. In that context, a U.S. branch of Dirty Water in my eyes is exactly what we should be doing. Giving some rock and roll back to the place where it started.”\n\nThe Phoenix label already has five new artists: Mean Motor Scooter, Escobar, Baronen & Satan, Bee Bee Sea and the Callas. It will also offer a full-service agency for booking, promotion, publishing and artist representation in addition to distributing music on vinyl, cassette, digital and CDs.\n\nLinkin Park plan Chester Bennington memorial concert at Hollywood Bowl\n\nThe surviving members of Linkin Park have announced a special show in honor of their bandmate and friend, Chester Bennington. The one-night-only celebration will be held at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles on Friday, Oct. 27.\n\nThis marks the first time the members have performed on stage together since Bennington’s death in July. They’ll be joined by a number of artists for a night of music honoring the Phoenix native.\n\nThe individual band members will contribute their fees from the event to Music For Relief's One More Light Fund in memory of Bennington.\n\nTickets go on sale Friday, Sept. 22 at https://linkinpark.com.\n\nThe official video for the album title track, \"One More Light\" premiered this week on Linkin Park’s social pages. Initially, the song had not been scheduled as a single, but the strong connection with fans in the weeks following Bennington's passing brought the track to the forefront.\n\n\"One More Light was written with the intention of sending love to those who lost someone. We now find ourselves on the receiving end,\" says Mike Shinoda. \"In memorial events, art, videos, and images, fans all over the world have gravitated towards this song as their declaration of love and support for the band and the memory of our dear friend, Chester. We are so very grateful and can't wait to see you again.\"\n\nThe video was directed by Linkin Park's Joe Hahn and longtime videographer Mark Fiore.\n\n\"It has been incredibly emotional to work on this, and especially to watch it,\" says Hahn. \"I feel that by doing it, we not only faced some of our biggest fears, but it enabled us to use our talents to bring some light to people who need it. As we move forward to the Hollywood Bowl show and beyond, I think about the people who connect with the band, outside and inside our circle. This video is a gesture of good will to the people who want that connection.\"\n\nThe Nash turns 5 with anniversary celebration starring Lewis Nash\n\nThe Nash will celebrate its fifth year as the undisputed hub of Phoenix jazz with a month-long celebration in October.\n\n\"It's hard to wrap my head around the fact that it's already been five years,\" says Phoenix native Lewis Nash, the celebrated drummer for whom the venue on Roosevelt Row was named.\n\n\"There's been a lot accomplished,\" Nash says, \"and a lot still left to do. A lot of great musicians have been through the place and given it their blessing, talked about how much they like the atmosphere and playing there.\"\n\nFounded with the hope of engaging young musicians to perform while offering educational opportunities, the Nash has welcomed some big names in jazz, been named a national \"jazz hub,\" served as home for hundreds of aspiring musicians and been a vibrant part of downtown's economic rebirth.\n\nDownbeat magazine has named the Nash one of the nation's top jazz venues for four consecutive years.\n\nAmong the goals going forward, Nash says, are \"continuing to deepen ties with the community and continuing to involve young people in the process of everything that goes on there, so that we're building future audiences, honing future artists and creating an appreciation for the art form here in Phoenix.\"\n\nHe feels the Nash has \"definitely, without question\" enjoyed significant success reaching out to that young demographic.\n\n\"And I know that because I have a chance to interact with a lot of the young musicians and ask them their impressions of what the place means to them and to the community and what they've gotten out of it. I've gotten a whole lot of positive feedback from young people, so that's encouraging for me. And when I say young people, I mean high school students as well as college students, recent grads and young professionals.\"\n\nTaking the gospel of jazz to a new generation is important, Nash says, because \"it's an original American art form. So when people begin to study the great artists of this music, going back to Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, people like that, all the way up to now, there's a parallel historical component to it.\n\n\"If you study the music of Louis Armstrong from the 1920s and '30s, you can also see simultaneously what was going on in American history during the time of these recordings and the heyday of these icons. These are human beings who were Americans, many of them African-Americans, living in a country which was denying them quite a bit during these years that we're talking about. And they persevered with this art form in spite of these hardships they were facing.\"\n\nThe Nash will host a jam-packed anniversary weekend Saturday and Sunday, Oct. 7-8, with tributes to Dizzy Gillespie and Ella Fitzgerald, featuring world-renowned artists Roberta Gambarini, Roy Hargrove, Sharel Cassity, Cyrus Chestnut and John Lee, as well as Lewis Nash.\n\n\"It's focused on honoring two icons who this year would be celebrating their 100th birthdays,\" Nash says. \"I had the pleasure and privilege of working with Dizzy Gillespie. I made a couple recordings with him, played live with him, and some of the musicians who are coming for the anniversary also played with Dizzy. The bassist, John Lee, was his musical director toward the end of his life. So we're just going to have a big celebration of the legacy of Dizzy Gillespie, which includes a lot of innovative things he did over the course of his career.\"\n\nFitzgerald, he says, is a \"one-of-a-kind\" artist.\n\n\"She and Dizzy were people who had a lot of fun when they performed,\" he says. \"And so the joy of the music, too, is something that we're celebrating.\"\n\nOther anniversary events include a Big Band Show with Darcy James Argue and for Nash members only, a special event with Canadian saxophonist Cory Weeds.\n\nTickets for The Nash fifth anniversary events are on sale. Patron badges include all anniversary weekend concerts; VIP Jazz Lovers Patron badges also include reserved seats and meet-and-greets with musicians at two celebratory shows at MIM Theater: Danilo Perez \"PanaMonk\" (in honor of Thelonious Monk's 100th birthday) and Regina Carter’s \"Simply Ella.\"\n\nHere's a look at the events.\n\n10/7: The Dizzy Gillespie All-Stars\n\nThe Dizzy Gillespie All-Stars, under the direction of Gillespie alumnus/executive director/producer/bassist John Lee, have delighted audiences around the world.

He was out walking around at 1 in the morning and got hit by a drunk driver. The driver wasn’t cited for manslaughter or anything. He was just cited for too much alcohol, I guess. But he wasn’t driving erratically. Neither one of them saw each other. Apparently, he was out wandering around on the street. It was kind of shocking that he got hit by a drunk driver and he couldn’t quit drinking himself.”\n\nPaul Bruce also was a talented musician and songwriter, although he never experienced the success Michael Bruce enjoyed as a member of the Cooper group, with whom he was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. And that didn’t always sit well with Paul.\n\n“He said to me one time that he couldn’t live in the shadow of his big brother,” Michael Bruce recalls. “And I said, ‘Paul, it’s all just a bunch of bulls—t.’” But he was such a sensitive kid. He wore his emotions on his sleeve. And he had a hard time. Even though he came to the gigs and hung out with us, he just couldn’t deal with it.”\n\nMichael Bruce’s group, which features his wife, Lynn Bruce, on bass, will be doing a lot of the hits he wrote while in the Cooper band. “I’ll be doing my best Alice,” he says with a laugh.\n\nThe four surviving members of the Alice Cooper group – which featured Dennis Dunaway on bass, Neal Smith on drums and the late Glen Buxton on guitar – recorded two new songs together on the latest Cooper album, “Paranormal.” And they’re doing a series of reunion gigs later this year in the U.K., where “School’s Out” topped the pop charts in the early ‘70s.\n\n“We did a couple shows in Nashville and we’re going to the U.K. on Nov. 8 to do five shows,” Bruce says. “The Tubes are opening and we do a mini-set in Alice’s set with his band. They drop a screen with Billion Dollar Babies and we appear on stage and do the hits like they were back in the day. People love it.”\n\nThe memorial concert will feature performances by Bruce’s group, Scott Rowe’s Alice Cooper tribute show, Harvest, Serious Play and Billy Cioffi and the Monte Carlos.\n\nDetails: 6-11 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 23.

I remember saying that I wanted to write an uplifting song that would remind people that love and unity will conquer all.\n\n\"There is so much hurt going on in the world right now, and it can feel hopeless at times. However, nothing stays the same forever, and that really is the message of this song. To have a voice and to stand for what is right, and that things will get better.”\n\nThe video was directly inspired by the lyrics from the song and its optimistic chorus of \"Victory is inevitable.\"\n\nAs Miss Krystle explains, “This music video is definitely a commentary and statement piece on the bigger issues going on right now. But the director and I wanted to focus on the individual struggle, to bring the narrative and responsibility back to each of us individually and remind people that positive change is always possible.\n\n\"We kicked around a few different treatment ideas, and landed on the stories: the drug addict, the dancer and the homeless person. One of the biggest challenges was trying to say a lot, but in the most minimalist way. I feel we accomplished that goal, and I love how the video turned out.”\n\nIn the opening scene, Miss Krystle is trapped in a jail cell, wearing a prison dress.\n\n“In all the treatment variations, one of the consistent elements was the jail cell,” she says. “In the final treatment (and video), the jail cell is the primary aesthetic (besides the three individuals). Whether the focus is personal, economic, political or social, we all feel trapped at times, so the jail cell is symbolic of our psychological and emotional imprisonment.\n\n\"This is why you see me stay in the jail cell, even though walls come down throughout the video, and I could certainly escape at any time. I remain trapped by my self-made prison, until I have eliminated all the things holding me back.”\n\nEach wall of the jail cell is made of a different material, representing the different characters.\n\n“As each person frees themselves from their torment, a side of my cell drops,” the singer explains. “Finally, you see me facing the brick wall, which is my own prison. You see me push that wall down, and only then do you see me walk out of the jail cell and free myself.”\n\nThe other characters were chosen, Miss Krystle explains, “because we felt each of these characters represented experiences we all know on a personal level, or at a minimum could sympathize with.\n\n\"The dancer lives for her craft, but she is injured and misses a big performance that was important for her career. The drug addict represents the dependency we all have in our lives, be it relationships, substances, alcohol or the like. The homeless person represents great loss and need.\n\n\"We see these three at ‘rock bottom,’ then again when each has made a decision to change, or change has begun, and finally when each person has triumphed through their personal tragedies for a higher purpose.”\n\nPhoenix entrepreneur sets out to 'fix the broken industry' with online streaming service\n\nPhoenix entrepreneur Damon Evans has built a music platform called Arena Music on the concept of fair pay for artists and free play for listeners.\n\nAccording to a press release, “the music streaming and merchandising platform is set to fix the broken industry\" while going up against the heavy hitters of the industry, such as Spotify and Pandora.\n\n“Through the platform we’ve created,” Evans says, “we are able to pay the highest rates in the world for music streams and merchandise sales. Artists simply cannot sustain a career in music from the low streaming royalties today's most popular subscription platforms pay per stream. If we don't act now, there will be no more music.\"\n\nArtists who work directly with Arena earn a penny per stream. As Spotify and Pandora, the world's most used services, artists earn just $0.003-$0.006 per play, and those platforms don't support other sales formats.\n\nBy paying the highest royalties for merchandise sales and music streams, Arena Music is hoping to position itself as a primary destination for artists and labels who want to maximize their earnings for both new releases and back catalog.\n\nFor musicians, Arena offers full sales support and real-time accounting, under a simple non-exclusive agreement.\n\nArena also says it offers artists more on products such as t-shirts, hoodies and caps than any other music or merchandising storefront currently online.\n\nIt's also the only streaming service to offer monthly royalty payouts through BitCoin.\n\nArena streams singles and albums from both independent and major-label artists without commercial interruptions or a monthly subscription fee. The user-friendly mobile app allows fans to purchase exclusive artist merchandise from anywhere in the world.\n\nArena also allows listeners to earn credits for using the service. The patent-pending Listen to Own (LTO) rewards program gives listeners the option of choosing between a $1 Arena credit or a free download anytime they've listened to any single song five times through the service.\n\n“Arena makes the artist and their fans happy,” says Evans. “It provides knowledge and direction for today’s creative and artistic communities through an ad free and subscription free merchandising storefront designed to build and sustain viable careers in music.”\n\nArena Music will soon launch a crowdfunding campaign through Wefunder.com to market an investment opportunity to musicians, producers, record labels and both accredited and non-accredited investors.\n\nCurrently, Arena exists as the largest commercial music platform that is neither funded by, or in any other way, associated with the three major labels.\n\nFor more information on Arena and its music and merchandise services, visit www.arena.com.\n\nThere is No Us unveil a chilling portrait of celebrity obsession\n\nThere Is No Us are premiering a chilling new video for \"Angel's Face With Devil's Hands\" that opens on a scene of singer Jim Louvau cutting a photograph of the video's striking female lead, Miss Krystle, off the cover of a magazine to add it to shrine he's built beside his bed.\n\nIf that sounds creepy, that's the point.\n\nAs Louvau explains it, \"The initial concept of the video was birthed from the idea that people in the era that we live in are obsessed with the idea of celebrity.\"\n\nThe specific event that inspired the song was Leonardo DiCaprio finally winning an Oscar and seeing people, including close friends, celebrate as though they'd won an Oscar.\n\n\"I thought to myself, this person you are praising couldn't care less about any of you,\" Louvau says. \"I actually posted something on social media when it happened as an experiment to see what sort of reaction I would get and it inspired the song. For some reason we connect with these people we look up to and think that they care about us on a level outside of collecting a paycheck.\"\n\nThis was before Louvau and guitarist Andy Gerold, a former member of Marilyn Manson who portrays a darker side of our obsession with celebrities in the video, had decided form a band to play the music they'd been working on together.\n\nThere Is No Us reached out to Scott Conditt, who directed their first video, \"In Violence We Trust,\" and told him they wanted to do something much more artistic than that first collaboration.\n\n\"We had no interest in doing another typical performance piece that had a bunch of people playing heavy music jumping around like monkeys looking tough,\" Louvau says. \"We are not looking to follow an expectation of what a band that plays heavy music is supposed to be. At the end of the day this is an art project that happens to be aggressive.\"\n\nBringing in Miss Krystle was a flawless bit of casting and the local singer effortlessly rises to the challenge.\n\n\"Initially we were looking to cast a female actress to portray a celebrity or a pop artist,\" Louvau says. \"Andy suggested that we worked with Miss Krystle since she was actually someone who had her feet in the pop world and was a close friend of ours. She turned out to be the best choice we could have made.\"\n\nMORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest\n\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.Twitter.com/EdMasley.\n\nMore music\n\nPhoenix concert announcements, updates\n\nConcerts of the week for Phoenix", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/02"}]}

It’s a plane. It’s — it actually is a bird this time. But not just any bird.\n\nThe University of Delaware is the latest school to have its beloved mascot memorialized as a bobblehead by the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nA limited-edition YoUDee bobblehead will be released for National BobbleHead Day on Jan. 7, and diehard Delaware fans who bleed blue and gold can get their hands on one.\n\nThe officially licensed bobbleheads are available for preorder at the organization’s shop at store.bobbleheadhall.com and cost $35 each plus $8 for flat-rate shipping. Shipping is expected in March.\n\nEach YoUDee bobblehead will be individually numbered. Only 2,023 are available. So Blue Hen devotees better act fast to avoid being left with ruffled feathers.\n\n\"We’re excited to be releasing this Bobblehead of one of the best and most unique mascots in college — YoUDee,” said National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum co-founder and CEO Phil Sklar. “We think this will be a very popular bobblehead for Delaware alumni, fans, students, faculty, and staff.”\n\nNow with its own miniature rendering, YoUDee stands among other university bobblehead mascots like Cocky of the University of South Carolina Gamecocks, Rameses of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Tar Heels, and Spike of the Gonzaga University Bulldogs.\n\nIt’s the second time in less than a year the Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum has had a Delaware-themed statuette. In February, Judy Johnson, the Baseball Hall of Famer raised in Wilmington, was included in the Negro Leagues Field of Legends Bobbleheads.\n\nThere have been Blue Hen bobbleheads available for more than 20 years. But this is the first produced by the hall of fame and museum. Sklar said they sought to create a new version that better captured and recognized YoUDee, which it had on a list of iconic and inimitable collegiate characters.\n\nHaving won first place eight times in the UCA National Mascot Championship, there’s much more to Delaware’s beloved bird than its award-winning charm.\n\nFor those who don’t know, the Blue Hen moniker has ties to the American Revolution. A company of the Delaware Regiment led by Capt. Jonathan Caldwell of Felton in Kent County was a fan of cockfighting and brought blue hens along for his time in the Revolutionary War.\n\nSome stories say Caldwell’s men charged at the enemy yelling, “We’re sons of the Blue Hen and we’re game to the end,” while others say he brought Blue Hens onto the battlefield. In the end, the regiment shared attributes similar to the blue hens — which are known for their ferocity and success in fights — and became known as the Blue Hens’ Chickens.\n\nThe Fightin’ Blue Hens of UD have been around since 1911 when the school published its yearbook titled “The Blue Hen.\" While students often donned various versions of a Blue Hen costume to support UD teams, it wasn’t until the early 1990s that the YoUDee seen marching around Newark today came onto the scene.\n\nThe only other college with Hens in the nickname is Southern California’s Division III Pomona-Pitzer Sagehens. Triple-A minor league baseball has the Toledo Mud Hens.\n\nIn an effort to rebrand the school’s “infamous mascot” as a highly regarded fan favorite, YoUDee was first “hatched” at the Delaware-Lehigh football game in Delaware Stadium on Sept. 4, 1993, after being created by Tom Sapp of Real Characters Inc. in Atlanta.\n\nYoUDee’s younger sibling, Baby Blue, who “hatched” on Nov. 23, 1999, at the Bob Carpenter Center, was also created by Sapp.\n\nSince then, the pair has been rockin’ the Air YoUDee’s, the official shoe of the mascots, all over the school’s red-bricked campus.\n\nDuring school-sanctioned events, YoUDee and Baby Blue are sure to be somewhere in the crowd taking pictures, hanging out with students and having lots of clucking fun shaking their tail feathers.\n\nThe pair is famously known for busting out the moves on the sidelines during sporting events, getting into shenanigans with fans and keeping Blue Hen morale soaring high in the student section.\n\nAside from the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum’s YoUDee release, they have a few other Delaware-themed knick-knacks available.\n\nJoe Flacco, current NFL quarterback for the New York Jets and former Blue Hen quarterback, can be seen in bobblehead form, along with Too Fly of the Delaware State University Hornets and bobble versions of the pets of the First Family, including first cat Willow and the first dogs Commander, Champ and Major. Ten percent of all sales of Champ and Major bobbleheads are donated to the Delaware Humane Association (now merged with Delaware SPCA and known as Humane Animal Partners), where Major was adopted in 2018.\n\nNewark's new look:With rising rent, rising buildings and more students how will Newark change?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/04/03/ballet-for-seniors-dr-fauci-boblehead-patrots-plane-ferries-95-masks-news-from-around-our-50-states/2938509001/", "title": "Ballet for seniors, Dr. Fauci bobblehead, Patriots' plane ferries N95 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey is not ready to issue a shelter-in-place order as other governors have, a spokeswoman said Wednesday, arguing the state has taken aggressive action to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Republican governors in Florida, Mississippi and Georgia on Wednesday reversed course and issued stay-home directives after previously resisting such a statewide order. But Ivey’s office said Wednesday that the governor is not ready to follow suit. A spokeswoman for Ivey said the governor has not ruled anything out, but hopes the state will not have to issue a statewide shelter-in-place order. Alabama last week announced the closure of nonessential businesses, such as salons, gyms and many retail stores and a prohibition of gatherings of 10 people or more that are not work-related where people can’t stay at least 6 feet apart. The previous limit had been 25. The state had earlier announced the closure of public and private beaches, on-site restaurant dining and that students would finish the school year by doing distance learning at home. Alabama’s “safer at home” policy urges people to stay home but does not order them to do so.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state accused an Anchorage man of buying respirators and selling them at “unconscionable prices” online to profit off coronavirus concerns. The complaint against Juan Lyle Aune alleged violations of a law barring unfair trade and commerce practices. It seeks financial penalties. Court records did not list an attorney for Aune, and a phone listing tried by the Associated Press didn’t work. The complaint alleged Aune generally bought 20-packs of respirators for between $17 and $23 from local stores. Between Feb. 10 and March 16, he sold respirators on Amazon at an average price of $89.25, the complaint states and alleged he made other sales on eBay. Reselling the respirators for “unconscionable prices during a time of increased necessity and high demand … offends public policy,” violates fairness concepts and and is unethical, the complaint stated. Assistant Attorney General John Haley, by email, said price-gouging involves taking advantage of an emergency. He said factors developed by the Alaska Supreme Court to help determine when an action is unfair under the law include whether it violates generally accepted fairness standards; is immoral, unethical, unscrupulous or oppressive; and whether it hurts people or businesses.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Some shooting ranges in metro Phoenix are closing to the public or restricting hours in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Arizona Game and Fish Department announced that Ben Avery Shooting Facility in north Phoenix, off Interstate 17 and the Carefree Highway, is closed to the public until further notice. The rifle and pistol ranges at Ben Avery are still open to law enforcement officers and user groups, which have mandated insurance and use ranges for firearms training and education. The Ben Avery archery range remains open to the public from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday. Only cash payments left in the drop box are accepted. Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday issued a statewide stay-at-home order, which will run through April. Although Ducey encouraged Arizonans to stay home to curb the spread of COVID-19, he said it’s important for residents to be able to go outside for recreation, as long as they practice social distancing. Privately operated ranges are still open across the Valley, but many are cutting hours and services. The Usery Mountain Shooting Range, on Ellsworth Road near the Usery Mountain Regional Park in the far East Valley, is limiting services to curb the spread of the virus. The range, which is operated by the Rio Salado Sportsman’s Club on land owned by the Arizona Game and Fish Department, is postponing all competitions, user groups and organized activities through the end of May, the range announced. The main public range, member range and sporting clays course are still open to the public. Indoor ranges, which often rent and sell firearms, are open with limited hours.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Buffalo National River was temporarily closed Thursday because of coronavirus concerns. The National Park Service said the closure takes effect immediately and includes the river, trails, campgrounds and open spaces. “It breaks my heart to have to close this incredible public park,” Buffalo National River superintendent Mark Foust said in a release. “It is, however, the right thing to do to protect the people that work here, live here, visit here, and love this place.” Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday asked the federal government to close the park and imposed temporary restrictions on state parks, including prohibiting overnight use at them. Hutchinson, legislators and local officials have complained about large numbers of people crowding the Buffalo National River area.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A British man accused of smuggling a phony coronavirus cure into the United States was charged with a federal crime, prosecutors said. Frank Richard Ludlow, 59, of West Sussex was charged in Los Angeles federal court with introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce and could face up to three years in federal prison if convicted, according to the U.S. attorney’s office. He was arrested last week on drug charges in the United Kingdom and remains in custody there, authorities said. It wasn’t immediately clear whether he had an attorney. Prosecutors alleged that Ludlow, who isn’t a doctor, had been selling people in California and Utah via mail a concoction called “Trinity Remedy” that he touted as a “miracle cure” for various ailments, according to a court affidavit. “This cure’ – later rebranded as ‘Trinity Mind, Body & Soul’ – allegedly contained vitamin C, an enzyme mix, potassium thiocyanate, and hydrogen peroxide. Consumers were instructed to add 18 ounces of water, say a prayer, drink half of the solution, take a probiotic along with bee pollen, and then ingest the remainder of the solution,” the U.S. attorney’s office statement said. Authorities said Ludlow sold between 300 and 400 of the treatment kits, but in February or March, as the coronavirus pandemic worsened, he began selling the kits under a new name: “Trinity COVID-19 SARS Antipathogenic Treatment.” The treatments haven’t been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for any medical use. “Every major health authority has warned that there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and no vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection,” according to the U.S. attorney’s office. “Hucksters who hawk ‘treatments’ for this deadly disease put consumers’ lives at risk by peddling unapproved drugs.”\n\nColorado\n\nColorado: In the past two weeks, Northern Colorado shelters and rescue groups have seen dramatic spikes in adoption and foster applications. As adoptions soar during the coronavirus epidemic, fewer pets are being surrendered to the Larimer Humane Society, said Tylor Starr, marketing and community outreach program manager. Although they have shut down adoptions through April 17 because of the stay-at-home order, the humane society is still providing lost-and-found, urgent owner surrender and end-of-life services to alleviate animal suffering, he said. Between March 18 and March 25, the humane society adopted out 83 animals, a 28% increase, and witnessed a 41% decrease in surrenders compared with the same time last year. The humane society still has 51 animals in foster homes and 53 more foster homes on standby. Starr said he doesn’t anticipate the need for more foster families at the moment. Bounce Animal Rescue in Fort Collins has seen a threefold increase in adoption applications and a flood of families stepping up to foster dogs, said executive director Anneliese Clark. Before the pandemic, Bounce typically received five to 10 adoption applications per dog. Now, it’s seeing 30 applications per animal and getting about 50 foster home applications a day. Weekly adoption events are on hold during the pandemic, but Bounce is still doing virtual appointments with potential adopters, “low-contact” handoffs for adoptions and a one-week trial for all adoptions to make sure the match is a good fit.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Two members of the Connecticut National Guard are among the latest state residents to test positive for COVID-19. An airman assigned to the 103rd Airlift Wing in East Granby tested positive March 27, and a soldier assigned to Joint Force Headquarters who works in Middletown tested positive the next day, National Guard officials said. The airman, between 20 and 30 years old, is hospitalized and the soldier, a woman between 40 and 50 years old, is recovering at home, officials said. On Wednesday, the National Guard also was transforming Southern Connecticut State University’s Moore Fieldhouse and Western Connecticut State University’s O’Neill Center into mobile hospitals to help with the anticipated surge of COVID-19 patients. There will be 250 beds at Southern and 200 at Western.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Trout fishing season started Tuesday, instead of the traditional first Saturday in April, “to help minimize crowds and accommodate responsible outdoor recreation during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) period,” the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control said in a release. Anglers can read regulations and find information about licenses on DNREC’s website. Coronavirus or not, the fish were biting. And anglers were eager to get out from isolation, return to a bit of normalcy and get one of those fish. Or, better: the daily limit of six. The DNREC encouraged safe social distancing, reminding anglers that a fishing pole can be about the length of the recommended minimum distance of 6 feet, and to choose less-crowded areas to fish. That can be the hard part, with the trout not practicing social distancing but clumping together in favored spots where they could be seen tantalizingly close in the shallow water. Fishing was a welcome change for Trampas Henderson of Stanton. “It is good to get out; recently I’ve been doing nothing but working and going home. The gym has been closed, restaurants and everything have been closed,” Henderson said. “It’s just nice to get out and do something different.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser said a COVID-19 testing site opens Friday at United Medical Center, WUSA-TV reported. The drive-through and walk-up facility is only open to D.C. residents with symptoms who are 65 and older, health care workers, first responders, and D.C. residents with underlying medical conditions. A hotline will be set up in the coming days so residents can call ahead and make an appointment.\n\nFlorida\n\nMelbourne: The Brevard Zoo is welcoming a baby giraffe, which was born on Sunday. The calf weighed 125 pounds and was 6-feet tall at birth. Zoo officials said in a statement that it was the sixth consecutive male calf born there. It was the ninth birth for the calf’s mother, Johari, 20. The father, Rafiki, 21, has sired all 14 giraffe born at the zoo, the statement said. The veterinary staff said the calf is in good health and nursing well, according to zoo officials. Masai giraffe are endangered because of habitat loss and poaching, the statement said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMarietta: A kitten stuck on a roof in the cold was saved by firefighters. The 6-week-old kitten was nursed back to health Wednesday after her rescue, Cobb County Fire and Emergency Services said in a post on Facebook. The female kitten quickly recovered after she was given milk, cat food, and was warmed in towels, a fire official told the Marietta Daily Journal. “A future fantasy life on the farm is in order for this adorable kitty,” the post added. The department decided to name the kitten “Shingles” after asking followers on social media to help name the feline, a fire official said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A school has distributed laptops to students who need the computers to take part in online education during the coronavirus outbreak. Hawaii News Now reported Wednesday that Pahoa High and Intermediate School distributed about 200 Google Chromebooks during three drive-thru collection events. The public school’s students signed release forms allowing them to borrow the laptops. The school’s online learning program began this week and staff said teachers and students are adapting to the changes. Staff members said it was important to get the laptops to students quickly so they would have the technological capability they need to learn from their homes. The state Department of Education announced public and charter schools will remain closed to students through April 6 in response to the virus pandemic. Pahoa High and Intermediate teachers developed curriculum using Google classroom and other other online platforms.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: U.S. officials are using the coronavirus pandemic to force a through long-delayed livestock grazing allotment decision in critical sage grouse habitat for a powerful agribusiness, an environmental group claimed. Wildlands Defense is asking the Bureau of Land Management to delay its March 20 decision approving Idaho-based J.R. Simplot Co.’s permit on about 94 square miles in southwestern Idaho for at least 10,500 cattle until the virus abates. The director for the Idaho bureau, John Ruhs, has refused. It’s not clear when the agency will issue a final decision, which would start a 30-day appeals process. Wildlands defense said the bureau’s appeal process requiring in-person trips to U.S. Postal Service offices to send or acknowledge receipt of certified mail by dozens of people puts communities at risk. The group said the bureau’s requirements also violate Gov. Brad Little’s March 25 stay-at-home order. The grazing allotment is in an area typically referred to as the Owyhees, which includes the Owyhee Mountains, canyons and rolling flats. Bureau spokesman Ken Frederick, in an email to the Associated Press, said the bureau’s “ability to modify grazing appeal procedures, which require certified mail receipts to confirm that interested parties received notice of a grazing decision and signed hard copies of appeals, is limited.” The agency hasn’t made public on its website the proposed decision. A copy obtained by the AP shows the agency is proposing to renew the grazing permit for 10 years. The average number of cattle on the range has been about 3,700 since Simplot acquired the permit in 1995. The proposed permit for 10,500 is roughly the same as 1995, but numbers typically fluctuate below that based on the condition of the range. Sage grouse are chicken-sized birds with an elaborate courtship ritual. Between 200,000 and 500,000 sage grouse remain in 11 Western states, down from a peak population of about 16 million. Experts generally attribute the decline to road construction, development and oil and gas leasing.\n\nIllinois\n\nCarbondale: Southern Illinois University has suspended the Delta Chi fraternity for violating the chancellor’s order banning in-person activities to slow the spread of COVID-19, officials said. The Southern Illinoisan reported Carbondale police over the past weekend responded to a house party hosted by Delta Chi, a violation of an administrative directive issued March 27 by interim Chancellor John Dunn and dean of students Jennifer Johns-Hall. The directive ordered compliance with Illinois Department of Public Health protocols requiring state residents to stay home except for essential trips for groceries or medicine. Gatherings of 10 or more people are also banned. “It was reported by the Carbondale Police Department that a fraternity in our community blatantly disregarded this message,” said Fraternity and Sorority Life assistant director Rachel Dunning said in an email announcing the suspension, adding it will stay in affect indefinitely. Jones-Hall said students found to have been involved in the incident will be referred to the student administration office.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:An April Fools’ Day prank making the rounds on social media suggested that Indiana students will have to repeat their current grade because of the coronavirus crisis. The joke, created by prank websites that can be used to generate social media posts that resemble real news stories, used Gov. Eric Holcomb’s image and claimed that he announced the move during a news conference. That did not happen. Holcomb addressed the prank and others like it Wednesday afternoon. Holcomb noted the date, then said he had received calls and texts asking about executive orders it was rumored he had signed Wednesday. “There were none today and get your information from the Department of Health’s website, that coronavirus website,” Holcomb said. “Don’t get it from someone who’s forwarding a forward that’s been forwarded. Get your information from the Department of Health.” Indiana isn’t the only state dealing with the spread of this fake news on social media. Posts mentioning schools in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and California are also being generated and shared. In Indiana, all schools will remain closed until at least May 1 and all state testing has been canceled. But students won’t be repeating the grade.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Lily Ungs, 17, of Urbandale performed a ballet for residents of the Summit House senior community in Des Moines on Wednesday night. Since the coronavirus epidemic began, Wednesdays are called “Balcony Night” in the community. Instead of gathering at each other’s apartments or various spots around the building, the residents have taken to standing on their balconies and chit-chatting across the gap. But Jon and Elaine Lindgren cajoled Ungs, their granddaughter, into performing a routine in the parking lot. Ungs studied at the prestigious Ballet West Academy in Salt Lake City, until her school year, like so many others, was shortened by the pandemic. Shortly before 6:30 p.m., Ungs warmed up, using the backs of parked cars to run through her routine stretches. She wore a white tutu and a silver tiara. The residents gathered on their balconies and folks from the other side of the building made their way over, doing their best to stay 6 feet away from their neighbors per coronavirus protocols. With scores of eyes upon her, Ungs twirled and tapped across the rough surface. Her performance included “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy” from “The Nutcracker.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state expects an influx of coronavirus tests in the coming weeks that should help with efforts to bring the pandemic under control, the state’s top health official said. Dr. Lee Norman, the state’s secretary of health and environment, said that he expects to have up to 64,000 test kits that can produce results in 45 minutes, the Lawrence Journal-World reported. “Very clearly we need to do population studies, meaning testing people who are well,” Norman said. “It’s very fundamental work and will push the analysis (of the virus) upstream. But until that time, social distancing is the name of the game.” Gov. Laura Kelly has issued a statewide stay-at-home-order as part of efforts to slow the virus’ spread, but getting everyone to follow it has proved challenging. The Shawnee Mission School District, which is among the state’s largest with more than 27,000 students, announced that it would begin issuing trespassing warnings Thursday for people who violate social distancing rules at its fields and stadiums. Those facilities remain open so people can exercise. But officials said the district and local police departments have received numerous complaints about large groups playing organized sports. People are supposed to stay at least 6 feet from each other and not gather in groups of more than 10.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort:The Kentucky National Guard already has been posted at local hospitals, but they soon will be at food banks amid the coronavirus pandemic.Gov. Greg Beshear announced Wednesday that the National Guard will deploy 70 members to four regional food bank warehouses located in Louisville, Elizabethtown, Wilder and Lexington.”Deployment is going to help feed seniors, families and displaced workers,” Beshear said during his daily news conference. “The National Guard members will assist Kentucky’s food banks by sorting and packing food into bags and boxes and distributing that through no-touch food distributors.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: Gov. John Bel Edwards reported a “jarring” uptick in coronavirus cases Thursday, though the state health department’s top COVID-19 expert said the spike is the result of a logjam of test results finally released to the state. The state reported 2,726 new cases Thursday for a total of 9,150 in 61 of the state’s 64 parishes. “This largely reflects people who already knew their test results, but the reporting to the state lagged,” Louisiana Department of Health Dr. Alex Billioux said on a conference call with reporters. “What we want to be clear is ... this isn’t a sudden 24-hour jump in cases that are a run on our health system; rather, it’s a bottleneck of reporting testing results,” Billioux said. Billioux said the backlog is largely from commercial testing, where he said 160,000 national tests results have lagged being reported to state. “There’s been pressure on those companies to get a better flow,” he said. He said the spike from delayed reports makes it harder to determine Louisiana’s infection trajectory. “These are cases newly reported, not necessarily new cases,” Billioux said. “The trajectory is still very concerning ... but the extra element of lagging results makes it harder to (calculate) the trajectory.” Thursday’s number of hospitalizations rose less than than 10% to 1,638.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Unemployment claims in Maine have reached a new high, surpassing a previous record attributed to the coronavirus outbreak. There were about 23,800 initial claims for unemployment compensation during the week that ended March 28, the Maine Department of Labor said. The previous record was about 21,500 claims a week earlier. There had been fewer than 700 claims a week before that in Maine, which had been riding a long streak of low unemployment. The Maine Department of Labor said in a statement that the virus “has caused significant economic hardship for Maine people and job losses across the state, particularly in the food services and lodging, health care and social assistance, retail trade and manufacturing industries.”\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: In the span of a week, Hardwire went from building armor to help protect soldiers from improvised explosives to trying to protecting health care workers from an enemy invisible to the naked eye. Developing a new type of face shield required long hours, sleepless nights and many cups of coffee, CEO Geroge Tunis said, but in the span of about 10 days Hardwire designed, tested, refined, retested and now manufacturers thousands of shields a day. The shields came at a crucial time for Atlantic General Hospital in Berlin, said Michael Franklin, the hospital’s president and CEO. “We were out of face shields,” Franklin said. “We were using goggles from Lowes and Home Depot. They had provided us with a lot of regular safety goggles and one of the paint stores in town also brought over all their safety goggles.” More than 100 face shields were assembled after the first day of production, Tunis said. Four days later, the company manufactured 12,000, with an additional 7,000 being built in one day alone. “This virus is spreading exponentially so every hour counts. So getting into production in meaningful levels is so important,” Tunis said. “You can’t make 10 of something and think you’re making a meaningful dent in it. The right number is 60,000-100,000 a day. You need to be at that level.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The New England Patriots’ private team plane returned to Boston from China on Thursday on a rainy afternoon carrying most of an order of 1million masks crucial to health care providers fighting to control the spread of the new coronavirus. Standing in front of the plane on the tarmac at Logan International Airport, Gov. Charlie Baker thanked Patriots owner Robert Kraft, officials in China who partnered with the state, and medical workers who need the masks. “This shipment comes at a critical time as we prepare for an anticipated surge in the coming weeks ahead,” Baker said. “What we were able to accomplish with this particular mission will go a long way forward in this fight.” Baker secured the N95 masks from Chinese manufacturers but had no way of getting them to the U.S. Baker said Thursday an earlier order for 3million masks had been confiscated at the Port of New York and this time he wanted a direct humanitarian delivery to the state. In an interview with Patriots.com radio Thursday, Kraft Sports and Entertainment chief operating officer Jim Nolan said the Chinese government didn’t sign off on the trip until March 27. He said the hurdles included legal logistics that were only cleared thanks to cooperation involving multiple state, U.S. and international entities. Nolan said the Patriots received permission to land in China and got a waiver of a 14-day quarantine because the pilots didn’t get off the plane. Baker said some masks will go to New York and Rhode island. The story was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday urged state lawmakers not to come to the Capitol on Tuesday, as planned, saying it is too dangerous to convene a session during the coronavirus pandemic. But she later clarified her remarks through a spokeswoman, saying lawmakers should convene briefly and in a safe manner to extend her emergency and disaster orders, and then return to their districts. “They should come in, extend (the orders) 70 days, and return to their communities like the rest of us are doing to keep the public safe,” spokeswoman Tiffany Brown said. However, Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, and other Republican lawmakers have said the requested 70-day extension is too long, and they plan to approve a shorter extension when they convene Tuesday. Earlier, at a news conference at the Capitol, Whitmer said: “The Legislature’s insistence on coming in next week is something I implored them not to do.” Whitmer’s original emergency declaration is set to expire Tuesday. However, she made a new disaster declaration on Wednesday, meaning she can continue to exercise emergency powers for another 28 days from Wednesday without the need for the Legislature to convene and vote on a resolution to extend the emergency or the disaster. She also has powers under the Emergency Powers of the Governor Act to continue to act unilaterally, even without an extension from lawmakers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz said he will deliver his postponed State of the State address on at 7 p.m. Sunday, and added he’s looking forward to speaking directly to Minnesotans during this uncertain time. The governor said Wednesday that he will deliver the speech alone with a remote camera from the Governor’s Residence, where he was in his 12th day of self-quarantining since a member of his security detail tested positive for COVID-19. “It is appropriate at this time with the character of Minnesota shining so brightly that we address where we’re at, and more importantly, where we’re going,” Walz said in his daily briefing for reporters. Minnesotans can view the address on YouTube Live and participating media outlets. Walz was going to deliver his State of the State address to a joint session of the Legislature on March 23, but had to cancel it amid the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A nonpartisan special election to fill a state House seat is being delayed by two months because of concerns about the new coronavirus. Gov. Tate Reeves announced Thursday that June 23 is the new date for the election in District 88 in parts of Jasper and Jones counties. If a runoff is needed, it will be July 14. The original date was April 21 with a May 12 runoff. Three candidates have qualified for the race, and the qualification period will not reopen. Republican Rep. Ramona Blackledge of Laurel resigned Jan. 31, less than a month after the start of the four-year term. The freshman lawmaker said she had to choose between serving in the House and collecting her state retirement pay. She said she could not afford to relinquish the pension that she earned during 40 years of working for county government. In Mississippi special elections, candidates run without party labels on the ballot but they often tell voters their party affiliation.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Smaller local governments are issuing stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the new coronavirus in Missouri, where the governor hasn’t issued a statewide order. Such orders took effect more than a week ago in the state’s largest cities, including Kansas City and St. Louis, but smaller counties with few or no COVID-19 cases are now telling residents to leave home only for essential reasons, such as to buy groceries or medicine. The order in St. Francois County, in southeastern Missouri, takes effect on Friday, The Kansas City Star reported. The county had 10 cases as of Wednesday morning. Gov. Mike Parson hasn’t ruled out issuing a statewide order, but he has said he was hesitant to impose state control over what he believes is a local issue.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Cascade County commissioners voted 2-1 to conduct an all-mail ballot election for the June 2 primary to reduce the chances of elderly election judges, county employees and voters from getting the new coronavirus. Clerk and Recorder Rina Fontana Moore recommended using only mail ballots out of concern that the coronavirus would be spread during the election at Montana ExpoPark. On March 25, Gov. Steve Bullock issued an order suspending a state law requiring that federal elections be conducted by poll and giving counties the options of all-mail ballot elections. The June 2 primary is a federal election. Commissioner Joe Briggs said he personally favored the mail ballot but voted against the resolution calling for the all-mail ballot election. He’s concerned that the governor doesn’t have the authority to suspend a state statute and that the Montana Association of Counties, which insures the county, won’t pay the county’s legal bills if the all-mail ballot election is challenged in court. Exhibition Hall still will be open on election day June 2 but voting will begin soon after May 8, when about 40,000 ballots will be mailed to residents.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state saw another record-setting surge in unemployment claims last week as the new coronavirus forced more businesses to close and lay off workers, according to new data released Thursday. The state received 24,572 unemployment claims during the week that ended March 29, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The previous record of 15,700 was set in the prior week as state officials imposed tough new restrictions on businesses and residents hunkered down at home to keep the virus from spreading. Nebraska has now had about 40,000 jobless claims in the last two weeks, which is about as many as it usually gets in a year.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: More than 20,000 people registered to vote in March, but the rate of people signing up to vote slowed at the end of the month, when state Department of Motor Vehicles offices closed because of the coronavirus epidemic, according to Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske. The DMV closures have an outsized impact on voter registration numbers because of a new state law that automatically registers someone to vote when registering for a license with the DMV or making other transactions with the agency, unless the person opts out. Cegavske’s office said Wednesday night that for the first half of March, the state DMV saw 2,100 transactions daily, but in the second half of the month as the virus spread, it dropped to about 470 transactions a day. Overall Nevada saw the number of active registered voters grow by 1.27% in March. Democrats represent 39% of all registered voters, Republicans make up 33% and unaffiliated voters are 23%.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Some county jail inmates who were convicted or accused of nonviolent crimes have been released to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, state corrections officials said. New Hampshire Public Radio reported the jail in Rockingham County, one of the largert jails in the state, has released about a dozen people. County Corrections Superintendent Stephen Church said the release of a defendant often depends on specific restrictions or requirements, such as daily check-ins, electronic monitoring or participation in programming. The majority of inmates who have been released by county jails have been close to the end of their sentences, or have been on work or weekend releases. Correctional facilities across the state are putting new inmates under quarantine for a minimum of 14 days.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSecaucus: Gov. Phil Murphy toured a 250-bed field hospital at the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus. The facility will open early next week, according to the governor. The hospital is scheduled to field noncoronavirus cases. It’s one of four field hospitals that are supposed to open in New Jersey. There will be two 250-bed facilities in Edison, with the fourth a 250-bed field hospital in Atlantic City.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nDoña Ana: Officials with the Doña Ana County Detention Center reported that there are no cases of COVID-19 at the facility, and that they have initiated a quarantine for new detainees. In a news release issued late Wednesday night, county officials stated that all new detainees will be held in a quarantined area of the center for 14 days to mitigate the potential spread of the novel coronavirus within the facility. New detainees will be housed together in order to limit their interaction with other detainees, officials said. This content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak. This new process will remain in place while the public health emergency is in effect. In addition, the county announced it will more thoroughly and frequently clean and disinfect the facility. Visitors of adult detainees are not allowed inside the detention center. However, they might schedule free calls and video visits from home, using a laptop or desktop computer at www.legacyinmate.com/Prepaid. Additional fee-based connections remain available, as well as texting, via www.gettingout.com. Visitation remains open for the Juvenile Detention Center, with restrictions. To schedule a visit, call (575) 647-7680. Also, juvenile detainees have access to two free 10-minute phone calls per week.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Veterinarians are answering the call to give up their ventilators to help fight the new coronavirus in humans. With city hospitals facing a ventilator shortage as coronavirus cases multiply, Mayor Bill De Blasio on Tuesday urged vets, plastic surgeons and others who might have the potentially life-saving equipment to lend it for the duration of the crisis. The New York Post reported the request is forcing some vets to prioritize human life over the animals for which they care. “There’s usually a distinct line between veterinary medicine and human medicine and there’s no crossover,” Brett Levitzke, the chief medical officer at Veterinary Emergency & Referral Group, told the newspaper. “That’s what makes the time we’re in so unprecedented.” A representative for Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners, which operates animal hospitals in Manhattan and Brooklyn, said the organization donated seven ventilators to New York-Presbyterian Hospital.But Levitzke’s practice has only one ventilator, and the decision to give it up is not one he makes lightly. Still, he said, “it’s just the right thing to do.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nTarboro: A man has been arrested after deputies, who were responding to a call about a shooting, found more than 70 people at a barn, a sheriff’s office said. The Edgecombe County Sheriff’s Office said deputies responded to Bynum Drive in Pinetops last Saturday in reference to shots fired into a residence, news sources reported on Thursday When deputies reached the scene, they saw vehicles leaving the area, and when they went to the back of the residence, they found more than 70 people, which is in violation of Gov. Roy Cooper’s order limiting gatherings. John Fitzgerald Taylor of Pinetops was charged last Saturday for violating the governor’s executive order. Authorities said Taylor was responsible for the gathering. As for the report of gunfire, deputies said the shooting happened on the street and that a stray bullet went into the back kitchen window of a nearby residence nearby. No one was injured and there have been no arrests in that incident.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: One of the state’s largest oil producers filed for bankruptcy Wednesday, citing the coronavirus pandemic on top of plunging oil prices. Gov. Doug Burgum said he expected more might follow and would “create real pressure on state budgets.” Although Whiting Oil was filing for Chapter 11 protection, state leaders were looking at an expected $1.2billion in aid from the federal bailout package – possibly enough with rainy-day money to avert the need to radically rework the state budget. “There are so many unknowns right now but we can absorb a tremendous budget shortfall without a special session,” state budget director Joe Morrissette said. General fund revenue, which is funded largely by state taxes on income, sales and energy, was ahead of projections for the current two-year budget cycle by more than $106million, Morrissette said. The state also has $65million from the prior budget cycle and a record $726million in the state’s Budget Stabilization Fund that can be tapped by the governor when tax collections fall short of expectations, though only after agencies endure across-the-board cuts.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohioans are confronted with an additional four weeks in isolation as Gov. Mike DeWine extended the state’s stay-at-home order Thursday to undercut the coming peak of coronavirus cases. The order issued by state health director Dr. Amy Acton will continue stay-at-home precautions until May 1. The initial stay-at-home order bought Ohio time to prepare for the onslaught of predicted cases, DeWine said. The two-week stay-at-home order issued March 23 – restricting many Ohioans to only vital travel for food and medical care and closing workplaces deemed non-essential – had been set to expire Monday night. The governor had signaled for days that the social-distancing order was near-certain to be prolonged with COVID-19 cases not projected to peak until later this month. DeWine said the new order would require retail stores, apparently including groceries, to post a limit of people to be admitted to stores at any one time to help reduce virus risk. The state is not setting a number. Although no limits remain on attendance at weddings and funerals, receptions are limited to no more than 10 people. Campgrounds are also being ordered closed under the new order, but those who live in a recreational vehicle at a campground can remain. State parks are not being closed, but social distancing must be practiced.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt called Thursday for a special session of the Legislature as part of his declaration of a health emergency in all 77 counties. Declaring a health emergency gives the governor broader powers to coordinate the state’s response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, including the ability to waive some statutory or regulatory requirements, said Stitt spokesman Charlie Hannema. State law requires the Legislature to convene within two business days to either concur with or terminate the health emergency, so the Legislature is expected to convene at 8 a.m. Monday. Under Stitt’s order, the state’s Commissioner of Health Gary Cox is authorized as the primary public health authority. On Wednesday, Stitt extended his “Safer At Home” order until April 30 and included all 77 counties, rather than just those with a confirmed case. The order requires nonessential businesses to shut down and the elderly and medically vulnerable to stay indoors. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A doctor at a veterans home in Oregon used a malaria drug to treat eight patients there for the new coronavirus, but said a state rule enacted last month would prevent him from treating any more veterans there. After pushback against the Oregon Board of Pharmacy’s March 25 rule, the board amended it on Wednesday to allow the drug to be used not only in hospitals for confirmed COVID-19 cases, but also long-term care facilities like the Oregon Veterans’ Home in Lebanon. Hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug, chloroquine, showed encouraging signs in small, early tests against the new coronavirus but has not proved safe or effective for this in any major scientific studies yet. It’s approved now for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. In the second week of March, the first cases of the coronavirus began emerging at the Oregon Veterans’ Home in Lebanon, when two men in their 80s fell ill with COVID-19. Then more got sick. After hearing that hydroxychloroquine could be effective, Dr. Rob Richardson began treating eight of the veterans with it and an antibiotic called azithromycin, also known as Z-Pak. On March 25, the Oregon Board of Pharmacy adopted a temporary emergency rule prohibiting the dispensing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine “for presumptive treatment or prevention of COVID-19 infection.” But late Wednesday, the pharmacy board changed its regulation, allowing “for a seriously ill patient in an institutional setting, such as Correctional Facilities and Long-Term Care Facilities, who would otherwise be hospitalized” to receive the drugs. Of the eight patients that Richardson treated with hydroxychloroquine and Z-Pak, seven recovered and one – a 91-year-old patient – died. Richardson has no conclusive evidence that the treatment led to their recovery but there were no negative side effects.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: As expected, demand far exceeded the capacity of Pennsylvania’s system of state-owned liquor stores to process online orders as sales resumed Wednesday. Brick-and-mortar liquor stores are closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, but nearly 278,000 people tried to place orders on the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board website during the first day of digital sales. By comparison, the site attracted 32,300 users when the liquor agency recently released several sought-after but limited-availability whiskeys. “As we expected, consumer interest and site traffic far exceeded our ability to accept orders,” a spokeswoman said Thursday. For now, the state is limiting website access to prevent the system from crashing, giving only a limited number of randomly selected consumers access to shop. All others get a screen indicating the online store is closed.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A coalition of labor unions and social justice organizations in Rhode Island is calling on state leaders to pass their own coronavirus relief package to help workers and the newly unemployed. The federal government’s relief package is not enough, the 14 groups said in a letter Wednesday to Gina Raimondo, House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, all Democrats. “Our state response must continue to fill the gaps left by the federal stimulus response packages to support the Rhode Islanders who are losing their jobs and the disproportionately low-wage workers who are heroically keeping us fed and cared for at great risk to themselves,” the group said, according to The Providence Journal. Some of the group’s proposals include double paid sick time from 40 hours per year to 80 hours and raising the minimum wage for some. The Gaspee Business Network also issued a list of recommendations for state leaders to consider during the pandemic, including giving businesses more time to remit sales tax; temporarily cutting the minimum wage; and suspending internet sales tax collections.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Public health officials are creating a statewide database of addresses of known positive COVID-19 cases, a secure tool only made available to first responders who have argued the information could help protect them. Although solely intended for the emergency response community, it’s also a step toward the release of more specific information about the location of infections that officials have come under fire for resisting. The online matrix, according to Nick Davidson, acting director of public health for the Department of Health and Environmental Control, comes in response to local officials’ complaints that first responders were being left potentially vulnerable to the disease and also needed that information to conserve protective gear, which is in short supply. Starting next week, Davidson told the Associated Press, the agency will be live with a “secure, web-based system” that first responders can access to see if a home to which they’re being called has a resident who’s tested positive for the new coronavirus. Responders will be able to query the system, which will have known positive cases listed by the address on a patient’s driver’s license.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nEagle Butte: The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe said it is setting up checkpoints on roads going into tribal land on Thursday to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The tribe won’t allow people in noncommercial vehicles with out-of-state licenses unless they can prove tribal membership and that they live on the reservation. The tribe also will restrict people who are not members from hunting on tribal lands. The tribe will be monitoring all other traffic on the main roads going into the reservation. So far, no one living on the reservation has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the latest update from South Dakota health officials.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the state will retrofit the Gateway Shopping Center for a 170-bed hospital to help add capacity to the Memphis metropolitan area’s medical system in the face of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Gov. Bill Lee said the Army Corps will construct a COVID-19 positive center at the shopping center along Jackson Avenue. He said the Corps is scouting other sites in Memphis, as well. Lee said the facility will be used for nonacute care patients. That would potentially save capacity at existing hospitals in Memphis. The portion of the shopping center that is vacant west of the existing Save-A-Lot grocery store would be retrofitted, according to city officials who learned of the announcement shortly before it was made public. According to a sign on the building, there is up to 105,000 square feet available to lease. Across the country, the Army Corps has been relied upon for its expertise to help combat the surge by retrofitting existing facilities. The Memphis and Shelby County joint task-force submitted more than a dozen sites to the Army Corps.\n\nTexas\n\nLaredo: Residents are being required to wear something that covers their nose and mouth when they’re out in public during the coronavirus pandemic – or face a fine of up to $1,000. Starting Thursday, all people in Laredo over the age of 5 will have to wear some kind of covering, such as a homemade mask, scarf, bandanna or handkerchief, when entering a building open to the public. Residents will also have to cover their mouth and nose when using public transportation, taxis, ride shares or when pumping gas. The new rule doesn’t apply to people riding in their own vehicles or if they are outside for exercise and following social distancing guidelines. Laredo’s city council issued the mandate on Tuesday. The South Texas city of more than 261,000 residents along the U.S.-Mexico border is about 155 miles southwest of San Antonio. Residents are being encouraged to use homemade masks and leave medical masks, including N95 masks, for health professionals, said Dr. Hector Gonzalez, director of Laredo’s health department. There are nearly 4,700 cases of coronavirus in Texas and at least 70 related deaths, according to state health officials. Others across the country have also been updating their guidance on whether or not to wear some sort of facial covering.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: As the number of coronavirus cases and deaths grew in Utah, the governor announced a freeze on evictions Wednesday and advocates demanded more inmates be released to prevent the spread in jails and prisons. With businesses closed across the state to prevent the spread of the virus that has caused a global pandemic, Gov. Gary Herbert ordered landlords to allow rent payments from affected workers to be deferred and evictions stopped until May 15. “This is designed to help people who, through no fault of their own, have lost jobs or lost income because of COVID-19,” he said. The ACLU of Utah is going to the Utah Supreme Court to demand more prison and jail inmates be released so the facilities can take steps to prevent the spread of coronavirus, like social distancing and frequent hand washing. Authorities have not yet confirmed any cases among inmates, but attorneys said it could spread quickly in jails and prisons. Corrections officials did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Similar petitions have been filed in other states.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Members of Chittenden County’s largest emergency response agencies have so far remained mostly healthy despite the spread of the new coronavirus in Vermont. But they are preparing for the anticipated surge in COVID-19 cases as they are being told by health officials that the worst is yet to come. Contingency planning should emergency responders need to self-quarantine or be hospitalized in large numbers has been key. It has also helped that many Vermonters are heeding Gov. Phil Scott’s calls to stay home, said Vermont State Police Capt. Garry Scott, the director of Fair and Impartial Policing and Community Affairs. Despite the danger of COVID-19, emergency responders are committed to continuing to respond in person to calls that involve citizens’ physical safety, they said. Burlington police has reported one case of COVID-19 in a member who was not interacting with the community in an official capacity at the time. That employee has been quarantined, said interim Chief Jennifer Morrison in an email. Burlington police and fire departments, South Burlington police, and Vermont State Police have said that other members have self-isolated for various reasons, but no other positive tests have been reported.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A long-term care facility with one of the nation’s worst known coronavirus outbreaks said Thursday that testing conducted on all residents had more than doubled the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 to nearly 100 as the number of fatalities increased to 16. The Canterbury Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center in suburban Richmond tested all its residents and staff earlier this week after the virus began sweeping through the facility in mid-March, a time when limited testing supplies and strict policies on who could be tested meant such a response was not possible. Ninety-two in-house or hospitalized residents tested positive, the statement said, up from a total earlier in the week of 41. Only 35 tested negative, and 15 tests were outstanding, meaning approximately two-thirds of the facility became infected with the virus. Of the residents who tested positive, 53, or about 58%, were “asymptomatic carriers showing no sign of being ill,” the statement said. The facility’s administrator, Jeremiah Davis, said in a statement that the findings were consistent with other mass testing studies. Among the 16 deaths were five over the last 24-hour period, the facility said in a statement. Canterbury has faced a staffing and supply shortage amid the crisis, though officials have said both have improved in recent days. As of Wednesday afternoon, 25 workers had tested positive, according to Davis. The staff-wide test results were not yet available.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Federal authorities have proposed a $611,000 fine for a Seattle-area nursing home connected to at least 40 coronavirus deaths. State regulators and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services conducted an inspection of the Life Care Center of Kirkland on March 16, finding serious infractions that they said placed residents in immediate danger. Authorities said Life Care had at least partially fixed the most serious problems by the time they conducted follow-up inspection in last weekend. In a letter to Life Care on Wednesday, CMS proposed a fine of $611,000, but said that could be adjusted up or down based on how Life Care continues to correct remaining problems. Life Care, which can appeal the fine, did not immediately return an email seeking comment. The federal regulators said the most serious problems concerned a failure to rapidly identify and manage sick residents during an outbreak of respiratory illness that began by mid-February; a failure to notify the Washington Department of Health about the increasing rate of respiratory infections among residents; and a failure to have a backup plan in the absence of Life Care’s primary clinician, who fell ill. CMS notified Life Care on March 18 that it had 23 days to remedy violations that placed residents at immediate jeopardy before it would be terminated as a Medicare provider. The agency on Wednesday extended that period, saying Life Care must fix all remaining issues by Sept.16.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s attorney general on Thursday said a ban on elective medical procedures during the coronavirus pandemic will reduce abortions but will be upheld in an eventual legal challenge. The executive order, which went into effect this week, mirrors directives in other Republican-controlled states that have been temporarily blocked by federal judges. West Virginia’s order, which doesn’t explicitly include abortion, said that it applies to all procedures that aren’t “immediately medically necessary to preserve the patient’s life or long-term health” to preserve medical supplies and protective equipment. “We believe that this broad-based prohibition will be upheld because it’s designed to protect the public health and applies to all elective procedures and all elective facilities,” Attorney General Patrick Morrisey told the Associated Press in an interview. Similar orders in Alabama, Texas and Ohio faced legal challenges soon after they were announced from pro-abortion groups who argued the directives violated existing rights to the procedure. Lawsuits were also filed in Iowa and Oklahoma, after governors in those states similarly ordered a stop to non-emergency procedures and specifically included abortion among them. Morrisey said the state’s order applies to abortion facilities despite a section that excludes “procedures that cannot be performed consistent with other law at a later date.” West Virginia bans abortions after 20 weeks.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:The United States’ top infectious disease specialist is getting his own bobblehead. The creation from the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum in Milwaukee features Dr. Anthony Fauci wearing a suit as he makes a motion showing how the nation needs to “flatten the curve” in the coronavirus pandemic. The museum picked Fauci because many people see the plain-speaking expert on the coronavirus as a hero right now, said co-founder and CEO Phil Sklar. “He isn’t trying to spin things,” he said. “He isn’t trying to make people happy and tell him what they want to hear. He’s actually telling them, you know, how he sees it as an expert. And I think that’s really what we need him this time.” Fauci’s face also appears on socks. And a Rochester, New York, shop is selling doughnuts with his face, surrounded by white frosting and topped off with red, white and blue sprinkles. Sklar said the bobblehead museum plans to donate $5 from every $25 Fauci bobblehead that’s sold to the American Hospital Association in support of that group’s effort to get masks and other personal protective equipment for health care workers. Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has served as an adviser to every president since Ronald Reagan. President Donald Trump has called him a star on his administration’s coronavirus task force.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Wyoming courts are extending measures to discourage spread of the coronavirus by another seven weeks. The series of measures announced by the Wyoming Supreme Court in March apply to all state courts in Wyoming. They include suspending many types of in-person proceedings, rescheduling trials, allowing for remote administration of oaths, conducting proceedings by video conference and making paper document filings optional. Set to expire April 10, the measures will now continue through May, Chief Justice Michael K. Davis said Wednesday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/03"}]}

Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds.\n\nThe disease typically causes a mild illness in people, but it can cause inflammation of the brain called encephalitis or meningitis.\n\nHow contagious is West Nile virus?\n\nWest Nile virus is most commonly transmitted when an infected mosquito bites a person or another animal. The virus is rarely transmitted among people.\n\nLeprosy in Florida:Leprosy cases in central Florida account for nearly 20% of national cases. What to know\n\nWhat are West Nile virus symptoms?\n\nThe majority of people who contract West Nile, around 80%, develop no symptoms, according to the CDC. West Nile symptoms in those who do include:\n\nHeadache\n\nBody aches\n\nJoint pain\n\nVomiting\n\nDiarrhea\n\nRash\n\nIn rare cases, a person may develop encephalitis, inflammation of the brain, or meningitis.

No one has died this year.\n\nWest Nile virus is transmitted by mosquitoes from infected birds to horses, humans and other animals. People infected by the virus usually show no symptoms at all or develop mild flu-like symptoms. In severe cases, complications can include encephalitis, meningitis and paralysis.\n\nAbout 50% to 80% of young and healthy people who are infected with the West Nile virus are asymptomatic, according to ADHS.\n\nPeople with weakened immune systems and people older than 50 are more at risk for developing a severe illness from the West Nile virus.\n\nMost people infected by the virus won't show symptoms, but the most commonly shown symptoms of West Nile virus are fever, nausea, headaches and muscle aches three to 14 days after being infected.\n\nThere is no cure, vaccine or treatment for the virus, so officials recommend taking these preventative measures:\n\nUse an EPA-registered insect repellent.\n\nWear long-sleeved shirts and long pants.\n\nFix broken screens in doors and windows.\n\nPrevent mosquito breeding by covering areas where water can collect.\n\nLast year, there were zero virus-related deaths in Arizona, and extreme cases of this virus are rare, but 19 people died in 2019, according to data from ADHS.

North Jersey temperatures are expected to hit lows around 60 degrees several nights this week.\n\nWest Nile virus does not cause symptoms in most people, although one in five infected may develop a fever, headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea or rash, according to the CDC. People over 60 years old are at greater risk for complications.\n\nLess than 1 percent of those infected with West Nile virus will develop severe symptoms, which include high fever, neck stiffness and swelling of the brain (encephalitis), which can lead to coma, convulsions and death, the state Health Department said.\n\nThe incubation period for West Nile virus is typically two to six days after a mosquito bite, but it can range from two to 14 days, the CDC said. For people with immune deficiencies, the incubation period can last several weeks.\n\nOver the past five years, the Health Department has identified West Nile virus as the cause of several deaths throughout the state, including:\n\nTwo deaths in Gloucester and Morris counties in 2013\n\nThree deaths in Cumberland, Monmouth and Passaic counties in 2015\n\nTwo deaths in Ocean and Union counties in 2016\n\nTwo deaths in Mercer and Middlesex counties in 2017\n\nUse insect repellents and wear long-sleeved shirts and pants while outdoors to guard against West Nile.

Sen. Charles Schumer has even asked for the federal government assist in killing mosquitoes in New York to prevent the virus from spreading in the state.\n\nWhile it can cause sickness and death like COVID-19, the West Nile virus can be a silent killer since it comes from mosquitos. Victims who don't know they are infected could face seriously complications. Noreen Hynes, director of the Geographic Medicine Center of the division of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University, told USA TODAY \"the real important thing is people have to protect themselves.\"\n\nAs cases of West Nile virus continue to rise throughout the country, experts are advising people to be cautious when being outdoors as autumn begins.\n\nWhat is West Nile Virus?\n\nWest Nile virus first appeared in a Ugandan woman in 1937, and since then has spread throughout the world, first appearing in the U.S. in 1999, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe most common way people get the virus is through mosquito bites, but contrary to popular belief, the virus originates from birds, according to the WHO. Mosquitoes only get the virus by feeding on infected birds. When they do so, the virus then ends up in mosquito's salivary glands, which then gets into humans when mosquitoes bite them.\n\n\"A mosquito really prefers to bite birds,\" Hynes said. \"But it's important for people to realize that the mosquitoes are happy to bite you, too.\"\n\nFact check: Yes, viruses can mutate to become more deadly\n\nNipah virus: What is it and why is it more deadly than COVID-19?\n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms? How fatal is it?\n\nWhile the virus can be fatal, it's not as common as people think.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 80% of infected people don't experience symptoms. For the 20% that experience symptoms, they can range from headaches, body aches, vomiting and diarrhea, with fatigue and weakness that can last for months.\n\nAbout 1 in 150 people infected develop severe illness affecting the central nervous system, which can result in disorientation, convulsions, paralysis and comas. The CDC estimated 10% of people who develop symptoms affecting their central nervous system die. There is no vaccine for West Nile, but it cannot spread by human contact unlike COVID-19.\n\nLike most viral infections, people over the age of 60 and immunocompromised are at higher risk of developing worsening symptoms.\n\nHow are cases in 2021 compared to year's past?\n\nWhile cases are on the rise, they are nowhere near the numbers in 2019, when 2,647 people were infected and 167 people died. The all-time worst year came in 2003, when 9,862 people were infected. The most deaths came in 2012, when 286 people, or 5% of infected people, died.\n\nSince 1999, the West Nile virus has infected 52,944 Americans and is responsible for 2,463 U.S. deaths.\n\nAs of Sept. 21, 479 cases have been reported and 21 people have died. While the numbers aren't as high as other years, Hynes said August and September are peak times for the virus to spread. Sen. Schumer said this year is, \"actually one of the worst mosquito seasons that we have had in recent memory,\" as the virus has been found in all five of New York City's boroughs.\n\nNew COVID variant:What we know about the mu variant and why Fauci is 'keeping a very close eye on it'\n\nHynes said it's possible people being outside more this year than last year due to the pandemic may have contributed to high virus numbers, but what really does matter is this year has been wetter than 2020. Since much of the East Coast dealt with rain from Hurricane Ida, wetter weather can mean more mosquitoes as they lay their eggs and spend their first few days of life in water.\n\n\"They'll do it in even small amounts of water. So, if you have standing water around your house, you probably want to make sure that you pour it out after the rain so that the mosquitoes can't lay their eggs,\" she said.\n\nHow can you stay safe?\n\nHynes said mosquitoes are typically active from dusk until dawn so it is important to keep that in mind when being outdoors. People can buy mosquito repellent, but something you may not know: mosquitoes can bite you through your clothing.\n\n\"You would have to consider pre-treating your clothing before you go outside with permethrin,\" Hynes said.\n\nDifferent brands and stores sell permethrin that can be put on the external side of clothing and camping gear. It can be extremely useful for people that like to camp or go on hikes.\n\n\"You can put that on your clothes and will stay embedded in the fibers for six weeks or six washings, whichever comes first,\" Hynes said.\n\nAnother clothing gear tip Hynes said is to wear lighter-colored clothes since mosquitos are attracted to darker clothes. Preventing a mosquito bite can help people avoid other diseases they can carry, such as malaria.\n\nFollow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/08/07/west-nile-virus-found-local-mosquitoes/545228001/", "title": "West Nile virus found in local mosquitoes", "text": "It's time to break out the bug spray.

This is much higher than normal as the average number of cases since 2016 has been 5 cases per season,\" the county said in an email newsletter on Sept. 23.\n\nThere are a number of factors that could contribute to the difference in county numbers.\n\n\"Counties might have residents who seek different amounts of healthcare, or providers who test and report cases more or less than in other counties. It is possible that in Pima County there might be more cases than what has been reported,\" Herrmann wrote in an email to The Arizona Republic.\n\nOlder adults more likely to get sick with West Nile virus\n\nOn the other hand, counties with more cases might have more West Nile virus-positive mosquitoes or older residents who are more at risk of acquiring the disease.\n\nPeople older than 60 and with certain medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension or kidney disease are at a higher risk of severe illness, Herrmann said.\n\nIt also seems males acquire the virus more often than females, but ADHS does not know why they have a higher rate of infection.\n\nAbout one in five people will show symptoms. The most common symptoms are flu-like, including fever, headache, body ache and muscle weakness.\n\nSevere illness affects the central nervous system. Symptoms include stiffness of the neck, inflammation of the brain and/or meningitis.\n\nHerrmann said cases could increase again this year.\n\n\"West Nile Virus season can last until the end of October in Arizona,\" he said.\n\nWest Nile virus death in Arizona:'Nobody should have to go through that': Man mourns Scottsdale dad's West Nile virus death\n\nReach breaking news reporter MacKenzie Brower at mackenzie.brower@arizonarepublic.com or on Instagram @_photomac_.\n\nSupport local journalism.

It returned to the Bob Carpenter Center in Newark just 14 months later for another show on April 18, 1994.\n\nSTORY: The most Delaware-y drink ever?\n\nSTORY: Have fun working off that Thanksgiving meal\n\nSTORY: Melissa Etheridge recalls emotional '13 Grand show\n\nSince that spring night, Phish fans waited 8,253 days for news of Anastasio returning to Delaware -- almost as long as one of the band's trademark extended jams.\n\nWell, the wait is over.\n\nThe Grand will announce Monday that Anastasio will headline a rare solo acoustic show at the Market Street theater this winter. The 7:30 p.m. show on Tuesday, Feb. 13, should draw fans from across the region, in addition to Delaware die-hards.\n\nTickets to see Anastasio at the historic 1,200-person Grand cost $65-$75. The on-sale begins Friday, Dec. 1, at 10 a.m. in person at the box office, via thegrandwilmington.org or by calling 302-652-5577. A pre-sale for donors to The Grand is set for Thursday, Nov. 30 at 10 a.m.\n\nIt's one of nine East Coast solo shows, kicking off in Morristown, New Jersey on Feb. 8 and wrapping up in Athens, Georgia on Feb. 18.\n\nIn the past, Anastasio has performed only a handful of solo shows each year, if any. This year, he performed five solo shows including a trio of East Coast March concerts in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and upstate New York.\n\nIn September, he performed a pair of shows with orchestras, something he has done multiple times since 2001. He teamed up with both the Nashville Symphony and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra in their respective cities.\n\n\"It feels like a really big show,\" says Stephen Bailey, managing director of programming at The Grand. \"My feeling is that everybody and their brother is going to be calling in every possible favor when tickets get tight.\"\n\nThe Grand's announcement that Anastasio was returning to Delaware is a dream come true for fans, especially those who were at the University of Delaware shows in the early '90s.\n\nMusician Kevin McCabe of Brandywine Hundred has seen Phish about 80 times and his first was Phish's 1994 return to The Bob. He remembers it all: getting a free ticket, going on a fluke and being blown away.\n\nThere was a circus atmosphere that night as giant inflatable balls bounced around the arena and the band bounced on trampolines while they played.\n\nMcCabe, now 43, was immediately hooked.\n\n\"When they came out, it was an instant punch to the face,\" McCabe says. \"It was crazy.\"\n\nIn the years since that night, McCabe has been keeping his lighter lit for the act, playing their songs in his Delaware bands over the years, including jam band Caravan, which was formed the same year as that Phish show.\n\nThis year, Phish has played 18 shows, including their celebrated 13-show \"Bakers Dozen\" run of shows at New York's Madison Square Garden over the summer. The band returns to the same stage for its annual string of New Year's concerts late next month, completing their support for 2106's \"Big Boat,\" the four-piece's 13th studio album.\n\nBailey says the booking was a bit of payback for a show The Grand lost to Atlantic City recently.\n\nParadigm Talent Agency, which has a deep roster of acts and recently brought Lyle Lovett and John Hiatt to The Grand, decided to route Anastasio's tour to Wilmington for a show to help make up for it.\n\n\"When you're slogging along in a market like I am with Philadelphia right there and now Live Nation here, you really don't get a lot of breaks. You get trampled on and you learn to live with that,\" Bailey says. \"But every once in a while, someone decides you've been trampled on enough and throws you a bone.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

These musicians did.", "text": "When The Grand announced Phish frontman Trey Anastasio was coming for his first Wilmington show, it wasn't a question of whether the concert would sell out, but rather how fast?\n\nTrue to form, Anastasio's army of devoted jam-loving fans were dutifully online Dec. 1 at 10 a.m., dreaming of getting some of the 1,200 $65-$75 tickets to the rare solo concert, which will be held Tuesday night.\n\nWith tickets for his first Delaware show in nearly 25 years available only online, it took about 25 minutes to sell out with theater officials saying it would have been even faster if the box office had opened their windows.\n\nBy the time the final order went through, Anastasio had still broken The Grand's all-time record for the quickest sellout, fueled by his hardcore legion of fans, many of whom will be coming from out of state.\n\nAnd it doesn't seem like many of them are willing to miss the show now that they snagged tickets. Earlier this week, there were only six tickets listed for sale on the ticket exchange website Stubhub.com, costing $120 each.\n\nAnastasio's 17-stop solo acoustic tour kicked off in Morristown, New Jersey, on Thursday and its East Coast portion ends in Athens, Georgia, on Feb. 18. The trek starts back up April 17 in Cleveland and concludes April 28 in New Orleans.\n\nHis previous two Delaware shows were in 1993 and 1994 while fronting Phish at Newark's Bob Carpenter Center.\n\nWith the red-headed Anastasio as the new sellout record holder at The Grand, we contacted the state's other major music venues to find out which shows of theirs have been the hottest of hot tickets over the years.\n\nBob Carpenter Center, 631 S. College Ave., Newark -- When it comes to flash sellouts, 2016 was a banner year for the 4,500-person University of Delaware arena. Hip-hop artists Future and Chance the Rapper both sold out their respective concerts in about 10 minutes, says David Arthur, UD assistant athletics director for sports and entertainment sales. Other musical powerhouses who sold every ticket in 20 minutes or less: Elton John, who drew lines what wrapped around the venue (2008), Ed Sheeran (2013), Maroon 5 (2010) and fun. (2012).\n\nBottle & Cork, 1807 Del. 1, Dewey Beach -- Unless you've been away from Delaware's beaches for more than a decade, you know that country music has become more and more of an original music force, especially at the famed Cork. So much so that the venue's longtime slogan officially changed from \"The greatest rock 'n' roll bar in the world\" to \"The greatest rock and country bar in the world.\" Last summer's pinch-me-I-can't-believe-he's-playing-a-club-this-small show by country singer Jake Owen sold out in two minutes, inching past the 2016's three-minute sellout by another country heavy hitter, Cole Swindell. In related news, this summer's upcoming Cork 82nd anniversary show scheduled for Aug. 3 headlined by semi-retired cover band Mr. Greengenes sold out in 68 minutes. \"Since they do so many fairs, festivals, arenas and large outdoor venues, both Cole and Jake commented on how cool it was to play a place like the Cork that was so intimate,\" says Highway One Group talent buyer Vikki Walls.\n\nDelaware State Fair, 18500 U.S. 13, Harrington -- It's been four-and-a-half years since the stars aligned and the state fair snagged a double bill that shines even brighter in retrospect. Country superstar Luke Bryan was paired with Florida Georgia Line, just as the duo was exploding in popularity thanks to their smash debut \"Here's to the Good Times.\" The combo show sold 9,800 tickets in a half hour back in 2013, says Danny Aguilar, state fair assistant general manager.\n\nFirefly Music Festival, The Woodlands, Dover -- Thanks to the 300-plus acres available to Firefly at the Dover Motor Speedway, there's never been a need for festival organizers to turn people away at the gate. Even though Firefly's space means sellouts are unlikely, there is one year that stands out above all others. In its seven years, 2015 was the only edition where single-day tickets were not available. If you wanted to see Sir Paul McCartney deliver his set packed with Beatles hits, it required a four-day pass. By 2016, the festival was back with single-day tickets and has never blocked them again.\n\nThe Freeman Stage at Bayside, 31750 Lake View Dr, near Selbyville -- When it comes to sellouts, The Freeman Stage doesn't keep minute-by-minute records. But recent single-day sellouts that went fast include last summer's 2,600-person concert by Chicago and 2016 shows by Huey Lewis and the News and Hotel California: The Original Tribute to the Eagles. \"It's not always the most well-known acts that have sold out quickly at The Freeman Stage,\" venue spokesperson Alyson Cunningham says.\n\nThe Gild Hall, 2126 The Highway, Arden -- Accidentally booked only 30 miles away from New Jersey's Appel Farm Arts and Music Festival on the night before the fest, British folk rocker Richard Thompson played Arden solo on June 2, 2006. But all tickets had to be sold in person. So across four afternoons, Thompson fans drove to Arden to get their seats with 80 tickets sold in the first 45 minutes they went on sale, says Ron Ozer, an Arden Concert Gild talent buyer. Adds Ozer: \"The concert itself was one of the hottest we ever had. It was close to 100 in the hall that evening and Richard had on a black silk shirt. I was sitting up front and sweat was rolling off his arm into his guitar. Made for a less appetizing, but still extremely cool concert, solo acoustic.\"\n\nThe Grand, 818 N Market St., Wilmington -- With Phish's Anastasio now the title holder, who did his 25-minute sellout unseat? The White Stripes had held the record for 10 years following their standing-room-only, full-throttle show in 2007. After an in-person-only on-sale that had hundreds of fans lining Market Street, Jack and Meg White delivered an enthralling performance, which turned out to be one of their final shows. Coming in third place is Willie Nelson's concert on September 10, 2014, which sold 1,200 tickets in 35 minutes -- a show that came only two years following his previous visit there. \"Willie was a total surprise. We just announced and it went crazy,\" says Stephen Bailey, managing director of programming at The Grand.\n\nThe Queen, 500 N. Market St., Wilmington -- It's been about eight months since Live Nation took over The Queen from World Cafe Love. Since then, the Dec. 5 acoustic duo concert by Shinedown’s Brent Smith and Zach Myers is the quickest sellout with about 800 tickets going in a couple of weeks. Other sellouts have included Brett Young, Breaking Benjamin, Third Eye Blind, Regina Spektor and Cheap Trick. During World Cafe Live's six-year reign, 2014's show by English indie pop act The xx sold out in minutes. Other quick sellouts included Neutral Milk Hotel, The Gaslight Anthem's Brian Fallon, Todd Rundgren, Lake Street Dive, Amos Lee and Animal Collective.\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

But a scheduling format has been created in which each team is paired with two permanent partners that it will play each year. For Delaware, that’s Villanova and Towson. The other six conference games will rotate annually so that all teams meet each other at least once at home and once on the road over an eight-year period.\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

(See the breakdown below.)\n\nWhile the lineup is not expected to be released until later this winter, that doesn't mean that Firefly die-hards can't have a little fun in the meantime, fantasizing about which of their musical heroes will come to little ol' Delaware June 15-18.\n\nThe pressure is on for Firefly to deliver this year, perhaps more than others.\n\nLast year's sixth annual fest boasted five headliners for the first time --The Weeknd, Muse, Twenty One Pilots, Chance the Rapper and Bob Dylan -- but attendance was noticeably down. (Festival officials dutifully reported that the festival had one again drawn 90,000 fans, but multiple on-site vendors put the number closer to 60,000.)\n\nIt was the first year that Firefly re-launched itself as a \"fan-curated festival,\" allowing fans to vote online for everything from acts and food.\n\nIn the past, the festival's biggest moments have come from its biggest names, such as Paul McCartney's dazzling headlining set in 2015 and the Foo Fighters' thunderous romp on the main stage the year prior.\n\nWhile we await official word on this year's roster, let's dig into who fans want to see and speculate on whether it will happen.\n\nFleetwood Mac (25 votes): Wait. What? It's 2017, not 1977. Why is Fleetwood Mac tied atop the list this year? Because Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood and John and Christine McVie are preparing to re-emerge in 2018, already announcing that they will tour. Nostalgia will be running high, especially since the act is re-issuing its self-titled 1975 album next month, which boasts hits such as \"Landslide\" and “Rhiannon.” Plus, Nicks is having a renaissance of her own, especially with the younger set thanks to appearances on FX's \"American Horror Story\" and NBC's \"The Voice\" in recent years. Could the act be eyeing big money festival dates for the summer? Absolutely. Would young and old alike stream to the festival to see them? No doubt.\n\nEminem (25 votes): Speaking of a renaissance, Eminem has also re-emerged, planning to release \"Revival\" on Dec. 15 -- his first new album in four years. Even though the album isn't out yet, Marshall Mathers has already put his mark on 2017, most notably with his ferocious freestyle attacking President Trump on the BET Hip Hop Awards in October. \"And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his/I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against,\" he seethed. It's also been four years since Eminem launched a full-scale tour, so odds are he'll be on the road this summer.\n\nPearl Jam (18 votes): Each year, Pearl Jam either wins (2015) or places in our Fantasy Firefly poll. After watching the Foo Fighters bring '90s rock (and Grotto Pizza shout-outs) to Dover, it's easy to visualize Eddie Vedder & Co. delivering as epic a sweat-filled set as the Foos. But not this year. PJ is in Europe that weekend playing the Pinkpop Festival in the Netherlands and London's 02 Arena.\n\nColdplay (11 votes): Will Chris Martin come to Delaware to perform for the second time in recent years? Probably not. Martin, who performed at Beau Biden's funeral service at Wilmington's St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church in 2015, wrapped up a massive 122-show world tour last month -- a tour that started back in March 2016. With no new album and much-needed rest time ahead, don't expect to feel a rush of blood to the head in Dover this summer. Plus, they don't need the money. Their tour just grossed $523 million according to promoter Live Nation, making it the third-highest grossing tour of all time behind U2’s $736 million 360 tour (2009-2011) and The Rolling Stones' $558 million A Bigger Bang tour (2005-2007).\n\nArcade Fire (9 votes): Another perennial Firefly fan favorite, the rollicking Canadian six-piece are known for their exciting leave-it-all-on-the-stage live shows -- something they have never brought to Firefly. Win Butler's band has been touring since June behind the band's (critically panned) album \"Everything Now,\" which was released in July. The indie rockers have a European tour on the books through the end of April and no other dates listed, so it's a possibility.\n\nU2 (8 votes): When U2 announced its tour behind the just-released \"Songs of Experience,\" the Irish rock band's 14th studio album, the rumors started to spread immediately. Even though Bono and the boys have shows booked for Firefly weekend (Philadelphia on Thursday and Washington, D.C,. on Sunday), fans were buzzing that they might squeeze a Delaware drop-in. Don't count on it. The band would have to perform shows on back-to-back nights, which they are only doing on this tour a few times and only when they are in the same venue for multiple shows.\n\nArctic Monkeys (8 votes): It's been more than three years since baby-faced frontman Alex Turner strode on stage with his slicked back hair and delivered one of the weekend's best sets, kicking it off with the swagger-filled single \"Do I Wanna Know.\" It obviously left a mark with fans who want the English rockers back. With no new album since that sunny summer day in 2014 and no tour dates listed, it doesn't look promising for a redux in 2018.\n\nThe Rolling Stones (7 votes): If you think Baby Boomers would storm the Firefly gates to see Fleetwood Mac, just imagine if the Stones brought their seemingly ageless stage show to Delaware for the first time ever? Fresh from this fall's quick 13-show European tour, they have no other tour dates on the docket. And since 2016's \"Blue & Lonesome\" was their first studio album in 11 years, we're not betting on them having a new batch of songs to push by this summer.\n\nLady Gaga (7 votes): As the #MeToo movement grows, Lady Gaga would be an especially timely booking. After all, she was the one who sang \"Til It Happens to You\" at the 2016 Academy Awards accompanied on-stage by 50 sexual assault victims. (Vice President Joe Biden introduced her.) With Florence + the Machine as the festival's *only* female-fronted headliner out of the 22 that have rocked Firefly since 2012, Firefly is in desperate need of some one-stage girl power. After her halftime Super Bowl performance earlier this year, Gaga waited until the summer to launch her North American tour, which wraps up in Utah next week. With Lady Gaga starring in Bradley Coopers' directorial debut (\"A Star is Born\") in May, she'll most likely be busily doing press for the film instead of wiggling in Dover.\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

Margaret Rose Henry, D-Wilmington, for working to get a much-deserved historical marker through the Delaware Public Archives.\n\nThe festival\n\nThe family-friendly festival will bring live music, drum and dance, and spoken word entertainment to Wilmington's Tubman-Garrett Riverfront Park from noon to 10 p.m. on Saturday, July 25.\n\nThe event was started in 1984 by Ibis and Genny Pitts, who were Marley's friends when he was here. Ibis, 69, died in 2013, but his wife and friends kept the festival going.\n\nThis year's performers include Romain Virgo, The Itals, Jah9, Alika, Dubtonic Kru, DJ Afrika Bambaataa and DJ Stepwise. The festival is bringing back its popular Children's Village and International Market Place, with cooling and relaxation in its Holistic Wellness Pavilion and Bamboo Rain Hut, along with Caribbean and international food and a beer garden.\n\nTickets are $25 and free for age 10 or younger, with discounts available for groups of 10 or more and VIP tickets at $75. Tickets may be bought at the gate, via eventbrite at http://bit.ly/1HwBleq, through www.oneluvparty.com or www.facebook.com/peoplesfestde and Delaware stores of ShopRite, one of the sponsors.\n\nEver-so-mellow, the festival is one true way to celebrate Marley's message of \"One Love.\"\n\nThe Park\n\nWilmington City Council rightfully gave unanimous support to Council President Theo Gregory's inspired idea, cosponsored by Councilmen Nnambdi Chukwuocha and Trippi Congo, to rename a small park at 24th and Tatnall streets as \"One Love Park.\"\n\nA mural of Marley with his lyrics, \"I feel so good in my neighborhood,\" was painted across the street from the park, less than a block from what was the Marley home in the 2300 block of Tatnall St.\n\nA groundbreaking ceremony was held at the park in May for improvements including new playground and exercise equipment, resurfaced basketball court, improved lighting, gated entrance and landscaping.\n\nAs the renaming was considered, Gregory talked about the Marley song's meaning, saying, \"We all need a reminder from time to time about the importance of love in our hearts for our children and for each other.\"\n\nSponsor Henry appropriately has called Marley's having lived in Delaware \"historic\" and a state historical marker is long overdue.\n\nThe new name, improvements and marker are good not only for the park, which had become somewhat rundown and known for drug activity, but also the neighborhood, city and state.\n\nFans also may add tributes. The 2nd District Neighborhood Planning Council is offering engraved pavers for $55 to $175 for the park entrance. For details or orders, see Friends of One Love Park at www.facebook.com/friendsoftatnallplayground or call the council at (302) 655-2839.\n\nIts President Kathleen Patterson said Sunday that proceeds will be used for community projects and events at the park.\n\n\"Our hope is that people will feel good about the park, to bring their kids there and the more people who come, we hope, the more it will become a hub of activity – a positive hub – for the community.\"\n\nThe Delawarean\n\nYears after his father died, Marley moved to Delaware with his mother, Cedella Malcolm Marley Booker, from Kingston, Jamaica, when she remarried.\n\nOutside Jamaica, Wilmington was the first place Bob Marley called home.\n\nHis mother owned her house on Tatnall Street and ran the \"Roots\" Jamaican music shop on Market Street. For a time, Marley and his wife lived nearby.\n\nAccounts vary of when the family came to Delaware and just how long Bob Marley lived here full-time – from a few months to many years. By some reports, Cedella moved here in 1962, after her son had begun recording as a teen with The Wailers, but he moved back in the mid-1960s to resume his music.\n\nWhen he returned and is said to have stayed longer, he worked at the Chrysler Assembly Plant in Newark, where fans bemoan the lack of a sign or other formal tribute. \"Night Shift,\" which he wrote in 1976, is said to have been inspired by his forklift driving job in Chrysler's parts warehouse. He also worked as a DuPont Co. lab assistant, but is said to have been paid under the name of Donald Marley.\n\nEven the family's foundation avoids specifying his Delaware time, saying he lived here \"off and on from 1965 to 1977,\" News Journal files say.\n\nMarley's son Stephen was born in Wilmington in 1972. He and siblings lived with Marley's mom, went to city schools and stayed with her when he toured.\n\nAmong his many awards and honors, Marley's \"One Love/People Get Ready,\" with the Wailers, was named Song of the Millennium by the BBC.\n\nRobert Nesta Marley, whose middle name meant \"wise messenger,\" died of cancer at in 1981, at age 36, with his mother at his side.\n\nShe lived in a home he had bought her in Miami, where she moved after closing her Wilmington store following a burglary in the late 1970s. She went on two write biographies of him and perform with his children Ky-Mani, Ziggy, Stephen, Damian and Julian Marley – described as a star in her own right.\n\nBooker, who died in Miami in 2008 at 81, had declined memorials for her reggae-star son. But she surprised Ibis and Genny Pitts at a birthday party they gave her, giving her blessing for them to hold the Peoples Festival for Peace in his honor.\n\nDo you have a Delaware Backstory?

Once in the network, they were able to steal trade secrets.\n\nThe group of avid gamers often would use the information for themselves, but also constructed and sold at least one Microsoft Xbox One before it went on the market in November 2013.\n\nThe group, through a breach of Zombie Studios, gained access to the U.S. Army's computer network and training software that was being developed for the Apache helicopter.\n\nU.S. District Judge Gregory M. Sleet hinted Thursday that some of the targeted companies wrote to him about the impact of the cyber thefts. However, Sleet did not elaborate in open court because the letters and other court documents have been sealed.\n\nMcAndrew would not say why the documents have been sealed.\n\nPokora, who was a computer science major at the University of Toronto, told Sleet he is remorseful and understands the significance of his crimes.\n\n\"I hurt a lot of people, including the companies that I valued and looked up to,\" Pokora said. \"They work really hard on innovating, and they don't deserve to have their hard work [stolen] like that.\"\n\nHis sisters, who were present in court, both said Pokora is intelligent and has grown up since being arrested in March 2014.\n\n\"This has been a very big wake-up call for Dave,\" Jessica Pokora said.\n\nPokora's attorney, Solomon L. Wisenberg, asked the judge to not sentence Pokora to any additional prison time. McAndrew requested two years in prison.\n\nSleet found a middle ground and said he weighed the need to deter other international hackers against Pokora's own remorse and likelihood of a bright future, possibly even working to protect one of the companies he had targeted.\n\nProsecutors first learned of the hacking group in 2011 when FBI agents in Delaware got a tip. None of the hackers are from Delaware, but the case was prosecuted here because of the initial tip and because some of the targeted companies are incorporated in Delaware.\n\nEven as the group realized it was under investigation by federal agents, it continued to operate.\n\nMcAndrew said international cyber crimes are complex to prosecute, but he said, \"We need to promote respect for U.S. laws, here and elsewhere.\"\n\nContact Jessica Masulli Reyes at (302) 324-2777, jmreyes@delawareonline.com or Twitter @JessicaMasulli.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/04/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/08/03/knotty-pine-owner-takes-apron-retirement/13557667/", "title": "Knotty Pine owner takes off apron for retirement", "text": "robin brown\n\nThe News Journal\n\nThe Knotty Pine%2C located at 308 E. 11th St.%2C served stars during segregation\n\nHealth issues have forced owner Stella Dunning to shutter the restaurant\n\nRetaurant has been a mainstay on Wilmington%27s Eastside\n\nFamily members hope to update%2C reopen the place in 2015\n\nWilmington's queen of soul food celebrated her retirement Saturday in the way she loves best – inside her historic restaurant packed with friends, family, food and love.\n\nMonths ago, health issues forced Stella Dunning from her kitchen at The Knotty Pine Restaurant, Delaware's oldest continuously operated African-American restaurant.\n\nBut she was beaming Saturday on her return.\n\n\"I walked in here and it felt like home,\" she said.\n\nDunning said \"people would holler me all the time and say, 'When are you going to reopen?' and Lord knows I wish I could, but I just can't.\"\n\nHer retirement ends a chapter of Delaware history, begun by her mother Lottie Ewing.\n\nUnder segregation, when entertainers such as Cab Calloway, Ray Charles and Lena Horne performed at the Hotel du Pont but couldn't eat there, they came to The Knotty Pine, located at 308 E. 11th St.\n\nBarbara Willis recalled James Brown going to The Knotty Pine, but said even greater is Dunning's example.\n\n\"To be a woman, and a black woman at that, with her own business, was amazing at a time when Afro-Americans – we were called colored or negro in those days – couldn't even get a loan,\" she said. \"... She is living proof of what's possible.\"\n\nLavon Robinson called her \"one-of-a-kind,\" saying she shows the young and disadvantaged \"they can overcome and do something.\"\n\nThe historical marker out front says the restaurant was \"a refuge for African Americans in a city where access to public facilities was still limited. Noted for its 'down home cooking' and friendly atmosphere, the Knotty Pine was popular with residents and visitors alike.\"\n\nHer oldest grandchild, Tyonne Hinson of Newark, had the marker copied onto a retirement cake with a News Journal photo of Dunning from the marker's 2006 unveiling.\n\nThat day, speeches and proclamations lauded her contribution to the city and state and she was similarly honored Saturday.\n\nCouncilman Darius J. Brown presented a city proclamation, adding his own tribute \"as a son of the Eastside.\"\n\nHe recalled skipping Howard High School classes to eat at The Knotty Pine and being inspired by civil rights leaders there.\n\nMany Delaware luminaries were devotees, including the late Herman M. Holloway Sr., the state's first African-American senator, and artist Edward L. Loper Sr.\n\n\"The Eastside's history is rich and The Knotty Pine's history is rich and literally spans throughout our country,\" Brown said.\n\nOthers giving tributes included artist Eunice LaFate, Bishop Aretha E. Morton of Tabernacle Full Baptist Cathedral on Washington Street and the Wilmington Peacekeepers group.\n\nMany told of her feeding down-and-out folks at the kitchen door, giving students and the needy brown bags of food to-go and supplying nearby St. Joseph's Church to feed the neighborhood's poor.\n\nPeacekeepers leader Lamotte X said, \"Miss Stella was always there for the community and she still is.\" He chuckled recalling kids' slogan when he went to Bancroft Junior High: \"You're doin' fine if you eat at The Knotty Pine.\"\n\nDespite trying times in the Eastside, Morton said, \"she's been a rock and an inspiration.\"\n\nAnd her retiring does not mean The Knotty Pine itself is history.\n\nAs Saturday's crowd sampled food in front of Dunning's trademark array of photos and tributes – her daughter Wanda M. Johnson said, \"We're hoping to open back up next year.\"\n\nSome things will be modernized and the menu is under review.\n\nAnd the plan is fine by Dunning.

Sorry to say that,\" Hawn said. \"Sometimes he tells you the truth and then sometimes he don't.\"\n\nWelch, imprisoned at Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna, is serving a 30-year sentence on a number of unlawful-sex charges with a 10-year-old girl. A search of Superior Court records shows he sexually abused the girl starting on July 5, 1997.\n\nThe abuse began shortly after Welch started watching a pornographic video while the girl \"was in the living room area with him,\" according to court records. He then kissed her on the mouth before he began sexually abusing her.\n\nThe child was the daughter of Welch's then-girlfriend.\n\nNew Castle County police were contacted July 17, 1997, after the mother learned of the abuse.\n\nAccording to the court document, Welch admitted to abusing the girl and was charged with 11 crimes. He pleaded guilty to first-degree unlawful sexual intercourse and unlawful sexual penetration on Jan. 5, 1998.\n\nWelch is scheduled to be released in June 2026. He is seeking early release and is scheduled to appear before the Board of Pardons in July.\n\nMontgomery County, Md., Police Department's Cold Case Squad and FBI agents in Baltimore announced last week that Welch was a \"person of interest\" in the sisters' disappearance.\n\nThe girls were last seen just after 2 p.m. March 25, 1975, walking between Wheaton Plaza (now Westfield Wheaton) and their homeonly half a mile away. Their mother told them to be home by 4 p.m.\n\nThey didn't return.\n\nWelch, who also went by the name Michael Welch, was noticed paying attention to the sisters on the afternoon they disappeared, according to investigators.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Maryland officials said they had not spoken to Welch, but have been questioning relatives since last year, according to Roe and Hawn.\n\nHawn said that in November, she learned investigators had called her mother in Tennessee about this case.\n\n\"Then when we came home, they were looking for me,\" Hawn said of Montgomery County police detectives. \"This was November.\"\n\nHawn occasionally visits Welch in prison, while Roe visits and writes to him more frequently.\n\nRoe said she brought up the missing sisters investigation to Welch during a December visit.\n\n\"Me and him talked about it and he said he didn't have anything to do about it,\" she said.\n\nRoe said her grandmother told her Welch was sitting on a couch when news broke of the missing sisters. Welch has told Roe that he was at the shopping mall around the time the girls went missing.\n\n\"I just think they need to go look elsewhere,\" Roe said. Despite Welch always being \"nice and sweet\" to her, Roe said she would not allow him to live with her and her children if he got out of prison.\n\nWelch had a difficult childhood and was considered the \"black sheep of the family,\" according to Hawn.\n\n\"Nobody got along with him,\" she said. \"Nobody in the family really didn't have really nothing to do with him.\"\n\nWelch's mother was killed in a car accident caused by his father who had been driving drunk, Hawn said. Welch was in the car at the time, she added.\n\nAfter a time in foster care, Welch went to live with his father, stepmother and Hawn in Hyattsville, Md. He was about 11 or 12.\n\n\"In that year, all I remember is him and his dad arguing, fighting and him leaving,\" she said. \"Coming back, getting in trouble with the police, but that's about all I remember.\"\n\nWelch traveled extensively throughout the U.S. from the 1970s through the mid '90s and worked as a ride operator for a carnival company, often set up at malls, according to Maryland authorities. He was working as a landscaper at the time of his Delaware arrest, according to court documents.\n\nMaryland authorities have said Welch was arrested in several states and charged with sexual offenses against young girls. They believe there are some who may have not come forward.\n\n\"We understand we're asking people to think back several decades to remember details they may not think matter.

They’re still a long way off – likely in 2023 and 2027. Look for an announcement this summer.\n\nFor FCS programs such as Delaware, games against FBS teams serve several purposes.\n\nPlayers love the challenge of mixing it up against a big-time foe in front of a large crowd in a huge stadium. School officials relish the payday, as such trips typically net about $500,000 for the visitor’s bank account, which comes in quite handy.\n\nCoaches just want to get out of the games healthy, so they have all their players for the games that really count.\n\nDelaware is presently in a run of playing six games in seven years against ACC schools. They were scheduled by former athletic director Eric Ziady.\n\nIt began horribly, in a 62-0 loss at Pitt in 2014. Losses at North Carolina 41-14 in 2015 and Wake Forest 38-21 in 2016 were competitive for a while.\n\nLast year, Delaware journeyed to then-18th-ranked Virginia Tech and got quite a bit out of its 27-0 loss, namely tremendous faith in its defense. And playing in front of the 62,526 who inhabited raucous Lane Stadium, truly one of college football’s most energetic venues, was something the Blue Hens will always treasure.\n\nDelaware doesn’t have an FBS foe this season, when a trip to frequent FCS national champ North Dakota State highlights the docket. But Delaware is back at Pitt in 2019 and at North Carolina State in 2020.\n\nLast fall, Delaware coach Danny Rocco, in his first season at the helm, said there was great “value” in match-ups against FBS opponents, both for the school and the players, who “look forward to playing in these games.” He did also state a preference for perhaps playing FBS foes from non-Power Five leagues.\n\nRocco also suggested the value of regional connections in seeking FBS adversaries, and that’s where Penn State is the perfect big-time game for Delaware, even if the Hens will be heavy underdogs.\n\nJust about every kid from Pennsylvania wants to be good enough to play for Penn State. Many of those who aren’t quite good enough to be a Nittany Lion come to Delaware, which has often fancied itself as a mini-Penn State in terms of football.\n\nRight now, there are 29 Pennsylvanians on the UD roster, but that number is about to explode. Nine of the 14 recruits in Rocco’s December, 2017, recruiting class were from Pennsylvania. So were two of the three high school seniors who signed in February.\n\nPlunk Penn State on that UD schedule and watch Rocco, who happens to be a Keystone State native and former Penn State player himself, make that number rise.\n\n“Penn State doesn’t want you? Play for Delaware and go show them what they missed,” sounds like a convincing recruiting pitch.\n\nSince I tweeted the possibility of this two weeks ago, a healthy debate has raged on the Gohens.net message board about whether or not it’s good for Delaware.\n\nSome have justifiably mentioned the stain left by former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky’s child molestation episodes and coach Joe Paterno and other school leaders’ utter failure to recognize his deviance and stop it.\n\nThat is shame Penn State must live with forever.\n\nBut the Nittany Lions still play football – quite well of late, in fact -- and the Blue Hens lining up against them will be a sight to behold.\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

Spring practice starts a few weeks later and Arrington will be among those trying to earn a role in the Blue Hens' rebuilding defense, despite not having played high school football.\n\nSo who is Keeno Arrington?\n\nAbout that name\n\nKeeno is the son of Lavar Arrington, a recent College Football Hall of Fame inductee who was a two-time first-team All-American linebacker at Penn State. He was then the second pick of the 2000 NFL Draft by Washington and played seven pro seasons.\n\nKeeno was born in 2000. But Lavar and his mother, Katey, who'd known each other since attending high school in Pittsburgh, didn't stay together long. Keeno grew up with his mother in Pittsburgh, though he did frequently see his father, who married his wife Trish, had four children and moved to the Los Angeles area. Keeno eventually took the last name of his stepfather, Keenan Holmes.\n\nLavar and Keeno had no contact for more than eight years from roughly 2013 to 2021, Keeno said, because of \"family disputes that were over my head.\"\n\nA high school star — in basketball\n\nKeeno Holmes frequently made his own headlines, but it was as a basketball player. He was on Lincoln Park teams that reached four Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League title games and won two WPIAL titles, plus a PIAA Class 3A championship.\n\n\"Once I started playing basketball there,\" he said, \"started doing the AAU travel thing in the summer, that kinda of eliminated summer workouts and camp for football. So slowly I started doing basketball all year round to the point it was kind of like the only thing I do.\"\n\n2023 SCHEDULE:Delaware opens with CAA road game before Penn State trip\n\nKeeno scored 1,658 career points and earned a WPIAL 3A Player of the Year award. He then attended nearby Division III Allegheny College, starting and averaging 9.6 points per game as a freshman in 2019-20.\n\n\"I really wouldn't change anything,\" he said of those experiences.\n\nA new perspective\n\nWith no basketball season in 2020-21 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and schoolwork being done remotely, he reassessed his family situation and athletic priorities while quarantined at home.\n\nWith plenty of time to mull his own athletic pursuits, Keeno felt the urge to give football a shot and began training with that in mind. He hadn't been on a football team since sixth grade. It was only natural then, he felt, to re-establish contact with his father.\n\n\"I just felt spiritually pushed to reach out to my dad and rekindle that relationship,\" he said.\n\nLaVar was happy to reconnect with his son and aid in his football endeavors.\n\n\"We all just feel whole again,\" Keeno said. \" . . . A lot of tension and heartache is out the window.\"\n\nA return to football\n\nLackawanna Junior College in Scranton, Pennsylvania, gave Arrington the chance to play football, which, he confessed \"scared me to death.\"\n\nCoaches urged him to \"be a sponge,\" and listen, observe and ask questions. Arrington was limited to special teams duty in his first season, in 2021. The biggest challenge, he said, was the physical aspect.\n\nHe turned out to be a quick learner.\n\nBUILDING BLOCKS:Delaware December recruits revealed\n\nLast fall Arrington became a starter, seeing action at linebacker, safety and cornerback. Arrington made 34 tackles, including four for lost yardage, broke up 13 passes and intercepted two.\n\n\"By the time I got to my second season I was really comfortable in what I was doing,\" Arrington said.\n\nIt was truly \"a breakout season,\" he added.\n\nDelaware notices\n\nDelaware defensive coordinator Manny Rojas was among the first of several Division I FCS coaches to express recruiting interest in Arrington. It didn't hurt that Rojas also has Pittsburgh roots. That helped pave Arrington's way to Delaware, which he chose after also getting scholarship offers from several of the Blue Hens' CAA rivals.\n\n\"When I talked to coach Rojas on the phone, I kinda knew that was the place I wanted to go,\" Arrington said. \"Him being a Pittsburgh guy, that connection, we speak a similar language. He's a blue-collar guy.\"\n\nThe message Arrington got from Delaware was \"We love you as a player,\" he said, and it sounded sincere.\n\nA visit to Delaware confirmed those feelings. UD coaches view Arrington, he said, as \"a Swiss Army knife\" in their three- or four-safety alignment capable of run-stopping, pass-covering and blitzing duties.\n\n\"When a program like that wants you,\" he said, \"they know something.\"\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian, who served as Nick Saban's offensive coordinator in 2019–2020, marched his Longhorns into Alabama's Bryant–Denny Stadium and beat the Crimson Tide, 34-24.\n\n“They (Alabama) were 52-1 in their last 53 (home) games, so I guess they’re 52-2 now,\" Sarkisian said after the Longhorns win.\n\nTexas quarterback Quinn Ewers threw for 349 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions. He said he's \"so proud of my team and my defense. We balled out.\"\n\n— Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 10 Texas extends lead to 10 with another haymaker\n\nHave yourself a night Adonai Mitchell.\n\nTexas’ junior receiver caught his second touchdown of the night, a 39-yard pass from QB Quinn Ewers, to extend the Longhorns’ lead over the Crimson Tide to 10 points in the fourth quarter. Mitchell has three receptions for 78 yards, while tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders has has five receptions for 114 yards. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 3 Alabama's 2-point conversion good after 39-yard TD\n\nAlabama isn’t done yet. After giving up two touchdowns to Texas in all of 15-seconds, the Crimson Tide cut the Longhorns’ lead to three points. Alabama’s Jalen Milroe dropped a low snap, but quickly picked it up and found Amari Niblack across the middle for a 39-yard touchdown. Alabama successfully completed a two-point conversion to bring the score to 24-27. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 10 Texas intercepts Milroe again, up by 11\n\nFifteen seconds later, the Longhorns scored again.\n\nTexas’ Jerrin Thompson picked off Alabama’s Jalen Milroe and returned it 32-yards to the Crimson Tide’s 5-yard line. It marked Milroe’s second pick of the night.\n\n— Cydney Henderson\n\nN0. 10 Texas answers back with TD, leads No. 3 Alabama 20-16\n\nAlabama’s lead didn’t last long. Texas immediately responded by finding the end zone themselves. Texas QB Quinn Ewers completed a 50-yard play to Ja'Tavion Sanders and capped the drive with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Adonai Mitchell to put the Longhorns up 20-16 over the Crimson Tide.\n\nA pass interference call on Alabama’s Terrion Arnold, his second of the night, accelerated Texas’ drive.\n\nAlabama led for one minute and nine seconds. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 3 Alabama takes lead over No. 10 Texas with 49-yard TD\n\nJermaine Burton finally got his touchdown.\n\nAfter two of Burton’s end zone catches were erased due to untimely penalties, quarterback Jalen Milroe connected with Burton for a 49-yard touchdown in the final minute of the third quarter.\n\nIt marked Alabama’s first touchdown of the game and the Crimson Tide took the lead over Texas for the first time. They are up 16-13 over Texas. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 10 Texas marches down field, but misses field goal\n\nTexas had the opportunity to extend their lead to seven, but Longhorns kicker Bert Auburn missed a 42-yard field goal to the left. That’s not the only missed opportunity of the drive. Texas QB Quinn Ewers went for the end zone on third down, but receiver Xavier Worthy couldn’t come up with the ball.\n\nTexas leads Alabama 13-9. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 3 Alabama’s Caleb Downs not feeling well, out for now\n\nFreshman safety Caleb Downs, the Week 1 SEC Football Player of the Week, is on the sidelines and not feeling well. According to ESPN’s Holly Rowe, Downs “lost his lunch,\" an expression that normally means someone vomited. Kristian Story is in the game at safety for Downs. — Cydney Henderson\n\nAlright, alright, alright: Matthew McConaughey attends Texas-Alabama matchup\n\nMatthew McConaughey is in Tuscaloosa.\n\nThe actor was in attendance Saturday at Bryant-Denny Stadium for Alabama’s matchup against Texas, his alma mater. (McConaughey graduated from the school in 1993 with a Bachelor of Science degree.) He went particularly crazy during Quinn Ewers’ 44-yard TD pass to Xavier Worthy.\n\n\"Hook em, baby!\" — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 3 Alabama penalty wipes out touchdown, again\n\nAlabama’s offense appeared to find a groove to start the third quarter with quarterback Jalen Milroe’s 34-yard pass to Isaiah Bond to convert a third down. But another penalty (holding) wiped out Milroe’s touchdown pass to Jermaine Burton, the second time a flag has negated a score this game.\n\nCrimson Tide kicker Will Reichard has been the real MVP so far. He nailed a 51-yard field goal to bring Alabama within 4-points of Texas, 13-9. Reichard is responsible for all 9 of Alabama’s points. — Cydney Henderson\n\nFor Shedeur Sanders, Colorado's defeat of Nebraska was 'personal'\n\nBOULDER, Colorado – Deion Sanders preached all week about how Saturday’s game against Nebraska was deeply “personal.”\n\nThere were plenty of reasons for this:\n\n∎ It was his first home game as head football coach at Colorado.\n\n∎ It was a sold-out game against the Cornhuskers, Colorado’s hated old rivals.\n\n∎ For his quarterback and son Shedeur, it also was a direct confrontation with Matt Rhule, the Nebraska coach who managed to offend him at times this year, including during pregame warmups when he said he saw him standing on the Buffaloes’ logo at midfield.\n\n“It was extremely personal,” Shedeur Sanders said after the Buffs beat Nebraska at Folsom Field 36-14.\n\nRead Brent Schrotenboer’s full story here.\n\nHalftime: No. 10 Texas 13, No. 3 Alabama 6\n\nThe Longhorns enter halftime with a 7-point lead over the Crimson Tide at Bryant-Denny Stadium.\n\nAlabama has struggled to get points on the board, but the Crimson Tide’s offense appeared to ignite with a third-down conversion when quarterback Jalen Milroe found Kobe Prentice for a 28-yard pass up the middle with 44 seconds left in the first half. A touchdown, however, was called back due to a penalty (ineligible lineman downfield) and another Alabama penalty (illegal motion) kept them out of the end zone. They settled for a field goal to cut into Texas’ lead, 13-6.\n\nMilroe has thrown for 80 yards and one interception and run for 52 yards. Prentice leads Alabama receivers with three receptions for 42 yards.\n\nTexas quarterback Quinn Ewers looked comfortable in the first half. He’s thrown for 138 yards and one touchdown to receiver Xavier Worthy, who has five receptions for 75 yards so far. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 10 Texas back on top of No. 3 Alabama after Ewer's deep-shot TD\n\nTexas quarterback Quinn Ewers connected with receiver Xavier Worthy for a 44-yard touchdown to take a 10-3 lead. Texas had tried another deep shot on the previous play, with Ewers throwing a lateral to Worthy, who then tried to find Adonai Mitchell down the field. But a pass interference penalty was called on Alabama’s Terrion Arnold for pulling Mitchell’s jersey, setting Texas up at the Crimson Tide’s 44-yard line and giving the Longhorns another crack at a big play. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 3 Alabama ties it up after Nick Saban’s gusty fourth down call\n\nAfter Texas took an early 3-0 lead, Alabama answered back with a 12-play, 51-yard drive to tie the game, 3-3. The Crimson Tide converted a 4th and three at Texas’ 42-yard-line, thanks to quarterback Jalen Milroe’s 6-yard pass to Malik Benson. But Alabama’s offense couldn’t get in the red zone and settled for a 43-yard field goal. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 10 Texas jumps to early lead over No. 3 Alabama after interception\n\nAlabama quarterback Jalen Milroe ran for 12 yards to capture a first down at the Crimson Tide’s 41-yard-line in the first quarter against Texas, but the drive ended two plays later when Texas defensive back Jahdae Barron intercepted Milroe. Barron’s pick resulted in a field goal for Texas to take an early 3-0 lead over Alabama. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 20 Mississippi rallies past No. 22 Tulane with big second half\n\nTulane led Ole Miss by 10 late into the third quarter, but the Rebels used a big fourth quarter to beat the Green Wave 37-20 in Yulman Stadium. Tulane was without starting quarterback Matthew Pratt, and backup Kai Horton played a solid role but was overwhelmed by the defense in the second half. In the second half, Ole Miss outscored Tulane 27-3, and sealed the win with fumble return for a touchdown with less than two minutes left. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nMississippi takes fourth-quarter lead on Tulane\n\nThe Rebels defense has made life tough for Tulane in the second half, and it’s offense broke through for a touchdown and capitalized on an interception to take a 20-17 lead over Tulane with 12 minutes left. The Green Wave then fumbled the ball to give Ole Miss the ball back. The Rebels have scored 13 consecutive points since the second quarter — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNotre Dame overcomes weather delay to get past North Carolina State\n\nAfter a lengthy weather delay, Notre Dame used a strong fourth quarter to pull away from North Carolina State and win on the road, 45-24. Leading 24-17 heading into the final 15 minutes, Notre Dame picked off Wolfpack quarterback Brennan Armstrong on back-to-back possessions in the final frame that led to two touchdowns to strengthen the lead. After forcing a fourth-down stop, Sam Hartman tossed a 35-yard touchdown pass to Holden Staes to seal the win before North Carolina State added a touchdown with two minutes left. T he duo of Hartman and running back Audric Estime were tough to stop, as the signal caller threw for 286 yards and four touchdowns on 15-for-24 passing, while Estime had 14 carries for 134 yards and two scores. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNo. 10 Texas at No. 3 Alabama: What to know about the matchup\n\nTime/TV: Saturday, 7 p.m. ET, ESPN\n\nWhy watch: The week’s headliner pits these national name-brand programs and future SEC foes in a rematch of last year’s encounter in Austin, in which the Crimson Tide narrowly escaped 20-19 thanks to some late heroics by Bryce Young. He is off to the NFL, of course, but the early returns on new Crimson Tide starting QB Jalen Milroe are quite positive. Longhorns QB Quinn Ewers, who was knocked out of last year’s tilt with Alabama with a shoulder injury, will be just as eager to show what he can do.\n\nWhy it could disappoint: Ewers and the Longhorns’ offense were a bit slow out of the gate last week against Rice. A similar start in Tuscaloosa could prove catastrophic, although the Texas defense should be better equipped to contain Milroe’s two-way ability than that of Middle Tennessee. If it isn’t a one-score game at halftime, there might not be any late drama — Eddie Timanus\n\nTexas vs. Alabama all-time record\n\nThe two programs have faced off 10 times. The matchup will be the second all-time in Tuscaloosa, and Alabama lost the last game 10-0 in 1902. The Longhorns hold a 7-2-1 series lead, but Alabama has won the past two matchups: the BCS Championship Game in 2009 and the matchup in Austin a season ago. The Longhorns have not beaten the Crimson Tide since 1982. — Nick Kelly, The Tuscaloosa News\n\nMiami holds halftime lead against No. 23 Texas A&M\n\nSpecial teams doomed the Hurricanes in the first half as two miscues led to easy points for No. 23 Texas A&M, but they still lead the Aggies 21-17 at halftime.\n\nDylan Joyce had his punt blocked by Jahdae Walker after Miami’s first possession and A&M cashed in three plays later as Conner Weigman scored on a keeper from 1-yard out.\n\nAfter A&M took a 10-0 lead, Miami answered after a 3-yard touchdown pass from Tyler Van Dyke to Colbie Young\n\nThe special teams came into play again when an A&M punt was muffed by Jacolby George at the Miami 7-yard line. Two plays later, Amari Daniels' 9-yard score put the Aggies up 17-7.\n\nVan Dyke (13-of-17, 232 yards, 3 TDs) then went deep to bring the Hurricanes within three, delivering a beautiful throw to freshman Isaiah Horton for 52 yards. After A&M missed a field goal with 57 seconds left, Miami took the lead after Van Dyke drove Miami 75 yards with no timeouts in 44 seconds and hit George on an 11-yard scoring strike. — Scooby Axson\n\nHow to watch Alabama vs. Texas\n\nThe game will be on ESPN and can be streamed on Fubo.

He’s 4-for-8 with 116 yards and the one touchdown pass. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nMichigan football score today: Wolverines in control against UNLV\n\nMichigan quarterback JJ McCarthy completed his first 13 pass attempts, and Blake Corum ran for 46 yards and two touchdowns as the Wolverines rolled to halftime with a 21-0 lead against UNLV.\n\nMcCarthy finished the half 17-of-18 for 188 yards with one touchdown to Roman Wilson. McCarthy had completions to seven receivers and added 38 rushing yards.\n\nEach of UNLV’s four first-half possessions ended in a punt, as the Rebels could only muster up 40 yards of total offense. UNLV quarterback Doug Brumfield threw for 58 yards and was sacked five times. — Scooby Axson\n\nNotre Dame football score today: NC State keeping it close\n\nNC State is hanging on at home against No. 11 Notre Dame, down 24-17 and starting the fourth quarter with the ball.\n\nAfter making it a one-score game, the Wolfpack forced a fumble to get great field position on Notre Dame’s side of the field. However, Brayden Narveson missed a 34-yard field goal that would have cut the deficit. The Wolfpack were able to force a punt to get the ball back to start the final 15 minutes. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nOle Miss football score today: Tulane leads in major home game for Green Wave\n\nTulane is without starting quarterback Michael Pratt but the Green Wave are holding up in a big home matchup against Ole Miss, up 10-7 in the second quarter.\n\nOle Miss only needed three plays to score a touchdown on its opening drive, but Tulane was able to respond thanks to a 57-yard pass from backup Kai Horton to Lawrence Keys III. The Green Wave were able to punch it in a few plays later, and their defense has forced the Rebels to punt on three straight drives. Valentino Ambrosio nailed a 44-yard field goal to start the second quarter to take the lead. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh on chain gang for son's youth football game\n\nJim Harbaugh can't be on the Michigan sidelines this week against UNLV because of his self-imposed three-game suspension. But nothing can keep Harbaugh away from football for too long.\n\nHarbaugh picked up a new gig and is spending his second Saturday off working the chains for a youth football game at his son Jack's game, dressed in his usual Michigan striped polo and hat, per a photo posted by ESPN reporter Sean Ritchlin.\n\n“There’s a chance my son Jack’s team is going to be playing at the same time. If he’s playing, I’ll go watch that game,” Harbaugh said the Monday before Michigan’s season opener against East Carolina. “I don’t know if I’ll watch on TV if I won’t be able to watch it. I can’t predict what it’s going to be at the time. It’s uncharted waters for me.\" — Gabriela Carroll\n\nClemson football score today: Turnovers keeping Charleston Southern close\n\nLess than one week after its disastrous loss to Duke, Clemson is in a battle with FCS Charleston Southern, with the Tigers leading 24-17 at the half.\n\nClemson quarterback Cade Klubnik has looked better in the home opener with 184 passing yards, but he made a costly mistake by throwing a pick six in the first quarter. The Tigers also fumbled early in the game and that was returned to the 1-yard line, and the Buccaneers punched it in one play later.\n\nThe Tigers' mistakes have given Charleston Southern hope from what has been a mostly ineffective offensive performance from the Buccaneers. Clemson is outgaining Charleston Southern 265-43. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nColorado no longer coming. The Buffs are here.\n\nBOULDER, Colorado – Head coach Deion Sanders and his Colorado football team made a statement to the nation in their first game last week at TCU. One week later, they made another one with less drama and flair, easily beating Nebraska 36-14 Saturday in front of the sold-out crowd of 53,241 at Folsom Field, the largest crowd here since 2008.\n\nAfter finishing 1-11 last season, the Buffaloes improved to 2-0 by overcoming a slow start, capitalizing on early Nebraska turnovers and then holding on to show they’re more than a one-week sensation.\n\nThe Buffs also weren’t nearly as sharp as they were in in last week’s 45-42 win in Fort Worth. They punted four times in their first four possessions Saturday after punting only three times all game the week before.\n\nColorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders even suffered four sacks in the first half but threw touchdown passes in the second and third quarters to help put Colorado up 20-7. The second one went to South Florida graduate transfer Xavier Weaver, who produced his second straight game of at least 100 yards.\n\nThe Buffs now look to go 3-0 with a night game next Saturday at home against Colorado State. −Brent Schrotenboer\n\nNo. 23 Texas A&M at Miami (Fla.) predictions, picks, how to watch\n\nTime/TV: Saturday, 3:30 p.m. ET, ABC\n\nWhy watch: Are the Aggies finally ready to live up to their seemingly annual billing? The same question could be asked of the Hurricanes. Both teams handled overmatched opponents as good teams should in Week 1, setting up what could be an interesting clash in the Sunshine State. A&M defeated the Hurricanes in a lackluster 17-9 contest last season, but both teams appear to have more competence on the offensive side this time. Aggies QB Conner Weigman torched New Mexico for five TD passes without a pick under new coordinator Bobby Petrino. Hurricanes QB Tyler Van Dyke wasn’t quite as prolific against the other Miami from Ohio last week, but RBs Henry Parrish and Mark Fletcher lent plenty of ground support.\n\nWhy it could disappoint: The Hurricanes’ much more accomplished secondary featuring DB Kamren Kinchens and the Aggies’ stout ground defense led by LB Edgerrin Cooper could neutralize the respective strengths of the opposing offenses. If that is the case, we might have another low-scoring struggle like the 2022 encounter. But that development would also significantly reduce the game’s blowout potential, so there should still be intrigue in the closing minutes. — Eddie Timanus\n\nUSA TODAY Sports staff picks:\n\nDan Wolken: Texas A&M\n\nTexas A&M Eddie Timanus: Texas A&M\n\nTexas A&M Erick Smith: Texas A&M\n\nTexas A&M Jace Evans: Miami\n\nMiami Paul Myerberg: Texas A&M\n\nTexas A&M Scooby Axson: Miami\n\nIowa at Iowa State how to watch and what to know\n\nTime/TV: Saturday, 3:30 p.m. ET, Fox\n\nWhy watch: This one won’t light up the scoreboard as a number of other games on the schedule will, but it should be competitive with the Cy-Hawk Trophy on the line. The Cyclones claimed it a year ago in a 10-7 slog, ending a six-game skid in the series. Unfortunately, not much else went right the rest of the way in a 4-8 campaign, while Iowa managed to go 8-5 despite its well-documented scoring woes. The Hawkeyes should be a bit more productive with Michigan transfer Cade McNamara now quarterbacking the attack, though nagging injuries could again hamper his mobility. The Cyclones will counter with freshman QB Rocco Becht, who had an efficient pick-free debut against Northern Iowa.\n\nWhy it could disappoint: Cue the \"take the under: jokes in 3… 2…. Oh, who are we kidding? They’re already out there, especially given that gambling issues stemming from a state-wide investigation have depleted both rosters. But personnel matters aside, both these teams are constructed to win a grind-it-out affair that may not provide many flashy plays. — Eddie Timanus\n\nUtah football score today: Utes survive Baylor\n\nJaylon Glover scored on an 11-yard run with 17 seconds left and Nate Johnson came off the bench in relief of an ineffective Bryson Barnes, leading No. 12 Utah to a comeback 20-13 win against Baylor.\n\nJohnson ran up the middle untouched from seven yards out to tie the score at 13 with two minutes remaining, capping an 8-minute, 15-play, 88-yard drive.\n\nBarnes got the start, subbing for an injured Cameron Rising and went 6-of-19 for 71 yards with an interception and was sacked twice. In the fourth quarter, Johnson completed six of his seven passes for 82 yards.\n\nBaylor got the ball back with 1:54 left but Sawyer Robertson, starting in place of an injured Blake Shapen, forced a pass over the middle which was intercepted by Cole Bishop, who returned it to the Baylor 29, which led to the winning score. The Bears got down to the 22-yard line on their final drive, but Robertson's pass fell incomplete in the end zone as time expired. — Scooby Axson\n\nColorado score today: Shedeur Sanders does dad’s dance to celebrate TD\n\nLike father, like son.\n\nAfter rushing for a 6-yard touchdown to put Colorado up 36-7 over Nebraska, quarterback Shedeur Sanders took a page out of his dad’s playbook for his celebration. Shedeur Sanders hit Deion Sanders’ signature ‘Prime Time’ shuffle in the end zone.\n\nHe’s thrown for 393 yards, two touchdowns by air, one touchdown on the ground and no interceptions on the day. − Cydney Henderson\n\nGeorgia, top-ranked teams score blowout wins\n\nNo. 1 Georgia started off slow with no first-quarter points, but it responded with a dominant second quarter en route to an easy 45-3 win over Ball State.\n\nThe Bulldogs victory marked just one of several top-ranked teams putting up huge victories over smaller schools. No. 4 Ohio State’s offense looked better against FCS Youngstown State in a 45-7 win, and No. 7 Penn State dominated Delaware with a 63-7 thumping of the Fightin' Blue Hens.\n\nColorado score today: Buffaloes score after another Nebraska turnover\n\nNebraska hung on for as long as it could, but several miscues later and Colorado is starting to pull away from its rival.\n\nAfter Jeff Sims’ touchdown run cut the deficit to six, Colorado scored 16 unanswered points to put the game nearly out of reach with a 29-7 lead with under 11 minutes left in the game. Trailing 23-7, Nebraska was in need of a score and in Colorado territory, but a botched handoff resulted in a fumble, the fourth turnover of the game for the Cornhuskers.\n\nColorado then marched down the field and capped the drive with a trick-play touchdown for Tar'Varish Dawson. The two-point conversion wasn’t good, but the 22-point lead nearly wraps up another win for Coach Prime. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNotre Dame scores on first play after weather delay\n\nIt appears Notre Dame was ready to play.\n\nAfter a lengthy weather delay at NC State, Notre Dame returned to the field with the ball at the Wolfpack 20-yard line. Running back Audric Estime then took the first play back 80 yards to the house for the first touchdown of the game to give the Fighting Irish a 10-0 lead. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nJeff Sims' big run gets Nebraska on the board\n\nIt was a nightmare first half for Nebraska quarterback Jeff Sims, but things may be turning around thanks to a big run.\n\nOn Nebraska’s opening drive of the third quarter, Sims took a quarterback draw 57 yards down the sideline, untouched and into the endzone to give the Cornhuskers their first points of the day and second touchdown of the season. The touchdown cut the Colorado lead to 13-7. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nVirginia’s Mike Hollins scores TD 10 months after shooting\n\nThere might not be a more important touchdown scored during Week 2 than the one by Virginia senior running back Mike Hollins.\n\nHollins was one of two students hospitalized after a Nov. 13 campus shooting, when a former Virginia football player opened fire on a bus returning from a field trip. Three teammates – Devin Chandley, Lavel Davis Jr. and D’Sean Perry – were killed.\n\nHollins took a second-quarter handoff against James Madison for a 4-yard touchdown, his first trip to the end zone in nearly a year – Sept. 17, 2022 against Old Dominion.\n\nVirginia leads JMU 28-17 in the third quarter. — Casey Moore\n\nAlabama vs. Texas odds\n\nThe top college football betting apps favor No. 3 Alabama in its primetime matchup with 10th-ranked Texas. The Crimson Tide are 7.5-point favorites over the visiting Longhorns, according to the BetMGM college football odds.

I wanted to see it empty and then see the transformation. It's pretty much what we're doing.\" — Gabriela Carroll, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nOhio State score today: Buckeyes up big at half\n\nQuarterback Kyle McCord’s inconsistencies during Ohio State’s opener have been washed away, even if only for a week.\n\nMcCord completed 13-of-18 passes during the first half for 253 yards and three touchdowns, including two to Marvin Harrison Jr., as the Buckeyes go into halftime with a 28-7 lead against Youngstown State.\n\nThe Buckeyes have rolled up 339 total yards during the first half. Ohio State registered 380 total yards last week against Indiana. — Casey Moore\n\nNorth Carolina State football scoreboard struck by lightning\n\nDonors at North Carolina State can’t be happy with this one.\n\nThe program’s brand new scoreboard was struck by lightning and shorted out during the Wolfpack’s game against Notre Dame.\n\nFans were cleared at Carter-Finley Stadium with N.C. State trailing the Fighting Irish 3-0 early in the second quarter. — Casey Moore\n\nColorado shuts out Nebraska in first half\n\nColorado’s offense hasn’t been as explosive as it was last week, but its defense is creating all sorts of issues for Nebraska. The Buffaloes have a 13-0 lead at halftime.\n\nTen of the 13 Buffalo points were off turnovers, and they scored all of their points in the final 4:20 of the half. Shedeur Sanders is 14-of-21 with 134 yards and one touchdown, and head coach Deion Sanders said it's the defense keeping the Buffaloes up, forcing three turnovers in the first 30 minutes.\n\n“We wasn’t clicking on all cylinders,” Sanders told Fox Sports at halftime. “The defense has been holding up strong and I'm proud of that.”\n\nA fierce Big 12 rivalry that’s set to renew with Colorado re-joining the conference next year, Sanders has made it known the importance of this game, and he reminded fans before heading back into the locker room.\n\n“This game is personal,” he said. “This game is 13-0, we should be up a lot more.” — Jordan Mendoza\n\nUtah score today: Utes struggling in brutal Texas heat\n\nNo. 12 Utah, playing its second straight week without injured starting quarterback Cameron Rising, is struggling against unranked Baylor, and trails 10-3 at halftime.\n\nThe Bears lost last week against Texas State and are also playing without their top quarterback, Blake Shapen, who injured his knee in that game.\n\nIt was 95 degrees in Waco for the 11 a.m. kickoff with an expected high of 101 by the time the game ends.\n\nUtah’s first half drives ended in three punts, an interception and a Cole Becker 31-yard field goal.\n\nBaylor took a 10-3 lead on a short Sawyer Robertson touchdown run. Robertson threw for 126 yards in the first half, while Dominic Richardson paced the ground game with 67 yards. — Scooby Axson\n\nGeorgia gets insane interception as Bulldogs jump to big lead\n\nEverything is going right for Georgia in the second quarter, as the Bulldogs have built up a 31-0 lead at the half and got an interception you had to see to believe.\n\nDown 14-0, Ball State quarterback Kadin Semonza attempted a pass, but it deflected off a Cardinal player’s back foot, and went right into the hands of Chaz Chambliss for the pick. The Bulldogs put up all 31 first-half points in the second quarter. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nColorado score today: Buffaloes get in end zone after interception\n\nAnother Nebraska turnover, more Colorado points.\n\nColorado is making it a nightmare for Nebraska quarterback Jeff Sims. After a fumble gave the Buffaloes a 3-0 lead, Sims threw an interception, putting Colorado in another great field position. The Buffaloes wasted no time, as Shedeur Sanders found Tar'Varish Dawson on the very next play for a 30-yard touchdown. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nColorado score today: Buffaloes convert turnover into points for 3-0 lead\n\nColorado is on the board, thanks to another Nebraska fumble.\n\nThe Cornhuskers gave Colorado promising field position after Jeff Sims couldn’t hang onto the ball, the third fumble of the first half and second Nebraska has lost. Colorado got the ball at the 19-yard line and went three-and-out, but the field position helped as Jace Feely nailed a 31-yard field goal to give Colorado a 3-0 lead with a little more than four minutes before halftime. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nColorado score today: Missed field goal ends Nebraska’s promising drive\n\nThe bad luck continues for the Cornhuskers.\n\nAfter a scoreless 20 minutes, Nebraska went from its 9-yard line to Colorado territory. But things took a turn on a third down, as a man in motion got in the way of the snap and Nebraska was able to fall on it to keep the ball on fourth down. The quick turn of events continued with Tristan Alvano’s 45-yard field goal attempt hitting the right upright, keeping Nebraska and Colorado scoreless with under seven minutes left in the first half. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nTerrell Owens, Michael Irvin, Chauncey Billups among stars who show up for Deion's home debut\n\nSome high-profile former athletes made their way to Boulder, Colorado, to watch Deion Sanders coach in his home debut against Nebraska.\n\nA packed house was at Folsom Field for the 10 a.m. local kickoff.

Weather.\n\nThree games in the early window Saturday are in a weather delay, all still in the first half:\n\nVanderbilt 0, Wake Forest 0\n\nNotre Dame 3, NC State 0\n\nPurdue 7, Virginia Tech 0\n\n— Jordan Mendoza\n\nColorado score today: Offense slow in Boulder\n\nAfter last week’s shootout, Colorado is in a defensive battle with Nebraska in Coach Prime’s debut at Folsom Field.\n\nNebraska got into Colorado territory to start the game, but the drive was killed by a fumble. Colorado responded by getting into Nebraska territory, but penalties hurt the Buffaloes and they punted from the Nebraska 35-yard line. Both teams went 3-and-out on their next drives, and Nebraska will begin the second quarter with a punt.\n\nColorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders, son of Deion Sanders, is 6-for-9 with 40 yards and three carries for 18 yards in the opening frame. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nOhio State score today: Buckeyes break tie with another Marvin Harrison Jr. TD\n\nMarvin Harrison Jr. had just two catches for 18 yards against Indiana in Ohio State’s 23-3 win last week.\n\nIn the first quarter against Youngstown State, the junior wideout has four receptions for 122 yards and his first two touchdowns of the 2023 campaign.\n\nAfter Harrison’s first TD put Ohio State ahead 7-0, Youngstown State put together a 75-yard scoring drive -- highlighted by a 36-yard pass play on third-and-3 – that tied things up 7-7 at Ohio Stadium.\n\nOhio State followed with a three-and-out, but on its next possession Kyle McCord found Harrison in the end zone for a 39-yard TD.\n\nThe Buckeyes lead 14-7 after one quarter. — Casey Moore\n\nGeorgia gets on the board with punt return touchdown\n\nAfter a slow start on offense, it's the Georgia special teams getting the Bulldogs on the board.\n\nMekhi Mews took a Ball State punt and returned it 69 yards to the house, the first punt return for a touchdown for the Bulldogs in 14 years. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nGeorgia score today: Bulldogs off to sluggish start\n\nOne quarter down and Ball State is giving the defending champions all it can, preventing Georgia from getting on the scoreboard in a 0-0 tie.\n\nAfter a solid kick return to open the game, the Bulldogs offense got it to the Ball State 10-yard line, but Peyton Woodring hooked a 28-yard field goal left. The Cardinals got into Georgia territory on their opening drive, but were forced to punt. Their defense stood tall on the next drive and the Bulldogs had to punt, ending the first quarter. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nVirginia honors three football players killed in shooting\n\nVirginia honored three football players who were killed in November with a moment of silence before their home opener against James Madison at Scott Stadium in Charlottesville.\n\nDevin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr. and D’Sean Perry have their numbers painted in the end zone. Virginia will also wear helmet decals of the players' numbers (1, 15 and 41) and sport legacy patches. James Madison will also wear helmet decals in honor of the players\n\n“It’s difficult for me. Some days are harder than others, right, and same for those players and the staff,” Virginia head coach Tony Elliott said this week, via the Daily Progress. “I can’t imagine what it’s like for their families dealing with it. We have an opportunity as a community, as a football program, fan base to pay respect to the three young men, their families, and then also the other 125 guys that have chosen to stay the course, do what’s difficult, and show up every single day.” — Scooby Axson\n\nOhio State score today: Marvin Harrison Jr. catches 71-yard TD for 7-0 lead\n\nThe No. 4 Buckeyes struggled to get anything going on offense during their opener against Big Ten rival Indiana last week. But Ohio State quickly found a successful formula against Youngstown State.\n\nThrow the deep ball to star wideout Marvin Harrison Jr.\n\nOn the third play from scrimmage, quarterback Kyle McCord connected with Harrison along the left sideline for a 71-yard touchdown pass and an early 7-0 lead for the Buckeyes in their home opener at “The Shoe” this season. — Casey Moore\n\nDeion Sanders takes the field for home opener in Colorado\n\nBOULDER, Colorado – Just minutes before kickoff between Colorado and Nebraska, the sold-out crowd at Folsom Field witnessed arguably the most anticipated entrance in school history.\n\nFirst came Ralphie, Colorado’s live bison mascot, who dashed from her gate onto the field as the crowd roared.\n\nThen came Deion Sanders about a minute later, slowed by his troubled left leg but waving his arms to the crowd as he made his home debut as the Buffaloes new coach.\n\nThe Colorado fans roared. It’s been one week since their Buffs upset TCU in Texas 45-42. And now they face Nebraska, their old rival in a game that issued more than 800 media credentials, the most ever at CU and highest since 2001. It was also the most expensive ticket in CU football history, according to TickPick, an online ticket marketplace that listed prices at $385 and up Friday night.\n\nThe big reason for it is Sanders, whose win last week and flamboyant overhaul of the team have been the talk of the sports world recently after the Buffs finished last year 1-11 under a different coaching staff. — Brent Schrotenboer\n\nCollege football picks Week 2\n\nThe names of elite schools in college football don't get much bigger than Alabama and Texas. The pair represents the upper-crust of programs have shaped a significant history of the sports. So when the Crimson Tide and Longhorns clash Saturday in Tuscaloosa, it's not surprising that most of the country will be on that game. Alabama needs a victory to help silence some of the doubters about the direction of the program. Texas needs a big win to establish credibility after almost 15 years out of the national title picture.\n\nHere are USA TODAY Sports’ expert picks for all of Saturday’s the ranked games.\n\nColorado QB Shedeur Sanders gets timely motivation from Tom Brady ahead of Nebraska game\n\nColorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders received a text message from a trusted mentor of his shortly after leading his team to a stunning 45-42 win Saturday at TCU.\n\nThe mentor was Tom Brady, the legendary former NFL quarterback.\n\nHis message was simple: “Don’t be satisfied.”\n\nRead Brent Schrotenboer’s full story here.\n\nWhy is Deion Sanders on TV so much?\n\nTV companies lined up to show Deion Sanders’ games for their intrigue and entertainment value with Sanders as a new head coach at the highest level of college football.\n\nThen advertisers lined up to buy ads during these games, betting it will get them a big audience for their brands at a cost of around $130,000 for 30 seconds if they bought the air time recently for his next game Saturday against Nebraska.\n\nBefore and after kickoff, the broadcasters themselves then focus on Sanders throughout the game, knowing he's the big reason viewers are tuning in.\n\nRead Brent Schrotenboer’s full story here.\n\nNo. 11 Notre Dame at North Carolina State predictions, picks, how to watch\n\nTime/TV: Saturday, noon ET, ABC\n\nWhy watch: Though the Fighting Irish had to go a long way for one of their two relatively easy wins, this true road game could serve as their first real test of the campaign. The Wolfpack handled a road opener against an improved Connecticut program and now looks to make an even bigger splash. The setting will be familiar for new Notre Dame QB Sam Hartman, who went 2-2 against the Wolfpack at Wake Forest but with neither win coming in Raleigh. N.C. State QB Brennan Armstrong has no history with the Fighting Irish, as he missed Virginia’s 28-3 loss to Notre Dame due to an injury in 2021.\n\nWhy it could disappoint: It probably won’t be a shootout. The Wolfpack defense, anchored by LB Payton Wilson, is stronger than any the new-look Irish offense has seen to date. But Notre Dame isn’t likely to surrender many big gainers either, so the intensity level should still be high in the fourth quarter. — Eddie Timanus\n\nUSA TODAY Sports staff picks:\n\nDan Wolken: Notre Dame\n\nNotre Dame Eddie Timanus: Notre Dame\n\nNotre Dame Erick Smith: Notre Dame\n\nNotre Dame Jace Evans: Notre Dame\n\nNotre Dame Paul Myerberg: Notre Dame\n\nNotre Dame Scooby Axson: Notre Dame\n\nNebraska at No. 25 Colorado predictions, picks, how to watch\n\nTime/TV: Saturday, noon ET, Fox\n\nWhy watch: Colorado games have suddenly become appointment viewing after the Buffaloes made the biggest splash of opening weekend. They’ll now look to follow their takedown of TCU in their first home game of the Deion Sanders era against old Big Eight rival Nebraska. The Cornhuskers are also under new management with Matt Rhule back in the college game. But his debut outing at Minnesota produced another late collapse to which NU fans have grown all too accustomed. The promising development for the Cornhuskers was the overall performance of the defense, but Colorado QB Shedeur Sanders and his array of fast targets will bring a bit more fire power. Nebraska QB Jeff Sims is well aware he must take better care of the ball.\n\nWhy it could disappoint: Colorado’s overall team speed would make the Buffaloes a much stronger comeback candidate should they somehow fall behind. An early Cornhuskers’ deficit would seem more difficult to overcome given Nebraska’s unproven ability to put up fast points.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports staff picks:\n\nDan Wolken: Nebraska\n\nNebraska Eddie Timanus: Colorado\n\nColorado Erick Smith: Colorado\n\nColorado Jace Evans: Colorado\n\nColorado Paul Myerberg: Nebraska\n\nNebraska Scooby Axson: Colorado\n\nTexas vs. Alabama predictions\n\nHere’s who our staff is predicting will win this No. 3 vs. No. 10 matchup:\n\nDan Wolken: Alabama\n\nAlabama Eddie Timanus: Alabama\n\nAlabama Erick Smith: Alabama\n\nAlabama Jace Evans: Alabama\n\nAlabama Paul Myerberg: Alabama\n\nAlabama Scooby Axson: Texas\n\nCollege football Week 2 bold predictions\n\nDisappointments and better-than-expected performances are anticipated each weekend in the wild world of college football.

It's been difficult to follow all the moving pieces during past weeks and months.\n\nWe knew last summer that more lucrative TV deals would soon lure UCLA and Southern California to the Big Ten for the 2024 season. Likewise, Texas and Oklahoma announced plans to move to the SEC. But little did we know how many other programs also would soon be moving.\n\nWhat's transpired in the Pac-12, Big 12 and Big Ten in the recent weeks has grabbed most of the college realignment headlines, but big changes are coming to both the Power Five and the Group of Five by this time next year. This season, the Big 12 will welcome three teams from the American Athletic Conference: Central Florida, Cincinnati and Houston.\n\nIn the past four decades, teams moved, conferences grew and a few collapsed. That doesn't sound much different than today's situation – other than the rapid pace at which these changes are unfolding. Here’s everything you need to know. — Jim Sergent\n\nWhere is 'College GameDay' in Week 2?\n\nESPN’s “College GameDay” crew is in Tuscaloosa for a battle between football superpowers No. 3 Alabama and No. 10 Texas on Saturday.

And the UD offense, while returning more personnel, is transitioning to new schemes and was throwing the football with a stiff wind.\n\nBut the defense, dressed in white, was up to the task while scoring a 52-41 win in a game that awards points for various accomplishments.\n\n“The score really should be even skewed more in the favor of our defense,” said Danny Rocco, heading into his third season as Delaware coach.\n\n“I thought the defense really played well. Our offense really did not show a whole lot out here today. So that’s a little disappointing. I think through most of the practices, it hasn’t really been that way here this spring.’’\n\nOnly one touchdown was scored, on Pat Kehoe’s 60-yard pass to Thyrick Pitts during 7-on-7.\n\nThere were three interceptions in the game, by cornerbacks Nijuel Hill and Amonte Strothers in 7-on-7 and safety Kedrick Whitehead, the Middletown High grad, during full 11-on-11.\n\n“Obviously, today we didn’t perform the way that we wanted to,” said Kehoe, the returning starter. “We’ve done a lot of good things this spring that we wanted to showcase out here today and unfortunately we weren’t able to. A lot of self-inflicted wounds.\n\n“But I’m still happy with the progress that we made, and I’m excited with where we’re going into the summer. We talked about today was the first time in 15 practices we didn’t score in the team period.”\n\nDelaware has a new offensive coordinator in Jared Ambrose, who left Colonial Athletic Association rival Towson and has installed what Rocco termed a “more diverse’’ attack that includes some no-huddle.\n\nFour Delaware quarterbacks did throw 64 passes Saturday.\n\nKehoe was 12-for-20 for 140 yards with the TD and one interception. Backup Nolan Henderson, the Smyrna High grad, was 10-for-22 for 93 yards and two interceptions and also ran for 17 yards.\n\n“I really feel the position remains in competition,” Rocco said.\n\nPitts’ three catches covered 72 yards. Gene Coleman II had five catches for 41 yards.\n\n“I don’t think it was indicative of what we’ve done during spring practice,” Rocco said of the offense.\n\nAndre Robinson’s five carries for 23 yards led rushers. Last summer’s transfer from Penn State was named the spring’s Most Improved player on offense.\n\nFreshman Drew Nickles was named Most Improved on defense. The versatile Nickles, who has been moved from outside to inside linebacker, had a game-high six tackles.\n\nDelaware also named four captains – Kehoe, a captain last season, along with offensive lineman Mario Farinella; defensive lineman Cam Kitchen, who has missed spring practice because of injury; and Hill, who lost his starting spot midway through last year.\n\n“We just want to come out and prove a point this year,” Hill said of the defense’s effort Saturday.\n\nThe Blue Hens are rebuilding after having more than 25 seniors on last year’s team that went 7-5 and ended Delaware’s record seven-year NCAA postseason drought by making the FCS playoffs. Delaware lost a first-round game at CAA rival James Madison.\n\nThe makeover is especially impactful on defense, which must replace eight starters, including seven in the linebacker and secondary corps. With its experience up front, Delaware will likely play more 4-3 and less 3-4 alignments this season than the past two years, as it showed Saturday.\n\n“I think this is gonna be a great defense because the path is set for us already,” Hill said, referring to players such as safety Nasir Adderley, likely to be a high NFL draft pick this week, and linebacker Troy Reeder, also expected to get an NFL shot.\n\nThe Blue Hens will return to the practice field Aug. 1 to begin earnest preparation for a 2019 season that commences Aug. 29 at home against Delaware State. The Colonial Athletic Association opener follows a week later at Rhode Island, which began its 2018 resurgence with a season-opening victory at Delaware.\n\nFCS programs are allowed to play 12 games this season because of the extra Saturday between Labor Day and Thanksgiving. Delaware will have a pair of severe nonconference challenges at home Sept. 14 against North Dakota State, winner of seven of the last eight FCS titles, followed two weeks later by a visit to FBS Pitt. CAA play resumes full tilt Oct. 12 at Elon.\n\n“We’ve got a lot of work to do as a unit and as a team,” Robinson said.\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

He landed at Penn State, where he redshirted as a true freshman and then saw reserve and special teams duty in 13 games in 2015.\n\nDespite being earmarked as a potential key part of Penn State’s rotation up front, Beh did not appear in any games early last season before being suspended from the team for unspecified reasons in October, though he was permitted to continue practicing.\n\n“A lot of stuff went into the decision [to transfer],” Beh said. “A lot of help from my family, my high school coach and people close to me. It definitely helps that Troy Reeder was one of my best friends, he was my roommate for two years. Being really close to him, that definitely helped. We talked every day.”\n\nReeder, the Salesianum School graduate, was a starting linebacker as a redshirt freshman at Penn State in 2015 before transferring to Delaware, where he was an All-CAA pick last year.\n\nBeh preferred not to discuss details of his Penn State experience and decision to move on, saying, “It’s just about moving forward and focusing on the future and what we’re doing here.\n\n“I think there’s a high ceiling. We have a lot of talent. More importantly, there’s a lot of ambition and we want to have a great offense. We really want it and now we’re in camp and it’s time to show it.”\n\nRocco, who called Beh a “hard-working, tough kid,” said he has all the attributes to succeed. Beh has two seasons of eligibility left.\n\n“It starts with that reality of having size, length and athleticism,” Rocco said. “He’s an athletic big guy so his numbers are going to validate his size but he’s not a slow-footed big guy.”\n\nHence, Delaware views Beh as someone who can play guard or tackle, which is valuable versatility.\n\n“He’s athletic enough to do both,” said Rocco, who added that Beh’s position could change daily or by series throughout preseason camp.\n\nHe was lining up with the No. 2 offense at right tackle in Friday’s first practice of preseason, in which center Brody Kern, guards Steve Robinson and Mario Farinella and tackles Jake Trump and Jethro Pepe were with the first unit. All have started before.\n\n“He fits right in with our crew,” Kern, the senior captain and fourth-year starting center, said of Beh. “He’s told me personally, ‘I’ve never come in somewhere and just clicked.’ We’ve been doing a lot more stuff together as an O-line so Noah came at the right time, fit right in and everybody got to know him quickly.\n\n“The good thing about Noah is he’s very quick, very light on his feet, very good pass blocker. He can move.”\n\nHis biggest move so far was to transfer to Delaware, where he has two years to help lead the Hens back to the FCS playoffs, from which they have had a painful six-year absence.\n\n“There’s a lot of great guys on this team,” he said. “That was easy to tell. They were very welcoming. It’s been easy to jell with them and get adjusted to everything.”\n\nHen scratch\n\nJunior Ryley Angeline, who caught six passes for 112 yards as a freshman but had no receptions in eight games last year, has been switched to running back, Rocco said . . .

But Kane’s second fumble with 3:58 left at the URI 42-yard line prevented the Hens from mounting a potential game-winning drive.\n\nThe Blue Hens also dropped a potential touchdown pass during a series on which they settled for a field goal.\n\nDelaware had pulled within 21-19 on Pat Kehoe’s 11-yard touchdown pass to Joe Walker with 6:45 to go that was initially ruled incomplete at the edge of the end zone. A video review gave Delaware the touchdown. However, Kehoe’s two-point pass to Jamie Jarmon was incomplete.\n\nKehoe was 12-for-22 passing for 202 yards and two TDs in his first start.\n\n“We’re not in a good spot,” Rocco said, mentioning how eight wins typically are needed to make the FCS playoffs. “I’m not gonna sit here and pretend we are. But we’re gonna get better and we’re excited to come back here and play [next] Saturday [against Lafayette].”\n\nDelaware outgained the Rams just 347-330 in total yards.\n\n“There’s certain stuff that we’ve done all camp and done really well that for some reason we went out there and didn’t do tonight,” senior inside linebacker Troy Reeder said. “We’ve talked several times about how good our defense can be and I think the motto we took from last year was, you can be really good, but it only takes one or two plays to lose games. Ultimately, that’s somewhat what it came down to.”\n\nThe second of two plays that broke the Blue Hens came with 39 seconds left in the third quarter. Rhode Island went up 21-13 after JaJuan Lawson's 57-yard TD pass to tight end Tyler Burke. Lawson was being chased out of bounds by Armen Ware when he lofted the football to Burke, who'd gotten free behind the UD secondary.\n\n“Defensively, we didn’t make a lot of big plays,” Rocco said. “We were not as dynamic as we’ve been. We were not as much of a ballhawk defense as we’ve been.”\n\nRhode Island’s first big play – and the Blue Hens’ initial major mistake – came when Justice Antrum scored the game’s first touchdown from two yards out after Delaware punter Nick Pritchard dropped and then failed to pick up or fall on the football after a high snap in the second quarter.\n\n“They just out executed us tonight,” Rocco said. “They made more key plays, more big plays.”\n\nRhode Island took a 14-10 lead with 6:27 left in the third quarter after Aaron Parker's 1-yard TD run that closed an 11-play, 69-yard drive featuring three third-down conversions.\n\nDelaware had driven to the URI 24 on its previous series before Kane fumbled.\n\nFrank Raggo’s 48-yard field goal with 3:35 to go in the third quarter cut the gap to 14-13. Tight end Owen Tyler had dropped a pass from Kehoe in the clear two plays earlier that may have have netted six points.\n\nEarlier the Blue Hens had tied it 7-7 after Kehoe threw the first touchdown pass of his college career, a 28-yard strike to tight end Charles Scarff, with 7:05 left in the second period. It closed an 80-yard series that needed just seven plays.\n\nRaggo’s 26-yard field goal gave Delaware its first lead with :35 left in the first half. Kane’s 47-yard gain on a screen pass helped put Delaware in position. Raggo earlier missed a 52-yard try.\n\n“It is a wake-up call,” Kehoe said. “We’ve got a long season ahead of us and we’ve gotta bounce back.”\n\nRhode Island 21, Delaware 19\n\nRhode Island 0 7 14 0 – 21\n\nDelaware 0 10 3 6 – 19\n\nSecond quarter\n\nRI – Antrum 2 fumble return (Carrick kick), 10:27\n\nD – Scarff 28 pass from Kehoe (Raggo kick), 7:05\n\nD – Raggo 26 FG, :35\n\nThird quarter\n\nRI – Parker 1 run (Carrick kick), 6:27\n\nD – Raggo 48 FG, 3:35\n\nRI – Burke 57 pass from Kawson (Carrick kick), :39\n\nFourth quarter\n\nD – Walker 11 pass from Kehoe (pass failed), 6:45\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

Kickoff will be just after 7:30 p.m.\n\nPenn State is a three-touchdown favorite when it unveils its recalibrated offense and super-charged defense to begin its expected College Football Playoff drive.\n\nHere are three things to watch for and a game prediction:\n\nDrew Allar raises expectations\n\nThough Penn State's sophomore quarterback is starting his first college game, he's been working in the system for more than 18 months now.\n\nIt should be a smooth takeoff. Drew Allar should get plenty of protection and help up front against an undermanned West Virginia defense. (It was dismal last year, ranking 117th or worst nationally in points allowed, passing yards per game and turnovers gained.)\n\nAllar should be able to comfortably scan and fire and work out early jitters and any kinks.\n\nHis numbers should look sterling, which probably won't be wholly indicative of his stature and introduction to a Big Ten schedule, at least not quite yet.\n\nBut the hype around the former 5-star recruit will take off anyway (Remember Christian Hackenberg, 2013?). How will he learn and grown from two warm-ups, including next week vs. Delaware?\n\nPenn State linebackers let loose\n\nThe Mountaineers shouldn't have much of a pass game to speak of early on. They lost their top receiving options from last season. Their new quarterback (Garrett Greene) looks to be a better runner than a downfield thrower. And they do have a deep stable of running backs.\n\nWhich all means there should be constant and focused action around scrimmage.\n\nNittany Lion spotlight:Best in the country? Why Penn State football's Chop Robinson will be 'a scary sight'\n\nPenn State's loaded linebacker group will be tasked with keeping that varied run game in check — their first shot at proving just how good/dominating they can be. New-and-improved Abdul Carter (up to 250 pounds), senior Curtis Jacobs and rookie Tony Rojas will be flying.\n\nTheir grades should be highly-determined by this: Filling run gaps as needed vs. overrunning and being out of position, allowing big gainers?\n\nIt will be a proving night, in particular, for Kobe King in the middle. He's reportedly leaner and faster and finding ballcarriers much more adeptly. He should pile up tackles.\n\nPenn State's precision level\n\nThis is the most highly anticipated Penn State team since 2017. It probably is its deepest, most talented roster in much longer.\n\nBut will it act like all of that?\n\nPSU concerns vs. West Virginia:3 unanswered Penn State football questions before season-opener\n\nWe'll get a taste for team unity and fundamentals Saturday, no matter the scoring margin. The Lions usually are sound at holding onto the football and even better at avoiding penalties.\n\nHow does that part of the operation look, especially when relying on needed second- and even third-stringers? It should provide insight into where the team truly stands when the outcomes begin to tighten in a couple of weeks.\n\nPenn State 41, West Virginia 12\n\nThe Lions will be fueled by the atmosphere, will start fast and simply have too much firepower, on both sides of the ball.\n\nWest Virginia can build around its offensive line and running game and promising pass-rushers on defense. But it isn't equipped to deal with Penn State's best at this point — the running back combo of Nick Singleton and Kaytron Allen and the wideout KeAndre Lambert-Smith on offense; those linebackers, edge rushers and do-everything cornerbacks on defense.\n\nThe measure of the night: Penn State's starters will be resting by the middle of the third quarter.\n\nFrank Bodani covers Penn State football for the York Daily Record and USA Today Network.

Dykhouse Stadium in chilly Brookings, South Dakota.\n\nThree third-quarter touchdowns provided additional emphasis.\n\nIt didn't help that Delaware quarterback Nolan Henderson, who set a school record for touchdown passes this season, did not return after injuring his left leg on a third-down run on the game's first possession. Brandon Ratcliffe's 27-yard field goal then gave Delaware an early 3-0 edge.\n\nZach Gwynn relieved him for one series and completed all three of his passes before red-shirt freshman Ryan O'Connor came on. O'Connor played the rest of the game and completed 10 of 21 passes for 104 yards.\n\nBut O'Connor took a hard hit resulting in an unnecessary roughness infraction with 1:07 left, resulting in a long delay as medical personnel tended to him and coaches from both teams joined the large group surrounding him. After he was carted off the field on a stretcher, coaches and game officials agreed to end the game there.\n\nO'Connor \"was responsive and moving all of his extremities upon leaving the field and is being examined further,\" Delaware football Twitter later reported.\n\nDelaware was outgained 353-192 in total yards. Leading UD rusher Kyron Cumby carried 10 times for 23 yards.\n\nGAME STATS: South Dakota State 42, Delaware 6\n\nIt was all painfully familiar.\n\nDelaware had lost 33-3 at South Dakota State in a 2021 FCS spring semifinal game that involved many of the same players who took part in the rematch. Delaware had also kicked a field goal to take an early lead in that game before things changed dramatically.\n\nNo. 1-ranked South Dakota State (11-1) has won 11 straight. The Missouri Valley Conference champions were playing their first game in three weeks after having a bye last week as the top seed in the 24-team tournament. They move on to face No. 8-seed Holy Cross, a 35-19 winner Saturday over CAA co-champ New Hampshire.\n\nNo. 23-ranked Delaware finished its winningest season in 12 years with an 8-5 record under first-year coach Ryan Carty, who was not available for postgame comment.\n\nDelaware long-snapper Jake Reed, the Caravel Academy graduate, had recovered a fumbled punt return to set up the Hens' initial field goal.\n\nLESSON LEARNED:Blue Hens must match Jackrabbits' physical brand of football in FCS rematch\n\nOn South Dakota State's second play, quarterback Mark Gronowski bolted up the middle for a 51-yard gain. Three plays later Isaiah Davis scored from the 1 as the Jackrabbits went up 7-3 with 4:55 left in the first quarter.\n\nThey were just as efficient and effective on their next two drives, going 75 yards on just six plays and 77 yards on eight snaps to take command 21-3 with 4:22 to go in the first half.\n\nEvery play on those first three South Dakota State possessions was a first or second down except the last, a third-and-1 keeper for a touchdown by Gronowski. Davis had run 10 yards for a touchdown to close the second series.\n\nRatcliffe had a 40-yard first-half miss before making a 39-yarder as Delaware went into halftime within 21-6 after forcing punts on South Dakota State's last two possessions of the second quarter. That gave the Hens some hope.\n\nBEST OF THE BLUE HENSRanking the top 100 University of Delaware male athletes of all time\n\nBut the hosts exerted their authority again in the third quarter, Amar Johnson' 2-yard TD run finishing a 58-yard drive to start the second half. The Jackrabbits quickly extended their lead to 42-6 before the quarter ended when they recovered an errant snap on a Delaware punt for a touchdown and on Gronowski's 4-yard strike to Jaxon Janke for his first TD pass.\n\nGronowski finished 11-for-15 for 131 yards passing and ran for 73 yards. Davis had 104 yards on 14 carries.\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

Capano Jr., one of Capano’s younger brothers, meets FBI agents at a truck stop and tells of being asked by Louis Capano on July 1 to have a half-filled trash bin emptied from a Concord Pike construction site. Investigators learn that early in the month, Capano’s youngest brother, Gerard J. Capano, sold a fishing boat without an anchor.\n\nSteve Wright, a clerk at the Getty service station on Lovering Avenue in Wilmington, tells the FBI the store closes at 9:30 p.m., casting doubt on Thomas’ claim that he stopped there about 10 p.m. on June 27 after dropping Fahey off at home. Agents discover that Capano used his credit card at Happy Harry’s in Trolley Square in Wilmington on June 30. A store manager tells agents a man resembling Capano inquired about blood remover that day.\n\nThe FBI learns Capano surprised his estranged wife, Kathleen, by borrowing her Chevrolet Suburban at 7 a.m. June 28.\n\nSEX, LIES & MURDER 20 years after Capano arrest, juror breaks silence THURSDAY DEFENSE: 'I wanted to withdraw from the case' PROSECUTOR: 'Tom Capano tried to hire a hit man to kill me' FRIDAY JUROR: 'He picked the wrong person, that's for sure' JOURNALIST: 'This Tom, Tom Capano' THIS WEEKEND JUDGE: Capano tried to assume control of the trial CHEF: The restaurant that hosted lawyers, witnesses and the Capanos PSYCHIATRIST: The last to see Anne Marie Fahey AND Video interviews, audio files and front pages of the papers during trial coverage all available at DelawareOnline.com\n\nJuly 29: Fahey’s psychologist, Michelle Sullivan, tells police Fahey was frightened of Capano and doubts she would have gone to his home willingly.

Connolly, find two spots of Fahey’s blood during an 11-hour search of Capano’s home, Jeep and his wife’s Suburban. The FBI labels the case a federal kidnapping probe.\n\nAug. 5: Connolly sends Capano’s attorney’s a “target” letter, notification he is under investigation by a federal grand jury.\n\nAug. 12-16: Police and FBI agents comb through trash and construction debris at two local landfills — where debris from Louis Capano’s Concord Pike trash bin was taken — searching for a rug, sofa and other evidence but come up empty.\n\nAug. 23: Thomas Capano is forced to give blood and hair samples for a DNA test at Riverside Hospital in Wilmington.\n\nAug. 29: Six people, including Louis Capano, testify before the federal grand jury.\n\nNovember: Authorities seize Capano’s timeline for June 28 from his law partner’s office. The alibi says he was in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, with his brother Gerard.\n\n1997\n\nJan. 3: A probable-cause affidavit — used to search Capano’s home — is unsealed, revealing that the FBI suspects Capano killed Fahey in his home June 27 and disposed of evidence.\n\nSept. 4: The FBI charges in court papers that Capano asked someone to hurt a legal secretary who spurned his advances in the early 1980s, and agents seize email and voicemail from Capano’s offices.\n\nOct. 8: Federal investigators raid the home of Gerard Capano, seizing 2 grams of cocaine, marijuana and 21 weapons.

Lyons Jr., tells prosecutors he helped Thomas dump a body wrapped in an anchor off Stone Harbor on June 28, 1996. Gerard says the body was first tossed in a cooler that wouldn’t sink, even after he pierced it with a gunshot. The cooler was later tossed into the ocean, he says. Gerard also says he helped Thomas throw a blood-stained sofa in the trash bin at Louis Capano’s construction site on June 28, 1996. Gerard says Thomas resisted his pleas to surrender.\n\nNov. 10: Louis Capano, accompanied by his attorney, tells Connolly he saw a sofa in his trash bin on July 1, 1996, after Thomas told him a day earlier that he had put some of Fahey’s personal belongings there.

Louis says Thomas told him he threw away a gun a few days after Fahey vanished, but the weapon was never fired.\n\nMISTRESS COOPERATES:\n\nFeb. 4: FBI Special Agent Eric J. Alpert reveals that Deborah A. MacIntyre, longtime mistress of Thomas Capano, bought a .22-caliber Beretta pistol on May 15, 1996 — six weeks before Fahey vanished. Alpert says MacIntyre, who initially lied about her relationship with Capano and the gun, told the FBI she threw the gun away before Fahey disappeared and only told Capano about buying or disposing of the weapon. Prosecutors also unveil phone records, a bank machine photo and receipts for gasoline and a fishing cooler to show how they corroborate Gerard Capano’s story.\n\nFeb. 6: Lee denies Capano bail.\n\nTRIAL DATE SET:\n\nFeb. 10: Lee sets Oct. 6 trial date.\n\nFeb. 27: MacIntyre tells prosecutors she bought the pistol for Capano and gave it to him.

Instead, they want to silence them.\n\nThe date picked proves that recently convicted former House Speaker Larry Householder was not the only elected official with a thirst for power.\n\nDishonest lawmakers say Issue 1 is for the good of Ohioans, but they know full well that far fewer Ohioans will show up to vote in August than they would for an election held in May or November.\n\nThey want to catch voters while their guards are down — during the dog days of summer — to seize ultimate control. If the issue is so important, why are they putting it on the ballot in August when turnout will be low?\n\nIt is not lost on our board that approval of this \"special\" election came months after the hypocrites in our General Assembly voted to limit most August special elections because they cost too much and turnout is low.\n\nThey were right then; they are wrong now.\n\nWhat will Issue 1 actually do?\n\nIf approved by voters, majority rule would be chucked when it comes to citizen-led constitutional amendments. Sixty percent of voter approval would be required instead of a simple majority of 50% plus one.\n\nThose seeking to get proposed amendments on the ballot would have the yeoman's task of collecting signatures from at least 5% of voters from the last gubernatorial election in all 88 counties.\n\nRight now, the signatures must only be collected from 44 counties, which is not an easy task. The 10-day cure period to secure a citizen-initiated amendment on the ballot would also be dropped.\n\nCitizens can now use that time to collect more signatures if they did not have enough valid one's the first time.\n\nWhy are lawmakers pushing the issue now?\n\nIn one breath, lawmakers will say Issue 1 is about preventing outside special interest groups from campaigning to change Ohio's constitution, but the truth seeps like venom out of their power-hungry mouths.\n\nState Rep. Brian Stewart - one of the issue's chief proponents - and others have made it abundantly clear that the true goal is to snuff out efforts create fairer statehouse and congressional districts — and to defeat an ongoing effort to pass an abortion access amendment possibly on the November ballot.\n\nThose aren't the only reasons.\n\nIssue 1 is also about beating back any citizen attempt to get amendments for recreational marijuana, gun control, workers' rights, increased minimum wage, term limits and a host of other things the majority of people of the great state of Ohio may or may not want.\n\nYou may never have a fair chance to decide any of these issues if the disingenuous lawmakers who run this state get their ruthless way.\n\nLawmakers cannot be trusted.\n\nApproval of Issue 1 would take Ohio back in time.\n\nThe state had a supermajority requirement for amendments proposed by the General Assembly between 1851 to 1912. Back then, lawmakers ignored voter demands and Ohio's statehouse was among the most corrupt in the United States.\n\nReform stemmed from the 1912 Ohio Constitutional Convention where voter-initiated constitutional amendments were added, and the supermajority requirement was chucked. Voters approved the amendment by 57.5%.\n\nVoter approval of Issue 1 would give legislators who have already proven they are not trustworthy nearly ultimate power to dictate your life with little impunity.\n\nOne only has to look at Ohio's most recent redistricting fiasco for evidence of how untrustworthy and dishonest lawmakers can be when there are no real checks.\n\nSeventy one percent of Ohioans voted for a fairer process for drawing legislative districts in 2015. The GOP-control Ohio Redistricting Commission did not care and stomped on the will of the people.\n\nGerrymandering continues to guarantee the Statehouse will remain not only controlled but dominated by Republicans.\n\nThe shameful redistricting process led to two costly primaries — one in May for U.S. Senate, Congress and statewide offices and one in August for the state lawmakers. About 21% of Ohioans voted in May compared to less than 7% who voted in August.\n\nThe upcoming August election is expected to cost at least $20 million of taxpayer money.\n\nMore:In 'historic abuse of power,' Ohio lawmakers seek to steal your voice| Mike Curtin\n\nIn a guest column published by the Dispatch in April, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose pointed to former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder's disgraceful — and unrealized — scheme to weaken term limits as evidence of the \"vulnerability of Ohio’s founding document.\"\n\nHe implied that voters are unqualified to decide for themselves and need a supermajority vote for our own good. That is clearly not the case. The vast majority of citizen-initiated amendments are rejected.\n\nOnly about one-fourth of such amendments proposed since 1913 have been approved.\n\nRecent examples include legalizing casino gambling in 2009, banning indoor smoking at workplaces in 2006 and defining marriage as between one man and one woman in 2004.\n\nLaRose has one thing right.

Next door is a branch of Pregnancy Decision Health Center, a crisis pregnancy center that offers counseling and support for pregnant women – but also works to dissuade them from terminating their pregnancies and has been accused of promoting misinformation about abortion.\n\nOf the two neighboring organizations, only Planned Parenthood provides medical services such as Pap smears, birth control and STD treatments.\n\nBut the crisis pregnancy center is the one receiving money from the state government. Ohio has funneled nearly $14 million in taxpayer funds to the center and others like it over the last decade, according to government records – even as state leaders have cut funding that previously went to Planned Parenthood for programs such as breast and cervical cancer screenings.\n\nOhio isn’t alone. More than a dozen states devote some of their budget to funding crisis pregnancy centers, a CNN review found. About half of those states distribute federal money intended to help needy families to the centers.\n\nSome of the organizations that receive money have been accused of spreading abortion misinformation or using the funds to advocate anti-abortion causes instead of helping women.\n\n“Public dollars should go to promoting public health,” said Ashley Underwood, the director of Equity Forward, an abortion rights advocacy group. Crisis pregnancy centers, she said, “solely exist to deter people from getting abortion services.”\n\nAn exam room in the Planned Parenthood near the Ohio State University campus. Maddie McGarvey for CNN\n\nSince the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this summer, a wave of abortion restrictions has swept the country, leaving millions of women with easier access to crisis pregnancy centers than abortion care. Crisis pregnancy centers far outnumbered abortion clinics across the US even before the court’s ruling, and anti-abortion groups are now planning to expand.\n\nPregnancy center leaders and their state government allies say the organizations deserve taxpayer funds because they provide pregnant women with resources like free diapers and ultrasounds. But some of the centers also lie to women about the safety and potential risks of abortion, according to multiple studies, abortion rights activists, and women who have been to the centers.\n\nThat kind of deception isn’t typical in any other area of health care, said Dr. Amy Addante, an Illinois OB-GYN who performs abortions and has been a vocal critic of crisis pregnancy centers.\n\n“The purpose of these centers is to try to stop someone from having an abortion,” said Addante. “I cannot think of any other medical decision or any other aspect of health care where there is a group of individuals whose only intent is to stop you from receiving that health care.”\n\nAbortion divide runs between neighboring clinics\n\nBig open windows invite patients and passersby into the waiting room at the Pregnancy Decision Health Center (PDHC). With velvety green chairs, leafy plants, and a coffee station that greets visitors as they come in the door, the crisis pregnancy center could pass for an upscale dental office or spa.\n\nOutside, PDHC’s sign towers over the neighboring Planned Parenthood, literally casting a shadow over the clinic’s entrance. Inside, the contrast is even starker: Planned Parenthood’s waiting room looks run-down – old chairs crowd the small space, faded informational posters cover the walls, and daylight is blocked by signage on the windows and mirrored doors meant to protect patients’ privacy.\n\nMultiple times a week, patients looking for Planned Parenthood mistakenly walk through PDHC’s doors, according to a Planned Parenthood clinician, Jennifer, who asked CNN not to use her last name out of security concerns. Some patients have told Planned Parenthood that PDHC employees told them abortion wasn’t safe or said PDHC tried to delay them and make them late for their Planned Parenthood appointments.\n\nLillian Williams is the vice president of health services of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio. Maddie McGarvey for CNN\n\n“They’ve provided an array of misinformation, whether it’s about abortion care or even about contraceptive services,” said Lillian Williams, the vice president of health services of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio.\n\nAyla Krueger, a 23-year-old Columbus resident, visited PDHC earlier this month with a friend who was seeking an STD test. She said that during their hour-and-a-half visit, an employee claimed that condoms were only 50% effective, the spread of STDs could only be prevented if people followed “God’s plan” of avoiding sex before marriage, and that if a woman who has an STD gets an abortion, “your STDs travel up your cervix into your organs and could kill you.”\n\n“I was dumbfounded,” Krueger said of the encounter. “My heart was breaking, thinking about girls who don’t understand what they’re walking into there… and possibly getting coerced.”\n\nExperts said that the center’s rhetoric was not medically accurate. “We do worry about ascending infections in abortions and pregnancy, but the risk is really, really low,” said Dr. Jonas Swartz, an OB-GYN and professor at Duke University Medical Center. “Crisis pregnancy centers regularly overstate the risk of abortions and this is just one example of that.”\n\nThe center also offers “abortion pill reversal,” according to its website, annual reports and pamphlets at the office. Abortion reversal is a medically dubious, unproven treatment that purports to undo a medication abortion but has been denounced by medical groups and found to be dangerous by researchers. A clinical trial that attempted to study abortion reversal was halted prematurely in 2019 when several participants suffered hemorrhaging.\n\nKathy Scanlon, PDHC’s president, declined an interview request and didn’t respond to CNN’s questions about Krueger’s allegations or abortion pill reversal.\n\n“Every woman deserves care and compassion when facing an unexpected pregnancy,” Scanlon wrote in an email, adding that the center provides “practical pregnancy care and support ranging from free pregnancy tests and ultrasounds to parenting education classes and much-needed baby items” such as diapers and car seats.\n\nAnti-abortion signs sit on a table during the Ohio March for Life in Columbus. Maddie McGarvey for CNN\n\nResearch has found that crisis pregnancy centers commonly disseminate misinformation. A study released last year by The Alliance, an abortion rights advocacy group, found that almost two-thirds of crisis pregnancy centers in nine states promoted false or biased information about abortion on their websites. That included false claims that abortions increased the risk of cancer or infertility. More than a third of clinics also advertised that they offered abortion pill reversal – and state-funded clinics were more likely than privately-funded ones to offer the unproven procedure and less likely to offer prenatal care, according to the study.\n\nSimilarly, a 2012 academic study of crisis pregnancy centers in North Carolina found that 86% of centers promoted false or misleading medical information on their websites.\n\nCrisis pregnancy center leaders say they are working to help women. Peggy Hartshorn, who founded the Columbus center and is now the chair of Heartbeat International, one of the largest global networks of crisis pregnancy centers, said the allegations that the groups spread misinformation are “a false narrative.”\n\nShe said that the information her centers provide to clients is “very well-researched, medically referenced – we document everything with multiple sources.”\n\n“Deep down in their hearts, women do not want to have abortion,” Hartshorn said. “Pregnancy centers are good for America, they really are.”\n\nIn Ohio, a new six-week abortion ban that went into effect after the Supreme Court decision, is currently on hold amid court battles. The Planned Parenthood clinic near Ohio State University doesn’t perform abortions – it refers patients to a Planned Parenthood surgical center on the other side of town that does.\n\nThe waiting room in the Planned Parenthood near campus. Maddie McGarvey for CNN\n\nThat facility, too, has a state-funded crisis pregnancy center operating across the street. On a recent afternoon, a handful of protesters lined the clinic’s fence with signs depicting bloody fetuses and shouted “you are already a mother” and “abortion is murder” whenever a patient came within earshot. One protester – wearing a reflective vest and holding a clipboard, similar to Planned Parenthood volunteers – tried to direct patients away from the abortion clinic and to the crisis pregnancy center across the street. The center told CNN the protesters weren’t affiliated with their organization.\n\nIt’s not rare for pregnancy centers to operate near abortion clinics. More than 100 pregnancy centers around the country are located within 200 meters of an abortion clinic or Planned Parenthood location, according to a CNN analysis. Some – in states like Delaware, Indiana and Michigan – are next door to clinics.\n\nAbortion rights advocates say the intention is to mislead women and block them from accessing abortion.\n\n“The purpose of co-locating near a legitimate provider is to intercept someone seeking legitimate health care and divert them into walking through their doors instead,” said Tara Murtha, the co-author of a report about pregnancy centers and a spokesperson for the Women’s Law Project. “It’s basically an obstacle course and a systemic barrier to abortion care.”\n\nAnti-abortion centers raking in taxpayer funds\n\nDespite the groups’ apparent spreading of misinformation, at least 18 states have funded crisis pregnancy centers with taxpayer money, according to a CNN review of government records and statements from state agencies. The largest is Texas, which has sent more than $200 million to the groups over the last decade.\n\nMore than a half-dozen states bankroll crisis pregnancy centers at least partly with funds from Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), a federal welfare program. Those federal funds are sent to states as a block grant, which gives state officials wide latitude in how to spend it, including on programs like “alternatives to abortion” grants for crisis pregnancy centers.\n\nResearch has shown that a smaller percentage of poor families are now receiving cash assistance from the TANF program than in previous decades.\n\nWhile about 68% of families with children in poverty received cash assistance through TANF in 1996, when the program was created, that percentage declined to just 21% by 2020, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank. The percentage was even lower in some of the GOP-dominated states that use TANF funding to support crisis pregnancy centers, such as Texas and Louisiana.\n\n“When you look at successes in reducing poverty by strengthening the safety net, cash assistance is the most effective way to help families,” said Aditi Shrivastava, who co-authored the study. “We are seeing states spend less of their money directly on cash assistance, and we don’t think that is what the program should be doing.”\n\nIn the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, some states are piloting new efforts to fund crisis pregnancy centers. Lawmakers in Arkansas and Iowa approved state funding for such groups for the first time this year.\n\nThe states have argued that crisis pregnancy centers deserve taxpayer funding because they provide services to pregnant women in need.\n\n“If we are going to be the most pro-life state in the union, we have to be prepared when those mothers come to a facility and they need help,” Arkansas state Rep. Robin Lundstrum said at a legislative hearing about the state’s new program earlier this year.\n\nIn Columbus, Pregnancy Decision Health Center is receiving more than $528,000 from the state government in the current fiscal year, according to government records. All of that comes from federal TANF funds. The funding amounts for about a fourth of the center’s total revenue, while the rest comes from private donations, according to the group’s most recent tax records available.\n\nPeople participate in the Ohio March for Life. Maddie McGarvey for CNN\n\nDespite the large amounts of money, there’s little oversight of how the taxpayer dollars are being used.\n\nMany of the appropriations are written into spending bills passed by GOP-dominated state legislatures. Pennsylvania, for example, has sent more than $70 million over the last decade to crisis pregnancy centers through Real Alternatives, an anti-abortion group that distributes state funding to crisis pregnancy centers.\n\nA 2017 report by the state auditor general found that Real Alternatives used hundreds of thousands of dollars of the money it received from Pennsylvania “to fund its activities in other states,” in what the auditor said was an example of the group “siphoning funds intended to benefit Pennsylvania women.” Real Alternatives denied the allegations in a statement, saying that they had “no basis in fact or law.”\n\nMichigan, which had contracted with Real Alternatives to distribute funding for crisis pregnancy centers, canceled its contract after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vetoed the funding for it in 2019. In a letter about the veto, Whitmer thanked a watchdog group that had issued a report accusing the organization of only helping a fraction of the pregnant women it had agreed to support.\n\nReal Alternatives, which also receives TANF money from Indiana, said the Michigan report was “riddled with inaccuracies, distortions, half-truths and defamatory statements.”\n\nA bill in the Ohio legislature that would have required crisis pregnancy centers receiving state funding to provide their clients with only medically accurate information died in committee in multiple recent legislative sessions. The state’s GOP legislative leaders did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the same red states that have bankrolled crisis pregnancy centers have stripped funding from Planned Parenthood. In Ohio, for example, the group never received state funding for abortions, but for years it received money for other services like cancer screenings, STD prevention and treatment, and sex education for teens.\n\nIn 2016, however, Ohio lawmakers banned the state from funding any organization that performs abortions, and the law went into effect after it was upheld by a federal appeals court in 2019. That meant that Planned Parenthood affiliates in Ohio lost about $600,000 a year in state funding, and led to the cancellation of some of their non-abortion health programs.\n\nWhile Planned Parenthood does receive some additional reimbursements through Ohio’s Medicaid program for providing non-abortion health care to people on Medicaid plans, it no longer receives state grants.\n\nPlanned Parenthood also lost additional federal funding under Title X, a program that funds birth control and reproductive health services, under a Trump administration rule. But the organization started receiving that money again this year after the Biden administration reversed the rule.\n\nMaria Gallo, a sexual and reproductive health epidemiologist at Ohio State University, said that state funding for crisis pregnancy centers shows how conservative lawmakers prioritize anti-abortion rhetoric over medical care for women.\n\n“It’s dangerous in part because they are legitimizing (crisis pregnancy centers),” Gallo said. “They are legitimizing that as a source of medical care when they’re not licensed medical facilities.”\n\nCrisis centers outnumber abortion clinics\n\nCrisis pregnancy centers drastically outnumber abortion clinics in the United States. There were 790 abortion clinics operating in 2021, compared with about 2,600 crisis pregnancy centers, according to a database compiled by Reproaction, an abortion-rights group.\n\nThat disparity is only likely to grow in the wake of the Supreme Court decision. Hartshorn, the chair of Heartbeat International, said the organization has created an online training program to help people open new pregnancy centers, especially in places without existing ones.\n\n“We need more people, we need more places, and we need more paths to pregnancy health,” Hartshorn said.\n\nThank you notes are displayed in the Planned Parenthood in Columbus. Maddie McGarvey for CNN\n\nA study by the National Center for Responsive Philanthropy found that the groups have taken in more and more money in recent years: They received over $1 billion in revenue in 2019, the most recent year data was available, compared to about $771 million in 2015.\n\nSeveral women who went to state-funded crisis pregnancy centers told CNN they felt misled and manipulated by the groups, and disturbed that they were getting taxpayer money.\n\nLast year, a woman who asked to be identified by her middle name, Eve, had just lost her job when she suspected she might be pregnant. She and her boyfriend went to Women’s Care Center in Columbus after finding the group on Google. Money was tight, and she chose the center – which is receiving more than $700,000 from the state of Ohio in the current fiscal year – because it promised free pregnancy testing.\n\nEve’s test was positive, and she asked the staff about an abortion. She said they handed her a pamphlet that warned her the procedure could cause infertility – though abortion doesn’t typically affect a person’s ability to become pregnant in the future. For three hours, Eve said the staff pressured her to carry the pregnancy to term.\n\n“It became very clear that they were against abortion really quickly,” said Eve, who left the center feeling upset and later got an abortion. The center didn’t respond to questions about Eve’s visit but said in an email they are “absolutely committed to accuracy, excellence and transparency in all we do.”\n\nOne day, Eve said she hopes to have kids. But at the time, she didn’t feel financially or emotionally stable enough to have a baby.\n\n“Nobody wants to make a decision to have an abortion,” Eve said. “And they made me feel really guilty and bad about it.”", "authors": ["Casey Tolan Majlie De Puy Kamp", "Casey Tolan", "Majlie De Puy Kamp"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/06/01/2024-presidential-election-candidates-republican-democratic/11641319002/", "title": "Who is running for president in 2024?

He lost his first wife Neilia Hunter and their one-year-old daughter Naomi in a 1972 car accident shortly after winning his first Senate race. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were injured in the crash but survived. In 2015, Biden lost Beau to brain cancer and has made it a major political goal to champion cancer research.\n\nHe remarried in 1977, tying the knot with now-First Lady Jill Biden. The two share a daughter, Ashley, and a large clan of grandchildren.\n\nBiden's son Hunter has been the subject of scandal in recent years and has written about his struggles with drug addiction. The GOP-led House has seized on Hunter's business dealings, hosting hearings to investigate his finances and the potential influence he has on his father.\n\nPrevious political experience: Joe Biden is a veteran of the Senate. First elected in 1972, he served as a senator from Delaware for 36 years before being elected as vice president on the Obama ticket in 2008.\n\nAfter serving two terms as vice president, Biden took a brief hiatus from government work before returning to run, and win, in 2020.\n\nHis views: Biden's campaign is focused on the \"battle for the soul of America,\" doubling down on the central message of his campaign four years ago. He said the question facing the nation is \"whether, in the years ahead, we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer.\"\n\nMore on Biden's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nLatest Joe Biden news: Explore\n\nExplore Will attacks against Hunter hurt Biden in 2024?

He is the son of Robert F. Kennedy, the former attorney general who was assassinated during a 1968 presidential run, and the nephew of former president John F. Kennedy.\n\nKennedy has been married three times and has six children. He wed current wife Cheryl Hines in 2014. Hines is a television star best known for her role on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"\n\nPrevious political experience: Kennedy is an environmental lawyer known for trumpeting a debunked theory that vaccines can be linked to autism.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Kennedy opposed vaccine mandates, calling them an infringement on individual liberty and at times used the Holocaust as a historical comparison. In 2017, former President Trump invited Kennedy to head up a presidential commission on vaccine safety.\n\nHis views: He is campaigning on a platform of fighting for the \"liberties guaranteed by the Constitution,\" according to his campaign website.\n\nMore on Kennedy's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Democratic\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: Williamson was married once in the late 1970s to a Houston businessman whom she has not named. She has one daughter, India Emmanuelle, whose father has not been publicly identified.\n\nPrevious political experience: Williamson is a self-help author and spiritual leader who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020. Then she was largely drowned out by a crowded Democratic field, breaking through for a rare viral moment, but eventually written off as a non-traditional candidate whose views involved centering the \"politics of love\" and rejecting a “dark psychic force of collectivized hatred.”\n\nHer views: Williamson supports abortion rights, a single-payer health care system and reparations for descendants of formerly enslaved Americans. She has suggested creating a U.S. Department of Children and Youth to increase child advocacy, and a U.S. Department of Peace.\n\nMore on Williamson's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nRepublican party candidates for 2024\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 55\n\nFamily: Binkley met wife Ellie in college and the two share five children.\n\nPrevious political experience: Binkley is CEO, president, and co-founder of the mergers and acquisitions conglomerate Generational Equity Group. He is also a faith leader, having co-founded and serving as the pastor at Create Church in Richardson, Texas.\n\nThe 2024 run is Binkley's first foray into politics. He says he wants to stand out in a crowded field by prioritizing unity, and leaning on his faith and business experience.\n\nHis views: Binkley has said he hopes to prioritize balancing the budget, lowering health care costs, creating bipartisan immigration reform, and putting more community emphasis on education. Binkley is against abortion. Though he signed a highly restrictive bill in his own state, he had indicated he would not do the same nationally and it should be a local issue. Binkley advocates for American energy independence using an \"all of the above\" approach that encompasses both fossil fuels and new technologies.\n\nMore on Binkley's 2024 presidential candidacy:\n\nLatest Ryan Binkley news : Explore\n\n: Explore Who is Ryan Binkley?

He remarried in 2016, tying the knot with current wife Kathryn.\n\nPrevious political experience: Burgum comes from a business background, once serving as SVP of Microsoft and founding both a real estate and venture capital firm. He was elected governor of North Dakota in 2016 and reelected in 2020.\n\nBurgum’s candidacy is expected to focus more on economics than culture wars – a favored topic of frontrunners Trump and DeSantis.\n\nHis views: Burgum has emphasized economic issues, rather than hot-button cultural issues that have been a focal point for some other GOP candidates. He is a vocal supporter of the oil industry, and the U.S. role in exporting it to other nations, and has said he favors smaller government and lower taxes.\n\nMore on Burgum's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 60\n\nFamily: Christie met wife Mary Pat at the University of Delaware and the two wed in 1986. They share four children: Andrew, Sarah, Patrick and Bridget.\n\nPrevious political experience: Christie was appointed U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey in 2002 and served for six years. He was elected governor of New Jersey in 2010 and occupied the office until 2018.\n\nChristie has been a prominent figure in the GOP since he launched his first presidential campaign in 2012. He ran again unsuccessfully in 2016 and, despite prior criticism, ultimately endorsed Trump and later joined his campaign.\n\nHis views: Christie is anti-abortion, but does support some exceptions in the case of incest, rape, and danger to the mother. He is not for a federal ban, instead believing the issue should be left to the states. He has advocated for a more secure border to stem the flow of fentanyl into the country and is in support of U.S. aid for Ukraine.\n\nMore on Christie's 2024 presidential candidacy:\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 44\n\nFamily: The governor wed former television host Casey DeSantis in 2009 and the couple share two daughters Madison and Mamie and one son Mason.\n\nPrevious political experience: DeSantis serves as the 46th governor of Florida. His national profile grew during the pandemic when he spoke out publicly against mask mandates and pushed to keep many Florida businesses and schools open. Since then, he has captured national attention with controversial legislative measures on education and immigration.\n\nWhile in law school, DeSantis joined the U.S. Navy as a JAG officer, later deploying to Iraq for active duty. Prior to his run for governor, he served in the House of Representatives as a congressman for Florida's 6th district for three terms from 2013 to 2018.\n\nHe is widely viewed as Trump’s biggest threat in the Republican primary. Similar in politics but different in demeanor, DeSantis represents a younger, some say more predictable, alternative to the former president.\n\nHis views: DeSantis is campaigning on a hard-right agenda to make America look more like Florida. He is in favor of \"defending parental rights and eliminating CRT,\" and is anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment.\n\nMore on DeSantis' 2024 Presidential Candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: Elder has no children and has been married once. The couple divorced after two years and Elder was engaged again to Alexandra Datig from 2013 to 2015. Amid his candidacy for California governor, Datig went public with an allegation that Elder had once brandished a gun at her while high on marijuana.\n\nPrevious political experience: Elder is a lawyer and conservative talk show host who mounted a campaign against California governor Gavin Newsom in 2021's recall election. Though he lost, Elder received the highest number of votes of any candidate besides Newsom.\n\nElder announced his candidacy on Fox News' \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" tweeting afterward \"America is in decline, but this decline is not inevitable. We can enter a new American Golden Age, but we must choose a leader who can bring us there. That’s why I’m running for President.\"\n\nHis views: Elder backs school choice, including vouchers and charter schools. His platform also includes a vow to be tough on crime, to secure the border, and to \"contain China\" by asserting military dominance in the South China Sea and minimizing reliance on the country's manufacturing.\n\nMore on Elder's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 51\n\nFamily: Haley is one of four children born to Indian-American parents in Bamberg, South Carolina - a town she has described as divided by race.\n\nShe and her husband of 26 years, Michael, live still in South Carolina where they are raising two children Rena and Nalin.\n\nPrevious political experience: Haley started her political career in the South Carolina state legislature where she served for 6 years before mounting a successful campaign for the governor's office in 2010. She won reelection in 2014 and has bragged that she has \"never lost a race.\"\n\nIn 2016, former President Trump nominated Haley to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, a position she held for a year before unexpectedly stepping down in 2018. Haley has played up her role as a female candidate in what is expected to be a largely male primary field. \"May the best woman win,” she quipped in an interview with Fox News.\n\nHer views: Haley is anti-abortion and pro-Israel. She supports cracking down on illegal immigration and \"getting tough\" on China and Russia. She has supported Trump in the past but also criticized him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\nMore on Haley's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 45\n\nFamily: Hurd wed Lynlie Wallace, a fellow political operative, in 2022. The two first met in 2009.\n\nPrevious political experience: A former CIA officer, Hurd served three terms in Congress representing Texas in the House after first being elected in 2014.\n\nHis views: Hurd stands out from an increasingly crowded GOP field as a rare vocal critic of Trump. He joins the likes of Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson in publicly disavowing the former president and in his campaign launch video listed illegal immigration, inflation, crime, and homelessness as legislative priorities.\n\nMore on Hurd's 2024 presidential candidacy:\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 72\n\nFamily: Hutchinson has been married to wife Susan since 1973. The two share four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nPrevious political experience: Hutchinson has had a long career in Republican politics. He was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to serve Arkansas' 3rd district in 1997; he served until 2001 when he was appointed DEA administrator and later undersecretary for the Department of Homeland Security for the George W. Bush administration.\n\nWhile in the House, Hutchinson served as impeachment manager in the trial of former president (and fellow Arkansas native) Bill Clinton. After leaving Washington he was elected 46th Governor of Arkansas. He served for two terms, from 2015 to 2023.\n\nHis views: He supports lower taxes, a strong national defense, and opposes abortion. He has said the Biden administration \"stood on the sidelines\" in the face of crime and “turned its back on the American worker.\"\n\nMore on Hutchinson's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 75\n\nFamily: Johnson tied the knot with wife Diane in 2008, and the pair share three sons.\n\nPrevious political experience: A businessman trying his hand at politics, Johnson built his wealth with the launch of Perry Johnson Registrars Inc., a company that ensures auto, aerospace and other businesses are complying with industrial standards. In 2022, he threw his hat in the ring for the GOP nomination for Michigan governor before being disqualified because of invalid signatures.\n\nHis views: Johnson told a group of Iowa voters in July that he was \"pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, anti-woke and anti-China,\" − and \"if you don't like it, well, tough.\" His campaign's signature \"2 cents\" proposes cutting 2 cents off every dollar of federal discretionary spending.\n\nMore on Johnson's 2024 Presidential Candidacy\n\nLatest Perry Johnson news: Explore\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 63\n\nFamily: Pence wed wife Karen in 1985 and the two share three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey.\n\nPrevious political experience: Pence entered politics in 2000 when he won his local congressional seat. He went on to serve six terms in the House of Representatives before being sworn in as governor of Indiana in 2013.\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump chose Pence as his running mate, and he served one term as Vice President. The role thrust him into a precarious situation in 2021 when Trump sought to pressure him to throw out some of Biden's electoral votes to overturn the election.\n\nPence ultimately defied Trump and certified the results, infuriating MAGA voters and Trump himself. His candidacy will likely involve a difficult tightrope walk as he attempts to distance himself from the former president without alienating the base.\n\nHis views: Pence is a vocal opponent of abortion, and of what he sees as the nation's long-term debt problem. He favors cuts in government spending and lower taxes, and while he often touts his time as vice president and speaks well of the policies that came out of the Trump White House, he has begun to distance himself from his former running mate in terms of tone. He has also criticized Trump's actions during the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore on Pence's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 37\n\nFamily: Ramaswamy married Apoorva Tewari, a throat surgeon and assistant professor at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, in 2015. The pair have two sons together.\n\nPrevious political experience: Ramaswamy is framing himself as an outsider, an entrepreneur-turned-political-hopeful who will give the establishment a run for its money.\n\nHe is a former biotech investor who founded pharmaceutical research company Roivant Sciences in 2014. Ramaswamy left the company in 2020 amid clashes with colleagues over how to respond to the murder of George Floyd and the public outcry that followed. He now heads up Strive Asset Management.\n\nHe is the author of three books, including \"Woke Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam,\" which explores how American politics and capitalism have become increasingly intertwined.\n\nHis views: He has peddled ideas such as ending affirmative action and eliminating the Department of Education. His elevator pitch: He'll go farther than Trump ever did or could today.\n\nMore on Ramaswamy's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 57\n\nFamily: Scott is unmarried, with no children. He was raised by a single mother in North Charleston and has one brother.\n\nPrevious political experience: Scott first entered politics in 1995 during a special election for City Council in Charleston. His profile grew nationally when he suggested posting the 10 Commandments outside the council building, a proposal that was denied.\n\nScott served for two years in the state legislature before being elected in 2010 to the House of Representatives for South Carolina's 1st district. He served one term before being appointed to the Senate by then-governor Nikki Haley and becoming the first Black U.S. senator from the state.\n\nScott is pitching himself as a more hopeful alternative to Trump, drawing on Reagan-era ideals and centering a tone of optimism.\n\nHis views: Scott joined the Senate in 2013. He’s anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment. He says on his website that his “signature legislation,” Opportunity Zones, put $75 billion into “distressed communities” across the country.\n\nMore on Scott's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 76\n\nFamily: Trump is the son of real estate magnate Fred Trump. Born and bred in New York, he first made his name developing skyscrapers and casinos.\n\nTrump first married in 1977, wedding Czech-born model Ivana. The two were married for 13 years and share three children: Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric. In 1993 Trump married actress and model Marla Maples. The two had one daughter: Tiffany. Following his divorce from Maples, Trump tied the knot for a final time with model Melania, who is mother to his youngest child, Barron.\n\nTrump's family was uncharacteristically involved in his presidency. Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner played prominent roles in the administration, and both Don Jr. and Eric were often cited as close advisors.\n\nPrevious political experience: When Trump entered the race in 2016, he branded himself as a political outsider, a businessman separate from the establishment, ready to \"drain the swamp.\"\n\nPrior to 2016, he dabbled in politics, often sounding off on controversial issues like the birther movement meant to cast doubt on Barack Obama's citizenship and the guiltiness of the now-exonerated Central Park Five. However, he was still primarily known for real estate and his forays into reality television, famously starring in \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nIn 2016, Trump shocked pollsters by securing victory over Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. He served a full four-year term and was defeated by Biden in his reelection bid.\n\nHis views: The former president has centered much of his campaign on his purported “political persecution” by Democrats. He supports securing America’s borders, “reclaiming free speech,” and “dismantling the Deep State,” according to his campaign website. He has said he would consider pardoning participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which was inspired by his false claims of election fraud.\n\nMore on Trump's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nThird-party 2024 presidential candidates\n\nPolitical Party: Green Party\n\nThough West originally announced his candidacy under the People's Party, he later officially filed as a Green Party candidate.\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: West has been married five times and has two children.

He has taught at a number of Ivy League institutions and works now as a professor of philosophy at Union Theological Seminary.\n\nIn a video uploaded to Twitter, West announced his 2024 candidacy saying, \"I enter in the quest for truth, I enter in the quest for justice.\" As a third-party candidate, West alleged \"neither political party wants to tell the truth\" on various issues. His bid with the People's Party represents the first independent ticket to enter the race thus far.\n\nHis views: West is a proponent of Medicare for All, and removing oil and gas subsidies as well as drilling on public lands. Long a vocal opponent of militarism, West's campaign website lists \"end the wars\" as a key priority which would include disbanding NATO and banning nuclear weapons across the globe.\n\nMore on West's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nThese presidential candidates have ended their 2024 campaigns\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 45\n\nFamily: Suarez is the son of another prominent Florida politician: Xavier L.

Prior to that he was Miami City commissioner and served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors from 2022 to 2023.\n\nViews: Suarez has said he did not support Trump in either 2016 or 2020, instead using his ballot to write in the names of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and Former Vice President Mike Pence respectively.

And in 2024 that will likely leave control of the White House in the hands of a very small number of states that are themselves divided almost exactly in half between the parties – a list that looks even smaller after this month’s outcomes.\n\nStanley Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster, speaks for many strategists in both parties when he points to the enormous “continuity among the elections” since Donald Trump emerged as a national figure. “We’ve now gone through 2016, ’18, ‘20 and ‘22 – and all looked pretty much alike,” he says. “And it has locked in the coalitions.”\n\nLooking at the Electoral College, this year’s results offered more reason for optimism to Democrats than Republicans. Five states decided the last presidential race by flipping from Trump in 2016 to Joe Biden in 2020 – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Democrats have already won six of the eight Senate and governor races decided across them this month and could notch a seventh victory if Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock defeats Herschel Walker in a Georgia run-off in December.\n\n“Republicans can’t be happy that in the states they have to win, we won – and by not just a little bit,” says Simon Rosenberg, founder and president of NDN, a Democratic research and advocacy group, who was the most visible skeptic in either party of the “red wave” theory this year. “It’s very encouraging as we go into 2024 because we were able to stare them down and beat them … [even] with inflation being so high. And it wasn’t just their bad candidates – its far more than that.”\n\nStill, the results also showed Republicans tightening their grip on Ohio, Iowa and Florida: though Democrats won all three in both of Barack Obama’s presidential victories, each now appears securely in the GOP’s column for 2024 (and likely beyond). And the perennial liberal hope of putting a “blue Texas” in play clearly looks like it will be deferred again after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s double-digit victory against an energetic and well-funded opponent (former Rep. Beto O’Rourke) squashed the limited momentum Democrats had built there in the 2018 and 2020 elections. Republicans once again beat Democrats for all of Texas’ statewide offices, continuing a shutout that stretches back to the 1990s.\n\nThese offsetting and hardening partisan strengths could, once again, provide the power to decide the White House winner to a few hundred thousand voters in a very few closely balanced states. That’s a windfall for the owners of television stations who will be deluged with television advertising in states such as Nevada, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona. But it’s also another reason for the prodigious stress in our fraught modern politics. Each side in an intensely polarized nation of 330 million recognizes that the overall direction of national policy now pivots on the choices of a miniscule number of people living in the tiny patches of contested political ground – white-collar suburbs of Atlanta and Phoenix, working-class Latino neighborhoods in and around Las Vegas and the mid-sized communities of the so-called BOW counties in Wisconsin.\n\nThe partitioning of the nation into distinct and intractable partisan camps is one of the defining features of modern US politics. The Democratic and Republican presidential nominees have each carried 20 states in every election since at least 2008. That means 80% of the states have voted the same way in at least the past four presidential elections – a level of consistency unmatched through the 20th century. Even during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s four consecutive presidential victories from 1932 through 1944, only about two-thirds of the states voted the same way each time.\n\nThe 20 states that Democrats have carried in each presidential election since at least 2008 will award 232 Electoral College votes in 2024; the 20 states Republicans have carried in at least the past four elections will award 155.\n\nBut that tally offers a misleading picture of the parties’ real standing. Of the 10 states that have flipped between the parties in at least one presidential race since 2008, four have not voted for a Democratic presidential nominee since Obama and have clearly tilted red in the Trump era. Those four states – Ohio, Florida, Iowa and Indiana – add another 64 Electoral College votes to the GOP tally and raise the party’s total to 219. North Carolina, also one of the 10, isn’t as securely locked down. But the GOP still has to be favored to capture its 16 Electoral College votes again after Republican Rep. Ted Budd’s solid three-point victory in this month’s US Senate race exceeded the margin in Rep. Thom Tillis’ much narrower 2020 win.\n\nIn this month’s election, each side generally consolidated that dominance across its core 20 states. Democrats notched runaway gubernatorial victories in California and Illinois, recaptured governorships previously held by moderate Republicans in Maryland and Massachusetts and posted blowout 15-point victories in Colorado and Washington Senate races that Republicans touted as much more competitive.\n\nIn turn, Republican Govs. Ron DeSantis in Florida and Mike DeWine in Ohio won landslide victories in which their winning margins exceeded 1 million votes, while Abbott in Texas triumphed by over 700,000 votes. For all the controversy over restrictions or bans on abortion that proliferated across the red states after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer, the GOP did not lose control of a state legislative chamber in any of the states that acted.\n\nOn balance, Democrats showed more cracks than Republicans in their 20 fortress states. That may not be surprising, given that the first midterm election of a president’s term is almost always difficult for his party, especially when voters are as discontented over the economy as polls show them to be now. Democrats faced unexpectedly difficult contests for the governorship in New York and Oregon before toughing out narrow wins that probably represent a high-water mark for Republicans. In New Hampshire, another core 20 blue state that Republicans sometimes hope to target, Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan’s decisive victory was likely more indicative of its leaning in a presidential contest than the easy reelection for moderate GOP Gov. Chris Sununu.\n\nBut Nevada, another of the Democrats’ base states, showed clear signs of vulnerability for the party, with Republican Joe Lombardo narrowly winning the governorship and Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto surviving in the Senate race by less than 10,000 votes. Those outcomes confirmed the trend that Nevada, after moving sharply toward Democrats under Obama, again tipped back toward toss-up status in the Trump era. Yet it also showed that the vaunted Democratic turnout machine in the state retains the ability to win very close contests.\n\nDemocrats did not demonstrate the capacity to threaten any of the GOP’s core 20 states, as Republicans did in Nevada. But for Democrats that inability to dent the red citadel was offset by clear indications of continuing momentum in the five states that decided the 2020 race.\n\nIn Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer won by over 10 percentage points and nearly 500,000 votes over a Trump-backed opponent – bigger margins than she posted in 2018 even though about three-fourths of voters called the nation’s economy only fair or poor in the exit poll conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. In Pennsylvania, against Trump-backed GOP nominees, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Josh Shapiro romped to an even bigger victory, and Lt. Gov. John Fetterman won the US Senate race by a surprisingly comfortable five-point margin despite his visible struggles with a stroke. Fetterman’s roughly 225,000 vote margin of victory nearly tripled Biden’s 2020 advantage in the state.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the picture was only slightly more mixed for Democrats. Even amid intense economic discontent, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers won reelection by about 90,000 votes – roughly triple his margin in 2018 when he unseated Republican incumbent Scott Walker in a much better year for Democrats. (Biden in 2020 won the state by only about 20,000 votes.) And while Republican Sen. Ron Johnson won reelection, he survived by only a little over 25,000 votes against an opponent, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who Republicans (and even some Democrats) had considered much too liberal to viably contest the state.\n\nMichigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were the three Rustbelt states that Trump in 2016 dislodged from what I termed in 2009 “the blue wall” – the 18 states that had voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1992. But Biden recaptured all three of them, and this month’s results strongly encouraged Democrats hopes of holding them again in 2024, especially if inflation recedes and any possible recession passes through before then. The exit polls showed that solid majorities in each state supported abortion rights – and that preponderant majorities of those residents voted Democratic.\n\n“On the blue wall states, I came away feeling better about Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin,” says Greenberg.\n\nThe remaining two Sunbelt states that flipped between 2016 and 2020 seemed to move in opposite directions. Arizona continued to drift toward the Democrats – at least when presented with GOP nominees in the Trump mold. Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly won reelection over Republican Blake Masters by a resounding 125,000 votes – roughly double the margin in Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema’s breakthrough victory in 2018, and far more than Biden’s 10,457 vote edge in the state. And while Democrat Katie Hobbs only won the governor’s race by about 17,000 votes over Trump acolyte Kari Lake, that represented a huge advance from the Democrats’ nearly 340,000 vote loss in the 2018 gubernatorial contest.\n\nIn Georgia, by contrast, most results suggested a shift back toward the GOP. Gov. Brian Kemp’s roughly 300,000 vote margin over Democrat Stacey Abrams was nearly six times bigger than his 2018 victory over her. Republicans posted solid victories in all of the other major state contests as well. Only the US Senate race broke this pattern, with Warnock leading Walker in the initial results before next month’s run-off.\n\nGeorgia may offer the most revealing measure of the opportunities and obstacles for Republicans to reverse the Democratic advantage in the states that decided the presidency in 2020.\n\nIn the Senate balloting, Warnock crushed Walker, another Trump-backed nominee, in the populous Atlanta suburbs, including Cobb and Gwinnett counties. Despite unhappiness with the economy, Warnock essentially matched Biden in capturing nearly 60% of the vote in those two counties-which voted reliably Republican not long ago.\n\nThat was indicative of a larger pattern this month. Even without Trump on the ballot, Democratic Senate and governor candidates matched (or even exceeded) Biden’s 2020 vote share in white-collar largely suburban counties around the country that recoiled from the former president – a list that included Maricopa in Arizona, Montgomery and Delaware in Pennsylvania, Dane in Wisconsin, Arapahoe and Jefferson in Colorado, and Oakland and Kent counties in Michigan. Those populous counties provided Democrats huge margins; if they persist into 2024, it will be extremely difficult for Republicans to win those states. In suburban places like these, “if the Republican Party’s focus in the future is going to be enforcing loyalty to Donald Trump … then we’re done,” says Jason Cabel Roe, the former executive director of the Michigan GOP.\n\nBut Georgia also signals how Republicans might avoid that fate. Though Kemp lost Gwinnett and Cobb, he ran more competitively there than Walker. Kemp posted that relatively better showing even though he advanced a staunchly conservative social agenda that faced substantial resistance in such areas – including a ban on abortion after six weeks now blocked by a state judge – by stressing traditional Republican economic themes and demonstrating his independence from Trump in their battles over certifying the 2020 election.\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Tom Davis, who served as chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, says that while such suburban areas “are lost for the foreseeable future for Republicans,” the GOP “doesn’t need to win them, you just need to improve” to tip some of the states it has lost in the Trump era. He’s confident that if Republicans choose someone other than Trump, such as DeSantis or Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, the GOP can regain ground in these places, even if those candidates must adopt a conservative social agenda to win the nomination.\n\nDemocrats remain confident about their ability to defend these places, particularly against Trump, but also against other Republicans such as DeSantis echoing many of his culture war themes. Greenberg says the prerequisite to any such defense is Democrats defusing voter concerns about their positions on crime and the border by moving at least somewhat toward the center. But, he says, “if you deal with those issues, I don’t see anything about DeSantis … that is attractive on the whole set of issues that working people want to have addressed” around economic opportunity and corporate responsibility.\n\nHow big a map does this leave the two sides contesting in the 2024 presidential race? No GOP presidential candidate would entirely concede Michigan or Pennsylvania, but the magnitude of the 2022 Democratic wins there – extending the party’s recovery in 2018 and 2020 – show how difficult it will be for any Republican nominee to take them in 2024, especially if he or she supports further restrictions on legal abortion. (Under Trump, says Roe, Michigan has become “a wasteland” for Republicans.) The results even more emphatically extinguished the prospect of Democrats in two years seriously bidding for Ohio, Florida or Iowa.\n\nThat could leave as few as four genuine toss-ups in 2024: Wisconsin in the industrial Midwest, and Nevada, Georgia and Arizona across the Sunbelt. That list could shift slightly depending on circumstances and the candidates. Rosenberg, for instance, believes Democrats should now target North Carolina with the same intensive organizing efforts they mounted in the key battlegrounds this year. And Republicans may continue to push for Minnesota and New Hampshire. But all will be difficult to dislodge from their current allegiance.\n\nA race with just Wisconsin, Nevada, Georgia and Arizona as true battlegrounds would begin with Democrats favored in states holding 260 Electoral College votes (including Washington, DC) and Republicans in states with 235. Democrats would need to win just one of Wisconsin, Arizona or Georgia to reach an Electoral College majority – yet that last piece could prove very challenging for them to secure. After 2022, the list of genuinely competitive presidential states may be shrinking, but, if anything, that could increase the tension as the nation remains poised on the knife’s edge between two deeply entrenched, but increasingly antithetical, political coalitions.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/12/surprise-vacation-yard-sale-reprieve-teacher-sick-day-news-around-states/114862294/", "title": "Surprise vacation, yard sale reprieve, teacher sick day: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State health officials are urging people to serve up a heaping side of precaution at Thanksgiving, as the holiday comes amid a national surge in COVID-19 cases. Officials say people should skip large family gatherings in favor of scaled-back events. “We all want to see our family at holiday time, and yet this is a special year. This is a year unlike any we’ve ever had,” Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said. “Many things maybe could be done virtually, which is not nearly as much fun but certainly safer.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines. Suzanne Judd, an epidemiologist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s School of Public Health, said Thanksgiving is particularly problematic because it’s a holiday celebrated by family gatherings indoors. “Gatherings greater than 10 people pose a substantial risk of one of the people being COVID-positive and not knowing,” Judd said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The spread of the coronavirus at the state’s largest prison has accelerated beyond an initial outbreak, with 110 inmates testing positive for the virus as of Monday. Goose Creek Correctional Center first announced a virus outbreak at the facility Nov. 2, when the Alaska Department of Corrections said 22 inmates and five staff members tested positive, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The prison west of Wasilla near Point McKenzie housed 1,317 pretrial and sentenced prisoners as of Monday, department spokeswoman Sarah Gallagher said. Staff are required and inmates are strongly encouraged to wear masks, she said. The outbreak began in one of the prison’s housing units, known as mods. Each mod has 64 prisoners, indicating the outbreak has expanded beyond a single unit, Gallagher said. Each mod continues to operate as a “family unit” in order to minimize the risk of further transmission, Gallagher said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With the state reporting a daily average of 1,900 new COVID-19 cases over the past week, Gov. Doug Ducey has urged residents to be careful. In a video posted Tuesday, Ducey urged Arizona residents to wear face coverings, wash hands, practice social distancing and stay home when sick. “Gatherings of families and friends from outside your household are no safer than going to the grocery store,” he said. Ducey, a Republican, has not implemented a statewide masking requirement, while many local governments in the state have done so. He announced no new virus prevention initiatives in the video posted on social media and his office’s website. He cited past moves that included increasing testing and providing money to hospitals for protective gear, staffing and ventilators. Ducey said he wants to protect public health “keep our economy safely open and moving, We know that both are important to the health and well-being of Arizonans.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations again hit a new high Tuesday, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson resisted calls for new restrictions on businesses or gatherings to combat a surge in coronavirus cases. An outbreak of the virus among state legislators also grew to 11 on Tuesday, with a lawmaker testing positive. The Department of Health reported 24 more people were hospitalized because of COVID-19, bringing the state’s virus hospitalizations to a new high of 810. The state’s confirmed and probable virus cases rose by 1,424 to 124,235. “The numbers aren’t good, the trend is not good, and we have a lot of work to do here in Arkansas and across the nation,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news briefing on the virus. The state’s COVID-19 deaths rose by four to 2,112. The Republican governor said many of the state’s cases are coming from smaller gatherings at homes that he said can’t be regulated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city will study the feasibility of using its enormous convention center as a temporary shelter for the increasing number of homeless people living on the streets. City Councilman Curren Price introduced a motion Tuesday seeking a report on what it would take to transform the 720,000-square-foot LA Convention Center in his downtown district. The property has not been used for conventions since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, the pandemic has forced more people into homelessness, Price said. With more than 60,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, encampments have gone up throughout the region on sidewalks, in empty lots and under freeway overpasses. “We’re in a panic situation along with a pandemic situation. Folks on the streets are just suffering,” Price told the Los Angeles Times. “We have to do a better job of housing individuals who are homeless.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Department of Public Health and Environment has routinely deleted emails related to the coronavirus pandemic even though the state archives has asked that they be saved, a newspaper has found. The Denver Post reports it discovered that emails sent and received by state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy were deleted after the newspaper requested documents. The department said it would provide some records, including emails. But it said emails “from May would have already been auto-deleted unless otherwise preserved, or they were previously deleted by Dr. Herlihy as part of a normal business process,” said Monica Wilkerson, the department’s records and legal services liaison. As of last year, the department deleted most employee emails after 90 days. The policy mirrors similar practices by the state government. The Colorado State Archives posted a notice in June asking agencies to “keep all records related to COVID-19.” Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition Executive Director Jeff Roberts said it is important to keep records so that journalists can report on a crisis affecting the health and safety of residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Canaan: More than 350 students and 20 teachers in a wealthy suburb are in quarantine after a new round of coronavirus testing turned up 15 infections, according to the local school district. New Canaan schools on Tuesday reported 13 students and two teachers tested positive, days after all 540 tests of students came back negative, the Stamford Advocate reports. There were also 26 new positive tests last weekend, First Selectman Kevin Moynihan said. “We continue to see cases spread from gatherings, dinner parties, out-of-town caregivers, house cleaners and, not unexpectedly, within families,” Moynihan said. “This rapid case increase over the weekend illustrates how fast community transmission spreads and accelerates.” The most recent testing resulted in quarantines for 213 students at New Canaan High School, 70 at Saxe Middle School and 70 at three elementary schools. People in quarantine are told they must stay home for 14 days.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Attorneys for a cleric say they’ve reached a settlement with Gov. John Carney over the coronavirus restrictions he imposed on worship services. The Rev. Christopher Allan Bullock filed a lawsuit in May claiming Carney’s restrictions were unconstitutional and discriminatory. Carney then rescinded many of the restrictions, and his lawyers argued Bullock’s claims were moot. But Bullock’s attorneys asked for an injunction prohibiting the governor from imposing similar limitations in the future. Lawyers representing the New Castle County pastor and community activist said Wednesday that the settlement requires the governor to treat houses of worship in a neutral manner in any future emergency. Among other things, if certain businesses or activities are considered essential, that definition will include churches. Attorney Thomas Neuberger said the state also agreed to pay the plaintiffs $150,000 in lawyer fees and $7,200 in court costs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. reported 206 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday – its highest single-day total since late May, WUSA-TV reports. Daily test data lags behind and is only available up to Nov. 7, so it’s unclear what, if any, connection to the weekend’s celebrations these numbers may have. The city is now averaging more than 100 new cases a day for the first time since May 30.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than a dozen Miami nurses and front-line health care workers are finally getting a well-deserved break. The group was scheduled for an upcoming, mandatory – aka boring – 48-hour training but was instead surprised with an island vacation to the Florida Keys. Jackson Health System supervisors were asked to choose staff who went above and beyond during the pandemic. Many of the staff, including respiratory therapists and lab techs, have not been able to take any time off during the pandemic to relax or spend time with their loved ones and have been working tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients, the hospital said. The 50 workers were told they had to attend a two-day training, but when they gathered at the hospital Tuesday, they were handed gift boxes with gift certificates. Hawks Cay Resort in the Florida Keys donated two-night stays to its island on Duck Key, surrounded by sparkling waters and swaying palm trees, as part of its Heroes Salute program.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is again hitting a new peak in public high school graduation rates. The state Department of Education said Tuesday that 83.8% of seniors graduated on time in the spring. That’s the highest level recorded since Georgia began calculating according to current methods, which require a student to graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma, and rose from 82% in 2019. The state says part of the increase came from a waiver allowing the state to count students with significant cognitive disabilities, about 1% of students overall, as graduating on time even if they take more than four years to complete high school. Because of the pandemic, many high school students did not have to take end-of-course exams last year, which would have counted for 20% of their overall grade. Most students take the courses that require the exams before their senior year, so it’s unclear whether the lack of tests influenced Georgia’s graduation rates.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Bankruptcies declined in October for the eighth time in 10 months as state unemployment reached a national high of 15.1% and as tourism was in the beginning stage of reopening after a major economic downturn. There were 125 bankruptcy filings in October, a 22.6% decrease from the 162 during the same period in the previous year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Data provided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, showed bankruptcy filings were down 9.8% to 1,274 for the year through October compared to 1,412 during the same period in 2019. Chapter 7 liquidation filings, the most common type of bankruptcy, fell 19.8% in October to 93 from 116 in the year-earlier period. Chapter 13 filings, which allow people with regular income sources to establish installment payment plans to creditors over three to five years, dropped 27.3% to 32 from 44 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge dismissed a case against a woman who was cited for holding a yard sale authorities said violated the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order. Judge Van Valin on Friday dismissed the case brought by officials who said the yard sale was not an “essential business,” The Idaho Statesman reports. Valin ruled the yard sale conducted in April by Christa Thompson of Rathdrum was not a business. Defense attorney Edward Dindinger said in a statement that the judge ruled the language of the stay-at-home order issued in response to the coronavirus pandemic did not apply to Thompson. The Rathdrum Police Department said in April that the event was a “large nonessential yard sale” that filled the front yard and spilled into the back yard of her home. Thompson held the sale “to liquidate her late father-in-law’s estate,” Dindinger said. Thompson faced a possible sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state set another single-day record for coronavirus infections Tuesday, pushing the total number of people who have tested positive in the state since the pandemic began past 500,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker presented statistics to show that hospitalizations are nearing their spring peak, when the initial wave of infections had officials scrambling for hospital beds and professionals to tend them. State public health officials reported 12,623 newly confirmed cases of the virus, nearly 15% higher than the previous record set Saturday, when cases also topped 12,000. In Chicago, officials reported a daily average of 1,686 new cases, roughly four times higher than a month ago. “There are no signs of slowing,” Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said. Hospitalizations jumped 7.5% in one day to 4,742. The seven-day average of 4,207 in hospital beds is creeping toward the 4,822 average hit May 5.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is continuing its record-setting increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new infections, health officials said Tuesday as the state once again surpassed 4,000 new cases and reported 63 more deaths. The newly reported deaths raised Indiana’s pandemic death toll to 4,731, including confirmed and presumed coronavirus infections, the Indiana State Department of Health said in its daily statistics update. The 4,879 infections reported Tuesday were Indiana’s second-highest daily count of newly reported coronavirus cases and marked the sixth straight day the state reported more than 4,000 new cases. Indiana’s seven-day rolling average for newly confirmed cases rose to 4,490, according to Tuesday’s daily update of the state’s coronavirus dashboard. That is the highest level Indiana has seen during the pandemic and more than five times the seven-day rolling average of 858 newly confirmed cases the agency reported Sept. 22.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two more state prisons are reporting outbreaks of coronavirus infections, according to the Iowa Department of Corrections. Recent testing has revealed outbreaks at prisons in Clarinda, where 377 inmates and 16 staff members are positive, and Rockwell City, where 254 inmates and four staff members are positive, a DOC report updated Sunday shows. The Clarinda prison has about 900 inmates, and Rockwell City has 426. The department released data Friday showing an outbreak at the Anamosa prison, and the updated numbers show 485 infected inmates of the 982 inmates at the prison. An additional 50 staff members tested positive. Additional smaller prison outbreaks are reported at Mount Pleasant, where 18 inmates and five staff members are positive, and the women’s prison in Mitchellville, where four inmates and 10 staff members are positive.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s largest public school district, in Wichita, has scrapped plans to allow its middle and high school students to attend some in-person classes, and three counties have imposed new restrictions inspired by the coronavirus pandemic. The moves by local officials come as the state works to expand its overall testing capacity so under a “unified” statewide strategy announced by Gov. Laura Kelly in late September. The strategy calls for regular testing of at-risk populations, including first responders, prison inmates, nursing home residents, and K-12 students and staff, as well as more aggressive testing in virus hot spots. The state plans to spend at least $53 million in federal coronavirus relief funds on contracts with private laboratories. But Kelly said Tuesday during a Statehouse news conference: “It won’t work if people are not abiding by the other safety protocols, particularly wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentuckians should avoid large Thanksgiving gatherings as a safeguard to protect extended family and friends from a surging COVID-19 outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Instead, in-person get-togethers should be limited to people from the same household, he said. While the health guidelines might be tough to swallow, the guidance can save lives as Kentucky struggles with its worst outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic governor said. “That person that you may think that you will really miss sitting across the table from you this year, I want to make sure is across the table from you next year,” Beshear said at a news conference. “And this right now is the most dangerous time we’ve had in this virus.” The Thanksgiving guidance came as the state reported 2,120 new virus cases – its highest total for a Tuesday and fifth-highest day overall, Beshear said. He also reported 14 more virus-related deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Shoppers will see state sales taxes suspended for two days this month, under a bill passed by lawmakers in their latest special session and signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, a Gonzales Republican, sponsored the measure to help residents and businesses recovering from hurricanes Laura and Delta and coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The state sales tax holiday will be held Nov. 20-21. Louisiana’s 4.45% state sales tax will not be charged on the first $2,500 of a purchase. The holiday doesn’t cover car, truck and other vehicle purchases. And it doesn’t apply to local sales taxes. The state is estimated to lose $4.5 million in sales tax collections because of the tax holiday, according to a nonpartisan financial analysis of the bill.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers plan to hold their first legislative sessions at the Augusta Civic Center instead of the Statehouse as coronavirus cases grow. The city-owned, 49,000-square-foot civic center, about 3 miles from the Statehouse, is typically used for events such as concerts, agriculture conventions and conferences. It would provide more space than the Statehouse, and that would make it easier to observe social distancing, a spokeswoman for outgoing Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon told the Portland Press Herald. The full Legislature last met in March. The top priority for lawmakers will be crafting a new, two-year state budget at a time when Maine’s finances have been stressed by the pandemic. New Hampshire lawmakers took a similar approach in June when they met in the University of New Hampshire Whittemore Center Arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will reduce indoor operations for bars and restaurants from 75% to 50% in response to rising coronavirus cases and increased hospitalizations, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday. The new limits took effect Wednesday. “Last week, I said that the warning lights were starting to blink on the dashboard and that it appeared we were approaching a critical turning point in the fight. Today, I’m reporting that we have now crossed over into the danger zone,” Hogan said at a news conference. “Too many residents and businesses have COVID fatigue and have begun letting their guard down.” State health officials also have issued a public health advisory effective immediately to strongly discourage indoor gatherings of 25 people or more at family gatherings or house parties. Contact tracing data has shown an increase in cases resulting from such gatherings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases could force the state to once again open field hospitals to care for a possible overflow of patients as intensive care units fill up, Gov. Charlie Baker warned Tuesday. Hospitals are also prepared to make an additional 400 beds available for COVID-19 patients by converting acute care beds to ICU beds to deal with an expected rise in cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus during the fall and winter, Baker said at a press conference. “The trends obviously are going in the wrong direction and show no signs of changing,” he said. When and where field hospitals might be set up depends on space and need, Baker said. Massachusetts residents had done a good job controlling the virus after an initial spike in the spring but are getting careless and allowing the virus to get a toehold again, leading to a second surge, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state on Tuesday posted a record number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases, near 6,500, and reported 59 deaths within the previous 24 hours – its deadliest day in six months. COVID-19, which subsided over the summer after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer imposed sweeping stay-at-home and other restrictions, has rebounded this fall. Asked if she might again order people to stay home, the Democrat said she was talking with the state health department about potential next steps. Mask requirements and gathering limits remain in effect despite a “confusing” state Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a law she used to issue orders, she said. Whitmer said she will not see extended family in person for Thanksgiving and said it is “inherently dangerous” to have more than one household in an enclosed space without ventilation and open windows. The state’s latest average positivity rate is 9.4%, up from 4.9% two weeks ago.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials reported a record 56 new deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said. Walz told Minnesota Public Radio the daily report shows positivity rates above 20%, an important measure of how fast the disease is spreading. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Minnesota has nearly doubled over the past two weeks from just under 7% on Oct. 27 to nearly 13% on Tuesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. The governor made the comments a day after warning Minnesotans that the state is approaching the worst phase of the pandemic and that conditions will get dramatically worse unless people start changing their behavior. He said it won’t be unusual for people to open their newspapers and see 50 to 60 new deaths. “This is just inevitable if we do not change our behaviors and take some mitigation efforts.” Walz told MPR. Minnesota’s previous record was 36 deaths, reported Friday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he, his wife and their three daughters are in isolation after the youngest tested positive for the coronavirus. Maddie Reeves, 8, attends a private elementary school in Jackson. The Republican governor said in a social media post: “She feels OK, but could still use prayers! Please pray for her momma too!” Reeves also said everyone in his family is being tested for the virus. The governor announced his daughter’s infection shortly after he canceled his coronavirus news conference that was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. An executive order issued by Reeves requires children and teachers to wear masks in public and private schools. Sixteen of Mississippi’s 82 counties have been under a mask mandate that was set to expire Wednesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Twenty-eight employees of an election board have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, and a director believes they most likely got infected from voters, though local health officials aren’t convinced. The Jackson County Election Board’s Republican director, Tammy Brown, said Tuesday that eight full-time and 20 part-time employees tested positive for the virus in the past 21/ 2 weeks. Most are doing well and recovering at home, but two are hospitalized, including one in intensive care, Brown said. Jackson County is Missouri’s second-largest county, behind St. Louis County. While Kansas City is part of Jackson County, the city has its own election board. The Jackson County board handled votes cast by nearly 200,000 people. Jackson County Health Department spokeswoman Kayla Parker said community transmission is so widespread that determining the source would be next to impossible.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the state’s chief epidemiologist said the spread of the coronavirus has stressed medical services to the brink, and he predicted the situation will get worse as winter sets in. “We’re kind of preparing for the worst here,” Jim Murphy said. “We have pretty spooky numbers for COVID, going into a fall respiratory season. It’s not a position that anybody would like to be in.” Murphy said the increase in cases across the state has led to a shortage in health care workers, in addition to a shortage in hospital beds. “You can have a lot of beds. But if you don’t have the staff to support those beds, that’s a problem,” he said. U.S. officials have dispatched a team of nearly 30 physicians, nurses, paramedics and other health care workers to Montana’s largest city. The National Disaster Medical System team arrived Friday and will work in Billings for two weeks, The Billings Gazette reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to set records with the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and health care providers expect that to continue because of the recent surge of cases. Cliff Robertson, CEO of CHI Health, said his group of 14 hospitals in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa is preparing for COVID-19 cases to keep increasing over the next three to four weeks. He said COVID-19 patients already account for about 25% of all the patients in his hospitals. “We highly encourage folks to take this seriously because … this virus is rampant in our community right now,” Robertson said. The steady increase in cases raises the concern that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist at Nebraska Medicine in Omaha. “In three weeks’ time, our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and we will no longer be able to deliver optimal and effective care for COVID, and we will also no longer be able to deliver appropriate care for everyone who comes in with a heart attack or a stroke.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Although the coronavirus is spreading at record rates, the state will not need to tighten restrictions if individuals commit to preventive measures like mask-wearing and working from home, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday. For the third time in three weeks, the governor referred to “alarming trends” and said Nevada was almost at the point where stricter measures would be necessary. But unlike in the past, when he has hesitated to commit to benchmarks or timelines, he provided a deadline: If Nevada doesn’t show signs that it’s containing the virus in two weeks, he will be forced to tighten the state’s prevention measures. “If you don’t have to go out, don’t go out. Reduce your time in public to what is necessary, and limit any and all exposures to those outside your household,” Sisolak said. “Think about changes like ordering groceries for delivery instead of going into the store, or picking up dinner curbside.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAmherst: Officials say an Election Day voter at a polling place tested positive for the coronavirus, but the town had safety precautions in place. WMUR-TV reports town officials in Amherst said they were notified by the state that a voter tested positive for the virus. They said the infected person was at Souhegan High School between 10:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. on Election Day. Amherst town moderator Steve Coughlan said it wasn’t crowded. The town is now contacting election volunteers who may have had direct contact with the voter. Coughlan said plexiglass shields separated voters from election workers. Volunteers had to wear masks, but voters did not. “I think we provided a very safe environment,” Coughlan said. “It would be crazy for us to have thought that there would be zero infected voters out of everyone coming in. So we took precautions that were appropriate.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The family of the state’s first law enforcement officer to die from COVID-19 has filed a claim to sue Hudson County, saying he did not receive any masks or other personal protective equipment while working at the county jail. Bernard Waddell Sr., a corrections officer with 32 years of experience, was forced to work within close proximity to inmates who he believed were infected, said family lawyer Paul da Costa. “Up to his last day on the job, he was not provided with any PPE,” da Costa said. The virus devastated the jail in Kearny. Along with Waddell, it claimed the lives of two nurses, a commissary director and another corrections officer. Waddell, 56, died April 1. The Jersey City resident is survived by his wife and two sons. Around the time of his death, New Jersey was experiencing a severe shortage of face masks and gowns, prompting hospitals to ask the public for donations.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Santa Fe Public Schools is ending a short-lived soft opening of in-person learning as the coronavirus pandemic hobbles the state. “I am announcing today a hiatus of our volunteer hybrid program due to the rampant rise in COVID-19 cases in Santa Fe County and New Mexico and SFPS’ philosophy to always prioritize the safety and well being of our students and staff,” Superintendent Veronica Garcia said. The volunteers included 58 teachers who went to work despite the pandemic, enabling about 200 elementary students to attend school in person at least part of the week. The program started Oct. 26 and will hold the last day of classes Nov. 20. “If parents are able to keep their children home next week, I urge them to do so,” Garcia said. The announcement comes as the state sets records for COVID-19 cases amid dwindling space in hospitals and as students are failing classes at much higher rates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. across the state in the latest effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. He said people will also be barred from hosting private gatherings with more than 10 people. Cuomo said the new restrictions, which go into effect Friday, are necessary because new coronavirus infections have been traced to those types of activities. Businesses can reopen each morning. “Bars, restaurants, gyms, house parties – that’s where it’s coming from, primarily,” Cuomo said. The governor spoke as rates of coronavirus infection continued to rise. He said 1,628 people were hospitalized across the state for COVID-19 on Tuesday, and 21 people died. “What we’re seeing is what they predicted for months,” Cuomo said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state will remain paused in its current reopening plan for an additional three weeks, with indoor gathering limits reduced from 25 people to 10 people starting Friday. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced the tightening of gathering restrictions during a Tuesday news conference. The decision not to further reopen ahead of Thanksgiving comes at a time when the state is concerned about increases it has seen in COVID-19 cases and the percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive. “The science shows that the transmission of this virus is much greater indoors, and the more people are gathered, the easier this virus can spread,” Cooper said. Cooper, who won reelection last week, noted that churches and restaurants would be unaffected by the updated guidance. The executive order will remain in place until Dec. 4.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state continues to lead the nation in daily new coronavirus cases per capita, with 1 in 83 residents testing positive in just the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. In the past two weeks, there were 2,265 new cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. State health officials reported a dozen new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus Wednesday, down from a record 30 deaths Tuesday. The deaths reported Wednesday increased total fatalities to 696 since the pandemic began. The report said 123 deaths have occurred in November, matching all of September. October has been the deadliest month so far in North Dakota, with 292 deaths. State health officials reported 1,039 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and a daily positivity rate of more than 18% for the second straight day.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine beseeched Ohioans on Wednesday to take the surging coronavirus spread seriously, issuing new orders on mask enforcement in businesses, limiting gatherings across the state, and threatening to close bars, restaurants and fitness centers if cases continue to rise. “Throughout our country’s history, each generation has faced unique sacrifices,” DeWine said in the statewide address. “Today, we all must do something far less dramatic but very important: Wear a mask so your friends and family members can live.” DeWine shifted the authority of mask enforcement from the local counties to the state. The Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation will be responsible for inspections across the 88 counties. If a business receives more than one violation, it will have to close for 24 hours. “We must do this to protect our front-line workers,” DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of people hospitalized with confirmed and probable coronavirus in the state shattered the previous one-day record by nearly 200 on Wednesday, and more than 2,100 new cases were reported, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The department reported 1,248 hospitalizations to surpass the previous record of 1,055 set last Thursday. The department reported 2,177 new cases and 19 additional deaths since Tuesday for totals of 142,334 cases and 1,470 deaths since the pandemic began in March. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day average of the percentage of people who tested positive has risen from 9% to nearly 16% in Oklahoma, and the average number of new cases each day increased from 1265.8 per day to 1,947.3.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown and state health officials warned Tuesday of the capacity challenges facing hospitals as COVID-19 case counts continue to spike. The Oregon Health Authority recorded a record 285 confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospitals Tuesday – a 57% increase in just the past week and an 83% increase in the past four weeks. “There are limitations to what Oregon’s health care system can handle,” said Dana Hargunani, the health authority’s chief medical officer. “Even with regional planning and the hard work of all of our hospital partners, we cannot handle ever-growing high daily case counts and widespread hospitalizations.” Currently out of Oregon’s 703 listed intensive care unit beds, 27% are available, and about 18% of non-ICU adult hospital beds in the state are available, based on data on from the health authority’s website. “Our fear that this virus would spread out of control as the colder months set in is now becoming a frightening reality,” Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city’s public school students will continue to attend classes virtually for the foreseeable future, district officials announced Tuesday. The announcement came on the same day Philadelphia public health officials saw a peak in confirmed virus cases and increased hospitalizations. The school district had planned to begin bringing back younger students for a hybrid in-person instruction model starting Nov. 30, with plans to phase in instruction for students with complex instructional needs and then older students next. “We hope to see these students back in school before the spring,” Philadelphia district Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said, adding that it would ultimately depend on health experts and infection trends. About one-third of parents with students who would have been eligible to return had opted for in-person, part-time instruction that would have put students in classrooms two days a week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Employees of the state Senate are being told to work from home after three workers tested positive for the coronavirus, state officials said. The Senate’s roughly 50 workers were instructed to start working remotely Monday after three staffers tested positive over the weekend, The Providence Journal reports. They were told to work remotely for two weeks. The directive came from Gov. Gina Raimondo. Senate spokesman Greg Pare said the Senate president is “following that guidance and wants to do all he can to keep Senate staff members safe.” The House said it has no plans to shift to remote work. The new cases in the Senate were reported as the General Assembly looks for ways to gather for its first full sessions since July. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio previously said he is exploring whether meetings can be held at the Rhode Island Convention Center.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials in the state’s largest school district say the number of students who received an F in at least one class tripled this year, as the district adjusted learning because of the coronavirus pandemic. First-quarter report cards show a little more than 16,000 students in Greenville County Schools had an F. That compares to roughly 5,300 students with at least one failing grade in the first quarter last year. The pandemic has limited in-person teaching for the district’s 75,000 students, and Associate Superintendent of Academics Jeff McCoy said that likely was a factor in the jump in Fs. He also cited the stress of the crisis on families and the emergency shutdown of schools in the spring. Still, the district wasn’t expecting such a big increase in the number of struggling students. McCoy said the report cards show a much larger proportion of virtual students are receiving failing grades compared to in-person students.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The mayor cast the tie-breaking vote that defeated a proposed mask mandate in the state’s largest city Tuesday night. After more than two hours of public comment, Mayor Paul TenHaken rejected the mandate after the City Council tied 4-4 on the ordinance. The mandate would have required face coverings to be worn by people in most indoor public places where 6-foot social distancing was not achievable. Violations carried a $50 fine. “I believe the small uptick we’ll see in compliance is not worth the community division that this will create,” TenHaken said as he ended debate. Councilor Greg Neitzert said he did not want to live in a city where people are calling the police because someone isn’t wearing a mask. “It’s not just about health,” Neitzert said. “We also have to look at principles.” The Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce opposed it. Several faith leaders in the city supported the mandate.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that he’s looking to include “meaningful” teacher pay raises in next year’s budget despite facing financial crunches brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee had originally proposed funneling an additional $117 million to K-12 teacher salaries earlier this year before the virus outbreak began rippling across the state. If approved, the starting minimum annual salary for teachers would have increased from $36,000 to $40,000 over the next two years. Yet months later, Lee was forced to strip the teacher funding boost, as well as many other budget initiatives, as officials braced for funding shortfalls. However, Tennessee’s revenues have come in slightly higher than originally projected over the past three months, allowing Lee’s administration to remain slightly optimistic that it will be able to fund some new measures rather than have to dip into rainy day funds.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state has become the first with more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases as the nation continues to face a surge of infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University early Wednesday. The nation’s second-most populous state has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases with 19,337 deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to the count on the Johns Hopkins website. Texas recorded 10,865 new cases Tuesday, setting a new daily record that surpassed by 74 cases an old mark set July 15, state officials said. According to state figures Tuesday, an estimated 132,146 cases are active, the most since Aug. 17, and 6,170 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, the most since Aug. 18. There were 94 new deaths Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Meanwhile, cases of the coronavirus are surging in the Laredo area, health officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A group of teachers has organized an event to encourage educators across the state to call in sick and use the day off to get tested for the coronavirus amid a surge in confirmed infection cases. “There are no testing requirements for teachers or students currently,” Granite School District teacher Lindsay Plummer said. Some teachers believe the “test out” planned for Thursday will prompt state leaders to do more to limit the spread of COVID-19 and increase safety protocols in classrooms, FOX13 reports. Plummer said the group was inspired to act following remarks made by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert on Sunday, when he put in place a statewide mask mandate. “The goal of doing something like this is we want to push them to do more,” she said. The Utah Education Association said it is aware of event but is urging teachers to be patient. Herbert’s office has said all teachers have universal access to testing.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state on Tuesday suspended a program that allowed people from across the Northeast to visit Vermont without quarantining if they come from a county with a low rate of coronavirus infection. Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that the number of counties eligible – listed on a map that uses red, orange and green to indicate eligibility – has continued to shrink. As of Tuesday only two counties between Maine and Ohio were listed as green. “The fact is, along with social gatherings, travel to and from other states without the proper quarantine continues to be one of the common denominators in our rising case counts,” Scott said. Essential travel – such as work, school, medical care, personal safety, shared child custody or buying groceries – is not affected, but people should only do what they need to do and then return home, he said. Vermont determined eligible counties as those with virus rates of less than 400 cases per million residents.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday announced plans to significantly increase statewide testing capacity and to launch a media campaign in southwest Virginia, which has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past month. The moves came three days after Virginia reported 2,103 new cases – its biggest single-day increase in new cases since the start of the pandemic. On Tuesday, the state reported 1,435 new cases. The state’s seven-day moving average of new cases is 1,462. The seven-day testing positivity rate has also climbed from just under 5% a few weeks ago to 6.2% on Tuesday. Since the start of the pandemic, the state has recorded a total of 194,192 cases, with 3,726 deaths. Northam said he is focusing on mitigation efforts and continuing to encourage people to wear masks and practice social distancing. He said he is not currently considering ordering new restrictions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two hospitals near the city are struggling with COVID-19 outbreaks within the facilities. The Auburn Medical Center reported at least five employees and eight patients tested positive for the coronavirus, after an outbreak on a fourth-floor unit. The hospital said in a statement Tuesday that one patient died after the outbreak was detected late last week, The Seattle Times reports. The MultiCare hospital system, which owns the hospital, tested all 40 patients in the unit and 212 staffers who had worked there in the two-week period before the first positive test was reported, officials said. At St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton, at least six people have been infected since early November. CHI Franciscan, the hospital system that owns St. Michael, announced Tuesday that four patients and two employees have been infected to date. State health officials have reported 350 outbreaks in health care settings, including hospitals, since Oct. 24, a statewide outbreak report said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new high of 642 coronavirus cases Wednesday and seven deaths as the pandemic continued its march into rural enclaves. There are 277 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, slightly down from the peak of 290 last week. A total of 553 deaths have been linked to COVID-19. Virus-related deaths have increased 45% in the past month. The daily positivity rate is up to 5.9%, the highest it has been in about two months. “The enemy is at our borders, and the enemy is coming at us right now,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a press briefing. Twenty-five counties had the most severe designation of virus spread, with 25 or more cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said all options are on the table for bringing new travel and business restrictions, but nothing is planned yet. “Legally, I can’t go out and start arresting people” for not wearing masks, Justice said in urging people to follow guidelines and get tested for the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers renewed his pleas Tuesday for people to stay home to avoid the coronavirus in an unusual prime-time speech hours after the state set new records for infections and deaths. The governor announced he was advising people to stay in their houses and businesses to allow people to work remotely, requiring masks, and limiting the number of people in stores and offices. He said projections show that if nothing changes, deaths could double to 5,000 by January. Evers has been imploring people to stay home and wear masks for months during twice-weekly afternoon news conferences to little avail. This time his office streamed his remarks live on his Facebook page and YouTube channel. “So I want to be clear tonight: Each day this virus goes unchecked is a setback for our economic recovery,” Evers said. Republicans and their conservative allies have worked to block every Evers initiative to stop the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The son of a state representative who opposed COVID-19 public restrictions said his father was positive for the coronavirus when he died. Roy Edwards, 66, died Nov. 2 at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper after being hospitalized for more than a week with illness that was not immediately disclosed, The Gillette News Record reports. Edwards continued to oppose public restrictions resulting from the pandemic during his recent campaign to retain his House seat. He was reelected the day after he died. Mitch Edwards said his father initially experienced minor virus symptoms. He was told by a medical professional that he had sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinuses, and did not need to be tested for COVID-19. Roy Edwards was not advised to quarantine, but he did so as a a precaution, Mitch Edwards said. His symptoms worsened, and he had trouble breathing Oct. 23, when he again sought medical attention.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/11/04/memorial-service-super-weed-bear-attack-news-around-states/50901741/", "title": "Memorial service, destructive 'super weed': News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTrussville: A school district’s superintendent has resigned after it was revealed that school officials had been aware of a student’s notebook filled with threats for a year before taking action to ensure student safety. Trussville City Schools Superintendent Pattie Neill’s contract was scheduled to expire June 30, 2026, but her attorney renegotiated the pact that will now end Oct. 31, 2023. Neill will be paid through that date but will no longer be in charge of the district, which is in a suburb of Birmingham, al.com reports. “It provides us an opportunity to move forward; it provides us an opportunity to have a fresh start,” Trussville City Board of Education Vice President Kim DeShazo said of the negotiation involving Neill. “I am looking forward to our city being in the news for the things that we have to celebrate because Trussville City Schools does have a lot to celebrate and a lot to be thankful for ... I’m looking forward to the next chapter.” The board named Interim Superintendent Frank Costanzo as the district’s acting superintendent as the system begins the search for Neill’s permanent replacement. Since Sept. 30, Neill had been on a 60-day leave of absence.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer said Wednesday that he is satisfied with Alaska’s ballot counting process and that there are no plans for a statewide hand-count audit of a race like the one he called for two years ago. Meyer oversees elections in Alaska and after the 2020 general election announced plans for an audit of votes on a statewide ballot initiative that narrowly passed. He cast the audit, conducted after the race was certified, as a way to address questions that had been raised about the validity of election results tied to vote tabulation equipment used by the state. The audit affirmed the passage of the initiative, which ended party primaries and instituted ranked-choice voting in general elections. This year’s elections were the first held under the new elections process. Meyer and Division of Elections Director Gail Fenumiai held a briefing with reporters Wednesday, ahead of next week’s election. Meyer said he is “satisfied that the process works and that there’s enough checks and balances in place that if something isn’t quite right, we’ll catch it soon.” In an interview with the Associated Press, Meyer said that with the 2020 review, “we were able to show folks that the machines worked correctly.” He said it has been frustrating to see people get misinformation from social media or from online videos.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A planned research center operated by the University of Arizona will get a $150million allocation of federal money via the state, officials announced Wednesday. The designation comes from money the state received through the American Rescue Plan Act, C.J. Karamargin, a spokesperson for Gov. Doug Ducey, wrote in an email. The funds will go to the UA Health Sciences’ planned Phoenix-based Center for Advanced Molecular and Immunological Therapies, which will be part of the downtown, 30-acre Phoenix Bioscience Core campus. There are no current cost estimates for the project, UA officials said Wednesday. The Phoenix Bioscience Core includes several education, health care and research entities, including the Arizona-based Translational Genomics Research Institute, the UA College of Medicine Phoenix, and the Dignity Health-Cancer Institute at St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center. The Center for Advanced Molecular and Immunological Therapies intends to advance immunology research in four areas: cancer, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and real-time immune system monitoring, UA officials said.\n\nArkansas\n\nVan Buren: Two former Crawford County deputies fired over excessive force complaints had requested a public hearing Wednesday in efforts to clear their names, but they didn’t show up, the sheriff’s office reports. Neither Levi White nor Zack King appeared at the sheriff’s department lobby Wednesday. Instead, a woman showed up to make accusations that she, too, has been roughed up during an arrest by White. White and King were caught on video making a rough arrest of Randal Worcester on Aug. 21. The video taken by a bystander showed White, King and a Mulberry police officer, Thell Riddle, beating Worcester after a convenience store clerk in Alma claimed Worcester threatened her. Attorney David Powell of Fort Smith, who previously represented Worcester, said he is now represented by another attorney in Oklahoma City. Powell is now representing Tammy Nelson, who said on Aug. 21, she was at her home, where she was involved in a civil matter that resulted in a heated argument that didn’t go well. White was sent to the call, where things escalated for the worse, she said. “I was just attacked by him and violated and thrown to the ground,” Nelson said. She was arrested and jailed on complaints of obstruction of a government operation and harassment. Powell said he has heard from other clients with such complaints.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Delays in testing evidence from sexual assaults have been a lost opportunity for investigators and a source of frustration for victims for years, prompting state officials to announce Tuesday that they have created a way for survivors to track the progress of linking their rape kits with DNA evidence. California is also the first state to hire a sexual assault evidence outreach coordinator, Sarai Crain, who will work with investigators, medical facilities and others to help track and process sexual assault evidence. The new online tracking system was required under a law approved by state lawmakers last year. It follows a 2017 California law that requires law enforcement agencies to submit the evidence for testing within 20 days and requires crime labs to test the evidence within 120 days or provide reasons for any delay. The goal is to end the backlog of rape kits by local agencies, make sure they are tested quickly once they are submitted, and keep survivors better informed, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said. Of nearly 6,400 kits collected in 2020, 90% were analyzed by May 2021, according to an annual report by the attorney general’s office. The rest were in various stages of processing. About half the tests found DNA that was compared to other DNA on the FBI’s database, and nearly 800 resulted in “hits.”\n\nColorado\n\nIdaho Springs: The Colorado city of Idaho Springs said Wednesday it has agreed to pay $7 million to a 75-year-old man who said an officer used a stun gun on him without warning and dragged him from his apartment after a dispute with a neighbor, causing a stroke that left him with permanent injuries. Michael Clark alleged in the federal civil rights suit filed last year that he suffered numerous health problems after Officer Nicholas Hanning used a Taser on him in his home in Idaho Springs, causing Clark to lose consciousness, fall and strike his head. Clark also accused Hanning of putting a knee on his neck, depriving him of oxygen and increasing his risk of death. Hanning, who was fired after the May 2021 encounter, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor third-degree assault and relinquished his right to serve as a law enforcement officer in Colorado. He was sentenced in January to two years of probation and community service. The Idaho Springs statement said the city admits no liability but is settling the case “for economic reasons and to bring closure to all involved.” It did say the city and Police Chief Nate Buseck “acknowledge the poor judgment that led to the use” of the Taser against Clark, which Buseck previously described as unacceptable. “He is wheelchair bound and now forever dependent on his family and doctors to survive,” Clark’s attorney, Sarah Schielke, said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A man who was linked to the sexual assaults of four women in 1984 by information on a genealogy database was convicted Wednesday of all eight kidnapping charges against him. A state jury in Hartford took less than an hour of deliberations to unanimously convict Michael Sharpe after a five-day trial. He faces 25 to 100 years in prison when he is sentenced Jan. 9. Sharpe, 71, who had been free on a promise to appear in court, was detained after the verdicts because a judge set a new bond at $2.5 million. At least two of the victims were in the courtroom and wept after the verdicts were announced, The Hartford Courant reports. Sharpe’s public defender, Dana Sanetti, said in her closing argument Tuesday that the only evidence connecting Sharpe to the attacks was his DNA, which was only “a piece of the puzzle,” Hearst Connecticut Media reports. Sharpe, of Marlborough, was once the chief executive officer of a group that ran the Jumoke Academy, a tuition-free charter school in Hartford. Prosecutors said he broke into the women’s homes in four different towns and sexually assaulted them at gunpoint in June and July of 1984. Investigators found DNA evidence at the homes, but no matches could be found at the time, and the cases went cold.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A big change is coming for the state’s surf-fishing car tag program: There will be no cap on the number of permits issued for 2023, according to an announcement from State Parks Director Ray Bivens on Wednesday. Yes, that means people don’t have to rush to the computer or Delaware State Parks’ gates to snag those coveted surf-fishing tags that allow drive-on beach access. No longer crushed by the “sold out” announcement from State Parks, anyone who wants a surf-fishing tag can now get one. Still, there was a reason the cap was put in place − to protect the natural resources and manage crowds. That’s where another change comes in. After a stakeholder group met this spring, State Parks announced it will be piloting a new reservation system for 36 of the busiest days during the season. The pilot reservation system and lifting of the cap come after the demand for surf-fishing permits has continued to grow in recent years and peaked at unprecedented heights in the past two years. In 2020, the maximum 17,000 tags sold out in just a few months, prompting the state to release an additional 1,000 tags. Eager anglers and beach enthusiasts lined up overnight for a chance to get one of these extra permits.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Internationally renowned chef Gordon Ramsay teamed up with Mayor Muriel Bowser on Wednesday for a friendly cooking competition at his newly opened restaurant in the nation’s capital, WUSA-TV reports. Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips opened Oct. 25 in The Wharf area of the city. The location is the third in the franchise, his take on the classic English street food. The menu ranges from classic fish and chips to chicken, shrimp, “dirty chips” and Gordon’s signature shakes: Sticky Toffee and Biscoff. During the competition, Bowser got to try her hand at one of the signature shakes with the help of Ramsay. The famed chef and the mayor competed against Deputy Mayor John Falcicchio and chef Christina Wilson, who won season 10 of Ramsay’s reality show “Hell’s Kitchen,” to see who could make the best Biscoff shake. The Ramsay-Bowser duo claimed victory. There could be a chance for a rematch in the future, as restaurateur Ramsay is not stopping with the Fish & Chips location in D.C. He is also opening his wildly popular Hell’s Kitchen restaurant, inspired by the show of the same name, on The Wharf as well in early 2023. Until then, the Fish & Chips location in D.C. is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday-Thursday and 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday-Saturday.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Florida State University held a memorial service on campus Wednesday evening to remember the victims of the 2018 yoga studio shooting in the city. The service marked four years since the mass shooting took place at Tallahassee Hot Yoga, where Scott Paul Beierle killed two women, 21-year-old Maura Binkley and 61-year-old Nancy Van Vessem, and injured five other victims before killing himself. A key part of the service was the announcement of a new initiative called “Florida State United: One Voice Against Hate,” which aims to bring more awareness to hate crimes through research and education. “As Maura and Nancy exemplified in their lives, love is the most important work we can do,” Jeff Binkley, Maura Binkley’s father, said to the FSU and Tallahassee community as they were gathered near the Integration Statue on campus. “Always remember that only love can conquer hate.” Maura Binkley was a senior at FSU double majoring in German and English, and Van Vessem was a chief medical officer at Capital Health Plan, as well as a former faculty member at FSU’s College of Medicine. Signs were placed throughout the area with phrases such as “A Voice for Safety,” “A Voice for Peace” and “A Voice for Freedom.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A state agency has stopped accepting applications from people seeking assistance with their rent payments, saying money from the federally funded aid program has begun to run out. The Georgia Department of Community Affairs posted an announcement on its website last week that the agency is no longer taking rental assistance applications, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The news caught housing advocates off guard and left some tenants scrambling to pay rent with little warning, said Lindsay Siegel, director of housing advocacy at Legal Aid of Atlanta. “The DCA put some tenants in a pretty bad position,” Siegel said. “If they knew they were running out of money, they should have told them so they could plan.” The federal government put $46.5 billion into an emergency rental assistance program in 2020 in hopes of averting spikes in evictions and homelessness during the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. Treasury Department reported a year ago that several states and large cities had already exhausted their share of the funding. Now Georgia is getting close to running out of rental assistance money, prompting the Department of Community Affairs to suspend applications, agency Commissioner Christopher Nunn said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The ground is still shaking and swelling at Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano in the world, indicating it could erupt. Scientists say they don’t expect that to happen right away, but officials on the Big Island are telling residents to be prepared. Mauna Loa is one of five volcanoes that together make up Hawaii Island, the southernmost in the Hawaiian archipelago. It’s not the tallest – that title goes to Mauna Kea – but it’s the largest and makes up about half of the island’s land mass. It sits immediately north of Kilauea volcano, which is currently erupting from its summit crater. Kilauea is well-known for a 2018 eruption that destroyed 700 homes and sent rivers of lava spreading across farms and into the ocean. Mauna Loa last erupted 38 years ago. In written history, dating to 1843, it has erupted 33 times. The Big Island is mostly rural and is home to cattle ranches, coffee farms and beach resorts. Mauna Loa’s eruptions differ from Kilauea’s in part because it is taller. Its greater height gives it steeper slopes, which allow lava to rush down its hillsides faster than Kilauea’s. Its enormous size may allow it to store more magma, leading to larger lava flows when an eruption occurs. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory has more than 60 GPS stations on Mauna Loa taking measurements to estimate the location and the amount of magma accumulating beneath the surface. There’s also a thermal webcam at Mauna Loa’s summit that will identify the presence of heat. And satellite radar can keep track of ground swelling and deflation.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A high-profile attorney who has defended in state and federal courts some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation is among the latest attorneys to quit state employment. Former Deputy Attorney General Megan Larrondo is one of eight attorneys and a handful of other staffers who have left or are leaving the Idaho attorney general’s office following Raúl Labrador’s win over five-term incumbent Attorney General Lawrence Wasden in the Republican primary in May. More departures are expected. Information obtained by The Associated Press through a public records request shows that Larrondo’s job ended Monday. Court documents filed Friday in both U.S. District Court in Idaho and the Idaho Supreme Court show filings requesting Larrondo be removed as attorney of record in the state’s abortion cases. The state and federal courts have yet to make final rulings in those cases. Labrador, a former U.S. representative who has said voters are looking for an aggressive, conservative attorney general, has promised to make the office more partisan should he win in next week’s general election. In a series of recent interviews, he denigrated attorneys working in the office, telling the Lewiston Tribune that the “Attorney General’s Office needs to have better lawyers.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The 2018 killing of “ZackTV,” a trailblazer in a perilous genre of gangland reporting he called “‘hood CNN,” seemed destined to go unsolved, even though gunmen attacked him on a downtown Chicago street lined with surveillance cameras. Police never announced arrests in the shooting of Zachary Stoner, who drew a national YouTube following filling a media niche with up-close stories about the lives and deaths of gang members and affiliated rappers from places other reporters were afraid to go. But police records obtained by the Associated Press reveal investigators believe they solved his homicide years ago when they arrested members of South Side Chicago’s “Perry Avenue” gang. Yet prosecutors in 2019 declined to prosecute, and police were forced to release the suspects. Police say the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office cited the possibility that the two sides in the shooting on May 30, 2018, were “mutual combatants” – a disputed legal concept that’s a throwback to duels between nobles or prearranged gunfights in the Wild West. That prosecutors passed on charges on those grounds raises questions about whether Chicago gangs can literally get away with murder when it’s unclear who initiated a shooting and who returned fire in self-defense.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor is planning his fifth overseas trip of the year, this time to attend a U.N. climate conference in Egypt. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb’s office announced Wednesday that he would take part in the COP27 climate change conference. Holcomb’s schedule includes giving a speech about Indiana’s efforts to increase use of clean energy in the state, the governor’s office said. “I look forward to highlighting the ongoing ways Hoosiers continue to pioneer the way forward, develop sustainable solutions, and lead productive global conversations,” Holcomb said in a statement. Holcomb and state Secretary of Commerce Brad Chambers will be part of an Indiana delegation arriving Sunday in Egypt and returning to Indiana on Nov. 12. The trip is being paid for with private donations to the Indiana Economic Development Foundation, the governor’s office said. Holcomb also plans meetings with businesses and foreign governments and organizations during the conference drawing leaders from nearly 200 nations. The governor has made four previous economic development this year, including to Germany and Switzerland last month and to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in May. He made two trips in the spring that took him to Sweden, Great Britain, Monaco, Slovakia and Israel.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: This week the Des Moines Area Religious Council’s network of food pantries broke the record for the number of individuals helped during a single day in the network’s 46-year history. On Tuesday, the network of 15 pantries assisted 1,530 individuals across Polk County, beating the previous record of 1,476 individuals helped in one day Sept. 3, 2019, according to a DMARC news release. Matt Unger, the CEO of DMARC, said even though he expected the record to be broken this month, seeing it happen is still “jarring.” He said he expects this November to be the busiest month in the network’s history. “It’s going to be a big month and it is going to take a tremendous amount of public support for ALL organizations working in the food insecurity space to make sure our community members have AT LEAST the basic groceries they and their households need,” Unger wrote in an email. According to DMARC, rising costs for essential goods such as food and gasoline, coupled with the decrease in benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in April, have contributed to the rise in people in need across Iowa. Michelle Book, the president of Food Bank of Iowa, said 1 in 7 working households across the state cannot cover the costs of their basic needs.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A former undersheriff was acquitted Wednesday in the death of an unarmed man he shot with a defective beanbag round five years ago. Virgil Brewer was charged with involuntary manslaughter after he shot Steven Myers using his personal shotgun the evening of Oct. 6, 2017, in Sun City, a rural area about 300 miles from Kansas City, Kansas. A Wyandotte County jury deliberated for four hours after a weeklong trial before returning the not-guilty verdict. It was unclear if Brewer, who has been on unpaid leave from the Barber County Sheriff’s department since his 2018 arrest, would return to his former role. Brewer and two other officers responded to a call about an armed man on a street after an altercation at a Sun City bar. Myers, who was drunk and had been told to leave the bar, was gone by the time officers arrived. They found him in a shed at a Sun City home. He came out of the shed, and Brewer shot him at close range with a beanbag, which split open and emptied pellets into his chest, causing fatal injuries. Medical Examiner Timothy Gorrill ruled Myers’ death a homicide. An expert testified at trial that the beanbag round was defective and should never have been sold or distributed, defense attorney David Harger said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: In a move that experts describe as outrageous, the Kentucky Bar Association is seeking to punish a lawyer who brought a scandal to light this summer in which an elected prosecutor was trading favors with a defendant in exchange for nude images of her. An inquiry panel has accused attorney Thomas Clay of violating what is known informally as the “squeal rule” or “rat rule.” The rule says that when a lawyer knows another lawyer has committed a violation of the Rules of Professional Misconduct raising a “substantial question about their honesty, trustworthiness or fitness,” the first lawyer must report it to bar counsel. When Clay learned that Commonwealth’s Attorney Ronny Goldy Jr. had for several years done favors for a defendant in exchange for her giving him nude photos and videos of herself, he reported it to the FBI but not to the bar association’s disciplinary counsel. Clay provided the FBI and the Louisville Courier Journal with 230 pages of Facebook messages documenting the quid quo pro. Just two days after the newspaper published a story that included excerpts of the messages, the bar moved to temporarily suspend Goldy, the elected prosecutor for Bath, Menifee, Montgomery and Rowan counties. Clay’s lawyer, Jon Fleischaker, said his client deserves “praise, not sanction.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A little more than 12% of registered voters in the state have cast their ballots ahead of next week’s elections, keeping up with Louisiana’s steady increase in midterm election turnout. Of the 363,009 residents who participated in the state’s early voting period, which ended Tuesday night, about 42% were registered Democrats, and 43% were Republicans, according to data from the Louisiana Secretary of State’s office. Most Louisiana voters opt to vote in person on Election Day. But the percentage who vote early has been steadily increasing. During 2018 midterm elections, about 11% of voters cast their ballots early, up from 8% in 2014 and 4% in 2010. Early voting topped 32% in 2020, though presidential election years tend to draw far more voters than midterms. The state has placed a number of restrictions on mail-in voting. Absentee ballots need a notary or witness signature and can only go to older people, those with disabilities or voters who can show they cannot cast a ballot in person on Election Day. This election, absentee ballots went to about 3% of the total number of registered voters in the state.\n\nMaine\n\nWells: More than $4.3 million in federal funds is on its way to the Wells-Ogunquit Community School District to help purchase 11 new, clean, zero-emission school buses. Such funds essentially will help the district swap out its current fleet of 12 diesel-engine buses. David Cash, the New England regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, made Wells his first stop Monday on his tour of Maine school districts that will be receiving their own slices of more than $13 million from the EPA’s Clean School Bus Program. Cash said the buses currently in use create pollution with “long-term impacts on our kids” and contribute to “problematic” issues related to climate change. He called the $5 billion being spent nationwide for new, “clean” school buses “tremendous.” “It’s incumbent upon us to make the right kind of choices and the right kind of investments,” he said. WOCSD is one of 13 school districts in the state that President Joe Biden announced would be part of his administration’s funding for the bus program for the current fiscal year. The funds are a part of the infrastructure bill Biden signed into law last year. WOCSD is receiving the largest share of the $13 million. Overall, the grant funds will help with the purchases of 34 “clean” buses for school districts throughout the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nMontgomery County: Vulgar signs atop a busy roadway are grabbing the attention of drivers and neighbors alike, WUSA-TV reports. Conservative activist Shaun Porter and several other people have recently been holding signs atop the Capital Beltway on the Bradley Boulevard overpass. While holding politically tinged signs near roadways is not a new phenomenon in the D.C. region, Porter’s signs include curse words and sexually graphic language directed at President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party. Jobe Lett, an 11-year-old Montgomery County resident who lives nearby the overpass, said the signs have become a distraction in his neighborhood “because of the language that they’re using.” Data provided by the state shows more than 200,000 people drive the beltway around the Bradley Boulevard overpass every day. But some of those drivers honk at Porter’s signs. That has also become a problem for neighbors. Homes surround the overpass on both sides. “Hey, I support everyone’s right to (free speech),” Montgomery County Jesse Sanders said. “I just kind of wish it wasn’t in the most residential of areas.” Maryland State Police said obscenity laws are vague, and they have questions about infringing on Porter’s First Amendment rights by asking him to stop.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Authorities who earlier this week said they had finally identified the “Lady of the Dunes,” the woman whose mutilated body was found on Cape Cod in 1974, are now looking for information about a man she may have married. The late Guy Rockwell Muldavin is believed to have married Ruth Marie Terry in February 1974, just a few months before the 37-year-old Terry’s body was found in Provincetown, according to a statement Wednesday from state police, Provincetown police and the Cape and Islands district attorney’s office. Investigators are asking anyone with information about the whereabouts of Terry or Muldavin in New England in 1973 or 1974 to contact them. Muldavin, described as an antiques dealer who also used the names Raoul Guy Rockwell and Guy Muldavin Rockwell, was a suspect in the deaths of a previous wife and a stepdaughter in Seattle in 1960, according to media reports at the time. He was caught in New York City and charged with “unlawful flight.” He died in California in 2002, according to his obituary. The death of the “Lady of the Dunes” was one of the most enduring and frustrating murder mysteries in Massachusetts. A young girl out for a walk found the body in the dunes in Provincetown in July 1974. The woman was naked on a beach blanket with her hands severed – so she could not be identified by her fingerprints, officials said. Her skull was crushed, and she was nearly decapitated.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A shortage of poll workers has concerned local election officials in some parts of the country, but Michigan is facing a different side of the trend. Conservative groups and local Republican Party operatives who have pushed false claims about the 2020 presidential election have recruited poll workers in the state by the thousands. Similar recruitment efforts on the right have bolstered the ranks of poll workers in some other states with nationally watched races. Seeding the ranks of front-line election workers with people recruited by groups promoting election conspiracies has raised alarms among some that the people at the foundation of the election system could try to undermine it. “It concerns me when the motivation to serve as a poll worker is fueled through misinformation and people who have been fed lies, in some cases, for years now,” said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat. “Since the spring, clerks have come at us with concerning questions they’re getting and, in some cases, hundreds of poll worker applications that seem to be motivated by nefarious intent.” In Oakland County, the state’s second-most populous, Republicans “discouraged about the outcome of the 2020 election” have been urged to sign up as poll workers through a new Republican National Committee recruitment program.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The City Council on Thursday unanimously approved a former public safety director from New Jersey to take over the city’s police department, as it struggles with depleted staffing and the uncertainty of an ongoing federal investigation following the killing of George Floyd. Brian O’Hara, deputy mayor of Newark, will start serving as Minneapolis’ police chief Monday. “Everyone is hungry for change in this city. I’m not here to maintain the status quo,” he told reporters after the council vote. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey nominated O’Hara to lead the police department in September and said Thursday that the city needs someone like O’Hara right now. “This moment matters,” Frey said. “The act of stepping up for this job – at this time – is an act of courage.” Minneapolis has been at the center of calls for changes in policing since the May 2020 killing of Floyd, whose death under an officer’s knee led to nationwide demands for racial justice and an end to police brutality. Calls to abolish the department or dismantle and replace it with a new department of public safety were rejected by voters in the city last year. The city is also under a federal investigation into its policing practices, and it is expected that court-enforced changes will be ordered through a consent decree.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State lawmakers met in special session Wednesday and quickly approved nearly $247 million in incentives for an aluminum plant that is supposed to bring 1,000 jobs to northern Mississippi by 2029. Many legislators voted on the incentives without knowing the name of the company. At a news conference as the session ended, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves acknowledged the aluminum project is being developed by Steel Dynamics Inc., an Indiana-based company that already operates a steel mill near Columbus, Mississippi. “They are a fantastic employer in the Golden Triangle today,” Reeves said. Reeves had previously said a nondisclosure agreement prohibited him from publicly naming the company until the deal was done. Only the governor can call a special session, and Democratic legislators questioned why Reeves has not called sessions to address other issues, including funding for Jackson’s troubled water system or for struggling rural hospitals. “Many Mississippians are suffering and dying. But none of these things, despite being matters of literal life and death, compelled the governor to call a special session,” Rep. Robert Johnson of Natchez said Wednesday during a Democratic Caucus news conference. “So, what compelled him to bring us back again? A victory lap being portrayed publicly as an emergency? But this feels a lot more like a campaign event, a political pep rally, than public service.”\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The city will pay $5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the family of an unarmed Black man who was fatally shot by a police officer in 2019. The Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners approved the settlement with the family of Terrence Bridges Jr. in a closed meeting earlier this week, The Kansas City Star reports. Bridges, 30, was shot and killed after officers responded to a reported carjacking. Police had contended he was resisting arrest and was shot during a struggle with the officer, identified in police records as Dylan Pifer. The officer told investigators he feared for his life because he thought Bridges was pulling a gun from a sweatshirt. Bridges’ family and civil rights activists said he was not armed, not resisting, did not pose a threat to the officer and was not involved in the carjacking. Tom Porto, an attorney representing the family, said in a statement the settlement represents the police department’s acknowledgement of the tragic and significant loss to Bridges’ family. Pifer, who is still on the police force, was not charged in the killing. A year after Bridges’ death, Pifer was with Sgt. Matthew T. Neal as Neal injured a 15-year-old boy by slamming his face into the pavement after stopping a car the teenager was in. Neal left the department after pleading guilty last week to third-degree assault. He was placed on four years’ probation. Pifer was not charged.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: While Budweiser and Coors Light remain the state’s favorite beers, Gov. Greg Gianforte and Department of Agriculture Director Christy Clark have signed a letter of understanding saying Heineken’s parent company, Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma, S.A., will do more business in Montana, including buying more Treasure State barley. The deal was announced Tuesday, The Daily Montanan reports. While the letter of intent didn’t commit the beverage industry giant to specific amounts or prices, it did say the company was committed to using more Montana products in its beer manufacturing. The “intent to procure increased volumes of high-quality Montana barley” will be met with “transparent market information, producer consultations, and continued investments in barley research” by the state, according to the letter. Gianforte, as well as leaders from Heineken and the Montana Wheat and Barley Committee along with members of the U.S. Grain Council, signed the letter at Bos Hay and Grain at Gallatin Gateway. “We’re thrilled Heineken recognized the superior quality of Montana barley and wants to do more business with our farmers,” Gianforte said. ‘This agreement ushers in tremendous opportunities for our ag industry.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: In the wake of a Halloween block party where a man drove around barricades and toward the crowd before a police officer shot and wounded him, counselors and government officials have been offering help for those who witnessed the chaos. Therapists were available Thursday evening at Minne Lusa Elementary School for those dealing with stress from Monday night’s incident in the same neighborhood, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Project Harmony Deputy Director told the newspaper that officials were hoping to help kids and adults alike process the experience and normalize their feelings, which she said might include fixating on the event, sleep interruptions, irritability and fearing for their own safety. The shooting happened about 7 p.m. Monday during the annual Halloween block party in the Minne Lusa neighborhood, and no one besides the driver was injured. It capped a chaotic few seconds in which people ran screaming as the car accelerated toward the crowd before shots rang out. Authorities had blocked off the area to traffic to allow trick-or-treaters and their families to mill about the streets safely. Police said the driver, later identified as 31-year-old Dontavius Levering, drove around the barricades and traveled recklessly the wrong way without headlights on Minne Lusa Boulevard through crowds of people, including throngs of children. It’s not clear whether he intended to hurt anyone.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada asked the state’s secretary of state Wednesday to investigate what it called a “coordinated partisan election administration effort” during rural Nye County’s hand-count of mail-in ballots that was shut down last week until after polls close. The ACLU said a hand-count volunteer openly carrying a firearm removed an ACLU observer from a hand-count tally room, which the organization said it recently discovered was Nye County GOP Central Committee Vice Chair Laura Larsen. The ACLU said the situation “poses questions” surrounding Nye County interim clerk Mark Kampf’s delegation of authority to partisan officials to remove observers from hand-count rooms, particularly during a hand-count process that deals with tabulation of ballots.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRye: A boil water order for customers of the Rye Water District has now stretched into its third week following the detection of harmful bacteria in district water samples in mid-October. A public informational meeting has been set for this weekend to discuss the order. Town leaders are continuing to distribute cases of bottled water to affected residents as Rye Water District leadership awaits the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services’ lifting of the order. Three weeks since the enactment of the order, Rye Water District superintendent Arik Jones said he still feels it could take several more days before it’s over. The cause of the water contamination has not been identified, though Jones stated that potential causes could be from “improper irrigation operation and/or maintenance.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nDelran: A $2.5 million upgrade at a water-treatment plant here is intended to remove a potentially harmful contaminant from a major source of South Jersey’s drinking water. New Jersey American Water said the improvements will target a man-made chemical found more than two years ago in samples taken from the Delaware River. The utility’s Delran plant processes up to 40 million gallons of river water daily for use by hundreds of thousands of customers in Burlington, Camden, Gloucester and Salem counties. The chemical – 1,4-dioxane – is used as a solvent during manufacturing or industrial processes, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. It is also a byproduct of some consumer products, including detergents and cosmetics.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Work to plug hundreds of abandoned oil and gas wells began in southeast New Mexico, amid the U.S.’ most active oilfields in the Permian Basin. The State’s Oil Conservation Division, an agency of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, got about $25 million in initial grant funding via the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed last year, hoping to redouble efforts to plug some of the about 1,700 wells believed to be abandoned throughout New Mexico on state and private land. Operations began Oct. 31 at a well east of Hobbs in Lea County. It was prioritized, the OCD said, as it was reportedly emitting large amounts of methane and hydrogen sulfide within 1,000 feet of local homes. Before the federal funds were granted, New Mexico was able to plug about 50 wells a year, but the OCD estimated the funds would allow the agency to clean up about 200 wells in the next 12 months. The money will also help remediate and restore the surfaces of another 50 to 60 locations.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New York will receive up to $524 million from drugmaker Teva to settle claims that the company contributed to the U.S. opioid epidemic, the largest amount secured from an opioid manufacturer or distributor sued by the state, Attorney General Letitia James announced Thursday. The state has reached a series of settlements with drug companies following an attorney general’s lawsuit in 2019 accusing them of deceptive marketing and failing to prevent the unlawful diversion of controlled substances. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and its affiliates were found liable last year for public nuisance charges by a jury on Long Island. To resolve the remedies phase, Teva agreed to pay out $313 million over 18 years, James said. New York will additionally receive $211 million from a $4.3 billion national settlement Teva agreed to in July if it is approved by state and local governments and tribes, according to the attorney general.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: North Carolina’s health agency is weighing whether to challenge a judge’s order demanding that the state ramp up services for people with intellectual and development disabilities to allow more of them to live at home or in their communities. In 2020, Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour ruled that too many such people were forced to live in institutions in violation of state law. Baddour allowed the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a plan to address the violation, but recommendations made by a consulting firm haven’t been carried out, the judge wrote Wednesday while directing his own remedies. Baddour ordered that at least 3,000 people must be diverted or shifted to community-based programs by early 2031. Separately, he told DHHS to eliminate before 2032 a waiting list of roughly 16,000 people who are qualified to participate in a Medicaid-funded program that helps them live at home or outside of an institution. A shortage of well-paid direct-care workers also must be addressed by the state Department of Health and Human Services, the judge ruled.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An invasive and destructive weed species threatening North Dakota agriculture has been found in three more counties. That raises the total to 19 counties in North Dakota where the so-called “super weed,” also known as Palmer amaranth, has been found since it was first identified in the state four years ago, The Bismarck Tribune reported. “We think it’s a very significant threat to our growers and ranchers,” said Tom Peters, an agronomist and weed control specialist at North Dakota State University and the University of Minnesota. Palmer amaranth can grow as tall as seven feet, even as much as 3 inches per day, and can resist many herbicides, produce hundreds of thousands of seeds and become strong enough to stop farm machinery, according to experts. A heavy infestation can cut soybean yields by as much as 79% and corn yields by up to 91%, according to research by Purdue University. The plants were recently found in Kidder, Williams and Stark counties, according to the state’s agriculture department. The findings were confirmed by the National Agricultural Genotyping Center at NDSU in Fargo.\n\nOhio\n\nLancaster: An exhibit in Ohio is evoking Christmas memories with a display of historic storybooks, vintage toys and costumes from the sets of the “Brady Bunch” of TV and movies. The show, “A Storybook Christmas Featuring a Very Brady Holiday,” opened Tuesday at the Decorative Arts Center of Ohio and runs through Dec. 31. The exhibition marks the opening of the holiday season at the historic Reese-Peters House that houses the museum. Across five rooms trimmed for the holidays, visitors will be invited to step into the pages of classic Christmas storybooks including “The Night Before Christmas,” “Polar Express” and “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.” Some children’s board books and pop-up books will be arranged with pages open for visitors to read, while others will be positioned along with toys under Christmas trees as gifts, replicating what Christmas morning may have looked like for the Bradys and other families in the 1960s and ’70s. Several costumes and props from the “Brady Bunch” sets have been incorporated into the display by co-curator Randall Thropp, who manages the Paramount Pictures Costume Archive. They include a two-piece pantsuit Florence Henderson wore in the episode where the Bradys travel to the Grand Canyon and a horse sculpture that appeared at the base of the Bradys’ staircase.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt granted another temporary reprieve to death row inmate Richard Glossip, pushing his scheduled execution back until February 2023 so that an appeals court has more time to consider his claim of innocence. Stitt, who is locked in a tough reelection contest, issued an executive order on Wednesday that delays Glossip’s execution, which was scheduled for Nov. 21. Stitt’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A clemency hearing for Glossip that was scheduled before the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board next week also will be delayed. Glossip received the death penalty for the 1997 murder-for-hire killing of his boss, motel owner Barry Van Treese. Prosecutors acknowledge Glossip did not kill Van Treese, but maintain that he paid the hotel maintenance man, Justin Sneed, to do it. Sneed, who received a life sentence but was spared the death penalty, was a key witness in two separate trials in which Glossip was convicted.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Portland City Council members voted Thursday to create at least three large designated campsites and ban the rest of the roughly 700 encampments currently scattered across the city. More than 3,000 people are living without shelter in Portland, a 50% jump from 2019, according to the proposal. “People on the streets deserve our compassion. They need our understanding, and many of them need our help to get off and stay off the streets,” Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said after the vote. “It is my personal view that these resolutions take an important step forward for the city of Portland to be able to do just that.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A measure to help the Pennsylvania Turnpike recover more unpaid tolls was signed into law Thursday, legislation that could trigger the suspension of thousands of vehicle registrations early next year. Gov. Tom Wolf gave final approval to legislation aimed at getting owners or operators of some 25,000 vehicles to pay their overdue bills for turnpike travel. After the law takes effect in two months, the process will start with the Turnpike Commission notifying registrants they are seeking to have their registrations suspended. At least a month later, the toll agency can ask the Transportation Department to start the process, and PennDOT said it will give the owners six weeks’ notice. “The customer is given several notices and opportunities to pay the tolls they owe before their registration is suspended,” PennDOT spokeswoman Alexis Campbell said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Police are investigating an anti-Semitic note left at the reception area of the Brown-Rhode Island School of Design Hillel Center on Sunday. In a letter to the Hillel community, Rabbi Josh Bolton said staff alerted both the campus police and Providence police. “I personally came to campus and met with detectives who opened an investigation into the incident. The investigation remains ongoing,” Rabbi Bolton wrote. Public safety officers, he said, determined there was no threat to Jewish students on campus. Hillel opened its doors Monday at 9 am. “While BRH takes any expression of anti-Semitism very seriously, we will not allow an incident like this to divert our focus from our core mission of building a flourishing Jewish community, and supporting the growth of Jewish students on College Hill,” Bolton wrote.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nChester: A man and his girlfriend suspected of killing five people in three states last year have pleaded guilty to two of the killings in South Carolina and have been sentenced to life in prison without parole, authorities said. Tyler Terry and Adrienne Simpson each pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and numerous other charges Wednesday in Chester County, according to media reports. Prosecutors agreed to not seek the death penalty in any of the five killings as long as the couple also pleaded guilty to two shootings near St. Louis, Missouri, and another in Memphis, Tennessee. All five deaths happened in May 2021, investigators said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The University of South Dakota received $552,381 to research the risk of emerging bed bug disease transmission in households across South Dakota earlier this month. On Oct. 7, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced seven universities were awarded $5.7 million to study populations at higher risk of being affected by home health hazards, like pests, injury hazards and asthma triggers. Those focus populations will be young children and seniors. Although there isn’t evidence that indicates bed bugs are transmitting disease, the goal of the “pro-active” research project is to identify if there’s a risk bed bugs could eventually be contributing to disease in households, said Jose Pietri, the USD assistant professor of microbiology leading the project.\n\nTennessee\n\nMt. Juliet: A Tennessee man who fled a traffic stop with an officer in the vehicle and refused to stop has been fatally shot, authorities said. The shooting happened after Mt. Juliet officers stopped a vehicle late Wednesday and asked the passenger, Eric Jermaine Allen, 39, to exit the vehicle, according to preliminary information from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Instead of exiting, Allen moved from the passenger seat to the driver’s seat and began to drive away, the bureau said in a statement. One of the officers attempted to stop Allen by leaning into the vehicle and gave commands for him to stop, but Allen drove away with the officer fully inside the vehicle, the statement said. The officer attempted to use a stun gun, but Allen continued to ignore commands to stop, prompting the officer to fatally shoot Allen. The officer was not injured. Bureau agents are working to independently determine the events leading to the shooting.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner revealed Wednesday that he underwent surgery and six weeks of radiation therapy during the summer for bone cancer in his jaw. Turner made the disclosure during a question-and-answer session after he delivered his annual State of the City address, the Houston Chronicle reported. Turner said he underwent nine hours of surgery on July 30 to remove the osteosarcoma. “Let me tell you, I have been blessed,” Turner said to applause. Turner missed a few weeks of City Council meetings while receiving his radiation therapy in August and September. His staff said he was undergoing medical treatment but did not specify what for. Turner, who has served as Houston’s mayor since 2016 after 27 years in the Texas House of Representatives, suffered a bout of COVID-19 last December.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The family of a Black fifth grader in Utah who died by suicide last year plans to file a $14 million lawsuit against her school, arguing that an inadequate response to reports of her being bullied over her race and disabilities led to her death. Attorneys representing Brittany Tichenor-Cox on Wednesday said they would seek damages for the 2021 death of her daughter, Isabella “Izzy” Tichenor. In a notice of claim, they said the school had violated state and federal laws, including those that require schools ensure equal treatment, provide educational opportunity and protect students experiencing homelessness. Notices of claim are required before people can sue government entities and the family’s claim said that the lawsuit will seek $14 million in damages. The notice of claim from Tichenor-Cox names Foxboro Elementary School in North Salt Lake City as a defendant, as well as its director and principal. It also names as defendants the Davis School District, school board and superintendent. They have 60 days to respond before the family can file a lawsuit based on the claim.\n\nVermont\n\nStratton: Game wardens are investigating a bear attack in the southern Vermont town of Stratton, the Department of Fish and Wildlife said Thursday. Wardens said the victim was treated for non-life-threatening injuries after the Wednesday evening attack and discharged from Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington. Officials did not describe the circumstances of the attack, but said more information would be made public as it becomes available. Vermont wildlife officials said earlier this year that the state was seeing a record number of risky encounters between human and bears.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Seeking to learn more about the election integrity unit of Virginia’s attorney general’s office, the state’s chapter of the NAACP has put down a $20,000 deposit to fulfill a request for unit records. Virginia’s NAACP President Robert Barnette said there’s not enough transparency about the unit and he feels the price aims to discourage the Freedom of Information Act request, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. “Given the importance of fair elections, the attorney general’s stated desire for transparency, we would have thought he would want to make these records public,” Barnette said in a news conference outside the state Capitol on Tuesday.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: The Bremerton City Council on Wednesday approved unanimously a plan to expand property tax exemptions for developers who build affordable housing in the city. The city remains “far behind the curve” in attracting affordable housing proposals and is thousands of units short of the number of people who desire to live in Bremerton, City Council President Michael Goodnow said. “I look at this as one tool in the toolbox toward solving our housing and homelessness issues,” Goodnow said. While beefing up what’s known as the city’s multifamily property tax exemption program, or MFTE for short, Mayor Greg Wheeler and other city council members had differing opinions about the best methods of bringing new affordable housing projects to the city. For now, the council created new property tax exemptions of both 12 and 20 years for developers who devote a fourth of their units to those defined as low income under a calculation using Kitsap County’s average income levels.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: A West Virginia elementary school principal has been honored as one of the nation’s top educators. Principal Andrea Trio of Madison Elementary in Wheeling received a $25,000 Milken Educator Award from the Milken Family Foundation on Thursday. Up to 40 elementary educators nationwide will receive the awards this school year. Trio is known for walking through the school halls singing with children, using music and other social-emotional behavioral tools to calm her young students. Trio earned a bachelor’s in music education in 2005 from West Virginia University and a master’s in educational leadership in 2014 from Hood College.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Madison Children’s Museum has fired a Wisconsin man with cognitive disabilities after he wore an Adolf Hitler costume over the Halloween weekend. The museum said the man believed he was making a mockery of the Nazi Party’s leader when he wore the costume on a busy street near the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus on Saturday. He was fired Tuesday night, after his costume was condemned on social media and by some news outlets, including the Jerusalem Post. The museum said in a statement that it fired the man after it “determined that his continued employment would create an environment at odds with our values and unwelcoming to visitors and staff.” The statement said the man’s costume was “completely unacceptable” and that the museum stands against antisemitism, bigotry and discrimination. The museum also said the man has cognitive disabilities due to a traumatic brain injury and that his work over the last decade has been supervised. “It is our understanding that he believed his costume to be mocking Hitler,” the statement said. The Madison Police Department called the costume “offensive and reprehensible,” but said wearing it was not a crime. Police said they told the man about the concerns his costume raised.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Sexual assault reports and complaints about equal-opportunity employment in the Wyoming National Guard have increased in the past year, a military official told state lawmakers Wednesday. While Greg Porter, adjutant general of the Wyoming National Guard, noted that sexual assault is a national problem, he told the state’s Joint Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee that the state ranks “among the top 10 in forcible rapes in the U.S.,” the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. State Rep. Mark Baker, R-Green River, said while reports in the Guard have risen – suggesting service members feel more comfortable speaking up – he still fears the numbers don’t properly illustrate the scope of the problem, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/01/03/what-laws-and-changes-ohio-lawmakers-want-to-pass-in-2023/69771350007/", "title": "What laws and changes Ohio lawmakers want to pass in 2023", "text": "A new set of state lawmakers was sworn in on Tuesday, and they've got big plans on everything from how the medical marijuana program should be run to whether Ohio should still impose the death penalty.\n\nThe 135th General Assembly will be dominated by Republican ideas. The GOP has the governorship as well as supermajorities in both the Ohio House and Ohio Senate. And it's expected they will exert that control during the budget process, which gets underway soon.\n\n\"I think, ultimately, a flat tax in Ohio is the goal of everyone,\" Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said. But questions still remain about \"where does it land\" and \"what are those brackets.\"\n\nDemocrats say they hope to influence budget conversations around how much to pay public schools and whether to raise reimbursement rates for healthcare providers. And the Senate's new minority leader has another big priority.\n\n\"I am determined, and my caucus is 100% behind this, to finally end the death penalty in Ohio,\" Sen. Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, said.\n\nHere's a list of what else leadership hopes to accomplish in 2023:\n\nMedical marijuana reform\n\nOhio became the 25th state to legalize medical marijuana in 2016, but the program hasn't worked as advocates hoped it would. High prices and a dearth of doctors who can recommend cannabis are among their two biggest complaints.\n\nMore:Ohio medical marijuana patients say prices too high, but program improving\n\nBut efforts to overhaul the program have failed.\n\n\"I think we all would agree it’s not comprehensive enough, really, to be used,\" Huffman said. And it's his goal to overhaul the program during this General Assembly.\n\nAntonio said she 100% supported the idea, though the \"devil\" would be in the details.\n\n\"We had a medical marijuana system created by people who really didn’t want to see us legalize medical marijuana,\" she said. \"When you don’t have 100% buy-in, you end up with something that is not fully functional.\"\n\nShe hopes any restructuring will include an emphasis on minority representation \"when it comes to who are the dispensers.\"\n\nReconfiguring Ohio's Department of Education\n\nIn the final hours of the last legislative session, Huffman tried to pass a law to change who controlled public education in Ohio. The 2,200-page bill would have stripped authority from the partially elected State Board of Education and given it to the governor.\n\n\"There was some trepidation because it was a short time frame,\" Huffman said.\n\nThe bill dropped after the midterm elections, leaving lawmakers in both chambers a few weeks to debate its merits. This new General Assembly will have two years to make a decision. Though Huffman previously said he hopes to pass something before the budget.\n\n\"I do think this is a really critical piece of legislation,\" Huffman said.\n\nHuffman has the support of the Senate Education Committee Chair Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware. The legislation is a big priority for him in 2023.\n\nMore:How a controversial plan to change who controlled public education unraveled\n\nAbortion discussions will continue\n\nRepublicans haven't passed any new abortion laws since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer.\n\n\"When it wasn’t possible for them to come up with something during lame duck, which we all expected, that was very telling,\" Antonio said.\n\nThe internal debate among GOP members appears to be about how far they should go in restricting access when a ballot measure to codify protections for the procedure in the state constitution is likely on its way. Some members want to ban all access from the moment of conception while others want to take a more measured approach.\n\n\"There is a range of feeling on each side as to what the specifics should be,\" Huffman said. The challenge is \"trying to coalesce that into language that’s going to get the support of most of the people...I think we can continue down that path.\"\n\nEnding the death penalty\n\nGov. Mike DeWine has delayed all scheduled executions since he became governor in 2019.\n\nThe lifelong Catholic officially put all death row sentences on indefinite hold in 2020 because lethal injection — the state's only legal method for execution — wasn't possible once pharmaceutical companies stopped selling drugs for this purpose.\n\n\"Lethal injection appears to us to be impossible from a practical point of view,\" he said.\n\nBut other Republicans have wondered whether DeWine, the former Ohio attorney general, has had a change of heart. Conservatives like Sen. Kristina Roegner, R-Hudson, have come out against the practice, saying her pro-life beliefs led to a \"change of heart\" on the issue.\n\n\"We’ve been having conversations for years around this,\" Antonio said. But the last general assembly was the first time both Republicans and Democrats backed a plan to ban the practice.\n\n\"I think we can do it,\" she said. \"I do believe this could be the general assembly that we get it done.\"\n\nPassing the Ohio Fairness Act\n\nAnother priority for the new Senate minority leader is passing a law that would outlaw discrimination for those in the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe \"Ohio Fairness Act\" has been introduced 10 different times. If passed, it would ban employers, landlords, schools and other kinds of public accommodations from denying services based on a person's sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nBut just like banning the death penalty, 2021 was the first time any Ohio Republicans signed onto the legislation.\n\nSen. Michael Rulli, R-Salem, said the last version would make every Ohioan feel welcome. And business groups like the Ohio Chamber of Commerce supported it because they believed it would help employers recruit the best and brightest talent.\n\n\"It's about making sure Ohio is a place where young people want to put down roots,\" Antonio said.\n\nGun control and mental health\n\nSen. Matt Dolan, R-Chagrin Falls, has introduced and amended two different versions of a gun control bill in the last two general assemblies.\n\nThe last iteration stepped back from what is traditionally considered \"a red flag law\" and focused on restricting future gun purchases after a court declares someone dangerous to themselves or others.\n\nThat didn't pass, but Dolan said \"what really developed was a great conversation.\"\n\nLawmakers did approve $90 million for six regional crisis centers, but Dolan wants to keep working on this issue in 2023.\n\n\"I give Sen. Dolan a lot of credit because he keeps trying,\" Antonio said. \"I think there are some reasonable measures that the majority of people in the state of Ohio and across the country already embrace. You can support the Second Amendment and also support sensible gun measures. They don’t have to cancel each other out. It's possible to do both.\"\n\nWhen it comes to mental health generally, DeWine said he appreciated the money Dolan managed to secure from the last legislature, and he plans to make the issue a big part of his upcoming budget.\n\nMedicaid reform\n\nHuffman is creating a new Senate committee that's focused exclusively on the Ohio Department of Medicaid.\n\nHe wants its members to focus on \"the need for real reform,\" and the fact that Ohio has \"a lot of providers who are not being appropriately compensated.\"\n\nBoth Dolan, who chairs the finance committee, and Antonio said they expect to hear a lot from Medicaid's list of providers once the budget process gets underway.\n\n\"They’re doing their work,\" Antonio said. \"They are calling and reaching out and telling us what the reality is on the ground.\"\n\nReducing income taxes\n\nIn 2021, Republicans passed a $1.6 billion reduction in Ohio's income tax – the largest cut in state budget history. And it's possible that this year will be no different.\n\n\"It's a tax we would like to minimize,\" Huffman said.\n\nOhio has eliminated some of the state's income tax brackets in each of the last three biennial budgets, dropping from nine down to three.\n\n\"Now, we have to look at taxes in terms of impact. What will have the most positive economic growth for everyone,\" Dolan said.\n\nHe wasn't ready to divulge any specifics yet but \"that’s where I am going to spend a great deal of time.\"\n\nAntonio, however, isn't convinced that's a good idea because income tax cuts can come with sales tax increases.\n\n\"That affects lower-income folks much more than the wealthy,\" she said.\n\nNo guarantees for new school funding formula\n\nOhio implemented a brand new formula for how it calculates what school districts should receive from the state in the last budget, but Senate President Huffman didn't commit to using it in the new one.\n\n\"Every budget is a two-year budget,\" he said. And what one general assembly does isn't binding on the next.\n\nAnna Staver is a reporter for the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau, which serves the Columbus Dispatch, Cincinnati Enquirer, Akron Beacon Journal and 18 other affiliated news organizations across Ohio.\n\nGet more political analysis by listening to the Ohio Politics Explained podcast", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/09/hospital-wedding-howard-celebrates-home-order-news-around-states/114749772/", "title": "Hospital wedding, Howard celebrates: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: An organization for teachers is expressing concern that children are being allowed to return to school before completing required COVID-19 quarantine periods, potentially putting the health of students and school employees at risk. The Alabama Education Association sent a letter Thursday to the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners saying it had learned some doctors are writing excuses for students to return to school before mandated quarantine periods expired. Theron Stokes, associate executive director of AEA, said doctors should be aware of the guidelines and follow them. “When students return to school having not completed the entire 14-day quarantine period, they are placing their fellow students and their schools’ employees at risk. For students and school employees who have underlying health conditions, these decisions can be deadly,” Stokes wrote. The group said it is gross negligence to ignore the quarantine guidelines and threatened possible legal action.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s largest city plans to boost enforcement of an expanded mask mandate and restrict gathering sizes in a bid to curb coronavirus cases, officials said Friday. The changes take effect Monday, with masks to be worn, with a few exceptions, in indoor public settings or communal areas and outdoors when distancing from non-household members is not possible. In some cases, such as for individuals with disabilities who cannot tolerate a mask, face shields will be allowed unless wearing one would be impossible, the order says. Masks are to be worn by school-age children older than 5, those who exercise or work at gyms, and athletes, players, coaches and officials who participate in organized sports, according to the municipality directives. Athletes must keep a mask on for indoor sports, but one is not required while “exercising vigorously outdoors,” the directives state.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A top hospital official urged Arizonans to help curb the spread of the coronavirus by considering alternatives to traditional Thanksgiving get-togethers. “Congregating in large groups and close contact with others outside of your immediate household put you and those around you at risk,” said Dr. Marjorie Bessell, chief clinical officer of Banner Health. “I know we are asking a lot of you.” Banner operates 23 hospitals in Arizona and several in other states. Arizona health officials on Sunday reported 1,880 new COVID-19 cases and 17 additional deaths. State Department of Health Services officials said the latest figures increase Arizona’s totals to 259,264 cases and 6,164 known deaths since the coronavirus pandemic began. Cases and hospitalizations have been steadily increasing in Arizona since late September and throughout October after bottoming out in August after the state was a national hot spot in June and July.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state hit a record one-day increase in coronavirus cases Friday for the second day in a row, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he was growing concerned about hospital capacity. The Department of Health said the state’s probable and confirmed virus cases rose by 1,870. The state’s previous one-day high came Thursday, when it reported 1,548 new cases. On Saturday the department reported 1,598 new cases and 12 additional deaths for totals of 120,828 cases and 2,068 deaths since the pandemic began. The department reported 722 hospitalizations, 16 more than Friday’s then-record high. “Today’s numbers show we are not in a good position as we head into the colder months,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Friday. “I ask all Arkansans to take this virus seriously and to take necessary precautions. Our number of new cases is growing at a rate that worries me in terms of our hospital capacity.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: Republican former U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa was victorious Saturday in his race to return to Congress, where he once headed the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and became a GOP favorite for launching a string of investigations of the Obama administration. The former nine-term congressman and ardent supporter of President Donald Trump trailed early in the San Diego-area 50th District. But as more votes were counted after Election Day, he overtook Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar. The latest vote count update gave him about 54% of the votes and a 23,000-vote lead. Issa already had declared victory in a statement posted to social media Friday night. Campa-Najjar, a 31-year-old former Obama administration official, was making his second bid for the seat. He received more votes than he did in 2018 and thanked his supporters for “giving a Latino-Arab American a chance to do something special.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: City officials are urging residents to stay home between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. in an effort to stem the tide of coronavirus cases, which could overwhelm area hospitals by the end of the year. Mayor Michael Hancock said during a virtual news conference Friday that the “Home by 10 Order,” which will last for at least 30 days, is necessary to avoid another citywide stay-at-home order. He also urged residents not to gather or mix with other households. “I’m not going to mince any words here when it comes to the spread of the coronavirus,” Hancock said. “We’re on a very dangerous path. We’re seeing rapid, significant increases in the numbers of people getting sick, and many of those people ended up in the hospital.” The mayor shied away from calling the order a curfew because he said enforcement would only target the most egregious violations – not, for instance, someone walking their dog or going for a run after 10 p.m.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: Several colleges and universities have added new restrictions for students as coronavirus cases continue to rise in the state. Quinnipiac University announced it is instituting a two-week quarantine after recording 155 positive tests on campus since Wednesday. The quarantine means residential students must stay in their rooms, except to pick up takeout meals from the dining hall, and students living off campus can only return for testing. Students in isolation who have tested positive for the coronavirus will have meals delivered to their rooms each night. At Yale University, students residing in Davenport, Hopper, and Saybrook Colleges were ordered to quarantine because of positive coronavirus tests. In Fairfield, Sacred Heart and Fairfield universities have instituted curfews. The state reported Friday that 22 more people were hospitalized with COVID-19, bringing the total to 402, the highest total in five months.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: For the Rehoboth Beach Film Society, the show (or shows) must go on. The 23rd annual Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival is taking place as scheduled this month with a few modifications for health concerns. Only five films will be shown inside the society’s Cinema Art Theater, with 10 more available to stream at home. “We had the opportunity to carry out this event with the safety of our viewers as a priority,” said Rehoboth Beach Film Society Executive Director Sue Early. “They can watch films at home this year. It’s not the same experience, but there’s some great films to see. And in our theater, we could be showing at 60%, and we’re only going to use 30 out of 104 seats, which is just under 29%. They are well-spaced and cleaned after every screening. So it’s really safe.” Tickets are on sale now for the festival, which runs Nov. 5-15.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Hundreds of people gathered on the campus of Howard University on Saturday to celebrate their sister Kamala Harris after her announcement as vice president-elect, WUSA-TV reports. “When you come to Howard University, that is a very distinct choice,” said Niambi Carter, associate professor of political science at Howard University. “You are choosing a legacy and a lineage that is great in so many aspects.” A large group of Alpha chapter members of Alpha Kappa Alpha gathered in front of the sorority’s plot on the yard to cheer for Harris’ election. “I’m so proud of Kamala, and I’m so proud to stand on the grounds where she walked,” alumna Kenya Sumner said. Harris graduated from Howard with a degree in political science and economics in 1986, the same year she became a member of the Alpha chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first historically black sorority, founded on Howard’s campus.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrange Park: Eight weeks after being admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, Henry Bell and his longtime fiancee decided the time was right for a wedding. So the day before his anticipated release from the inpatient rehab center at Orange Park Medical Center, Bell, 63, and Antionette Brown, 48, said their vows in the parking lot Thursday. Brown’s uncle performed the ceremony. “His condition was deadly,” Brown said. “We decided to do it now because we feel they (the hospital staff) are like family and wanted to share the life they gave us back.” Bell was admitted to the hospital Sept. 13 and immediately put on a ventilator. Brown and the couple’s seven grown children could only wait and hope for his condition to improve. He spent weeks in intensive care. He entered the hospital’s rehab center Sunday, and his recovery has included learning how to walk again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Athens-Clarke County plans to rent space for jury trials and grand jury proceedings. Grand juries and trials have been on hold in the state since March 14, when state Supreme Court Chief Justice Harold Melton declared a statewide judicial emergency because of the coronavirus threat. In subsequent renewal orders, Melton amended them to allow for court proceedings if they could be conducted safely. The best option for holding court proceedings in Athens-Clarke County is by using the Classic Center, said a committee tasked with deciding the issue. The county will pay the Classic Center up to $350,815 to rent space for the proceedings. The price Athens-Clarke will pay includes daily cleaning of the rooms used for trial proceedings, including space to conduct actual trials and a jury deliberation room. The $350,815 amount is based on the cost of 30 jury trials that last an average of five days each.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Land and Natural Resources reopened a popular scenic spot on Oahu that has been closed to visitors since the outbreak of the coronavirus. The Nuuanu Pali State Wayside, popularly known as Pali Lookout, was closed to the public at the outset of the pandemic because of budgetary constraints and crowding concerns. There were challenges in maintaining physical distancing at the lookout, State Parks Administrator Curt Cottrell said. Officials announced the park, which is among the most visited spots on Oahu, reopened Wednesday with daily hours of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. The gates to the park’s access roads will be unlocked and secured daily by the Honolulu Police Department. The state set new parking fees of $7 per vehicle for nonresidents. Hawaii residents are not subject to parking and entry fees at any state parks. Tour buses are largely absent from the lookout, making the volume of visitors much lower.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A state panel of medical experts is asking the governor for a statewide mask mandate, and hospitals are running out of space for COVID-19 patients, after a week marked with record numbers of new cases and deaths. At least 671 Idaho residents have died from the coronavirus, and a record high of 1,290 new COVID-19 cases were reported on Wednesday alone, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, followed by 1,265 new cases Thursday. More than 69,500 residents have been confirmed to have the illness since the pandemic began. Idaho hospitals have reported more than 200 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 every day since Oct. 12. On Nov. 2, the most recent data available, there were nearly 300 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Jeanie Gentry, CEO of Steele Memorial Medical Center in Salmon, told the Idaho Statesman the facility is short about 40% of its staffers because they’ve been exposed or sickened.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has tested negative for the coronavirus after learning he may have been exposed during a meeting to someone who tested positive. Members of Pritzker’s staff who attended the meeting last Monday also tested negative for the virus, his office said Saturday in a news release. Pritzker had self-isolated Friday while awaiting test results. They were the second negative test results for Pritzker and staff members who also underwent weekly tests Wednesday, according to his office. Meanwhile, 12,438 newly confirmed and probable cases of the virus and another 76 deaths were reported Saturday by the Illinois Department of Public Health. More than 10,370 new cases and 49 deaths were reported Friday. Illinois has had nearly 478,000 cases of the coronavirus and more than 10,150 deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: The University of Notre Dame’s Faculty Senate formally expressed disappointment in the school president’s failure to wear a face mask at a White House event days before he tested positive for the coronavirus. The Faculty Senate voted 29-13 on Thursday for a resolution expressing disappointment in the Rev. John Jenkins’ failure to wear a mask and practice social distancing at a Sept. 26 Rose Garden ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor confirmed last month as a U.S. Supreme Court justice. The Faculty Senate was originally expected to vote on a no confidence resolution, but that was amended. Jenkins tested positive for the coronavirus days after the Rose Garden ceremony, where President Donald Trump introduced Barrett as his nominee to the high court. Jenkins was seen without a mask, and he shook hands and sat shoulder-to-shoulder with others.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State prison officials reported Friday that a coronavirus outbreak has infected nearly half of the inmates at a prison in Anamosa. Testing last week revealed 476 inmates among 985 at the prison tested positive for the virus, said Cord Overton, a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Corrections. A report provided by the department indicates 37 staff members also tested positive. Across the nine institutions the department manages, 601 inmates were infected as of Friday afternoon. The report shows coronavirus has been active in the prison system since testing began in March with more than 21,000 tests administered to inmates. It said 1,252 inmates have recovered, an indication they have at one time tested positive but are no longer symptomatic are believed to be contagious. Four Iowa inmates have died during the pandemic, the report said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state saw most of a projected budget shortfall melt away Friday with a fiscal forecast that is less pessimistic about the economy and tax collections than a dire estimate issued this spring during a statewide lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic. The forecasting group boosted the state’s forecast for tax collections by $463 million, or 6.3%, for the 2021 budget year that began July 1. The group also issued its first calculations for the 2022 budget year that starts in July 2021, and while the forecast predicts a drop in tax collections of 2.1%, or $166 million, that’s due largely to the end of a temporary, pandemic-induced move to help income taxpayers. The Legislature’s nonpartisan research staff now projects a $153 million budget shortfall for the state’s 2022 budget year, an amount that almost can be covered by an internal shuffling of government funds that Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly already has proposed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s bar and restaurant operators are getting a break from alcoholic beverage renewal fees in a cost-saving step as they struggle with revenue losses from the pandemic. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is granting a 12-month fee renewal waiver to license holders, Gov. Andy Beshear said Thursday. Bar and restaurant operators who haven’t submitted the renewal fee this year won’t have to pay until 2021, he said. Those who have paid this year will have their fees waived in 2021, he said. “This has certainly been a difficult year for our bars, restaurants and venues, and they deserve this innovative support as we face what could be a very painful winter,” Beshear said. Bars and restaurants have endured capacity limitations to help contain the coronavirus. The fee waiver doesn’t apply to producers, distributors, wholesalers and others able to continue operations throughout the virus-related state of emergency.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: In response to complaints that family and clergy were barred from hospitals and nursing homes amid the coronavirus pandemic, legislators have rewritten state laws to lessen visitation restrictions during public health emergencies. The bills passed unanimously in the special session that ended last month and were signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. They still will give discretion to the Louisiana Department of Health to decide just how wide-open the visitation can be and what safety protections will have to be followed. One measure by Sen. Robert Mills, a Minden Republican, calls on the health department to create rules requiring inpatient health care facilities to allow pastors, priests and other members of the clergy to visit patients during a public health emergency, if the patient asks for the visit.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials on Friday recommended caution at more schools in the state because of the rise in coronavirus cases. The state uses a color-coded system to categorize the level of precaution schools should use. The administration of Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said it’s adding schools in Knox County and Franklin County to the “yellow” category, which is an intermediate level. Those counties join Somerset and Washington counties in the yellow category. All other counties in the state are in the “green” category, the lowest level, though officials said they’re closely monitoring schools in Waldo and Kennebec counties. The state recommends that schools located in counties in the yellow category consider hybrid instruction models to reduce the number of people in schools and classrooms. The change in category for some schools came as cases surged around the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city is tightening restrictions on restaurants and indoor and outdoor gatherings in response to rising cases of the coronavirus, Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young announced Friday. The changes will take effect Thursday at 5 p.m. Young said numbers of people in restaurants, religious facilities, theaters and malls will be limited to 25% capacity. Young said food service establishments must close indoor dining at 10 p.m. Bars that don’t have a license to sell food will be closed. “I am instituting these restrictions for the public health and to save lives in Baltimore city,” Young said. Also, the city’s health commissioner revised an order to require masks to be worn in public at all times, whether people are inside or outside. Dr. Letitia Dzirasa’s order is effective immediately. “Over the past month Baltimore city has seen our data trends move in the wrong direction,” she said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State officials on Friday urged more schools to return to full, in-person instruction, saying that only communities with the highest COVID-19 rates should be using any form of remote learning. Under previous guidance, schools were told to shift among remote learning, in-person learning or a mix of the two depending on their area’s infection rate. Areas with moderate spread were advised to use remote or hybrid learning, while only those with the lowest rates were encouraged to bring students back full time. But speaking at a news conference, Gov. Charlie Baker said there’s growing evidence that schools are not a significant source of spread and that keeping students at home hurts their learning and mental health. “We continue to see too many communities with children learning in remote-only models,” he said. “We all know that losing a week, a month, a quarter or more in the life of a kid’s education has real consequences.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Joe Biden reclaimed the Wolverine State for Democrats with a surge of support in urban regions like Detroit and Grand Rapids, offsetting high turnout in rural and exurban areas for President Donald Trump. Biden’s 146,000-vote margin, 2.7 percentage points, was powered by gains in big, vote-rich counties such as Oakland near Detroit and Kent, which includes Grand Rapids – amid a record 5.5 million people casting ballots statewide. Biden won Oakland by 14 points, besting Hillary Clinton’s 8-point edge in 2016. He carried Kent by almost 6 points after Trump netted it by 3 points four years ago. Trump again won traditional bellwether Macomb County outside Detroit, by roughly 8 points – less than his 11-point margin in 2016, however. Biden became just the second Democratic presidential candidate to carry Kent in more than 50 years, after Barack Obama did it in his first run.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: COVID-19 is sweeping across the state at an unprecedented pace, breaking records for new cases and daily deaths and raising concerns about the ability of hospitals to keep up. The Star Tribune reports Saturday’s tally of 4,647 new cases – a figure that would have easily set a record during the first eight months of the pandemic – wasn’t even close to the biggest single-day count of the past week. For the seven-day period ending Saturday, Minnesota reported more than 25,000 new COVID-19 cases, or more than 10% of the state’s cases since March. The Minnesota Department of Health reported another 34 deaths Saturday, bringing the week’s total to 168, the second-highest one-week count since the start of the pandemic. Hospitals, meanwhile, are scrambling to treat more COVID-19 patients even as the virus threatens to sideline more health care workers.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Health has been working around the clock to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Now, the agency will be responsible for starting a statewide medical marijuana program within the next nine months. Uncertified election results showed 74% of Mississippi voters approved the ballot measure that allows doctors to prescribe up to 5 ounces of marijuana per month for people who have at least one of more than 20 serious medical conditions. “This vote shows minds are changing,” said Jaqueline Temple Rudder, a homemaker from Madison County who lost her father-in-law to cancer and voted for Initiative 65. “We don’t want our sick suffering.” Both Gov. Tate Reeves and state’s top health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, opposed the initiative. Officials with the Department of Health will have until August to begin licensing treatment centers and certifying eligible patients.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Local health departments in the state don’t have enough staffers to conduct contact tracing for all the COVID-19 cases popping up, so they have been prioritizing the ones they try to trace back to their sources, officials said. The state’s rate of positive tests over the past two weeks is more than double the national average, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Larry Jones, who heads the Missouri Center for Public Health Excellence, said local health departments are struggling to keep up with contact tracing, which helps determine how a disease is spreading. Missouri on Sunday reported 4,131 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three more deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Missouri has risen over the past two weeks, from about 1,789 new cases per day Oct. 24 to about 3,126 as of Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A nursing facility in Butte has reported 10 COVID-19-related deaths in less than two weeks, and Gallatin County on Friday enacted stricter measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. Montana has hit a record for hospitalizations, and the confirmed number of infection cases was closing in on 38,000, state officials said. The state health department confirmed 986 more cases of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the total for the past week to 6,040, or an average of 863 cases per day. Over the previous week, the daily average was 779. Montana has reported 418 deaths, which may not include all 10 deaths tied to the outbreak at the Continental Care & Rehabilitation nursing facility in Butte. The Gallatin County health board on Friday said bars, restaurants and casinos must close by 10 p.m. instead of 12:30 a.m. They must also limit group sizes at tables to six adults plus children who are with a parent or guardian.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to report record numbers of new coronavirus cases and people hospitalized with the virus. Health officials said the surge in cases over the past month continued Friday with 2,681 new cases and 748 people hospitalized with the virus. Both those were new records, and the state’s rate of new cases was the seventh-highest in the nation. The state said 27 new deaths were reported Friday to give Nebraska 701 deaths. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has increased over the past two weeks from 836.71 new cases per day Oct. 23 to 1,408.86 new cases per day Friday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Also Friday, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said nine more staff members had tested positive for the virus to give it a total of 225 staff members who have been diagnosed with the virus. The department said the ill staffers are all isolating themselves at home.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Democrats successfully won reelection in the swing state’s two battleground congressional districts. First-term Rep. Susie Lee won reelection to a second term by defeating former professional wrestler Dan Rodimer in the 3rd District. Republicans believed the Las Vegas-area district offered them their best chance at unseating an incumbent. Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford was reelected in the state’s other battleground district, defeating Republican former Assemblyman Jim Marchant. Lee and Horsford’s victories cement a six-year hold on Nevada’s swing districts, which Democrats have won in the three most recent elections, and helps Democrats hoping maintain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, where many races remain too early to call with votes left to be counted. The result sends Nevada’s existing delegation back to Washington, D.C.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth-Hitchcock is again putting strict limits on visitors to its hospitals and outpatient clinics in response to the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Effective Friday, visitors are banned under most circumstances. Limited exceptions will be made for pediatric patients, women giving birth, patients at the end of life and those in a few other circumstances. The return to more restrictive policies applies to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon as well as the health system’s outpatient clinics and facilities. Officials said their decision was based on the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in both New Hampshire and Vermont. Meanwhile, the state’s court system said it is suspending in-person hearings for a few days after Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Day to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday named his associate counsel to lead the commission that will oversee the state’s new recreational marijuana marketplace. Dianna Houenou, who serves as legal counsel to Murphy’s administration, will chair the Cannabis Regulatory Commission. Before working in Murphy’s administration, Houenou was policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union in New Jersey. Murphy, a Democrat, made the announcement just days after New Jersey voters approved a constitutional amendment legalizing recreational marijuana for people 21 and older. The amendment goes into effect at the start of next year and calls for state regulators to set up a marketplace for the legal sale of the drug. It’s unclear when marijuana will be ready to hit retail shelves in the state. Advocates for legalization said the soonest they expect it could happen toward the end of 2021.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State officials have the power to impose civil penalties when enforcing public health orders that call for businesses to restrict their operations amid a public health emergency, the state Supreme Court said Friday. The unanimous written opinion details the legal reasoning for an oral decision made by the court in August in a case brought by businesses that challenged health orders issued as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham had petitioned the court to resolve the dispute. Lujan Grisham has warned that more restrictions could be imposed as early as this week as infections, hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase. She also said she has been disappointed in enforcement, pointing to businesses and country clubs in Albuquerque and elsewhere that hosted Halloween parties despite the ban on gatherings.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Restrictions in some New York City pandemic hot spots will be rolled back, even as the state prepares to combat coronavirus flare-ups upstate, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday. The governor said he’s considering imposing additional social distancing restrictions in “microcluster” zones in the Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse areas because of rising infection rates. The addition of more of those zones upstate reflect the shifting state strategy as COVID-19 becomes a worsening problem beyond New York City, once an epicenter of the pandemic. The governor also said the National Guard will increase its presence at airports to help make sure travelers from non-neighboring states can provide proof of a negative coronavirus test. “In general, downstate New York is doing better than upstate New York, which is a total reversal from the first phase of COVID,” Cuomo said during a telephone briefing.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans pressed state election officials Friday to make public more information about the number of outstanding ballots from last week’s election that could be counted. Nearly a dozen Election Day races in North Carolina, including those for president and U.S. Senate, remained too early to call because as many as 172,000 ballots had either yet to be counted or rejected, or could trickle in before this week’s deadline to receive mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day. The actual number of ballots that will arrive is likely to be less, however, because many people who requested absentee ballots ended up voting on Election Day or perhaps didn’t vote at all. And past elections show a significant portion of the 41,000 provisional ballots cast Tuesday will be rejected.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A child with COVID-19 has been confirmed to have a rare condition that causes inflammation in different parts of the body, state health officials said Friday. The child, who was discharged from the hospital and is resting at home, is the first confirmed case of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in the state. “This development is an unfortunate reminder that COVID-19 can impact people of any age, even children,” Dr. Joan Connell, Department of Health field medical officer and pediatrician, said in a statement. “The best way to help prevent your child from getting MIS-C is to take action to avoid exposure to the COVID-19 virus and teach your child how to do the same.” MIS-C – short for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children – can inflame the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes or gastrointestinal organs. Children with it have experienced persistent fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes and fatigue. Long-term effects are unknown.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The number of coronavirus cases in the state has continued to spike despite pleas from the governor for people to help slow the spread. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Ohio has risen over the past two weeks from 2,084 new cases per day Oct. 22 to 3,748 new cases per day Thursday, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in the state has also risen over the past two weeks from 4.96% on Oct. 22 to 7.93% on Thursday, according to the tracking hub. The Health Department on Friday reported 5,008 probable and confirmed cases, another daily record high. Ohio has reported more than 240,000 probable and confirmed cases to date, including 5,494 deaths. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday that he planned to announce additional measures soon to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of newly reported coronavirus cases in the state Saturday more than doubled the previous one-day record, and the Department of Health said a backlog of cases and possibly duplicate reporting were the reason. There were 4,741 new cases, bringing the total to 136,492 since the pandemic began, the department said. The previous one-day record of 2,101 new cases was recorded Thursday as cases in the state have surged in recent weeks. “We have reason to believe that our normal case count would have continued on an upward trajectory without the backlog and duplication,” which is due to a transition from a manual to electronic reporting system, according to a health department statement. In a statement, Gov. Kevin Stitt called on residents to wash hands often, socially distance and voluntarily wear masks at indoor public places.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Following a record-breaking day of COVID-19 cases in the state, officials announced new restrictions Friday that will be implemented in at least five of the state’s counties as part of a two-week pause on social activities. The updated safety measures, which begin Wednesday, include halting visitations to long-term care facilities, reducing the capacity of indoor dining at restaurants to 50 people, encouraging all businesses to mandate working from home, and urging Oregonians not to gather with people who do not live in their household – but if they do to limit it to six people. If people have multiple get-togethers, which is discouraged, it should be the same social circle of six people. “Let me be clear, we cannot allow this disease to continue to spread so rapidly in our communities. Lives are at stake,” Gov. Kate Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Bail has been set at $750,000 each for two men authorities said were armed with loaded handguns when they were arrested near the city’s convention center where votes were being counted. Joshua Macias, 42, and Antonio LaMotta, 61, traveled from the Virginia Beach, Virginia, area in a Hummer and did not have permits to carry the weapons in Pennsylvania, police said. They were charged with carrying a concealed firearm without a license and carrying a firearm on a public street. The men were stopped Thursday about a block from the vehicle, Macias with a .40-caliber Beretta handgun inside his jacket and LaMotta with a 9 mm Beretta in a holster, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said. An AR-style rifle and ammunition were found inside the vehicle, Outlaw said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: Protesters gathered near a prison that houses federal detainees Friday, denouncing the facility’s contract with U.S. immigration authorities and pointing to a surge in coronavirus infections among detainees. Demonstrators blocked roads leading to the Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, where authorities say more than 150 detainees have tested positive for COVID-19. Activists have repeatedly called for Wyatt’s closure, saying conditions are subpar. The publicly owned but privately operated lockup has about 540 inmates in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In April, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal class-action lawsuit seeking the release of dozens of detainees, saying the virus was spreading “uncontrollably.” More than two dozen detainees subsequently were freed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two days after his opponent proclaimed victory in South Carolina’s 1st District, freshman U.S. House Rep. Joe Cunningham conceded defeat Friday, saying he was proud of the work he had done in his single term in Congress and pledging to continue to work toward bipartisan progress as a private citizen. Standing in front of the U.S. Customs House in Charleston, Cunningham told supporters that he had called Republican Nancy Mace to offer support and congratulations. “She’s now my representative,” Cunningham said. “I’m rooting for her.” The Associated Press called the race for Mace early Wednesday morning, but Cunningham did not concede, citing scanning issues with absentee ballots in one of the district’s counties. In her victory, Mace, 42, becomes the first Republican woman elected to Congress in South Carolina and only the second-ever woman from the state elected to a full House term.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: More than 100 state residents have died of complications due to the coronavirus in the first eight days of November, health officials said Sunday. The Department of Health confirmed 13 deaths in the past day, for a total of 111 this month and 536 since the start of the pandemic. The overall death count is the 24th-highest per capita in the country in the past two weeks, Johns Hopkins University researchers said. The state reported 1,426 positive tests for COVID-19 since Saturday. South Dakota ranks second in the country behind North Dakota in the number of new cases per capita in the past two weeks. The top five counties with the most cases per capita in that time are Bon Homme, Dewey, Buffalo, Potter and Sanborn, according to the COVID Tracking Project. There are 546 people being treated in hospitals in the state, up 31 in the past day. Of those, 96 are in intensive care units, and 69 are using ventilators.\n\nTennessee\n\nJohnson City: Health officials in northeastern Tennessee say they do not have enough nurses to combat COVID-19 inside the region’s hospital system. “There are no longer enough nurses to fill the need that we have,” Ballad Health Senior Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer Lisa Smithgall told WJHL-TV. According to Ballad Health, the hospital system is looking to hire 350 registered nurses to fill its nurse shortage. “In the last eight weeks, we’ve had more than 900 patients admitted to COVID-19,” said Ballad Health Chief Administrative Officer Eric Deaton. After hitting 200 inpatients last week, the health care system has adjusted its COVID-19 surge plan to receive 300 inpatients. “These numbers represent lives; they’re non-encouraging,” Deaton said. “In fact, it’s really becoming a tragedy in the increased rates that we’re seeing.”\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: A district judge on Friday upheld an order from El Paso County’s top elected official shutting down businesses while the region fights an alarming surge in COVID-19 cases. The decision from Judge Bill Moody of El Paso’s 34th District Court came as federal military medical teams deployed to the border region at the request of the state. The county’s top elected official, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego, ordered a two-week shutdown of nonessential activities late last month. In making his decision, Moody pointed out that during the Spanish flu pandemic in the early part of the 20th century, city and county elected officials had authority to respond as they “thought was necessary to protect the health and financial interests of their individual communities.” Chris Hilton, an attorney with the Texas attorney general’s office, said the state would appeal.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s largest teachers union called for the governor to move all public secondary schools in high coronavirus transmission areas to remote learning Friday as the state reported a single-day record of 17 COVID-19 deaths. The Utah Education Association also called for Republican Gov. Gary Herbert to suspend all extracurricular activities that can’t comply with social distancing guidelines in high transmission areas from the Thanksgiving holiday throughout winter break. “We are now seeing multiple schools repeatedly shift back and forth from in-person to at-home learning due to outbreaks,” the union wrote in a statement. “This cycle is obviously not helping to control the virus spread and, as educators, we can unequivocally state the continual interruptions are not in the best interest of student learning.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott said Friday that comments by President Donald Trump casting doubts on the integrity of the election process are hurting society. Scott said all legal votes cast in the 2020 election need to be counted, including mail-in votes. Scott’s comments came a day after President Donald Trump made baseless claims of fraud in the ballot-counting process for the presidential election. Scott said that the president’s comments are “inciting a lot of rhetoric” and that many of his followers take him at his word. “I don’t believe any of the statements he made last night are true, and I do believe it is hurting our society and our ability to work together,” Scott said. After voting Tuesday, he said he had cast his presidential ballot for former Vice President Joe Biden. He said he had never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate before but had to put “country over party.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Freshman Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger has kept her seat in a competitive congressional race in the Richmond suburbs. The former CIA operations officer defeated Republican challenger and state House delegate Nick Freitas in a close race that was called Sunday. Spanberger is considered one of Congress’ more moderate Democrats and was part of a wave of women who helped Democrats retake the U.S. House in 2018. But Freitas had tried to tie Spanberger to her party’s leadership and said it was out of sync with constituents. Spanberger spent nearly a decade with the CIA, working on counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation cases. She is one of two moderate Virginia Democrats who held on to U.S. House seats they flipped from red to blue two years ago, as Democrats’ strength in the Old Dominion continues to grow.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state set a daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 1,777 new confirmed cases announced Saturday, and the state Department of Health warned that COVID-19 cases are spreading in the Puget Sound region. In a statement, the health agency said the high numbers the state has seen over the past week reflect an overall surge that started in mid-September. King, Snohomish and Pierce counties are currently the hot spots in the region, officials said. “COVID-19 is currently spreading very quickly in Washington state,” said Secretary of Health John Wiesman. “We are very concerned that disease transmission will only grow over the next few weeks with the holidays coming up. The threat to overwhelming not just our hospital systems, but our ability to do contact tracing, is real. We need everyone in Washington state to take action now to stop the spread.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported surging COVID-19 case numbers Saturday along with 15 newly reported deaths from the virus. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources reported 655 newly reported cases as of 10 a.m. Saturday for a total of 27,742 total cases and 502 deaths since the pandemic reached the state. The daily case count set a record for the state, a day after West Virginia saw a new peak of 540 cases over 24 hours. On Friday, several government staff and officials including Gov. Jim Justice were tested for the virus after a staffer in the Capitol building tested positive Friday morning. The attorney general’s office later said the employee believed to have the virus tested negative Friday night. Justice said he was tested for the virus minutes before a noon news conference Friday, where he announced the record high of new cases. He also urged West Virginians to get tested at sites around the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: State health officials reported a new daily high of more than 7,000 new COVID-19 cases – another new daily record. Saturday’s total of 7,065 confirmed infections is more than 900 cases higher than the previous record, set Friday with 6,141 cases, according to the state Department of Health Services. The state first passed 6,000 daily cases Friday, and Tuesday and Wednesday of this past week also saw record-setting numbers of new cases. The 7,065 positive cases made up 37% of the 18,928 test results reported Saturday by the state health department. The seven-day average of new cases also rose again, hitting 5,394, which is the highest weekly average to date, according to DHS. The state health department also reported 45 more people have died, bringing the state’s death toll to 2,301.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: State health officials reported 646 new coronavirus cases Sunday, the second-highest single-day total of the pandemic in the state. The Department of Health listed 966 new cases Friday, the highest single-day total. The Casper Star-Tribune reports at least 114 people have died of the coronavirus, and more than 14,690 people have tested positive. The new totals come amid a rapid surge in the numbers of cases in Wyoming and throughout much of the U.S. Gov. Mark Gordon has said he is not considering implementing a statewide face mask order but has urged residents to wear masks. Albany County, which includes Laramie; the Wind River Reservation; and Teton and Laramie counties have implemented mask mandates under which residents must wear facial coverings when outside their homes, with some exceptions.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/state/2022/03/08/florida-abortion-law-ban-hb-5-florida-abortion-clinic/9414123002/", "title": "DeSantis' abortion ban: What's legal and what's illegal in Florida?", "text": "UPDATE: FDA rules abortion pills may be dispensed in pharmacies\n\nOn Friday, June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade case that constitutionally established the right to abortion.\n\nThat passed abortion laws to the states, where Republican lawmakers quickly began to ban abortion in about half of them while some Democratic-led states worked to reinforce protections for the procedure. Access to abortion, in other words, now depends almost entirely on where you live.\n\nWhat does that mean to Floridians?\n\nIn April of that year, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the state's most restrictive abortion regulations since Roe v. Wade, banning nearly all abortions in Florida after 15 weeks with no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nThe law went into effect July 1, was briefly stopped by a Leon County judge who called it a likely violation of the state constitution’s right to privacy., and then went back into effect when the state appealed.\n\nHere's what the new law means for pregnant people in Florida.\n\n'Dream bigger':How weekend marches keep advocates' fight for Roe v.

Wade mean?\n\nPreviously Florida's new abortion law may have faced a constitutional challenge since it was more restrictive than Roe v. Wade. That is no longer the case.\n\nWhat does Florida's abortion ban do?\n\nAs of July 1, the \"Reducing Fetal and Infant Mortality\" law (HB 5) bans all abortions at 15 weeks and later. The only exceptions are if carrying the pregnancy to term would result in serious injury or death for the mother or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality.\n\nTwo physicians must certify, in writing, that one of those conditions warrants the procedure. There are no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nThe new law redefines \"gestation\" from \"between fertilization and birth\" to \"as calculated from the first day of the pregnant woman's last menstrual period.\"\n\n15-week abortion ban:Florida Gov.

And so the argument is, should you kill a baby after 15 weeks because it was (conceived) under certain circumstances?\" Senate President Wilton Simpson said.\n\nAbortion bill amendments blocked:Despite attempts to block it, Florida Senate prepares abortion ban for final vote this week\n\nDoes Florida have a waiting period for abortions?\n\nYes. As of April the state requires anyone seeking an abortion wait 24 hours after an initial doctor’s visit before returning to undergo the procedure.\n\nWaiting period:After 7 year legal battle, Leon County judge signs off on Florida abortion waiting period\n\nCan minors get an abortion in Florida?\n\nFlorida required minors seeking an abortion to notify at least one parent 48 hours before an abortion and obtain consent from a parent or approval from a judge through a legal mechanism known as judicial bypass.\n\nWhat happens to doctors who perform an abortion after 15 weeks?\n\nIf a physician violates the ban, they would be guilty of a third-degree felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.\n\nIf I get an abortion after 15 weeks will I be charged with murder?\n\nUnlike Georgia's abortion laws, Florida's does not expressly define a fetus as a human being and there are currently no listed penalties for the person getting the abortion. The state's existing laws only penalize the doctor(s) performing it or anyone actively participating in the procedure.\n\nIf I'm pregnant in Florida and need an abortion after 15 weeks, what do I do?\n\nIf your pregnancy threatens your life or a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, or if the fetus has not achieved viability and has a fatal abnormality, you still can get an abortion but you would need to get two physicians to certify that in writing first.\n\nOtherwise, you would need to travel out of state, and you may need to drive a while. Like Texas, Georgia bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, usually about six weeks, often before some people even know they're pregnant.\n\nFlorida's laws still are more lenient than other states, including the ones that border us.\n\n“As mind-boggling as it sounds, even with the 15-week restriction, we will be seen as a haven state,” said Alexandra Mandado, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood of South, East and North Florida.\n\nMany states with newly-restrictive laws — and states with bills ready to go — are expected to increase restrictions or ban abortion outright now that the Supreme Court decision has come down.\n\nWhich states have banned abortion or made it illegal?\n\nThere are 44 states with some ban on abortions after a certain point in a pregnancy, according to The Guttmacher Institute, an organization that works to study, educate, and advance sexual and reproductive health and rights.\n\nTwelve states — Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennesee, Texas, and West Virginia —ban abortions entirely.\n\nGeorgia bans them at 6 weeks.\n\nTwo states, Florida and Arizona, ban them at 15 weeks.\n\nNorth Carolina bans them at 20 weeks.\n\nNine states, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina and Wisconsin, ban abortions at 22 weeks.\n\nNevada, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania ban them at 24 weeks.\n\n14 states — California. Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, MInnesota, Montana, New York, Rhode Island, Washington and Wyoming — ban abortions at the point of viability.\n\nVirginia bans abortion at the beginning of the third trimeser of pregnancy, 25 weeks.\n\nMany of these states are currently attempting to further restrict abortion or already have new laws on the books that have been blocked or contested in courts.\n\nAre abortion pills still legal in Florida?\n\nSort of. In 2021 the Food and Drug Administration permanently removed a key restriction on medication used to terminate pregnancies, allowing so-called \"abortion pills\" to be available by mail and prescribed through telehealth medical consultations due to pandemic restrictions, and in January of this year they announced that they could be dispensed in some pharmacies such as CVS and Walgreens.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service may deliver abortion pills even in states that have banned or restricted abortion access, the Department of Justice announced, since senders cannot know if the recipient will us them illegally.\n\nBut Florida law requires the physical presence of a doctor for the abortion process, which includes talking to the patient 24 hours before the procedure, so telehealth consultations are not permitted and other abortion restrictions apply. Medical abortions must be performed within the first 11 weeks of pregnancy, an even tighter deadline than the state's.\n\nThe abortion pills, mifepristone and misoprostol, also must be prescribed, although people in states where telehealth abortions are banned have started driving over the border to states where they are not, as that can be considerably cheaper than driving to a possibly-far-off and overbooked clinic.\n\nThe day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement that the Justice Department will protect providers and anyone seeking abortions in states where it is legal. In particular, Garland said the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of mifepristone for medical abortions.\n\nMedical abortion Qu0026A:Are abortion pills safe? Can I get out-of-state prescription? Your questions, answered\n\nMore:Justice Department clears Postal Service to deliver abortion pills even in restrictive states\n\nWhere can I find an abortion clinic near me?\n\nYou can find a list of abortion clinics and health centers that perform abortions at Planned Parenthood. You also can find clinics through Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration's online facility locator by picking “Abortion clinic” in the “Facility/Provider Type” field.\n\nThere are currently 53 clinics in Florida spread across the following counties: Alachua, Broward, Collier, Duval, Escambia, Hillsborough, Lee, Leon, Miami-Dade, Orange, Osceola, Palm Beach, Pinellas, Polk, Sarasota, Seminole and St. Lucie. A majority of counties do not have an abortion clinic.\n\nWhen does the new Florida abortion law take effect?\n\nThe law took effect July 1, 2022.\n\nThe 15-week ban is facing two lawsuits, one from a group of Planned Parenthood affiliates and independent providers, and another from a Palm Beach County synagogue. Both challenges seek to block the ban from going into effect and charge that it violates the state constitution’s privacy amendment.\n\nWhat other restrictions on abortion does Florida have?\n\nAlong with the restricted time period, abortion law in Florida currently requires that 24 hours before an abortion can occur, the physician performing it or a referring physician must, while physically in the same room, inform the patient of the physical risks of both getting an abortion and carrying the pregnancy to term and the probable gestational age of the fetus as determined by mandatory ultrasound.\n\nThe physician must also provide state-directed counseling materials. The patient may refuse to look at the ultrasound.\n\nHow many abortions are done in Florida?\n\nThere were 79,648 abortions performed in 2021 in Florida, of which 59,252 (74%) were listed as elective, according to data from the state Agency for Health Care Administration. About 75,000 of them occurred in the first trimester, or the first 12 to 13 weeks of pregnancy, compared with 4,850 in the second, according to state data.\n\nState data shows 16,822 abortions were done because of social or economic reasons and 1,503 abortions were for the psychological health of the mother. Another 1,060 abortions were for the health of the mother yet not for life-endangering reasons, the data shows.\n\nThere were 757 abortions due to “serious fetal genetic defect, deformity or abnormality,” another 119 abortions were performed because of a life-endangering condition to the mother, eight abortions were performed because of incest and 118 were done because of rape.\n\nOf the abortions because of serious genetic defect or some other abnormality, the state data shows 64% of them, or 484 abortions, were done in the second trimester. The second trimester starts at week 13 and ends at week 26, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nDo Florida doctors support the new abortion ban?\n\nSome do, many don't. Roughly 700 physicians in Florida signed an open letter to the state Legislature opposing the 15-week abortion ban, calling it an “alarming attempt to improperly insert politics into the patient-clinician relationship” and said the consequences for Floridians would be dire.\n\n“This legislation is bad medicine and bad policy, and we urge you to reject it for numerous reasons,” the letter states.\n\nDo Florida voters support the new abortion ban?\n\nAccording to a poll by the University of North Florida's Public Opinion Research Laboratory, 55 percent of voters surveyed opposed the abortion bill. Opposition grew to 60 percent when people were told it didn’t make exceptions for victims of rape or incest.\n\nThirty-four percent of the people surveyed supported the idea, according to a release from UNF.\n\nGallup Poll:Most Americans identify as pro-choice and believe abortion is 'morally acceptable'\n\nUNF poll:Most voters don't back abortion ban, 'Don't Say Gay' bills in Florida Legislature\n\nWill Florida pass more restrictive abortion laws?\n\nQuite possibly.\n\nGov. DeSantis has not committed to whether he supports the so-called\"heartbeat\" abortion bill, so named because of the belief that a detectable human heartbeat can be heard at that point.

Next target: diversity at work", "text": "For years, Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, has crusaded for stakeholder capitalism, the idea that business leaders should value the well-being of people and the planet along with the interests of shareholders.\n\nThese “woke” beliefs – Salesforce offered to relocate employees who were concerned about being able to get an abortion in Texas and stopped selling software to retailers that stock military-style rifles, and Benioff spoke out against Georgia and North Carolina for passing laws that would allow LGBTQ discrimination – have gotten this activist CEO in hot water with conservatives who say he’s sacrificing profits for politics.\n\nBut Benioff hasn’t backed off. Last fall, Salesforce sided with Harvard University and the University of North Carolina in a pair of cases before the Supreme Court challenging the practice of considering race in admissions to build diversity on college campuses.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the high court on Thursday struck down affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nThe decision is limited to higher education and won’t directly affect employers like Salesforce, which are governed by a different statute. But the ripple effects from the ruling could come quickly, starting with a decline in college graduates from underrepresented backgrounds, meaning the loss of \"a pipeline of highly qualified future workers and business leaders,\" companies from Google to General Electric warned the Supreme Court.\n\nLegal experts say the move to restrict affirmative action also could lead to more challenges in how corporations make hiring and promotion decisions.\n\nWhat’s more, the affirmative action reversal could emerge as the latest flashpoint in the nation's culture wars. Observers expect the ruling to embolden attacks on corporate diversity and equity and inclusion initiatives as tensions rise over how corporate America should address lingering workplace inequality.\n\nIn response, companies are holding discussions and contemplating changes to diversity programs. Some are second-guessing setting public targets for racial diversity in their executive ranks or running leadership training programs exclusively for underrepresented groups. Others are wondering if they should remove “diversity” from job titles to avoid scrutiny.\n\nBut many employers – including Salesforce – say they plan to stay the course.\n\nThe company says one of its core values is equality, and it has built diversity initiatives from recruiting people from underrepresented backgrounds to creating an employee advocacy program for people of color that take into account that talent is spread evenly but opportunity is not.\n\n“We don’t waver,” Salesforce Chief Equality Officer Lori Castillo Martinez told USA TODAY. “Equality is our value, and that is something we will continue to focus on, especially in these challenging times.”\n\nAffirmative action decision will increase scrutiny of diversity programs\n\nComing as conservative groups push back against diversity programs and consumers vent frustrations over corporations becoming more vocal on progressive issues like LGBTQ rights, abortion and racial equity, the Supreme Court decision probably will invite greater scrutiny of the strategies companies use to increase diversity, according to Andrew Turnbull, a labor and employment partner at law firm Morrison & Foerster.\n\nFederal law prohibits employers from considering race and other protected characteristics in employment decisions. Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, on the other hand, help employers make their workforces less homogeneous and their workplaces more inclusive by casting a wide net for qualified workers from different backgrounds, Turnbull said.\n\n“We may see an increase in challenges to those programs because some employees may incorrectly assume this means that their employers can no longer have workplace affirmative action or DEI programs,” he said.\n\nThe debate swirling around diversity programs has increased the possibility that corporations will be hit with discrimination lawsuits – from those who support these initiatives and those who oppose them.\n\nIn the decade from 2011 to 2021, the number of reverse discrimination claims filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission dropped from about 4,000 to 2,000 a year, according to data USA TODAY obtained from the EEOC. Though white people account for about two-thirds of U.S. workers, those claims made up about 10% of overall race-based discrimination claims.\n\nLawyers see an increase in reverse discrimination claims as GOP backlash escalates\n\nBut Turnbull says lawyers are seeing an increase in reverse discrimination claims. Earlier this month, a federal jury in New Jersey ordered Starbucks to pay $25.6 million to a former regional manager after determining that the company fired her because she was white.\n\nAs the GOP backlash increasingly targets the private sector, legislative challenges to diversity policies in red states are also proliferating, Turnbull said.\n\nMuch depends on how employers respond to the ruling, said Stanford law professor Richard Thompson Ford. Robert's majority opinion leaves room for colleges to consider how race affected an applicant's life.\n\n\"As far as I know workplace DEI is individualized, so even if the court’s logic were applied to workplace programs, it would not seem to prohibit the kinds of policies most employers use,\" he said.\n\nFew employers engage in the type of affirmative action that was used by selective colleges and universities, according to Ford.\n\nIn employment, affirmative action means “acting affirmatively” to create an environment that is welcoming and fair to all workers and that encourages diverse candidates to apply for positions, said Christy Kiely, a labor and employment partner with law firm Seyfarth. Employment decisions are then based on merit, Kiely said.\n\n“It is lawful for employers to affirmatively recruit people so that they have the widest range of applicants and pick the most talented candidates,” said Amalea Smirniotopoulos, senior policy counsel at NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. “I don’t think that will change.”\n\nAffirmative action is latest GOP target after CRT and ESG\n\nCorporations have turned to diversity programs to right decades of lost opportunities for Black people and other groups who have been historically underrepresented, especially in leadership roles. Those efforts intensified after the killing of George Floyd in 2020.\n\nPledges from corporations to address racial inequities drew a sharp backlash, from legislation in GOP-controlled state houses restricting how corporations talk to employees about racism to the targeting of trillions of dollars in investments that take into account ESG, short for environmental, social and governance principles.\n\nIf there is any sense in these C-suites, companies will take this as the catalyst, the catapult, the warning they need to get back to not discriminating. Scott Shepard, director of the National Center for Public Policy Research’s Free Enterprise Project\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling is a warning to corporate elites to stop foisting their liberal agenda on the nation, said Scott Shepard, director of the National Center for Public Policy Research’s Free Enterprise Project.\n\nIn August, the conservative think tank sued Starbucks executives and directors on behalf of a Starbucks shareholder, claiming that by setting hiring goals for Black people and other people of color, awarding contracts to diverse suppliers and tying executive pay to diversity, the coffee chain is engaging in racial discrimination.\n\nStephen Miller’s America First Legal has filed complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission asking for investigations into the hiring and employment practices at companies including Starbucks, McDonald's and Morgan Stanley.\n\n“If there is any sense in these C-suites, companies will take this as the catalyst, the catapult, the warning they need to get back to not discriminating,” Shepard said.\n\nAffirmative action ruling chilling effect? ‘I’m already seeing this downturn in DEI’\n\nNatalie Gillard, who created Factuality – an employee training tool used by companies such as Google, Nike and American Express – says she’s worried the affirmative action decision will have a chilling effect, much like President Donald Trump’s 2020 executive order banning the U.S. government and federal contractors from teaching employees about systemic racism caused some private employers to pause training.\n\n“I'm already seeing this downturn around DEI efforts in institutions, organizations and corporations,” said Gillard, who has lost business in Florida and Texas where public universities are barred from spending money on diversity programs.\n\nAlvin B. Tillery Jr., director of the Center for the Study of Democracy and Diversity at Northwestern University, says he’s concerned about what conservatives may have planned next. He expects they will double down on efforts to rid the public sector of affirmative action, from government hiring to contracting.\n\n“Supplier diversity programs and federal contracting − that’s the big prize,” said Tillery, founder of the 2040 Strategy Group, which works closely with Fortune 500 clients. “It's really about taking away set-aside programs and racial equity programs, including at the local government level. Those are things that have a much bigger impact on society than affirmative action at colleges.”\n\nWill big businesses like Apple, Google, Nike and Starbucks back off diversity efforts?\n\nLast fall, some of the nation’s largest companies, including Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Starbucks, filed briefs siding with colleges and universities that consider race as one of the factors in their admissions process.\n\n\"Racial and ethnic diversity enhance business performance,\" the companies told the Supreme Court. \"Research and experience demonstrate that racial diversity improves decision-making by increasing creativity, communication, and accuracy within teams.\"\n\nOur clients are coming to us, not saying how do we stop this, but saying, how do we educate our team around why this is still important. Evelyn Carter, president of diversity firm Paradigm\n\nWill corporate America shrink from diversity initiatives under growing pressure from the political right? Evelyn Carter, president of diversity firm Paradigm, doubts it.\n\nA Bain & Company survey of CEOs showed that 85% of the nearly 300 business leaders view social issues − labor standards, human rights, DEI, health; and product safety − as “urgent” concerns for their companies. When asked about the primary role of their business, 60% said either creating “positive outcomes for society” or “balancing the needs of all stakeholders.”\n\n“Our clients are coming to us not saying 'How do we stop this?' but saying 'How do we educate our team around why this is still important?'” Carter said.\n\nCorporations are just starting to see the benefits from the progress they’ve made in diversifying their workforces and leadership, said Lanaya Irvin, CEO of Coqual, a think tank that researches workplace diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nData shows that corporate America still has very little diversity, especially at the top.\n\nWhite men represent 7 in 10 executives at the very top of the nation’s 100 largest publicly traded companies, according to a USA TODAY analysis of named executive officers. In fact, they are even more likely today than their grandfathers to be managers despite a diversifying workforce.\n\n“It’s definitely not time to take one’s foot off the gas or to retrench,” Irvin said.\n\nNike CEO John Donahoe recently commended Bob Iger for standing up for Disney’s values in a spat over LGBTQ legislation with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who announced his presidential campaign late last month.\n\nCorporations should pick their battles but speak out on issues that are “core to who you are,” Donahoe said.\n\nFor Nike, that means standing up for the values of racial and social justice, according to Donahoe.\n\n“Our core consumer for the Nike brand, the Jordan brand, the converse brand, are urban Black and brown communities – that’s where sneaker culture started,” Donahoe said during the CNBC CEO Council Summit last month. “We listen to our athletes and to our consumer about what they care about, and they care about racial and social justice, and so we view that as core to who we are, core to our identity.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/29"}]}

Harris McDowell, co-chair of of the powerful budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, said at a Friday press briefing. “I don’t want to de-emphasize that it’s a difficult issue. But we just have to get those diversity numbers up.”\n\nMcDowell and other state leaders came together to say, unequivocally, that it is untenable for the state’s flagship university to have only one in 20 students enrolled be black when one in five residents statewide are black. That’s especially true, McDowell points out, when state taxpayers annually hand the school millions of dollars – $120 million in the most recent budget passed in June.\n\n“All our students, including our minority students, need to see a path forward at UD,” said Sen. Margaret Rose Henry. “Many of our students in Delaware are not able to attend their own state school.”\n\nCalls for change are welcome to students like Jasmine Anthony, a Sussex County native who is used to finding herself the only black student in any class.\n\n“I sometimes feel like, whenever I speak out in class, I’m not just speaking for me, I’m speaking for all black people,” said Anthony, who’s majoring in black studies and political science. “I have to be very careful what I say, because everyone is looking at me like, ‘This is what all black people think.’”\n\nUD grad Carl Suddler knows precisely what Anthony is talking about. He calls it “being speaker for your race.”\n\n“As a student, it puts you in this position where you’re more cautious, you’re timid, you don’t want to say the wrong thing,” said Suddler, who graduated from Glasgow High School. “You feel like everybody’s looking at you.”\n\nSeveral black students said they’ve rarely encountered outright, flagrant racism at UD, though incidents do happen. Anthony says she once had a racial slur shouted at her from a passing car, and one of Anthony’s friends said she had the same N-word hollered at her by a white person who tossed a chicken nugget while she walked down a sidewalk.\n\nLast year, when UD played Delaware State University, a historically-black university, racial insults spread on the social media app Yik Yak, drawing condemnation from top UD officials.\n\nYasser Payne, a professor of black studies at UD, often tells black students that adjusting to college life will take more effort for them than it will for white students.\n\n“Your biggest challenge will not actually be drilling down and doing the work, attending class, doing papers,” Payne said. “Your biggest challenge will be with contending with the culture of this place. It will be trying to get the jokes, to find out when it is appropriate to speak or not to speak.”\n\nPatrick Harker, UD’s president the past eight years, is leaving to lead the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, putting the university at a crossroads as it selects his replacement.\n\n“One of the biggest things we need to address is diversity,” said Robert Opila, the incoming president of the Faculty Senate and a member of the search committee. “The student body isn’t diverse. The faculty isn’t diverse. But the state of Delaware has a sizable African American population. It has to change.”\n\nOpila points to a Middle States Commission on Higher Education review of UD released in 2012 that praised UD for many things, but found it lacking on diversity.\n\n“UD is not diverse in either absolute or relative terms,” the report said. “With few exceptions, we believe that the university trails its peers in every measure of diversity in every constituency of the institution.”\n\nIn the fall of 2014, more than 76 percent of UD’s undergraduate students were white. About 5 percent of undergraduates were black, 7 percent were Hispanic, and 4.5 percent were Asian or Pacific Islander. Foreign students, Native Americans and multiracial students made up the remaining 7.5 percent.\n\nBy contrast, 64 percent of Delaware’s population is white, 22 percent is black, 8 percent is Hispanic and 3.7 percent is Asian, Census figures from 2013 show. Native Americans and multiracial citizens make up the remaining 2.3 percent.\n\n“It’s not like we’re in Minnesota,” said Leland Ware, a black professor who has taught at UD 15 years. “We are between Baltimore and Philadelphia, where there are large black middle classes.”\n\nBetween 1998 and 2014, the percentage of Hispanic students at the school leaped from 2.4 in 1998 to more than 7.\n\nMaria Matos, president of the Latin American Community Center, credited Harker’s predecessor, David Roselle, with helping build the Hispanic student body by hiring upper-level administrators, like the provost and admissions staff, who were Hispanic.\n\n“If there’s diversity at the table when people are making decisions, there are different perspectives,” Matos said. “If you don’t have those perspectives, it’s difficult to make decisions that lead to diversity.”\n\nAsian students’ share increased from 2.6 percent to 4.6 percent between 1998 and 2014.\n\nPalash Gupta, President of the Delaware Asian American Business Association, believes more Asian students are attending UD because more Asian families are coming to Delaware. Over the past few decades, Gupta said, immigrants flocked to the U.S. to receive training in burgeoning engineering and computer science fields – and children of those immigrants followed in their parents’ footsteps.\n\n“Delaware is definitely one of those places where there is opportunity,” Gupta said.\n\nWhile Hispanic and Asian students have seen steady gains, the percentage of black students has stubbornly stayed around five percent for decades. In 1998, 5.8 percent of students were black; in 2014, that number was around 5.1.\n\nJames Jones, Director of the Center for the Study of Diversity at UD, says cost is often a factor, because black families generally have lower incomes than white families. The K-12 school system, he points out, also continues to see achievement gaps between white and black students, meaning fewer black students reach the admissions bar. And those that excel may go elsewhere.\n\n“Those black students who are well-prepared and have the economic wherewithal have a lot of options, so we are really competing heavily with other institutions for them,” Jones said.\n\nNationally, there were 17.5 million undergraduates in 2013, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Of those, 56 percent were white, while almost 2.6 million – about 15 percent – were black. The number of black students nationally doubled between 1990 and 2013.\n\nOther regional institutions have higher proportions of black students: last school year, the University of Maryland was 12.7 percent black, Rutgers was 10 percent black and the University of Pennsylvania was 7.1 percent black.\n\nUD’s 5.1 percent was higher than Penn State’s 3.8 percent.\n\nSchools nationwide that set similar entrance requirements to UD were slightly more diverse. About 7 percent of students were black, according to U.S. Department of Education Data analyzed by Anthony Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.\n\nThese comparisons hardly mean UD is alone in having a less-than-diverse student body. In fact, many schools that require high test scores and GPAs have largely white, affluent populations.\n\n“If you look at the demographics nationally, we are on par with our aspirant and peer institutions when it comes to attracting students who are of African descent,” said Carol Henderson, vice provost for diversity.\n\nUD officials point to the statistics for research-intensive universities that the school either competes with, like Rutgers, Penn State, the University of Maryland, or aspires to compete with, like Ohio State, University of Michigan and the University of Wisconsin.\n\nA group of 34 such universities had an average of 4 percent black students, according to a report run for UD officials by the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nUD agrees that it needs to do more.\n\nIn February, when Harker went to discuss the school’s state funding in front of the Legislature’s budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, he addressed growing criticism about the lack of diversity from groups like the NAACP.\n\n“In all candor, this has been a long-standing issue for the University of Delaware. It’s an issue that we need to continue to plug away at,” Harker said. “It’s not something we’re going to solve overnight.”\n\nIn 2012, after the Middle States report, the university launched the President’s Diversity Initiative, spurring the creation of new programs and student organizations designed to make the campus more inclusive.\n\nIn June of last year, Harker named Henderson, a UD professor who has authored books about the representation of black people in literature and culture, the school’s Vice Provost for Diversity.\n\n“Diversity is an ongoing process and the university is actively involved in that process,” Henderson said.\n\nHenderson’s job is to not just encourage diversity based on race, but also family income, sexual orientation and gender.\n\nHarker directed Henderson to create a university-wide plan for diversity. She says a draft of that document should be ready by summer’s end.\n\nHenderson points to a host of different programs UD already has created aimed at recruiting minorities and helping them succeed. A few of those programs include:\n\n• The College Readiness Scholars Institute, in which Christina School District seniors and juniors get to visit the school and get help with admissions.\n\n• UD Scholars, in which first generation freshmen come to school early to get acclimated to college life.\n\n• Diversity Enrichment Leaders, specially trained guides who host campus tours for minority students and send personal letters to admitted students.\n\n• Each One Reach One, which pairs first-year black students with upperclassmen.\n\n• NUCLEUS, which includes additional work with academic advisers, weekly e-mails and social media posts about important academic deadlines and campus events, a dedicated study space, work-study positions and opportunities to do research as an undergrad.\n\nSchool officials also point to a long list of student organizations dedicated to minority students, from the Asian Student Association to the Caribbean Student Alliance and the Indian Student Association.\n\nUD has a Center for Black Culture, which lists at least 17 different student organizations for black students, including seven black sororities and fraternities, an NAACP chapter, gospel choir and African Dance troupe.\n\nHenderson argues there’s evidence all these efforts are bearing fruit. Considering all minority races, the past two freshman classes have been some of the most diverse in school history, she said.\n\n“Different affinity groups require different approaches,” Henderson said. “Here at UD we try to take lots of different approaches to diversity.”\n\nSome, like professor Jones, see promise in the work that Henderson is doing and changes in the admission process.\n\n“I don’t believe the efforts and the analytics have been there to support this effort until recently,” Jones said.\n\nBlack students were not permitted to attend UD until 1950, when Louis Redding successfully sued the school on behalf of six black students who were turned down for admission because of their race. Unable to attend UD himself, Redding went on to graduate from Brown University and earned a law degree at Harvard.\n\nThe year after the UD suit, cases Redding had filed in Delaware were combined with suits from other states in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court which found schools that were separated by race were inherently unequal. The decision led to desegregation of public schools.\n\nStudent activists like Anthony, who is president of the UD chapter of the NAACP, acknowledge that UD is taking some action.\n\n“Dr. Henderson is fabulous,” Anthony said. “They’re trying. But more needs to be done.”\n\nFor one thing, Anthony argues the university needs to target more efforts at white students. Many white students and even white professors, she argues, are ill-equipped to have conversations about race.\n\n“It’s a very polite campus,” Anthony said. “Talking about race can be difficult, and people don’t like to do it. But how can we address a problem if we can’t even talk about it?”\n\nHenderson said the university has tried to spur campus-wide conversations about diversity through its First Year Experience program, in which freshmen students read a common book and have group discussions.\n\n“The First Year Experience is one of the rare times that we get all our students together,” Henderson said. “We use that opportunity to have conversations about how we can be a more inclusive academic community.”\n\nThe university needs to hire more black professors, many students and faculty say.\n\nOf the 1,203 full-time faculty at UD last year, only 52 professors were black – less than 5 percent.\n\n“If I come visit campus and it looks like all the students are white and all the professors are white, that’s going to be a worry for me,” said UD grad Suddler.\n\nHe remembers black students at UD finding common places where they could gather to avoid a sense of isolation, like “The Booth” in the Trabant Student Center.\n\nSuddler was a member of the first graduating class in the University’s Black American Studies program, double-majoring in history. He recently earned his PhD at Indiana University – another largely-white school – and will be a visiting fellow at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\n“[Emory's] population is 10 percent black,” Suddler said. “That was appealing to me, to know that it was less likely where I’d run into the situation where my whole class is white students. To know that there’s a better chance there will be other black members of the faculty.”\n\nUD professor Payne argues that the university can’t simply hire its way to a more diverse student body.\n\n“It can be a hard problem for a university to solve because it is sort of an abstract issue,” Payne said. “There has to be a cultural shift that starts at the administration and goes all the way down to the faculty.”\n\nProfessor Ware says continued efforts from top officials won’t get traction unless the broader university community starts to see a shift in mindset.\n\n“Decisions at the staff level, at the department level, have to be made with diversity in mind,” Ware said. “Professor Jones has to look out and see an all-white class of 35 students and think, ‘OK, this is strange.’ And that’s often not the case now.”\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, 324-2428 or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/06/11/pandemic-not-schools-orchestrate-pomp-and-circumstance-class-2020/5337058002/", "title": "Despite pandemic, schools manage pomp and circumstance for ...", "text": "Harold Ingram woke up Saturday morning and realized he’d lost his voice.\n\nThe principal of Glasgow High School wasn't cheering at a sporting event — he lost his voice cheering for students at the high school’s first-of-its-kind drive-thru graduation the day before.\n\nFor five hours, teachers applauded the class of 2020, shouting out each name as students walked across an outdoor stage with their families celebrating from parked cars.\n\nThe socially distanced ceremony was anything but traditional. Balloons floated out of car windows and a DJ played music keeping the crowd engaged.\n\nBut celebrating together and seeing each other for the first time in months, the students and faculty of Glasgow High felt close despite keeping at least 6 feet apart, as they marked the end of a tumultuous school year.\n\nSTATE GUILDELINES:Delaware schools can hold outdoor graduations, without hugs, state says\n\nNow that outdoor gatherings of up to 250 people are allowed by the state, schools are starting to rethink what in-person ceremonies look like.

It’s a year like no other. We wanted to make sure they remembered something positive and exciting. Something the family can remember for years to come.”\n\nOther school districts continue to roll out graduation plans for the coming weeks. In most cases, students are split into staggered groups to accommodate the 250-person rule.\n\nVIRTUAL GRADUATION:Even from home, graduation remains an emotional, surreal moment for 2020 grads\n\nNormally, seniors would graduate at the Bob Carpenter Center in Newark, Ingram said, in a straight-laced ceremony complete with speeches and (mostly) quietly seated students.\n\n“It’s a great place, but it’s traditional. I think we need to change with the times and what students want,” Ingram said. “Students want to celebrate their moment with their families and other students. They really just want a big party to celebrate their accomplishments.”\n\nAlready, students in lower grades are asking how the school will top this year’s graduation.\n\n“This graduation had extra weight. Nobody thought that on March 13, that would be the last day of their senior year. We knew we could not allow the kids to go without something spectacular.

The DSWA guide talked about methane recovery from the landfill and how that methane is captured and piped out. The group then traveled the three miles to the recycling plant. While visitors are not allowed into the plant itself, the students could see inside the buildings and got an idea of what processes are automated and what kinds of recyclables are particularly valuable. In the Education Center there was a short video and the students participated in a mock recycling line. The DSWA tour provided opportunities for students to observe the negative impact modern life presents to the environment and the positive impact environmental scientists and engineers are having in resolving the issues with waste management for a considerably large community.\n\nSeniors Jordyn Humes and Kaitlin Helms participated in a Student Journalist Night on WDEL with commentator Alan Loudell March 30.\n\nOn April 14, the Diocese of Wilmington sponsored its 18th Pass the Word program for young men at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore.

House Bill 143, as it’s known, would make it easier to hire teachers from states that have not yet raised the bar for teacher preparation. As a graduate of Wilmington University’s Master of Special Education program and a first-year teacher who recently took the assessment, I know passing HB 143 would mean getting rid of a valuable tool for first-year teachers preparing for the classroom.\n\nI graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Sociology from Delaware State University in May of 2012 with honors and soon after became a paraprofessional. It was my experience in the classroom as a paraprofessional that made me first think I would make a great teacher. As a product of Delaware’s public schools (Delmar School District,) I imagined the type of impact I could make as a teacher in the very schools I grew up in. With that in mind, I enrolled in Wilmington University to get my masters in special education.\n\nAs I matriculated through the program, I encountered the first hurdle to becoming a teacher: passing a general knowledge exam (Praxis I or “Praxis Core”). I passed the math section the first time but had to take the other subjects’ more than three times each. Sadly, my experience is not unusual. According to the Center for American Progress, “Praxis I pass rates were about twice as high for whites as for African Americans in reading, writing and math.” Disappointed with this setback, I began to question whether I really should become a teacher. I fed myself the type of excuses that keep so many from the profession: “Teachers don’t make any money. Do I really want to be one of the few black males in the profession?” Ultimately, I decided to stay the course by reminding myself that the Praxis I was not an indicator of my ability to teach.\n\nI later took and passed the Praxis II, a subject-matter specific content knowledge test. When it finally came time to take an actual measure of my teaching, the Praxis Performance Assessments for Teachers, like the legislators behind HB 143, I thought it was just going to be another unnecessary hurdle on the way to becoming a teacher. But with the support of the faculty at Wilmington University, I was well prepared for the assessment, excelled and knew it had been a meaningful experience.\n\nThe assessment required that I complete four performance tasks essential to being a great teacher. The first task asked me to demonstrate that I understand my students and the community. I had to show how I would further student learning and how I would engage with a diverse set of families in my classroom.\n\nThe second task required I show my ability to assess student learning in my class and use my assessments to better support students.\n\nThe third task assessed whether I could create a high-quality lesson plan, differentiate instruction in my classroom, provide students with rich feedback to improve their learning and then reflect on my teaching.\n\nThe final task required I record and reflect on my teaching practice. I demonstrated my ability to implement a standards-based lesson, use questioning techniques to facilitate student learning and use effective classroom management techniques.\n\nThis process took a lot of time and was not easy, but it was a necessary investment in my development as a teacher. It prepared me well for interviews and for eventually managing my own classroom. It is the kind of investment we should want from teachers to be best prepared to instruct students.\n\nBy removing the performance assessment from Delaware’s licensure requirements, HB 143 is attempting to make it easier for out-of-state candidates to become a teacher in Delaware. But we have to ask ourselves: Is the easy road what’s best for teachers and our students?\n\nJenson Dennard is a first-year special education teacher in the Christina School District.

Before that she’d taken part in numerous other sports, including swimming mainly, plus tennis, cross country, soccer, basketball, softball and lacrosse.\n\n“I didn’t like it initially because I wasn’t very good at it and my sister was so good,” she said. “But I started to really enjoy the teamwork in it. You can really connect with people. You have to make the boat feel good. Outside of the power and technique, you have to get along with who you’re with. The sense of teamwork and doing it together with people, doing it for them, made it very appealing.”\n\nThe doubles, in which Carr prevailed in Florida with Pierce, has been one of her favorite boats and her sister had been her long-time teammate before going off to college.\n\n“Rachel is a very talented rower and she’s got experience in the double, too, so we both had that going,” Carr said, “and she had competed at Nationals in a single before. When we had early-on practices together, we just clicked very well.”\n\nBlue-Gold numbers out of line\n\nWhile the Gold draws from 22 schools and Blue from 21 for the annual DFRC Delaware All-Star High School Football Game, it may be time for organizers to shift teams again with the state’s population drifting south.\n\nEnrollment for Gold schools surpassed 23,500 in 2016-17. For Blue it was about 17,500. The Gold roster is made up of players from schools south of the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal plus Red Lion Christian and the Christina School District trio of Christiana, Glasgow and Newark.\n\nEveryone else is on the Blue, which at one time was basically just Wilmington area schools but has had to steadily add teams over the years, most recently St. Mark’s.\n\nThe Gold dominated Saturday’s 62nd annual matchup 44-0 behind stellar defense, Smyrna quarterback Nolan Henderson’s 22 completions for 260 yards, both Blue-Gold records, and Glasgow wideout Michael Credle’s record 10 catches, which covered 116 yards. Henderson is headed to Delaware and Credle to Delaware State.\n\nBalint, Hutchinson honored\n\nSt. Mark’s wide receiver David Balint (Blue) and Smyrna linebacker Josh Hutchinson (Gold) were winners of the Jack and Pat Gregory Outstanding Leadership Awards after the Blue-Gold game Saturday.\n\nWilmington Charter seeks coach\n\nCharter School of Wilmington is seeking a new football coach after Larry Cylc’s recent decision to step down. The Force, which moves from Blue Hen Conference Flight A to the Diamond State Conference this fall in all sports and therefore can play a less demanding football schedule, hasn’t won more than two games in a season since going 7-3 in 2010.\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

Unlike some other parents, Antwi can't afford to hire a tutor.\n\nTylan often comes home with stories about classmates who have been suspended. He's had issues with no father at home.\n\nAbout 44 percent of the school's students were suspended last year, according to the state.\n\nClearly, Christina School District doesn't have enough resources to support students struggling with mental or behavioral problems, Antwi said. She thinks the school does the best with what it has, but there just isn't enough money.\n\nJeffers Brown, her son's principal, pointed to several workshops that teach staff how to cope with students' emotional and behavioral issues.\n\nEven so, \"I feel like the children are very aggressive,\" Antwi said. \"I feel like the teachers are kind of scared of the students. There's a level of fear.\"\n\nGiving students and teachers in so-called high-needs schools the support they need takes money, and a lawsuit filed by two civil rights groups — Delawareans for Educational Opportunity and the Delaware NAACP — demands the state change how it funds education. It claims the system provides more support for children who are well off than it provides for children living in poverty.\n\nThey are working with the Community Legal Aid Society and the American Civil Liberties Union of Delaware, which says the state's education system is not providing an adequate education to all students.\n\nThe lawsuit, similar to ones filed in 45 states, seeks to have more money given to schools with large numbers of low-income students, special education students and English language learners.\n\nThat funding would allow school districts like Christina to invest in tools that could help those students succeed, as districts in New Jersey now do. And it could keep experienced teachers from fleeing jobs in those schools that can be overwhelmingly stressful.\n\nACLU-DE legal director Ryan Tack-Hooper said despite the best efforts of teachers, families and school staff, the current education system fails too many Delaware children.\n\nEven if the lawsuit is not successful, similar cases in other states have had a significant impact and raised public awareness of the issues.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, funding inequities harm students from low-income families, students with disabilities and students who are learning English. Schools struggle to hire specialists who can help them, and test scores for disadvantaged students are far below state standards set by the Delaware Department of Education in its new Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, plan.\n\nAt Stubbs, for example, less than 5 percent of fourth-graders were at grade level in math last year and only about 6 percent were proficient in English language arts.\n\nAntwi said often students' home lives are blamed for poor performance at school.\n\n\"There’s this perception that these kids come from a poor community and that their parents don’t care,\" she said, making it clear that she would do anything possible to help her son succeed. \"But where you live doesn't define who you are.\"\n\nShe also wishes her son got more homework, so she could help him study at night, but the school is moving away from that.\n\n\"Homework is viewed as an end-all be-all by most of our parents,\" her son's principal said. \"Our kids have been working diligently on the two new curriculums we implemented this year during school hours. They are very scripted and may not call for homework assignments. Only the lower grades receive homework packets every week.\"\n\nTylan has been attending Stubbs for about three months and previously attended Carrcroft Elementary School in Brandywine Hundred.\n\nPavia Fielder, who recently retired from a 16-year stint as a teacher at Warner Elementary School in the Red Clay School District, and now substitute teaches in New Castle County, said the problems aren't isolated to one school or one school district.\n\nShe sees a sharp contrast between schools that serve large amounts of low-income students and those that don't. Often, the inequities exist not between school districts, but within school districts, she said, between schools in the city or low-income neighborhoods and in the wealthier suburbs.\n\n“I see it in all of the districts. I see it everywhere,\" she said. “Some schools have what they need, but these (low-income) schools never get what they really need. When is that going to happen?\"\n\n'Not perfect, not unconstitutional'\n\nIn a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, lawyers for Carney and the state Education Department argue that Delaware's Constitution doesn't guarantee students a fair or \"adequate\" education system. It only promises a \"general and efficient\" one that achieves maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense.\n\n\"Delaware’s education system is not perfect, but it is not unconstitutional,\" the motion to dismiss says.\n\nIn a reply brief filed this week, ACLU and Community Legal Aid lawyers argue the framers of Delaware's Constitution sought to prepare children to engage in democracy and be productive citizens.\n\nDelaware is failing to do that, the brief says.\n\n\"This failure is the result of policies and practices that deprive public schools of the resources and organizational structure needed for all children to receive necessary services and support,\" it says.\n\nThe Education Department had no comment on the case. Gov. John Carney's office pointed to new investments outlined in his proposed 2018 budget and said they will give students more support.\n\nThey include $16.5 million to help improve education in the five struggling Christina School District schools in Wilmington and $6 million for the Opportunity Grants program that assists schools serving high poverty and non-English speaking students — a three-fold increase over the current allocation.\n\nCarney believes that all Delaware children deserve a quality education, said Jon Starkey, a spokesman for the governor. \"He is committed to investing in Delaware's schools, and providing additional support and resources for schools serving low-income children, English learners and students with special needs.\"\n\nCritics say the new investments proposed by Carney won't have a significant, lasting impact.\n\nMany schools in Delaware do not have the money to pay for smaller class sizes, expanded school time, highly qualified specially trained teachers, technology, effective family engagement and partnerships with health, family welfare and specialized education service providers.\n\nMike Griffith, a senior school finance analyst for the Education Commission of the States, said Delaware's education funding system only exists in six other states: Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Mississippi, Tennessee and Virginia.\n\nIt's top-down, and many states have moved away from that model, he said. The state basically determines how many teachers, principals, nurses, etc. a school qualifies for and sets aside money to fill those positions. Districts can \"cash in\" some of those positions, but then only get a portion of the total salary to use for other purposes.\n\n“Your system doesn’t allow there to be dollars, money dollars,\" Griffith said. \"It allows there to be teachers.”\n\nThat can really hamper schools, he said in a 2016 Q&A with the Rodel Foundation of Delaware.\n\n\"The big thing in Delaware is that the current system doesn’t allow for flexibility in the new areas where education is now being taken,\" Griffith said. \"Digital learning, for instance, is one of the biggest growth areas in education, as is dual and concurrent enrollment. In a more flexible system, you can say we’re going to use these funds to pay for teachers and for these enrollment opportunities for our students.\n\n\"Today we see more and more kids splitting time between virtual learning environments and brick-and-mortar school environments. Your system is built strictly on that brick-and-mortar idea. It’s not flexible for modern learning.\"\n\nThe lawsuit says tying money to teachers creates other problems, such as staff instability.\n\nSince high-poverty schools have a large proportion of students with extra needs but lack the resources to address them adequately, they are difficult places to work. Teachers with more seniority often choose to teach elsewhere, which leaves relatively inexperienced staff serving those disadvantaged students.\n\nThe annual rate of teacher turnover at high poverty schools is much higher than the statewide average of 15 percent. For example, at Bayard Middle School in the Christina School District, about 30 percent of teachers changed last year and in the 2015-16 school year, turnover was more than 60 percent, according to the lawsuit.\n\nFielder, who worked at Warner Elementary for 16 years and has been certified as a teacher in Delaware since 1999, had more experience than many of the teachers there. Fifty-six percent have been teaching for nine years or fewer, according to the state Education Department. Twenty-four percent have been teaching for four years or fewer.\n\n\"Every single year, we had teachers that would leave before October,\" Fielder said. \"And definitely, if they made it through the school year, they were gone. They were looking for something that wasn't so intense.\"\n\nAs the result of the Charter School Act and Neighborhood Schools Act, which requires students attend the school closest to their homes, Warner has been effectively re-segregated, according to the lawsuit. Only 1.8 percent of students there are white.\n\nBy contrast, Heritage Elementary School, in the same school district but outside the city of Wilmington, is 72 percent white.\n\nFielder said she couldn't blame the teachers who left Warner, because it was a tough place to work. There were students dealing with serious trauma, and not enough support staff to help them deal with their needs.\n\n“It’s a serious, serious problem that all schools are dealing with, but not in the magnitude and numbers that the priority schools are dealing with,\" she said, referring to the state's lowest-performing schools.\n\nWarner, where 16.7 percent of fourth-graders were proficient in English last year and 8.9 percent were proficient in math, is one of them.\n\n“Unless we really just have some real conversations about what’s going on,\" Fielder said, \"I don’t see how it will change.”\n\nSetting precedent\n\nThe lawsuit has provoked some conversation already, though it is unclear if the issue will actually be taken up by Chancery Court Judge Travis Laster.\n\nIn other states, judges have refused to hear such cases, arguing that they do not have jurisdiction over legislative funding formulas. And when cases are heard, it can take an average of seven years for them to wind their way through the court system, Griffith said.\n\nAs of now, there are only four states — Hawaii, Mississipi, Nevada and Utah — that haven't faced litigation over their school funding formula.\n\n“In most cases, the resort to litigation or to lawsuits is the last resort,\" said David Sciarra, executive director of the Education Law Center in New Jersey. “What’s happening in Delaware is systematic of what you see in states across the country.\"\n\nSciarra said his organization has tracked multiple school funding cases and they often serve as an important catalyst for change.\n\nIn about 60 percent of the lawsuits, the court sided with the plaintiffs, according to SchoolFunding.Info. Most cases point to academic and graduation standards that states began adopting in 1989 and to low test scores to argue states aren't fulfilling their responsibilities.\n\n“You have states — every state now actually — prescribing standards that schools, teachers, students have to meet,\" Sciarra said. \"But if the resources aren’t there, all this talk about closing achievement gaps among legislators is frankly hollow.\"\n\n“The kids that get hurt by that the most, or harmed by that failure, are the ones that have the greatest need. And you just see that play out from state to state to state.”\n\nThere have been several school funding lawsuits in New Jersey, he said.\n\nIn 1973, the New Jersey Supreme Court declared the state’s school funding formula was unconstitutional because it violated the “thorough and efficient education” requirement of the state Constitution. Since that decision, the Supreme Court has issued more than a dozen school finance opinions.\n\nA new funding formula was created in 2008 and is considered a national model, even though since it was only fully funded in 2009 school districts have been getting less than the court says they should. Even so, for several years now, New Jersey has been ranked near the top in the nation for student achievement.\n\n“The graduation rate of all poor people in New Jersey is higher than the national average for all children,\" Sciarra said.\n\nPennsylvania is also in the middle of a school funding lawsuit, which could have implications for Delaware, Sciarra said. While Pennsylvania courts had maintained they didn't have jurisdiction over school funding, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 2017 reversed that and said it would take up the issue.\n\nThat opened the door for a school funding overhaul in Pennsylvania. It highlights a fundamental shift in legal strategy for education funding lawsuits and outlines one potential path the school funding case can take in Delaware's Chancery Court, Sciarra and other experts said.\n\n\"That's probably going to loom large over (Delaware's) case,\" Sciarra said.\n\nA possible solution?\n\n\"We spend a lot on public education, that's a line you hear a lot,\" said Eve Buckley, who has two children at Shue-Medill Middle School in Newark. “I think the main thing is we’re not spending the money in a smart way. We’re not directing it where the needs are.”\n\nOver the years, she's seen programming cuts and class size increases at Shue-Medill, she said.\n\nAbout 40 percent of students there are classified as low-income and 16 percent have special needs, according to the state Education Department. About 6 percent are English-language learners.\n\nBuckley said the school no longer has a French teacher and that it doesn't have a shop teacher or librarian.\n\nThough she personally can afford to enroll her children in private lessons, she knows many families cannot.\n\n\"We don't feel that our kids are being hugely adversely impacted because we trek them to all kinds of things after school,\" she said, adding that she and her husband are both on the faculty at the University of Delaware. \"But for a lot of their classmates, it's just not an option. We're not investing in those children in the way that we should be.\"\n\nWendy Lapham, spokeswoman for Christina School District, said principals have to make hard decisions about staffing based on available teaching units, student interest and enrollment.\n\n\"Since many of the resources dedicated to students needing additional support come from a variety of sources ... it is not accurate to assume that resources intended for the general student population are redirected to students that need additional support,\" Lapham said.\n\nShue-Medill Principal Michele Savage said the school offers Spanish classes, and plans to offer Mandarin Chinese in 2019-20.\n\n\"We do not offer shop class because of the impact of the funding/staffing cuts,\" she said.\n\nAbout 46 states provide additional financial support for English language learners, giving the schools that serve them more money so they can hire specialized staff and teachers. There are 35 states that provide additional financial support for low-income children.\n\nDelaware does neither, and also does not provide special education funding for students with disabilities in kindergarten through third grade. (The Joint Finance Committee, last Tuesday, recommended $2.9 million to support students in kindergarten through third grade who require the lowest category of special education services, such as reading support or physical therapy. That would need to be approved by the full Legislature as part of the state budget process.)\n\nThe lawsuit is scattered with examples of what that means in under-resourced schools in Delaware.\n\nSpecial education specialists managing individual education plans in the Christina School District have caseloads of more than 100 students, the lawsuit says. There are 46 English language learners at Kirk Middle School but only one ESL teacher. At Smith Elementary School, two fifth-grade classes had 36 students in them as of Oct. 31.\n\nIn the fourth grade, there were classes of 29, 30 and 32 students, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThere is no reading specialist at Seaford High School, where many students live in poverty and more than 65 percent are not proficient in English language arts. In one third-grade special education class at Highlands Elementary School in Red Clay, all 12 children had to share one computer, according to the lawsuit.\n\nOne proposed solution to equity issues has been to institute a needs-based funding formula, which gives a bigger piece of the pie to disadvantaged students.\n\nThink about it this way. Every student would start with roughly the same amount of funding, depending on their grade level. Then, students who need special help would get extra funding.\n\nThe total amount of money Delaware spends on education could stay the same in a needs-based model but would be redistributed.\n\nSuch a change would likely be controversial, because school districts with relatively few low-income students and English language learners, like Appoquinimink, could stand to lose money. Some of the state funding they currently receive would likely be shifted to poorer school districts like Christina.\n\nMoney raised via referendum and local property taxes would not be affected.\n\nIt's something that has been argued for by the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission, a state advisory committee established by former Gov. Jack Markell in 2015 to come up with ideas to improve education in the city.\n\nBut Carney has said he is not in favor of needs-based funding, in part because it gives extra money to districts without holding them accountable for how they use it. He has said there is neither the financial nor political support for such a measure.\n\nOther politicians have questioned whether there's enough evidence that needs-based funding works. Some studies show money can have a positive impact on academic outcomes and others show that it doesn’t.\n\nSometimes school districts spend the extra money on the wrong things, experts say. But when they spend money on the “right” things, test scores and outcomes improve, research shows.\n\nOne study published by the Washington Center for Equitable Growth found that the achievement gap between students in high- and low-income districts shrank by roughly 20 percent after spending increased. In states with no school-funding reform, the gap grew.\n\n“School finance reforms are perhaps the largest national effort we have made to increase equality of educational opportunity since the school desegregation movement,” the study’s authors wrote. “There have been dramatic improvements in equality of school funding over the last two decades, many spurred by a series of state court rulings demanding more adequate school funding. We show that these reforms translated into sharp and immediate increases in funding in low-income districts.”\n\nIn a study conducted by The National Bureau of Economic Research in 2015, researchers looked at long-term outcomes such as educational attainment and students’ income after graduation.\n\nIt said low-income students from schools that got more money were less likely to be poor as adults. They were 10 percentage points more likely to graduate high school and earned about 10 percent more at work.\n\nThe study looked at all students, but for non-impoverished children, the funding benefits were found to be “statistically insignificant.” The research is intended to show that while some benefits of increased funding may not necessarily translate into higher test scores, they can still improve students’ overall outcomes.\n\nThe extra funding was spent on changes such as smaller class sizes, more guidance counselors, higher teacher salaries and longer school years.\n\nWhile some states have made significant investments in early childhood education, as Delaware has, research shows that some of the benefits fade by the time those students leave third grade. Lackluster funding in elementary school can negate some of the positive effects.\n\nSiawaa Antwi, Tylan Raburnel's older sister and a junior at Freire Charter School in Wilmington, isn't sure Delaware is giving students what they need at all.\n\nAs a member of TeenSHARP, which prepares high school students of color for top colleges, she's come to realize how underprepared she is and how hard she'll have to work to secure her future. TeenSHARP has summer programs that help teens get up to speed, but she worries she'll be unable to catch up.\n\nFreire, a fairly new school where 72 percent of students are African-American and about 52 percent are low-income, does not have advanced placement or international baccalaureate classes, she said.\n\nPaul Ramirez, co-head of school at Freire, said the school did have its first dual-enrollment class this year. AP classes will come next year when the school has its first 12th-graders, he said.\n\n\"AP classes themselves aren't a huge cost burden,\" he said. \"More to the point, I do think that the per-student funding rate only covers the basics of what we offer, and we're able to provide a lot of the rich programming we have at the school only by seeking funding from other sources. \"\n\nSiawaa worries about her brother, she said. Growing up in Wilmington, she knows what can happen to kids who get held back in school and don't get the education they need.\n\n“I was just having this conversation with my mom, and I think it’s really messed up because you can't make up for 12 years of a bad education,\" Siawaa said. \"You can’t make it up over a summer.”\n\nShe said Tylan's father isn't involved in his life and her father killed himself, which has left the family struggling. While Siawaa admits changes in circumstance have led to her brother to act out in school, she can't help but feel the education system is failing him and that schools should have more counselors and psychologists to help children coping with trauma.\n\n\"It's like a domino effect,\" she said. \"You go to a bad elementary school, you go to a bad middle school, you go to a bad high school. How do you get into a good college and get a good job?\"\n\nTRENDING STORIES\n\nNCCo council votes down property tax increase\n\nDelaware lawmakers eye state workers bonuses\n\nCrimes, but little prison time in accused arsonist's past\n\nOriginal lawsuit\n\nMotion to dismiss\n\nACLU and Community Legal Aid's response\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

The Tuscaloosa News reports Foster, 89, received the degree during graduation ceremonies. She enrolled at the all-white university in 1956 but was expelled three days later after her presence brought protests and threats against her life. Foster received a standing ovation Friday, news outlets report. Before receiving the honor, she remarked on the difference in seeing smiling faces “instead of frowning and displeased at my being here.” Foster earned a master’s in education from the school in 1991, more than 35 years after attending her first class. She waited until 1992 to graduate to share the moment with her daughter, who is also a UA alumna.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Nenana Ice Classic organizers have announced this year’s winner for the guessing contest. Ice Classic manager Cherrie Forness says Anchorage resident Patricia Andrew was the only person to guess the exact time the ice officially went out on the Tanana River in Nenana. That happened at 12:21 a.m. April 14, the earliest in the contest’s 102-year history. The jackpot is $311,652. Forness says Andrew will receive $224,389.44 after federal taxes are withheld. The payout will be made June 1. Each year, people buy tickets to guess when a tripod mounted on the frozen Tanana River will fall over as ice on the river breaks up. Forness estimates about 287,000 tickets were sold this year.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: An experiment to change the flow of water from a dam near the Arizona-Utah border has boosted the number of aquatic insects that fish in the Colorado River eat. Scientists are hoping to better understand those results with a second bug flow experiment that will run through August. They found that releasing low, steady flows of water from Glen Canyon Dam over the weekends gives bug eggs a better chance at surviving. The experiment is part of a larger plan to manage operations at the dam, which holds back Lake Powell. Researchers are recommending three consecutive years of bug flows to see if the amount and types of bugs increase in the Grand Canyon. The flows don’t change the amount of water that must be delivered to Lake Mead downstream.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission has received a nearly $1 million grant to help pay for the state’s newest nature center now under construction. The $980,000 grant from the Walton Family Foundation was announced Thursday for the new facility in Springdale. The center is located east of Interstate 49 in northwest Arkansas and will include an outdoor archery range, a northern bobwhite education pavilion, walking and biking trails, and exhibits featuring the wildlife of the Ozarks. Construction on the center began in December, and it’s expected to open in October 2020. The Game and Fish Commission also has nature centers in Fort Smith, Jonesboro, Little Rock and Pine Bluff.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAvalon: The mountaintop runway on Santa Catalina Island, a tourist destination off the Southern California coast, has reopened after five months of construction. A World War II-era DC-3 touched down on the new runway at the Airport in the Sky to mark the occasion Friday, the Orange County Register reports. It was followed by six CJ-6 Warbirds that flew in formation over the runway and two more vintage aircraft that made a high-speed, low-altitude fly-by. About 100 U.S. Marines and Navy sailors began working on the island in December under an agreement between the military and the Catalina Island Conservancy to rebuild the deteriorating runway. The project was paid for by $5 million donated to the nonprofit land trust. The military performed the work as part of a training exercise.\n\nColorado\n\nBellvue: Fish now have another couple of miles to wander freely on the Poudre River. A recently completed fish ladder at the Watson Lake dam in Bellvue reconnects 2 miles of stream, giving fish freedom to swim upstream in search of deeper water, shade, food or spawning habitat. Fish ladders create alternate routes for passage over and around obstacles like dams. This isn’t the first one on the Poudre, but the project’s magnitude is unique, says Colorado Parks and Wildlife aquatic biologist Kyle Battige. The $850,000 project started in 2016 and is a collaboration among Northern Water, Colorado Parks and Wildlife, Morning Fresh Dairy, Noosa Yoghurt, Poudre Heritage Alliance and Trout Unlimited, among other partners.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s Lemon Law Program is being credited with providing consumers more than $2.6 million in refunds or returns last year for problematic new vehicles. Department of Consumer Protection Commissioner Michelle Seagull says that’s an increase of more than $300,000 from 2017. The agency processed 81 cases in 2018, compared with 64 in 2017. Seagull says she’s pleased more families are aware of the program, an informal process for resolving disputes between consumers and automobile manufacturers. She says it can be a financial burden when a new vehicle is defective. All new car dealers in the state are required to post lemon law information in their service departments and provide purchasers with information about it at the time of sale or least of a new vehicle, including motorcycles.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Democratic lawmakers have again introduced legislation allowing school districts in the state to raise taxes without local voter approval. A bill introduced Thursday says that, beginning in July 2020, a school board could increase the rate or amount of its district operating tax by at least 2% every year, indefinitely, without holding a referendum. A school district could still hold a referendum if officials wanted to raise the operating tax by more than 2% or a rate equal to the increase in the consumer price index. A referendum also would still be required to pay for major construction projects. The bill, similar to previous proposals, was introduced just days after residents in the Christina school district, one of Delaware’s largest, rejected a proposed 20% increase in operating taxes.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The mayor has proposed a bill to locally legalize the sale and distribution of recreational marijuana, despite a federal budget provision barring the city from enacting marijuana legislation. The Washington Post reports Mayor Muriel E. Bowser announced the legislation Thursday. A 2014 law allows District of Columbia residents to grow and possess marijuana but doesn’t allow purchases of the drug. The “Safe Cannabis Sales Act” would task the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration with regulating marijuana businesses and impose a 17% sales tax that would go toward the act’s enforcement and affordable housing. District Attorney General Karl A. Racine says local officials can legally discuss the legislation, a flip from his take in 2015. District lawmakers say they may not vote on the bill’s final passage until Congress removes the prohibiting provision.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state will establish an agricultural hemp program under a bill sent to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. The Senate unanimously passed a bill Friday to establish the program, hailed as a way to help farmers who have been battered by hurricanes and hurt by citrus diseases. Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried said the state could soon be a leader in hemp production, give the state’s climate. She said citrus will remain the state’s top crop, but citrus farmers will now have an option of supplementing their groves with hemp. Hemp is related to marijuana but only has trace amounts of THC, the chemical that makes people high. The plant was a wide range of uses, from ropes and clothing to building materials and animal feed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A group that advocates for saving historic homes and places plans events throughout the state in May to celebrate National Preservation Month. The Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation held walking tours of some of Macon’s prized historic homes and gardens over the weekend. On May 18, the group will gather volunteers in Talbotton to clean up inside Zion Church. The church was built in 1848 and several years ago was placed on the Georgia Trust’s annual list of “places in peril.” An open house is planned May 30 in Atlanta at the Randolph-Lucas-Jones House, a 1924 home undergoing rehabilitation after the house was moved to save it from demolition. The Georgia Trust said in a news release that local preservation groups also plan events in dozens of Georgia communities.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A new study finds coral reefs provide more than $835 million in flood protection for the state annually. A report by the U.S. Geological Survey, The Nature Conservancy and the University of California-Santa Cruz established the value that the natural formations provide the islands, according to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. The team worked with the engineering and insurance industries to create models estimating values for almost 2,000 miles of U.S. coral reef coastline. The report says reefs provide more than $1.8 billion in flood protection annually, including about $12 million on Kauai, $395 million on Oahu, $377 million on Maui and $51 million on the Big Island. The report says that in a 50-year storm, coral reefs off Honolulu alone could provide more than $435 million in flood protection.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State prison officials are appealing a judge’s order that they turn over documents that will reveal the source of the lethal injection drugs used in a recent execution. The Idaho Department of Correction filed the notice of appeal last week in Ada County’s 4th District Court. In the notice, the prison officials say they want the Idaho Supreme Court to decide whether Judge Lynn Norton erred when she determined that a receipt from the compounding pharmacy that provided the drugs used in Richard Albert Leavitt’s execution in 2012 is a public document that must be released. The receipt was for drugs expected to be used in a later execution, but none has occurred since then. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed under Idaho’s public records law by University of Idaho professor Aliza Cover after the department denied her public record request in 2017.\n\nIllinois\n\nGeneva: A former Marine is trying to locate, repair and catalog 100 years’ worth of historical items at an American Legion Post here ahead of its centennial celebration. Matthew Lutz, 34, says he’s excited to find items from past battles and has already discovered a beret that belonged to a Geneva native who survived Pearl Harbor. Some items at the Geneva American Legion Post 75 have mildewed because of exposure to moisture over the years. Post Cmdr. Brian Noonan recruited Lutz to help with the project, the Daily Herald reports. Lutz says he feels it’s his responsibility to preserve the post’s history. The goal is to complete the project by the post’s charter anniversary Aug. 14. The Geneva History Center will host a lunch at the post May 14 so community members and veterans can share their legion stories.\n\nIndiana\n\nFranklin: A county that was once a powerhouse in the canning industry is taking a look back at those days in a new exhibit. Johnson County was Indiana’s top producer of canned goods during the early 20th century. The county just south of Indianapolis boasted an array of canning plants that produced more than 53 million cans of food in 1942 alone. The new exhibit examining that industry is called “Pick, Peel, Preserve: Canning in Johnson County” and runs through mid-October at the Johnson County Museum of History. Director David Pfeiffer tells the Daily Journal that the canning industry helped “put Johnson County on the map.” The county’s J.T. Polk Canning Co. started in a Greenwood kitchen in 1872 and grew to become the largest cannery west of Baltimore.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A giant, inflatable, colorful, kooky and confetti-filled wonderland is coming to the city. The world’s largest adult-friendly bounce house is coming to Des Moines, along with a 60-foot maze and giant inflatable obstacle course. Big Bounce America will be at Southridge Mall on June 7-9. The candy-colored castle clocks in at more than 11,000 square feet and holds the Guinness World Record for the largest inflatable bouncy castle. Giant slides and ball pits bursting with technicolor vibrancy are there to dive in. Both adult-only (ages 16+) and family-friendly sessions are available. The event is free for parents to attend with their children, but a ticket is required if a parent wants to enter any of the inflatables. Kids 3 and under must be accompanied by a paying parent or guardian. Tickets are available online in advance and the day of the event.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Lawmakers who support expanding Medicaid blocked passage of the next state budget Friday in a high-stakes standoff designed to force the Legislature’s conservative Republican leaders to allow an expansion plan backed by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. The Kansas House voted 63-61 against an $18.4 billion spending blueprint for the budget year that begins in July. House and Senate negotiators hashed out details Thursday night that were favorable for Kelly, fellow Democrats and moderate Republicans, with extra money for higher education, the prison system and state employee pay raises. Democrats and moderate Republicans praised the proposed budget but saw the vote as their chance to pressure the Senate’s GOP leaders into relenting on plans to delay an expansion vote until next year.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The University of Louisville has won a $1 million grant for researching the manufacture of thin solar panels by repurposing printing presses. The university says in a release that the goal is to reduce the cost of producing solar panels. The grant comes from the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office. The project at the Conn Center for Renewable Energy Research will focus on thin film solar cell production using a roll-to-roll platform, the same used to print newspapers. Thad Druffel, who is leading the research at the Conn Center, says the technology can revitalize a declining printing industry and boost a growing solar industry.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: This year’s New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival celebrates 50 years of spotlighting the state’s culture and musical traditions. The nonprofit Jazz & Heritage Foundation – which owns the festival – is marking that milestone by directing festival profits to a range of annual programming, including free after-school music classes for students and $1 million in project grants. It’s also funding four free festivals held throughout the year: Crescent City Blues and BBQ, Treme Creole Gumbo, Congo Square New World Rhythms and Louisiana Cajun-Zydeco. Don Marshall, the foundation’s executive director, says it gives more than $1 million yearly in grants to artists and organizations, such as YAYA – Young Aspirations Young Artists – which runs youth summer camps.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Wildlife authorities say the state has already received more than three dozen complaints this spring about nuisance bears, which are emerging from their dens hungry for food. Nuisance bears, which knock over bird feeders, paw through trash and steal from pet food dishes, are a rite of spring in the Pine Tree State. But the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife says it doesn’t have to be this way. The department is asking homeowners to remove outdoor items that attract bears, such as grills and unsecured garbage cans. The department says it has received 38 complaints so far, mostly in the areas of Ellsworth and Blue Hill along the eastern coast and Kennebunkport and Arundel in southern Maine. May tends to be a busy month for complaints.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The new mayor has vowed to clean up the city after being thrust into office by his predecessor’s resignation amid corruption investigations, but he inherits serious, long-standing problems that have plagued previous administrations. Bernard “Jack” Young, a longtime leader of the City Council, says he intends to serve only the remainder of former Mayor Catherine Pugh’s term and has no interest in running for mayor in 2020. If the Democrat doesn’t change his mind, his tenure would last just a year and a half. “I wish him good luck, but I’m reserving my full support because he seems apprehensive about being the mayor in the first place,” says Clayton “Mr. C” Guyton, a respected community organizer featured in “Charm City,” a recent documentary about Baltimore shot amid its ongoing scourge of intense violence.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNew Bedford: A 2-year-old red panda is the newest attraction at Buttonwood Park Zoo. “Jacob” was introduced to visitors Friday. The Standard Times reports that Jacob, Buttonwood’s first red panda, was born at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo and brought to New Bedford last summer. The animal spent several months bonding with caretakers in private before making its public debut. Red pandas are native to China, India and several other Asian countries. They are listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Zoo officials say they’re expanding Jacob’s habitat and hope to also bring in a female red panda.\n\nMichigan\n\nHolland: Two pairs of oversized wooden shoes displayed as part of an art competition that were stolen ahead of the annual Tulip Time Festival have been recovered by police. The Tulip Time Festival announced online Friday morning that the shoes were to be repaired and put back on display. Artists decorated 45 big pairs of the traditional Dutch clogs called klompen for the “Klompen Garden” public art event in Holland, and the shoes were on display outdoors. Workers noticed Thursday, two days before the festival officially began, that two pairs were missing from Centennial Park. The clogs are nearly 3 feet long and 1 foot wide. The western Michigan city of Holland is known for its Dutch heritage, and the festival is a big tourist attraction. It runs through next Sunday.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Some nonprofits in the state are embracing communal housing as a way to address affordable housing shortages despite the model being long rejected as contributing to urban blight. Minnesota Public Radio News reports Alliance Housing has been trying to get Minneapolis to rethink boarding houses as a solution to the affordable housing crisis. The nonprofit has been unsuccessful in its efforts to lift the city’s 1980s rule that prohibits new licenses for boarding houses. The prohibition reflects the city’s stance that boarding houses undermine neighborhoods with single- and two-family homes. Alliance runs one of the city’s remaining boarding homes, where 25 single men and two women live together. Tenant Craig Spivey says it offers decent housing for people who can’t afford an apartment on their own. Tenants each pay about $350 rent a month.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A photographer who captured iconic images of black students challenging segregation is donating his camera to the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. In a state Department of Archives and History news release, Jerry W. Keahey Sr. says he hopes his camera will be displayed near his photos in the museum’s exhibition about the Tougaloo Nine. The students from historically black Tougaloo College staged a nonviolent sit-in at Jackson Municipal Library in 1961. The library had been reserved for white people. Mississippi NAACP leader Medgar Evers worked with the students to plan the sit-in. The four women and five men were charged with breach of peace and spent 32 hours in jail. Each was convicted, fined $100 and given a 30-day suspended jail sentence. The case was later dismissed on appeal.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Actor Sean Astin talked about his mother’s mental illness, films and more at Missouri State University last week as the keynote speaker for the school’s second annual Impact Summit, which started last year to raise awareness about college students’ mental health needs. Astin has been in the film business for most of his life as an actor, director, voice artist and producer, including starring roles in “The Goonies,” “Encino Man,” the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy, “Rudy” and “Stranger Things.” Astin is well-acquainted with mental illness as his mother, Academy Award-winning actress Patty Duke, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1982 and wrote about it in her 1987 autobiography. Duke died in 2016. The stigma around mental illness has gotten a little bit better, Astin said. “In my mom’s time, it was, like, Bellevue and padded rooms and shock therapy,” he said.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state is the first this year to authorize sports betting. Gov. Steve Bullock signed a bill Friday for the Montana State Lottery to oversee wagering on sports through kiosks and mobile devices. Sports betting is happening in eight other states, six of which authorized it after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed it nationwide last year. Montana officials have estimated sports betting will generate $3.7 million for the state during the first year. Lawmakers sent the Democratic governor two bills that would have created competing systems. One was the lottery bill; the other would have allowed private businesses to run sportsbooks, kiosks and mobile apps. Bullock vetoed the second bill, saying in a veto letter that the lottery has existing infrastructure and ensures a transparent environment.\n\nNebraska\n\nPlattsmouth: Two local companies are helping to prevent a summer bummer after the city suffered flood damage to its water facilities and can’t fill the community’s pool. The Omaha World-Herald reports that severe flooding in March damaged the Plattsmouth water treatment and wastewater facilities, forcing the city to impose restrictions: no lawn watering, no washing vehicles in driveways and no filling private pools. Mayor Paul Lambert says there just isn’t enough city water available for Twin Rivers Water Park. Most of the limited temporary supply of water is coming from the Cass County Rural Water District system. The two companies that came to the rescue of summer fun for kids and families are Fast Grass sod farm and Liquid Trucking. Fast Grass is donating its well water; Liquid Trucking is hauling it to the water park.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Southern Nevada consistently ranks high for STD rates, but health officials are stepping up public education campaigns now that Clark County has the highest rates of syphilis in the nation. The Las Vegas Sun reports Clark County ranked first in the nation for syphilis rates per capita in 2017. The number of reported cases of syphilis in the county is steadily increasing, with nine cases having been reported in 2016, 20 cases in 2017 and 24 in 2018. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can be cured with antibiotics if identified early on. University Medical Center Dr. Alireza Farabi says the infection can lead to other complications in the long term, including meningitis, dementia, blindness and hepatitis.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed a bill Friday to repeal the state’s death penalty for a second time, though lawmakers are likely to override his decision in the fall. Sununu, a Republican, vetoed the bill surrounded by police officers and other law enforcement officials at a Manchester community center named in honor of Officer Michael Briggs, who was shot to death in the line of duty in 2006. “This bill is an injustice not just to Officer Briggs and his family but to law enforcement and other victims of violent crime across the state,” Sununu said. New Hampshire’s death penalty applies in only seven scenarios: the killing of an on-duty law enforcement officer or judge, murder for hire, murder during a rape, certain drug offenses, or home invasion and murder by someone already serving a life sentence without parole. The state hasn’t executed anyone since 1939.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBarnegat Light: The state will spend $10 million on projects to prevent storm water pollution from entering the ecologically fragile Barnegat Bay, authorities said Friday. The state Department of Environmental Protection announced grants to nonprofit groups, local governments, and state colleges and universities that will institute projects to prevent polluted runoff from entering the 660-acre watershed. Barnegat Bay is one of the most ecologically threatened bays in the nation and is the subject of various efforts to improve its water quality. It’s a major recreational area, but the heavy development that comes along with that has greatly increased stress on the bay, as paved surfaces allow pollutants to wash into the waterway.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: College students are using drones to help map the location of dinosaur tracks at a state park. The Albuquerque Journal reports New Mexico State Parks is teaming up with Central New Mexico Community College students and the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science to map out the footprints at Clayton Lake State Park. The park located in the northeastern part of the state contained track sites that are about 100 million years old. Central New Mexico Community College instructor Rick Watson says students will fly the drones from different heights in order to record a variety of details. Once the project is complete, students will place the photographs, 3-D models, maps and other findings on a website.\n\nNew York\n\nNiagara Falls: The Maid of the Mist boats that bring tourists to the base of Niagara Falls are going electric. The company on Friday announced plans to launch two zero-emission passenger vessels during the coming tourist season. The boats will be powered by high-capacity battery packs. The new vessels are expected to go into service in mid-September and replace the existing diesel-engine vessels that will operate on the lower Niagara River until then. The Swiss technology company ABB is supplying the lithium-ion battery packs and an onshore charging system. The batteries will be recharged for seven minutes after each trip. The Maid of the Mist first launched in 1846.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGreenville: As artists, their influence can be seen in hundreds, even thousands, of paintings, illustrations, sculptures and designs; yet for the most part, their work has remained in the background. But “Rock the Bus” has become a vehicle of expression for Pitt County Schools visual arts teachers. The annual exhibit, which opened Friday at Emerge Gallery and Art Center, showcases the creations of 20 art teachers, representing more than a dozen area schools. “It’s a celebration of their created work,” says Jane Austen Behan, arts education programs director for Pitt County Schools. “It gives them the opportunity in the visual art world to showcase their particular talents as working artists themselves.” The exhibit began more than a decade ago. The works will be on display through May 30.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state plans to invest $33 million in the unmanned aircraft systems industry in an attempt to establish the state as a premier location for drone research, testing and commercialization. Gov. Doug Burgum is expected to sign a bill authorizing the investment in a ceremony Monday with state leaders. The majority of the money will go toward building out infrastructure to support operations to fly drones beyond the sight of the pilot. About $2 million will be used to support an unmanned aircraft test site in Grand Forks that’s been authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones without chase planes to observe the flight. Another $3 million will upgrade infrastructure at Grand Sky, the country’s first unmanned aircraft business park, located on the Grand Forks Air Force Base.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Children in the state have the chance to design an anti-bullying license plate. A contest to create the logo and slogan for the “Stop Bullying” plates is a joint effort of the Ohio Attorney General’s Office and the Ohio Education Association. The contest is open exclusively to children enrolled in kindergarten through fifth grade in the current school year. Entries must be postmarked by May 31. Republican Attorney General Dave Yost says the contest provides a way for children to push back against bullying with their creativity. The winner will receive a certificate and see the winning artwork featured on the special plates. Contributions from sales of the plates will fund bullying prevention grants for nonprofits, schools and school districts.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Beef lovers need not fret about what to eat in this state where cattle outnumber people. Gov. Kevin Stitt on Thursday signed into law a bill making the ribeye the official steak of Oklahoma. The measure takes effect Nov. 1. Rancher and state Sen. Casey Murdock of Felt, who sponsored the bill, says the cattle industry is a huge part of Oklahoma’s identity. Murdock says Oklahoma has more than 5 million cattle. Census figures estimate the 2018 population of Oklahoma was about 3.9 million. Murdock says designating the ribeye, which is known for its flavor, as the official steak of Oklahoma is good for tourism and restaurants.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden isn’t finished trying to create new wilderness and recreation areas across the state. After passing legislation earlier this year that applied the highest form of environmental protection to 30,000 acres in the Coast Range and 250 miles of rivers, Wyden returned Wednesday with a new conservation bill. The Oregon Recreation Enhancement Act, co-sponsored by Sen. Jeff Merkley, would create new recreation areas around the Rogue and Molalla rivers, expand the Wild Rogue Wilderness and outlaw mining on 100,000 acres in southwest Oregon. The two senators said establishing the protected areas would increase the state’s outdoor recreation economy but also stressed that legislation wouldn’t stop projects meant to reduce the threat of wildfire. Opponents have said the legislation could make wildfires worse.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city has launched a new street sweeping pilot program in a handful of neighborhoods, hoping to finally sweep away the persistent nickname Filthadelphia. There’s no shortage of work. A sanitation department official tells the Philadelphia Inquirer the new street crews round up about 7 tons of litter a day. Rather than requiring residents to move their cars, the program involves workers with leaf blowers blowing trash off sidewalks and from under cars so the street sweeping machine can access it. Some neighbors say they’re annoyed by the amount of dust generated, but despite it, most are still supportive of the efforts and appreciate the cleaner streets. The program is a compromise for residents resistant to moving their cars. Tight street parking availability in the city makes it tough to find a spot.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A self-driving shuttle service is launching in the city. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo and state Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti say the “Little Roady” autonomous vehicle pilot program is scheduled to begin May 15. It’s the first service of its kind in the state. The free service will operate seven days a week, with 12 stops between Olneyville Square and Providence Station. There’s no public transit along the full route. Each vehicle holds six people, including an attendant who has the ability to take control at any time to ensure safety. May Mobility of Ann Arbor, Michigan, was awarded a contract by the state to operate the service. The state will pay $800,000 for the first year. The contract includes options to extend the service for two more years.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMountain Rest: It’s now official. The state’s record for most rainfall in a year has been broken. The State Climate Extremes Committee voted that the 123.45 inches of rain recorded at the Walhalla State Fish Hatchery in far northern Oconee County in 2018 was a valid measurement. The group examined rainfall records from the surrounding area and weather patterns to confirm the total. The rain gauge is near Lake Jocassee. The state climatologist office says the previous record was 119.16 inches of rain at Hogback Mountain near Landrum. The mountains are usually the rainiest part of South Carolina, with an average of about 75 inches per year.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPine Ridge Reservation: The Oglala Sioux Tribal Council has unanimously decided Gov. Kristi Noem is no longer welcome on the Pine Ridge Reservation. The council said Wednesday that Noem is not to set foot on the reservation unless she rescinds support for her two bills aimed at Keystone XL pipeline protesters that would codify “riot boosting” in state law and allow the state to sue any person or organization for “riot boosting.” The Oglala Sioux Tribe says it was “particularly offended” that Noem consulted with TransCanada prior to introducing the new bills but didn’t consult with any of the Sioux tribes whose land would be “traversed and endangered” by the Keystone XL pipeline. Noem’s office says she will continue to engage with tribal members, stay in contact with tribal leadership and maintain her efforts to build relationships with the tribes.\n\nTennessee\n\nPigeon Forge: You may have walked, hiked and biked in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, but now you have a chance to see it while riding in a decked-out pink Jeep Wrangler. The Pigeon Forge location is Pink Jeep Tours’ first in the eastern United States. Each tour lasts two to four hours, taking up to seven passengers through parts of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Four tours are offered: the Newfound Gap Tour, the Foothills Parkway Tour, the Roaring Fork Tour and the Oconaluftee Farm Tour. Once the national park section wraps up, each tour will also feature a 30-minute off-road section on private property, where tour guides take the Jeeps up and down steep hills.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: More than 100,000 people in the U.S. are stuck on an organ transplant wait list, hoping to find that perfect match to their blood type, body size and hospital location. But many – 20 per day, in fact – will die before receiving the organ they need, the Houston Chronicle reports. Imagine, then, if scientists could just print one for them using a method similar to 3D printing. Jordan Miller, a Rice University bioengineer, has been working toward this goal for the past five years. It’s more complicated than it sounds: 3D printing originally was created for use with plastics, which are not compatible with the human body. But Miller and his team now have found a way to 3D-print living tissue using human cells and a water-based solution. This discovery was published Thursday in the journal Science.\n\nUtah\n\nOrem: Graduation gowns worn by Utah Valley University graduates saved an estimated 70,000 plastic bottles from landfills this year. The Daily Herald reports the gowns for the university in Orem came from Oak Hall Cap & Gown, which uses recycled plastic bottles to make regalia. The Virginia-based company says each of the recyclable gowns takes about 23 bottles to make. The process includes chopping and melting the plastic into a filament yarn that is woven and dyed. The university 40 miles south of Salt Lake City says this is the fifth year students have worn the gowns. Officials say there is no cost difference compared to the polyester normally used in the traditional graduation attire, and using recycled materials fits the school’s sustainability mission.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: One of the most historic buildings in the capital city has been declared a public safety hazard. The Montpelier City Council made the declaration for the former farmstead of Col. Jacob Davis, who founded the state capital. The Times Argus reports that Davis deeded the land to the city where the Statehouse is built. The City Council held a hearing last month on the 1836 Greek Revival house and barn on Route 2 after an adjoining landowner complained. A report to the City Council says a city inspection found numerous deficiencies in the building that made it a public safety hazard. The owners of the property must submit a remediation and abatement plan to the city by May 17.\n\nVirginia\n\nDanville: A movie director with multiple Academy Awards has been asking about life in this southern Virginia textile town. The Danville Register & Bee reports that filmmaker Steven Spielberg visited Danville in late April to talk to former Dan River Inc. employees about the influence the textile mill had in the region before being shuttered more than a decade ago. Two-generation mill employee Gary Knick said Spielberg’s sole interest was the mill, its history and its people. Knick and others say they did not know why Spielberg was gathering the information and didn’t ask. Spielberg’s production company, Amblin Partners, did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A man dubbed the “Barefoot Bandit” for a series of crimes committed when he was a teenager is trying to get out of probation early. Colton Harris-Moore, now 28, asked a U.S. District Court judge in April to end his federal probation four months early so that he can become a motivational speaker. Seattle U.S. Attorney Brian Moran responded Friday, saying there was no reason to allow Harris-Moore off the hook now, as the probation doesn’t prevent him from traveling to such speaking engagements. Harris-Moore was sentenced in 2012 to seven years in prison for a series of crimes committed barefoot, which began after he escaped from a Renton juvenile halfway house in 2008. He was ultimately captured after crash-landing a plane he flew to the Bahamas.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A federal investigation of Gov. Jim Justice has widened to include a range of tax documents on the governor’s expansive business portfolio, according to a subpoena sent to his administration last month. The federal grand jury subpoena that the state Revenue Department released Friday asks for communications, meeting records and tax documents involving the state and any of the roughly 100 private business interests held by the Republican governor. Last year, Justice held a press conference with revenue officials to say he resolved a series of state tax disputes that had long followed his companies. Officials said the governor wasn’t involved in resolving the debts and would not say how much money was paid. Prosecutors are largely targeting records from 2010 to 2016, before Justice took office in 2017.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOak Creek: A tabby cat has new back legs, with the help of some University of Wisconsin-Madison students and a 3D printer. Community Cat shelter vice president Sarah Close says Chicago Animal Care and Control found the stray with infected legs last September and turned him over to the Whitewater, Wisconsin-based shelter. A veterinarian amputated part of the male cat’s back legs, and the shelter named him Sgt. Stubbs. Community Cat officials then asked a freshman engineering class for help. The students made prosthetics with a 3D printer and extra straps to keep them on. Stubbs received the legs and tried them out Thursday evening. Stubbs’ new owner, Adam Schofield of Oak Creek, says he was impressed with the prosthetics and hopes Stubbs will get used to them.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: One of the world’s biggest and most powerful steam locomotives is chugging to its big debut after five years of restoration work. Big Boy No. 4014 rolled out of a Union Pacific restoration shop in Cheyenne on Saturday morning as hundreds of spectators looked on. Next it’s headed to Ogden, Utah, to help celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Transcontinental Railroad. Big Boy engines hauled freight between Wyoming and Utah in the 1940s and 1950s. Of the 25 Big Boys built, eight remain, but only this one will be operational. The Big Boy locomotive measures longer than two city buses. It’s heavier than a Boeing 747 jet plane fully loaded with passengers, yet powerful enough to pull 16 Statues of Liberty over a mountain range.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/in-our-schools/2016/06/09/student-news-edison-high-school-bowling-program-roll-grant/84981260/", "title": "Student news: Edison High School bowling program on a roll with ...", "text": "Staff Report\n\n@MyCentralJersey\n\nThe school received the funds from the California Casualty Thomas R.

They read various articles at their individual reading levels and answered comprehension questions.\n\n\"I have learned to take my time and look back in the article to check my answers,\" said Jason Florencio, a fourth-grader.\n\nChristine Rompos, a fourth-grader, said it helped her “become confident because it broke things down for me so I could think about what I had read.”\n\n\"Our students have been reading about many things that are going on in the world,” said Romatowski. “I have seen tremendous growth because they are using reading strategies that they have been learning instead of guessing and hoping to get it right. The students persevered and supported one another each and every day. Paying their prizes forward shows us how much character they have and how they want to help others.”\n\nSacred Heart University\n\nChristopher Kulesza of Metuchen received a bachelor's degree in exercise science from Sacred Heart University in Fairfield Connecticut, this spring..\n\nSiemens Competition Math, Science and Technology\n\nThe Siemens Competition, established in 1999, is a signature program of the Siemens Foundation, administered by Discovery Education. Each year, the program invites high school students nationwide to submit original research projects in math, science and technology for the opportunity to win college scholarships ranging from $1,000 up to $100,000. Students can compete as individuals or as members of a team.\n\nAs with last year, the regional competition rounds will be held on-line in a secure virtual environment. Participants will present their projects via a secure cloud-based technology platform to a panel of judges who will be assembled at regional hosting universities in November.\n\nThe regional judging will take place at six leading research universities across the country: California Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Notre Dame and The University of Texas at Austin.\n\nWinners of these Regional Finals will be invited to present their research in-person to nationally scientists and mathematicians at the National Finals in Washington, D.C. in December at The George Washington University.\n\nFor further information, visit www.siemens-foundation.org or follow @sfoundation.\n\nSouth Amboy High School\n\nJunior Patrick Walsh added to his list of running accomplishments this year by capturing the Central Jersey Group I State Title in the 3200m event. This is his second sectional title at this distance.\n\nHe followed up his championship performance with a strong second-place finish in the State Group I meet this past Saturday in Egg Harbor. This performance qualifies Patrick for the NJSIAA Meet of Champions, which is set to take place at Central Regional HS in Bayville on June 11.\n\nStockton University\n\nThe Ospreys, Stockton University’s NCAA Division III athletic teams, have won numerous conference and regional titles, and they’ve done it without a pep song to cheer them on. That’s about to change.\n\nThe university has initiated a public song-writing contest to create a Pep Song no longer than 60 seconds, with fun, easy-to-remember words and an upbeat melody. The song must include a reference to the Ospreys and be applicable to all Stockton sports. Entries are due by July 1.\n\n“Stockton’s sports teams are a great source of pride and having our own Pep Song will be another way for fans to display their Osprey spirit,” said Lynne Kesselman, Stockton’s first lady, who is chairing the university’s Pep Song committee.\n\nThree finalists will receive the opportunity for complimentary consultation and the winner of the contest will be chosen by songwriter and producer Fred Jerkins III. The Pep Song will debut on University Weekend, October 2016, to be played by Stockton’s new Pep Band.\n\nEntries must be submitted in MP3 format and include written lyrics and melody notation.\n\nTo Submit: Download, fill out and sign the contribution agreement, and email the song entry in MP3 format and the signed contribution agreement to pepsong@stockton.edu.For more information, contact the Pep Song committee at pepsong@stockton.edu or visit the http://intraweb.stockton.edu/eyos/page.cfm?siteID=69&pageID=589.\n\nThomas Edison State University\n\nJetBlue has launched JetBlue Scholars, an innovative new program that offers crewmembers an opportunity to earn a fully accredited college degree from the Trenton-based Thomas Edison State University, with JetBlue covering most of the cost.\n\nThe program takes an unconventional approach to employer-sponsored education by providing alternative college credit options for crewmembers, going well beyond standard tuition reimbursement and providing college advisement and resources to address the needs of those working full-time.\n\n“Crewmembers asked for help earning degrees and we knew we could take a big step beyond tuition reimbursement,” said Bonny Simi, head of JetBlue Scholars. “We rethought the employer’s role in investing in education. Utilizing the alternative credit model to unbundle the higher education process, we’re eliminating some of the complexity. We hope to inspire other employers to adopt this model which will help dramatically increase the percentage of Americans who have access to post-secondary degrees.”\n\nThomas Edison State University worked with JetBlue to create alternative credit pathways to several of its degree programs that utilize online courses evaluated by the American Council on Education, select JetBlue training programs and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifications evaluated by the university, credit-by-exam programs and open courses.\n\nJetBlue will cover most of the cost of the program for participants. As part of the initial launch, more than 400 JetBlue crewmembers are currently working toward earning their bachelor’s degrees. The program’s first graduation ceremony is scheduled to take place this September with more than 50 crewmembers slated to receive their degrees.\n\nJetBlue Scholars opens periodically for crewmembers to enroll. After registering, crewmembers are assigned a success coach to help them map a pathway to a bachelor’s degree in aviation, liberal studies, information technology or business administration from Thomas Edison State University. They will also work with their success coaches to incorporate their education background, including transcripts from previous course work, copies of professional licenses or certifications held, transcripts from military, law enforcement or fire training and any other experiences or documentation that demonstrates college-level learning. Many crewmembers already hold special licenses or FAA certifications.\n\n“When it comes to mapping my college degree path, my journey has been one of discovery, excitement and pleasure – thanks to the guidance I’ve received from the JetBlue Scholars team,” said Bonnie Merritt, supervisor relations at JetBlue and a JetBlue Scholar. “I love being able to see where I’ve been and what I need to reach my end goal.”\n\nCourse work is completed primarily through three innovative learning technology platforms – Sophia.org, StraighterLine.com and Study.com. Courses offered by these providers have been evaluated and recommended for credit by the American Council on Education’s College Credit Recommendation Service and offer a variety of online videos, lectures and other content that provide for flexible schedules and self-directed learning.\n\nJetBlue is also developing new courses internally utilizing open source material from providers such as Saylor.org and OpenStaxCollege.org, which will prepare crewmembers to earn credit through college-level exams provided by the College Board and Thomas Edison State University.\n\nThe Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi\n\nThe following Central Jersey residents were inducted into the honor society of Phi Kappa Phi, the nation's oldest and most selective collegiate honor society for all academic: Initiated from Kean: Megan Bernstein of Sayreville, Shazneka Blue of Linden, Krista Brennan of Rahway, Mark Celis of Parlin, Shaunique Cisson of South Plainfield, Carissa Eagle of Edison, Colleen Ferenchak of Rahway, Matthew Fernandez of Cranford , Michelle Fitzula of Linden, Amanda Frusco of Edison, Hangfeng Gong of Union, Dora Gonzales of Perth Amboy, Nerissa Gonzalez of Piscataway, Christopher Hart of Fords, Heather Huff of Iselin, Anialma Iglesias of Perth Amboy, Laura Jacobs of Colonia, Erica LoBuglio of Sayreville, Laina Magnani of Edison, Rodolfo Manalo of Colonia, Katelyn Massa of South Plainfield, Christina Masucci of Roselle Park, Katherine McCue of Rahway, Kelsey Melendez of Edison, Fallon Melillo of Piscataway, Brian Mirfield of Old Bridge, Renata Moro of Roselle, Nicholas Mwangi of Fords, Mevla Nuredinoski of Carteret, Cara Oliveto of East Brunswick, Catherine Ortiz of Fords, Sarah Pearson of Colonia, Jasmine Pichardo of Roselle Park, Jesus Reyes of Roselle, Thomas Rich-Caverly of Cranford, Jackeline Rivera of South River, Lisa Romane of Piscataway, Fiama Romero of Rahway, Naomi Keith Santos of Port Reading, Jennifer Sarro of Rahway, Vasu Shah of Roselle Park, Maria Sica of North Brunswick, Zinamaria Sinicropi of Clark, Brianne Skriloff of Edison, Yuri Smishkewych of Cranford, Jessica Soriano of Rahway, Alexa Speer of Avenel; Richard Gregory of Piscataway initiated at University of Delaware; Megan Moran of Woodbridge initiated at State University of New York College at Plattsburg; Elena Shupak of Monmouth Junction initiated at The College of New Jersey.\n\n\n\nThe Wardlaw-Hartridge School\n\nALSO: Twenty-four Upper School students at The Wardlaw-Hartridge School in Edison were inducted into the World Language Honor Societies at a ceremony in the Oakwood Room on May 17. Jamie Segraves, World Language Department Chair, delivered the welcome, which was followed by the Introduction to the Honor Societies, Candle Ceremony and Honor Society Oaths.\n\nThe following students were inducted: Chinese – Suraj Chandran of Edison, Jennifer Guo of Edison, Michael Jesionka of Middlesex, Eduardo Martinez of Scotch Plains, Kevin Nader of Bernardsville, Shaun Martinez of Woodbridge, Gursimran Singh of Monroe and Rishi Yasa of Edison; Latin – Rohan Arvindh of Woodbridge, Audrey Cheng of Colonia, Sana Mansuri of Edison, Kerry McGrath of Carteret, Raj Raval of South Plainfield, Zishan Sajid of Carteret Ellena Son of Woodbridge, Hannah Yates of Piscataway and Jason Yin of Scotch Plains; Spanish – Aaliah Burney of Sewaren, Ovidio Chavez of Elizabeth, Akash Dalal of Scotch Plains, Abraham Golding of North Plainfield, Shreyas Heragu of Edison, Lauren Kisare of Bridgewater, Mia Reyes of Pisacataway and Brittney Wilson of North Plainfield.\n\nALSO: On May 14, The Middle School Robotics Club from The Wardlaw-Hartridge School in Edison competed in the Botball New York/New Jersey regional tournament in Rahway. Sixteen teams, including 14 high school and two middle school teams, took part in this event that tested students' resourcefulness, resilience and perseverance. Club advisor Noreen Jafri accompanied team leads Faizah Naqvi of South Plainfield, Ashwin Manur of Iselin and teammates Svanik Dani of Edison, Sohum Thakker of Monroe, PranavMuralikrishnan of Piscataway, Shiv Tickoo of Edison and Zain Zaidi of Edison.\n\nThe day was packed with exciting moments as the W-H team competed head-to-head in a double elimination event against seasoned high school teams. The young W-H team was undefeated against The Lawrenceville School, Minisink Valley High and Xavier High School, and grabbed a second place in the tournament.\n\n\n\n“Botball 2016 was a very interesting experience for me. There were so many ups and downs. It was also very stressful, but it is something that I will never forget,” Shiv Tickoo said. “This was also a great opportunity to bond with my teammates as well as people from other teams. It also gave me some knowledge on coding and some building. It also helped me improve my writing ability. In the end, it felt really good watching our robot accomplish the feats that it was meant to accomplish.”\n\nTrinity Episcopal Day School 2016 Summer programs\n\nDid you know that summer vacation takes an academic toll on students’ skills and knowledge? Statistics show that when students report to school in September, on average they perform one month behind where they were in June. Summer learning programs have the potential to help children improve their academic outcomes.\n\nTrinity Episcopal Day School (TEDS) 205 North Ave., Cranford is offering two programs for summer 2016. The TEDS Enrichment Program, for Grades K-5, is designed to maintain students’ academic skills in Reading, Math, Writing and Comprehension. The TEDS Summer Program, for ages 21/2 to 4 years, includes academics and weekly-themed arts and crafts, games and activities. TEDS Summer Programs run from July 11 to Aug.19. Reservation can be made by the week and TEDS offers extended hours from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. For more information call 908-276-2881 or visit www.tedscranford.com.\n\nWoodbridge Township School District\n\nWoodbridge Township School District conducted its first district-wide middle school Spelling Bee on May 11. The top 10 spellers from each of the five Woodbridge Township middle schools competed for the grand prize and the title of WTSD’s Spelling Bee Champion. Preliminary rounds took place at the individual middle schools with the final round culminating at the district level.\n\nAfter a fierce competition, Stephen Daramola, a seventh-grade student from Avenel Middle School was named this year’s Spelling Bee Champion and took home the grand prize, a $200 TD Bank gift card. Second- and third-place winners, Diya Vemuganti and LiamO’Donnell, both eighth-grade students from Iselin Middle School, won $100 and $50 TD Bank gift cards, respectively.\n\nThe Rotary Club of Woodbridge-Perth Amboy sponsored the event, donating $500 for prizes.\n\nUnion County College\n\nThis summer the Office of Continuing Education at Union County College is offering the 2016 College for Teens program sponsored by the Union County Board of Chosen Freeholders.\n\nThis free program is offered for two sessions. Each session is will run for two weeks and will meet from Monday through Thursday.

And sometimes nothing but a cheesesteak will do.\n\nAfter the Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl, we wanted to watch the televised parade at a neighborhood bar accompanied by a cold beer and the City of Brotherly Love's favorite sandwich.\n\nOne of the best in Delaware can be found at Kid Shelleen's. The food at Kid Shelleen's greatly improved when Harry's Savoy Grill owner Xavier Teixido took over operations in 2010.\n\nThe \"jumbo cheesesteak\" ($15.95) is a whopper of a sandwich. You could easily split it — well, unless, you have a Jason Kelce-size appetite. It's loaded with lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, fried onions and, of course, Cheez Whiz, or you can build your own.\n\nShellfish cobb at Columbus Inn\n\n2216 Pennsylvania Ave, Wilmington\n\nSalads can be boring. Really boring.\n\nThis one is not, especially if you're a shellfish lover.\n\nThe shellfish cobb ($26) is a healthy and filling meal. A bed of mixed greens is tossed with a light, but zippy horseradish-spiked thousand Island dressing.\n\nFanned out on top are pieces of cold shrimp, a half of lobster, including tail and claw meat, as well as lumps of crab. The rest of the salad, in true Cobb fashion, has egg, bacon, avocado, cucumber, tomato, radish, red onions and green beans. Enjoy.\n\nBanana pudding at Limestone BBQ and Bourbon\n\n2062 Limestone Road, Limestone Shopping Center, Milltown\n\nLimestone BBQ and Bourbon, which opened this past summer, is a new concept for High 5 Hospitality, the restaurant group that runs the state's Buffalo Wild Wings franchises and the Stone Balloon Ale House in Newark.\n\nCulinary director Robbie Jester has recreated a slightly altered version of his grandmother's famed banana pudding that he calls \"Grahammie's\" banana pudding ($5).\n\nJester makes it with love, and he does his \"grammy\" proud.\n\nImpossible burger at Grain Craft Bar & Kitchen\n\nLocations in Bear, Newark, and Kennett Square, Pennsylvania\n\nThere's no way a vegan burger can look, smell and taste like meat, right? Impossible, don't you think?\n\nWell, think again. Last January, Grain Craft Bar & Kitchen restaurants in Newark, Bear, and Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, added the \"Impossible Burger\" to their menus and we gave it a try.\n\nImpossible Burgers are not gluten- or soy-free. They're made with wheat and potato proteins and coconut oil, which is the fat in the burger.\n\nThe meat-like texture, aroma and flavor comes from heme, a molecule found in plants and red meat that makes blood red and gives beef its distinctive taste.\n\nThe patty has a similar mouth-feel to beef. We found the flavor pleasingly meaty with no initial off-putting after-taste, though it probably won't fool devoted carnivores. (If you want a beef burger, get a beef burger.)\n\nCurry chicken at Mayne Dish\n\n2202 Kirkwood Highway, Elsmere\n\nI needed sunshine on a dreary May day, so I checked out Mayne Dish, a Jamaican-American restaurant in Elsmere.\n\nYou order at the counter. There are tables downstairs and upstairs. But I took my curry chicken and D&G Jamaican Ginger Beer to go. While waiting for my $8 lunch and $2 drink, I was serenaded by Bob Marley tunes.\n\nA small order of chicken curry included a huge helping of chicken, potatoes and carrots with rice and beans and cabbage. I hit the wall after a few bites and still had more than half of it left.\n\nA few minor quibbles: You really had to watch out for the bones, especially a few small pieces of bone. Maybe they chopped the chicken pieces with a cleaver that might need to be sharpened? The flavor was very good. Next time, I'll check out the jerk chicken.\n\nDinner at Heirloom\n\n212 Savannah Road, Lewes\n\nOwner Meghan Lee's endearing 3-year-old Lewes restaurant in a renovated Victorian home doesn't just rank as one of the best restaurants in Sussex County, it's easily one of the best in the state. She and executive chef Matthew Kern collaborate to create the exciting and ambitious menus that change with the seasons.\n\nThis past spring, we loved the house-stretched burrata with its soft, creamy white cheese, swirls of green from torn basil and dots of red from Calabrian chili.\n\nPlump spring peas popped when you bit into them and crumbles of sourdough breadcrumbs and sprinkles of sea salt added toasty crispness.\n\nBut, really, I don't think you can go wrong with any dish here. Looking forward to more in 2019.\n\nBraised short rib pizza at Crust & Craft\n\nMidway Galleria, 18701 Coastal Highway (Del. 1), Rehoboth Beach\n\nWhen Crust & Craft chef/owner Brenton Wallace posted a photo of the short rib beef pizza ($18) made with caramelized onions, chanterelle mushrooms and creamy Robiola cheese on Instagram this summer, I made a beeline for his Rehoboth Beach gourmet pizzeria.\n\nThe eatery specializes in 12-inch Neapolitan-style pizzas baked in a red-tiled Marana Forni wood-fired oven that can reach 900 degrees. Definitely worth a visit.\n\nNew York strip and wedge salad at Houston-White Co.\n\n315 Rehoboth Ave., Rehoboth Beach\n\nThe new restaurant across from Dogfish Head Brewings & Eats, is aimed directly at beef eaters. This destination for steak lovers is owned by Megan Kee who also runs La Fable, a lovely, traditional French bistro on Baltimore Avenue.\n\nThe $45 New York strip (14-ounces) came beautifully seared just a notch above medium-rare, as requested, and was simply a beautiful, juicy, beefy, tender yet still slightly chewy, cut.\n\nThe wedge salad ($12) on a chilled plate with drizzles of blue cheese dressing, a generous amount of Stilton blue cheese, cherry tomatoes, a confetti of red onion and hearty chunks of bacon can be shared.\n\nCrab cakes at Courtyard by Marriott– Newark\n\nUniversity of Delaware, 400 David Hollowell Drive, Newark\n\nBack in June, we began a hunt for the best places in Delaware to get a crab cake. We saved the best for last because the crab cakes made by Chef Mark Chopko easily deserve the numerous awards they have received.\n\nThe $26 crab cake dinner (two cakes and two sides) is available at the hotel's bistro at the hotel off Del. 896. The bistro serves breakfast and dinner, no lunch. These gluten-free cakes, bigger than your palm, are made with all lump crab meat and a secret all natural binding ingredient.\n\nMy second favorite spot for crab cakes in Delaware is Woody's Dewey Beach Bar & Grill. The crab cakes served at Racing Legends restaurant at Delaware Park in Stanton are a close third.\n\nPappardelle with lamb bolognese at Bardea\n\nCorner of Seventh and North Market streets, Wilmington\n\nScott Stein and Antimo DiMeo's Bardea (pronounce it bar-DAY-ah) restaurant has been one of the buzziest, busiest new eateries to hit downtown Wilmington in some time. The 5,000 square-foot space, formerly Kennedy Fried Chicken, has been completely refurbished and tables fill up fast.\n\nDiMeo's housemade pappardelle with lamb bolognese ($17), featuring a plop of soft mint goat cheese, has become a favorite.\n\nYou don't get a whopping, supersize plate and you probably won't be taking home leftovers, but it is closer to the size of what you would find in restaurants in Italy.\n\nPork tacos at MezCali Taqueria\n\n1205 Coastal Highway (Del. 1), Dewey Beach\n\nMezCali, a California-inspired taquería and mezcal bar serving tacos, small plates, entrees and cocktails in a casual setting, took over the former Dewey Beach Club.\n\nThe tacos, wrapped with fresh, made-in-house corn tortillas, are so delectable, don't be surprised if you start planning what to order next while still working on your first plate.\n\nThe pork carnitas might be my favorite, though the sweet potato tacos (two for $8), made with twice-fried 'taters, jicama slaw, pico de gallo and Sriracha aioli, are a very close second.\n\nThe moist, slow-roasted pork in the tacos al pastor (two for $8), pairs perfectly with chunks of pineapple and onions and a confetti of cilantro. Other choices include baja fish, coconut shrimp and carne asada.\n\nPoke bowls at Poke Bros.\n\nMill Creek Shopping Center at Kirkwood Highway and Limestone Road\n\nI jumped started my healthy eating for 2018 with trips to Poke Bros., and haven't stopped all year. The fast-casual chain specializes in Hawaiian-style raw fish rice bowls. Three franchises have opened in Delaware.\n\nPoke, pronounced POH-KAY, originated in Hawaii and features cubed-cut raw fish mixed in a bowl with rice, vegetables and other toppings. It's sometimes called “sushi in a bowl.”\n\nMeals can be customized with various sauces and garnishes. Most bowls will cost under $13.\n\nI'm also a fan of the PoBu sushi burrito at PoBu Restaurant at 215 E. Main St. in Newark.\n\nTo make the burrito, the staff top a sheet of nori with sushi rice and then layer in ahi tuna, Scottish salmon, avocado and edamame.\n\nFor a bit of crunch, they add tempura. The roll gets some gentle heat from squeezes of wasabi basil and sriracha aioli.\n\nTropical acai bowl at Playa Bowls\n\n134 E. Main St., Newark\n\nIt might not be easy to pronounce, but acai was a hot food trend in Delaware in 2018.\n\nAçaí (ah-sah-EE) a tropical, South American purple berry found in rainforests, is often touted as a superfruit.\n\nAt Playa Bowls, I got hooked on the Tropical Bowl ($9), pure açaí topped with granola, bananas, pineapple, coconut flakes and honey.\n\nAnother favorite is Nutella ($11) which includes açaí , banana, strawberry, coconut flakes and Nutella drizzle.\n\nCoffee at Little Goat Coffee Roasting Co.\n\n16 Haines St., Newark\n\nInside an adorable Sears Roebuck kit house, dating back to the early 1940s, that once was the original home of the Newark Natural Foods Co-op and, later, a hairdresser and skate/snowboard shop, you'll find one of the best cups of coffee in the state.\n\nAt Little Goat Coffee Roasting Co., customers can watch the roasting process in action, snuggle on a floral couch near a (non-working) fireplace, or grab a seat in one of two plush red seats that once faced the stage at Wilmington's Grand Opera House.\n\nLittle Goat was founded by business partners Joe Lins and Olivia Brinton, who wanted to bring their own freshly roasted, organically grown and fairly traded coffee to Delaware.\n\nCrab and lobster tower at Eden\n\n23 Baltimore Ave., Rehoboth Beach\n\nWhile Labor Day weekend always, sadly, spells the unofficial end of the season, one of my favorite dishes of the past summer, and in fact year, was the crab and Maine lobster tower at Eden.\n\nIt features layers of large chunks of cold lobster meat over creamy crab meat. The base of the molded tower is a fruity mango salsa and the plate is finished with a swipe of cool, avocado crema.\n\nEden, a romantic, fine-dining, dinner-only eatery has long offered this $19 appetizer, but it was a new-to-me experience.\n\nFocaccia robiola di Ciro at Touch of Italy\n\n530 Concord Pike, Brandywine Hundred\n\nWhen Touch of Italy owner Bob Ciprietti took over the former Bella Coast Italian Kitchen & Market on Concord Pike, the Sussex County restaurateur came with some secret weapons.\n\nHe brought in culinary consultant Ciro Verdi, a longtime New York City chef/restaurateur whose pizza has been praised by celebrity chef Bobby Flay and featured often on the Food Network.\n\nVerdi is overseeing all dishes on the menu. On a recent visit, Touch of Italy seemed to still be working out kinks, but I'd go back for focaccia robiola di Ciro, a signature dish that Verdi first introduced in 1989.\n\nThe thin, baked focaccia ($17) is smeared with creamy, robiola cheese and drizzled with white truffle oil. Verdi's focaccia robiola di Ciro deluxe ($21) is the same style pie, but it also includes prosciutto, arugula and oven-dried tomatoes.\n\nThe Hydrator at Raw Essential Juice Bar\n\nShops of Limestone Hills, 5335 Limestone Road, Pike Creek\n\nA family member turned me on to this delicious, cold, $8.50 green drink and now I can't get enough.\n\nThe Hydrator is a 20-ounce, 170-calorie smoothie featuring a blend of cucumber, spinach, pineapple, mango and cucumber water. It's refreshing, but not overly sweet. Give it a try.\n\nPastries at The Station on Kings\n\n720 Kings Highway, Lewes\n\nThis snazzy cafe and market that opened last year comes from Leisa Berlin, who runs the town's super cute and classic candy store, Edie Bees Confection Shop on Second Street.\n\nThe delectable pastries are not to be missed. I like the croissants, especially the chocolate-banana and the savory ham and cheese.\n\nYou can order lunch at the counter and eat it in a separate greenhouse-like dining area. The menu goes well beyond run-of-the-mill sandwiches and salads.\n\nCream of crab soup at Meding's Seafood\n\n3697 Bay Road, Milford\n\nRecently, we stopped into this Kent County seafood market/restaurant off Del. 1 to get the low-down on the giant gold 47,000-pound, 20-foot ship's propeller that's in the parking lot.\n\nThe propeller, purchased as an eye-catching landmark for the eatery, was one of four that once helped thrust the USS Shangri-La. That aircraft carrier commissioned in 1944 earned two battle stars in World War II, and three stars in the Vietnam War. Famed astronauts Jim Lovell and the late Gene Cernan were once deployed on the Shangri-La.\n\nDuring our visit on a cold November morning, we tried Meding's signature homemade cream of crab soup. It's a winner. The cream of crab soup, a family recipe, is made with fresh crabmeat and a dash of seasoning on top. You can eat in or get it to go in 12- or 32-ounce containers.\n\nAvocado-blood orange salad at Prime 225\n\n225 Bohemia Ave., Chesapeake City, Maryland\n\nPrime 225 restaurant in Chesapeake City, Maryland, is worth a drive and for so much more than this salad. But I've included it because it's was so hard to stop eating it.\n\nA dining companion, who has visited Prime 225 several times in the past, didn't even have to look at the menu. He knew he wanted this salad. Again.\n\nChef Brandon Gentry tosses baby arugula leaves with small bites of blood oranges, sweet onion, grape tomatoes and toasted pine nuts in a tart-sweet white balsamic-tarragon vinaigrette. He then fans buttery slices of ripe avocado on top for some crunchy and followed by little creaminess.\n\nThe menu now has a different version of the salad which includes roasted baby beets, oven dried tomatoes, avocado, sweet onion, candied pine nuts, red wine poppy seed vinaigrette and local honey.\n\nIt's still a very good beginning to a meal, especially if you get a bone-in ribeye or the Maryland rockfish.\n\nMORE DELAWARE FOOD:\n\n20 (and more) classic Delaware eateries you shouldn't miss\n\n10 great Delaware places to satisfy a sweet tooth\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2022/06/24/best-restaurants-cincinnati-sotto-nicolas-jean-robert-jeff-ruby-fausto-kiki-salazar-bakers-table/7500577001/", "title": "Best restaurants in Cincinnati: 15 places that stand above the rest", "text": "I don't like playing favorites. So when my editor asked me if I'd be interested in doing a \"best restaurants\" list this year, I was initially on the fence. But when I got to thinking about how often readers (and friends) have asked me for recommendations on where to eat in this town, I realized there were a few spots that always make my greatest hits list.\n\nSure, there are plenty of local chili parlors, pizzerias and barbecue joints to celebrate. But let's save those for later. The focus of this list is the full-service restaurants that are firing on all cylinders (or at least as many cylinders as they can right now). I say that because staff shortages are still a cold reality. And even restaurants that are fully staffed are likely to train brand-new employees, many of whom had no prior restaurant experience.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2018/02/20/best-new-jersey-breakfasts-around-world/1059772001/", "title": "Breakfast places in NJ with a heaping helping of local flavor", "text": "They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. And that means it's imperative that the first thing that greets your palate be delicious. Otherwise, you may skip breakfast, or wolf down a few glazed doughnuts and be famished a couple of hours later.\n\nNo risk of that happening when breakfast is infused with big, bold flavors.\n\nInternational breakfasts — the morning meals that are popular in Ecuadorian, Balkan, Cuban, Turkish, Scottish and Chinese cultures, to name a few — are a fascinating and scrumptious way to start a day.\n\nHere are an assortment of breakfasts — and the restaurants that serve them — recommended by professional chefs and consummate food lovers.\n\nCalentado with Chorizo at Noches de Colombia, Englewood\n\nWhat do you do with leftover arepas, chorizo, rice and beans? If you're in the Andean region of Colombia, you reheat your leftovers, top it with one or two fried eggs and, ¡ya esta!, breakfast. Called \"calentado,\" which means heated, this hearty dish can be found in just about any traditional Colombian mom-and-pop shop. In North Jersey, chef and owner Galo Grijalva of Empanada Mania in Bergenfield says his go-to spot for the dish is Noches De Colombia in Englewood. He was introduced to the dish by his Colombian friends while growing up in Ecuador. The dish is terrific, he said. However, the best part is, Grijalva said, \"the hot chocolate\" that many Colombians order with it. \"It is made with broken down pieces of chocolate, heated in milk with cinnamon and sugar and pieces of cheese thrown in so they melt.\"\n\nGo: 90 W.

He enjoys it at Chinese supermarket Kam Man Market, which has an eat-in-bakery and a counter for enjoying the prepared foods it produces. But of course Dan Tat is best eaten in the morning, Cho said, when they are fresh out of the oven. Whenever Cho finds himself at Kam Man, he makes sure to wolf down a fresh Dan Tat, along with Bolo Bao, a Chinese pineapple bun, and Char Siu Bao, Cantonese steamed pork buns. He washes it all down with a cup of coffee. And the breakfast is easy on his wallet too: Each pastry costs from $1.25 to $2.\n\nGo: 200 Route 10, East Hanover; 973-503-1770, kammanmarket.com.\n\nPrzenice (Balkan French Toast) at Cafe Bubarama, Clifton\n\nSnezana Milia, Cafe Bubarama's owner, hails from Montenegro, and calls przenice (pronounced projenees) \"the main breakfast my mother and her mother's mother made.\" Her darling 3-year-old cafe specializes in the foods of the Balkans. How is przenice, aka Balkan french toast, different from American french toast? \"We fry our bread in oil, we don't grill it,\" Milia said. Plus the toast — multigrain if it is served with sweet jam and fruit; thick white bread if served with savory ingredients — is brushed with an egg wash, not soaked in eggs. Kenny West, a Clifton resident and sous chef of Orama restaurant in Edgewater, is a huge fan of Bubarama's przenice, especially the thick toast served with Bulgarian feta and smoked beef prosciutto ($8.25). Or, sometimes, he orders another specialty of the house: burek, filled pies made with flaky phyllo dough. The house-made pies can be filled with meat, cheese, vegetables; West's favorite is filled with mashed potatoes ($6 personal pie; $3.75 mini-pie). And everyone knows to order the homemade yogurt ($2.50 small; $3.50 large) to drink. \"Ninety-nine percent of the people drink yogurt with it,\" Milic said.\n\nGo: 263 Parker Ave., Clifton; 973-928 1371, cafebubamara.com.\n\nHuevos Rancheros at Raymond's, Ridgewood and Montclair\n\nGuatemalan-born Carlos Valdez, executive chef of The Oceanaire Seafood Room in Hackensack, grew up eating beans and eggs for breakfast. So is it any wonder that his favorite breakfast is huevos rancheros, the classic Central American and Mexican dish that originally was enjoyed on farms (it means rancher's eggs)? Composed of fried eggs served on fried corn tortillas dressed in a simple tomato and chili sauce, and often accompanied by fresh avocado, huevos rancheros can be found on the menus of diners, cafes and even white-tableclothed restaurants. Valdez loves the version served at Raymond's because, he said, it is obvious to him that \"the dish made it onto the menu from someone in the kitchen staff.\" In other words, a fellow Latin American. He said his daughter has watched him order it so many times that she eventually started ordering it — and now it's her favorite breakfast, too ($14).\n\nGo: 101 E.Ridgewood Ave., Ridgewood; 201-445-5125; and 28 Church St., Montclair 973-744-9263, raymondsnj.com.\n\nBenedict Arepa at Chit Chat Diner, Hackensack\n\nArepa, a flat patty made of ground maize, is eaten practically all day long in Northern South America — and of course in the morning. But, that's no reason not to upgrade this commonplace and classic Latin American dish with perfectly poached eggs, grilled chorizo, melted Manchego sheep cheese and pimento-flecked Hollandaise sauce. Which is how you'll find the dish at colorful Chit Chat Diner in Hackensack, a favorite breakfast meal of Bogota resident Ralph Perrotti, chef of Atlas Public House in Jersey City. \"I am all in with anything that involves chorizo,\" said Perrotti. In addition to Benedict Arepa ($12.95), he recommends Chit Chat's huevos rancheros ($10.95) — with chorizo.\n\nGo: 515 Essex St., Hackensack; 201-820-4033 chitchatdiner.com.\n\nCombinado Lurin (Peruvian Combination Plate) at Oh! Calamares, Kearny\n\nChicharrones (fried pork belly), relleno (Peruvian blood sausage) and camote (yam chips) is what Lima-born, CIA-trained chef Jan Placencia craves for breakfast on weekend mornings. It's a hearty dish (actually dishes) — and just to ensure it supplies enough carbs it's often served with pan frances (fresh rolls). This combination breakfast or combinado lurin is served in many Peruvian restaurants, noted the Lyndhurst resident, who is set to open Somos, a Peruvian/fusion restaurant in North Arlington sometime next month.\n\nBut he admits he has a soft spot for his parents' restaurant Oh! Calamares in Kearny, where the dish is available on Saturdays and Sundays beginning at 10 a.m. Cost: $13. And the drink of choice: cafe con leche, of course ($2).\n\nGo: 102 Kearny Ave, Kearny; 201-998-4111, ohcalamaresnj.com.\n\nMenemen at Istanbul Borek & Kebab, Cliffside Park\n\nIn the center of the country of Turkey sits the city of Menemen, where the fertile soil, nourished by the Gediz River, is perfect for growing tomatoes. So perfect, in fact, that the country’s first tomatoes are said to have been grown there. It is fitting, then, that a classic Turkish breakfast shares the city’s name: “This breakfast item uses a lot of tomatoes, and they say that’s how it got the name,” said Ayca User, who with her sister, Zeynep Ozdemir, owns Red Bank’s Antoinette Boulangerie. The women were born in Turkey; Menemen is close to their hometown, Izmir. “I love a good Turkish breakfast,” she said, “and if there is Menemen on the menu, count me in!” User enjoys the dish at Istanbul Borek & Kebab in Cliffside Park, “or try any Turkish restaurant in Paterson,” she said.“The dish is rich in tomatoes and green peppers,” User said. “After sautéing the veggies with olive oil, add the eggs and make it scrambled style, a little salt and pepper and voilà. It is amazing with some fresh Turkish bread to dip in. Afiyet Olsun!” (Turkish for bon appétit)\n\nGo: Istanbul Borek & Kebab, 360 Lawton Ave., Cliffside Park; 201-945-3030, istanbulborekkebab.eat24hour.com.\n\nPotato Scones, Black Pudding at Cameron’s Scottish Foods, Brick\n\nOutside of the United States, breakfast tends to lean more savory than sweet — like England’s grilled tomatoes and baked beans or Israel’s shakshuka. The same is true of Scotland, as Ian McAndrew recalls.“While my kids were growing up, I was fortunate enough to have them all try different Scottish foods without much pushback,” said McAndrew, who owns Cameron’s Scottish Foods in Brick. “On Sundays, when we would have a family breakfast, I would cook them Scottish sausage, potato scones, eggs, and black pudding. Once I finished making breakfast, we would all sit at the family table and enjoy our time together, telling stories and laughing.\" At his store, McAndrew sells potato scones and black pudding, a sausage made with onions, barley, oats, spices, salt and beef blood, plus other Scottish specialties.\n\nGo: Cameron’s Scottish Foods, 284 Brick Blvd. in Brick; 732-920-0006 cameronsscottish.com.\n\nLamb Mergueze Sausage Shakshuka at MishMish, Montclair\n\nShakshuka, a heady dish of poached eggs atop a spicy slightly sweet tomato sauce, is the Middle East's gift to breakfast lovers. Who can resist sopping up the delicious red sauce with a slice or two of bread? For brunch at popular casual Mediterranean spot MishMish, Israeli-born chef Meny Vaknin gilds one rendition of his shakshuka (he offers four varieties) with lamb mergueze sausage ($14), because (1) he could and (2) it works. \"The sweetness and the savory flavor of the sauce benefits from the fat and full seasoning of the lamb,\" Vaknin said. Food fan Michael Sinatra, who worked at Whole Foods Market for nearly eight years, can't forget the deliciousness of MishMish's lamb mergueze shakshuka. \"I only had it once but I am always thinking about it,\" he said.\n\nGo: 215 Glenridge Ave., Montclair; 973-337-5648 mishmishcafe.com\n\nMaduro, Spinach and Queso Blanco Omelette at La Isla, Hoboken\n\nLa Isla, a funky Cuban spot in Hoboken, is famous for its French toast — it has been featured on TV — but for Hoboken resident and fervent food lover Michael Sinatra, it is the omelette with sweet plantains ($10) that is the real star of morning eating at La Isla. \"Perhaps my favorite omelette on earth,\" he declared. Get it with a side of Cuban coffee and cafe con leche.\n\nGo: 104 Washington St., Hoboken; 201-659-8197 aislarestaurant.com\n\nBreakfast Burrito at Sazon Latino, Boonton\n\nBoonton has 22 eateries, said Chris Manzella, the outgoing executive director for Main Street Boonton. You can get just about any cuisine here — but only a few places are open for breakfast. One that is open — and good — is Sazon Latino. Everything in this spot is cooked by chef-owner Gerardo Lagos of Hondurus. Help yourself to a tray, tell Lagos what you want, wait for him to cook it and then place it on your tray, grab yourself a seat and enjoy. \"Every day is a different offering,\" Manzella said. \"It's quite unique.\" Anything that she likes best? \"To be honest with you, most of the time I just point.\" On offer always are the usual Central American staples: plantains, arroz con pollo, chorizo, etc. But do try the breakfast burrito, a soft tortilla with sour cream, rice and beans, cheddar and pepper Jack cheese with your choice of pulled pork or chorizo ($5). \"Everybody likes it,\" Lagos declared proudly.\n\nGo: 209 Main St., Boonton; 973-794-4121, no web site.\n\nGallo Pinto at the Division Café, Somerville\n\nIn Costa Rica, breakfast is the biggest meal of the day, and that is certainly reflected on the menu of the Division Café in Somerville, which features tons of breakfast favorites including gallo pinto, a Costa Rican traditional breakfast of stir-fried rice, beans, cilantro, onions and peppers accompanied by sweet plantains, a fried egg and a slice of cheese. “This dish is very unusual to other cultures and it really represents Costa Rica,” said Steffany Granados, marketing manager at the Division Café and daughter of the owners. “Our Costa Rican clientele really loves our gallo pinto and our American customers find it interesting and different.” Traditionally, gallo pinto is made of the leftover rice and beans from last night’s meal tossed in with whatever else is available, explained Granados. “Everyone has their own way of making it,” she said. Plus, aside from it being tasty and filling, the dish caters to everyone since it can be vegetarian or meat can be added to it. $7.95, add $3.95 for grilled chicken or $4.95 for steak.\n\nGo: 8 Division St., Somerville; 908-450-7979, divisioncafe.com.\n\nPorción de Chicharron at Sabor Peruano, Rahway\n\nWhen Peruvians head to Sabor Peruano in Rahway for a traditional breakfast, the porción de chicharron — deep fried pork chunks with sweet potatoes and onion salad — is one of the first things that they notice. “It’s a very traditional dish,” said Johanny Fonseca, co-owner of Sabor Peruano. “Everyone likes it — it comes out very soft in the center and crispy on the outside and paired with the sweet potatoes and onion salad, it’s such a good mix.” When non-Peruvians come into Sabor Peruano for breakfast, Fonseca said that she explains to them that Peruvians are very heavy eaters and will even pair the dish with bread. She urges them to try the porcio de chicharron, and they’re always glad they did. “Once they give the dish a try, they finally understand,” she said. “They always like it.” ($8.)\n\nGo: 1576 Irving St, Rahway; 732-900-1396, saborp.wixsite.com/saborperuano.\n\nSteak and Eggs at A Little Bit of Cuba Dos, Freehold\n\nFor Jay Lopez, chef and owner of A Little Bit of Cuba Dos in Freehold Borough, breakfast reminds him of his childhood. “While growing up in Cuba, I looked forward to the weekend, when we would visit my ranch, or rancho, as we say in Spanish,” Lopez said. “Everything we would eat there was the freshest you could get. My favorite breakfast was the Cuban version of steak and eggs — grilled skirt steak topped with two eggs, sunny-side up, and a side of tostones, or fried plantains. We also ate arroz criollo, rice topped with a fried egg, beans, avocado and maduros, which are sweet plantains. Even though they’re technically breakfast dishes, I find myself craving them at any time of the day! The flavors really bring back memories.” Lopez’s restaurant does not serve breakfast, but if a diner would like to try these dishes, he will prepare them during lunch and dinner service.\n\nGo: 2 E. Main St., Freehold Borough; 732-577-8506; alittlebitofcubados.com.\n\nTamal at Uncle Ralph's, Edison\n\nA great breakfast — or any meal, really — often is one that includes a little bit of everything. A bit of this, a taste of that, a dish like this is a true treat, and so fulfilling. Such is the case with Chef Marita Lynn’s favorite Peruvian breakfast. “There is a classic and popular authentic breakfast in Peru that consists of tamal, a corn cake stuffed with chicken or pork and wrapped in banana leaves; olives, hard-boiled eggs, chicharron (crispy pork), relleno (blood sausage), fried sweet potatoes and salsa criolla, which is julienne onions in lime juice,” said Lynn, who until last year owned Runa Peruvian Cuisine in Red Bank. She now shares her passion for Peruvian cuisine through cooking classes and her food blog (mykitchenintuition.com). “There's a place south of Lima where all you can find is this popular breakfast: It's called Lurin, and I remember going with my big family there (including cousins, aunts, uncles) some Sundays to have this delicious breakfast. Many restaurants right in Lima will have it.\" She continued: “This breakfast is a classic for anyone in my family's birthday, and most of the time, my mom and I will either cook or go to a restaurant. Uncle Ralph’s in Edison serves this authentic Peruvian breakfast, and I am sure you will enjoy it because it is delicious.”\n\nGo: 2143 Woodbridge Ave., Edison; 848-202-9366.\n\nWhitefish at the Kibitz Room, Cherry Hill\n\nChef-restaurateur Mark Smith, who owns Tortilla Press in Collingswood, a BYOB, and Tortilla Press Cantina in Pennsauken, grew up in the Midwest, where he offers Mexican and Southwest-influenced, seasonal cuisine. His favorite breakfast haunt is a South Jersey landmark, The Kibitz Room, a New York-style deli. \"I'm originally from Ohio so when I arrived in South Jersey, exotic brunch food to me meant lox and bagels,\" he said. \"The bagels I was used to in my home town were frozen or packaged ... not the lush, crusty ones in every kind of variety possible that I saw all around me in South Jersey. I'd frequent whatever bagel place was closest to me and then finally discovered the Kibitz Room in Cherry Hill. I think they took pity on me as an unenlightened Midwesterner. They introduced me to bagels with lox and cream cheese — pretty much heaven. Then they suggested I try whitefish, which I absolutely loved. I can't get away with serving it at the restaurant -- nothing less Mexican or Latino than whitefish. But oh, if I only could...\"\n\nGo: 100 Springdale Road, The Shoppes at Holly Ravine, Cherry Hill; 856-428-7878, greatpastrami.com.\n\nSalmon on a Bagel at Moore Bagels, Marlton\n\nChef Phil Manganaro opened Park Place, which is a tiny but already highly acclaimed restaurant in Merchantville. Before setting off on his own, Manganaro launched numerous restaurants for James Beard Award-winning restaurateur Stephen Starr, and also was executive chef at Keg & Kitchen in Westmont. “My favorite and only breakfast place I go to is Moore Bagels in Marlton,\" he says. \"Fresh-made bagels every day, an old red neon sign with the word BAGELS in the window and one of my favorite sandwiches, 'The Evesham.’ Toasted poppy bagel (my choice), cream cheese, raw onion and tomato and Acme smoked salmon. My love of this sandwich comes from my time working in Jewish appetizing in Beverly Hills and NYC while at culinary school. The best part of the bagel shop to me is the smell, the fresh seeds and toasted bagels coming out of the oven throughout the morning. It has an energy to it, brings me right back to NYC for a couple of minutes, right in the heart of suburbia.’’\n\nGo: Moore Bagels, 65 E. Route 70, Marlton; 856-334-5091, moorebagels.com.\n\nBaleadas at Sabor Centroamericano Honduran Restaurant, North Philadelphia\n\nReza Ghassemi and Mirna Castillo, husband and wife, are owners of the newly opened Andalé Latino Grill in Marlton, with an original location in Feasterville, PA. He is from Iran and she is from Honduras. The fast-casual concepts features Latin fare from 21 Spanish-speaking countries, from tacos to arepas. The couple lives in Philadelphia, which is where they get tempted to treat themselves to a special breakfast. “On weekends when my wife wants something authentic for breakfast, we go to Sabor Centroamericano, off Rooselvelt Boulevard and C Street. Her favorite breakfast, other than the authentic pastries, is baleadas.’’Baleadas are a classic Honduran dish made with a thick flour tortilla. Traditionally, it gets filled with mashed fried beans. Other ingredients might include avocado, sausage, plantains, chicken or pork.

(As a side note, we intentionally left barbecue out of this conversation. That's a topic for a whole other discussion — and it's one we plan to have soon.)\n\nFor the most part, the eateries on our list are those that have been around for decades and have distinguished themselves by serving great food and providing quality service. You also may notice a few places you may not have heard of yet. We have included a handful of spots new to the dining scene and making their mark.

Willett believes in the farm-to-fork concept, so every seasonal ingredient is fresh and grown by regional farmers.\n\nWillett’s Oysters of Love (crispy Gulf oysters in New Orleans BBQ Sauce) is a nod to her New Orleans influences and her Smoked Salmon Deviled Eggs start with her grandmother’s recipe. Both are starters not to be missed.\n\nLocated in the historic Brinkley Plaza, the light-filled restaurant has soaring ceilings, red velvet banquettes and one of the most beautiful patios in town.\n\nIf looking for lunch Downtown on a Friday, we recommend Felicia Suzanne’s.

Since 1909, members of the Grisanti family served Northern Italian fare at various restaurants around town.\n\nNestled in the lobby of an Embassy Suites, Frank Grisanti has been a beloved Italian restaurant for decades.\n\nDishes like Toasted Ravioli, Bacon-Wrapped Livers and Italian Meatballs are old-school starters that appear on almost every table. You can’t go wrong with one of the classics like spaghetti with meat sauce, beef lasagna or Grisanti’s manicotti. Chef and owner Frank Grisanti uses the tried-and-true family recipes that have been passed down through the generations.\n\n1022 S. Shady Grove Road; 901-761-9462; frankgrisanti.com\n\nRiver Oaks\n\nMost Memphians heard of Chef José Gutierrez. Many know he as one of an elite few who have earned the title of Maître Cuisinier de France. (There are fewer than 100 chefs with that distinction in North America.) Originally from the Southeast of France, he was head chef of The Peabody dining institution Chez Philippe for his first 22 years in Memphis, winning accolades nationwide during his tenure there.\n\nIn 2010, he decided to make the move out East and took over River Oaks. His neighborhood restaurant quickly became a favorite.\n\nWith Gutierrez's signature modern French fare, the restaurant is also known for its attentive and friendly service.\n\nDishes like Caramelized Salmon with Cauliflower Risotto, Steak Frites and Crispy Organic Lemon Chicken Paillard keep customers coming back.\n\nRegular’s tip: At lunch, order the Chef’s TV Dinner.

Steak lovers should try the Filetto Di Manzo con Gorgonzola — an 8-ounce filet encrusted with garlic, wrapped in bacon and stuffed with gorgonzola. Daily specials allow Judd to show his creativity in the kitchen.\n\nLike the original Ronnie Grisanti’s, the dining room on a weekend night is bustling and a bit loud. The bar at the front of the restaurant is a popular gathering spot. Hand-painted murals (one in the bar and one in the dining room) are nods to the original location. Memorabilia and menus of the family’s previous restaurants are hung throughout the restaurant.\n\nRegular’s tip: Ask to sit at one of the leather banquettes. Thanks to their tall backs, the banquettes help make it easier to converse while still allowing you to feel part of the activity.\n\nRegalia Shopping Center, 6150 Poplar Ave.; 901-850-0191; ronniegrisanti.com\n\nGERMANTOWN / COLLIERVILLE\n\n\n\nLas Tortugas Deli Mexicana\n\nThis little gem in a Germantown strip mall offers some of the freshest and most authentic Mexican food this side of the border.\n\nWith almost 20 different kinds of tacos and tortugas (Mexican sandwiches) served each day, along with other authentic menu items that are constantly changing, there is always something new to try at Las Tortugas Deli Mexicana.\n\n“This is the style of taco you would find in Mexico City,” said Jonathan Magallanes, who opened Las Tortugas in 2003 with his father, Pepe.\n\nEach filling can be ordered as either a taco or a tortuga. The options range from Al Pastor Spicy Pork Tenderloin with Fresh Pineapple to a mild De Huachinango Veracruz grilled fish taco.\n\nIn 2017, they opened a second location in East Memphis at 6300 Poplar Ave. The service at both is fast casual. The lines move fairly quickly — and it is definitely worth the wait.\n\nRegular’s tip: Be sure to start with the guacamole and an order of Elote (Mexican street corn). You’ll thank us after one bite.\n\n1215 S. Germantown Road, Germantown; 901-751-1200; delimexicana.com\n\nP.O.

First of all, that two decades just blew by and then we started our commemorative shows here in the Valley at the Yucca Tap Room in February. We did 12 or 13 of those Yucca shows. And then we hit the road in March and didn’t get back until the end of November. So it was the earliest start and the latest finish to a tour. We saw a lot of people and we had a lot of fun. But as I looked at it on the calendar, going into it, it looked like it would be a really long year. Now I look back and think, ‘Where did it go?’ I guess I have to lean on that old maxim: Time flies when you’re having fun. I kind of wish I could do it again, it was so much fun.”\n\nPeople have been asking if they plan on celebrating any other anniversaries.\n\n“Fans are asking ‘Well, how many anniversary records are you doing?’ Because ‘The Bottle & Fresh Horses’ comes up next year and then in 2019, it’ll be ‘Honky Tonk Union.’ But I’m still writing music. We did a lot of writing, actually, this year. And we’ve begun our sort of preliminary discussions with a really cool producer – a cat who’s in Los Lobos, Steve Berlin. He’s overseeing our direction right now in terms of production.”\n\nBerlin is a brilliant producer and a perfect fit, in many ways, for Clyne’s approach to rock and roll.\n\n“I love his work,” Clyne says. “I love his ethos. He came to a couple of shows of ours in Portland, came backstage, hung on the bus and said, ‘Look I only work with what I like and I really like what you’re doing. I want to do your record.”\n\nAt this point, it’s all just a matter of lining up schedules.\n\n“We’ve already shared about nine songs with him that he’s already given us some good comments and direction on,” Clyne says. “We’re doing our very best to line up our schedules in time to get it out by June. I feel really blessed that he’s a fan and we could stumble into him. I’ve been in the business a long time, but he’s been in it longer and his body of work is impressive. When a guy like that stoops down and says, ‘I want to work with you,’ it feels odd but very good.\n\nThe goal is to record at Wavelab Studio in Tucson.\n\n“So we’re hoping that our touring schedule, the studio’s availability and his touring schedule allow us to get in there in February and March,” Clyne says, “which means as soon as we’re done with these ’76 songs, we’re gonna start doing pre-production in early January here at home. It’s a pretty ambitious schedule, but we’re hopeful.”\n\nAs to how it’s shaping up, direction-wise, Clyne shrugs it off with “I don’t know. And I’m OK with that. Typically, I have a statement of intent before I go into writing a record. But with this one, the only thing I wanted to do was to not lean on all my old habits, because as a writer, I’ve got 20 years of habit. Some of them are successful and some of them aren’t. And I wanted to make sure that before I used these devices again, that I was scrutinizing them. I really tried to stretch the envelope in my writing in terms of subject matter and chord progressions and compositionally. There’s clearly something to be said for pop sensibility but I’m trying to stretch out and listen to stuff like Los Lobos or we were just talking about Jeff Lynne. Those guys shed a lot of light on the art form and I’m standing here kind of in awe while trying to incorporate the new stuff they’ve been showing me.”\n\nAsked if there’s anything else he’s looking forward to in the new year, Clyne says, “Yeah, we’re doing the return of January Jams, our little festival in Mexico. Circus Mexicus in June is our big one and then we do kind of a miniature one in January. We skipped it last year in favor of rehearsals for the ‘Fizzy Fuzzy’ commemorative shows. So we’re bringing it back and we’re doing it at three different venues which we haven’t gotten to do for a while. Traditionally, January Jam is just at JJ’s Cantina. But this year, we’re doing the 13th at Banditos, then the 14th at JJ’s and the 15th at Wrecked at the Reef. We’re doing different sets each night and Jared and the Mill are going to accompany us. So I’m stoked to be getting back down there and putting that back on the calendar.”\n\nThe Darts sign to U.K. label Dirty Water Records, album due next summer\n\nLast month, the Darts threw a record-release celebration at Valley Bar in honor of their first EP.\n\nNow comes news that they've already signed to Dirty Water Records, the in-house label of a legendary London club night named in honor of the Standells' \"Dirty Water.\"\n\nAn all-female garage/psychedelic rock supergroup featuring Nicole Laurenne and Christina Nunez of the Love Me Nots together with Michelle Balderrama of Brainspoon and Rikki Styxx of the Dollyrots, the Darts joined forces early this year when the Love Me Nots went on what Laurenne says is a \"a semi-permanent hiatus.\"\n\nThey've released two EPs in the past few months and the hope is to have a full-length effort out on Dirty Water by next summer.\n\nLaurenne says she's been trying to get the attention of Dirty Water for years \"because of their perfect taste in trashy garage punk and their great media presence.\" And it's easy enough to hear why a label like that would take an active interest in the Darts, whose music more than lives of to the promise of putting those particular musicians in the same room -- especially given the reckless abandon with which they make their way through tracks as instantly engaging as \"Revolution\" and \"Carry Me Home.\"\n\nDirty Water \"finally stopped ignoring me this Fall,\" Laurenne says. \"One of their PR guys, a real sweetheart named Matt Hunter, came to the US and asked to meet with me in Phoenix. There was an instant connection, being that we know a lot of the same bands and people around the world, and have pretty much the same taste in music.\"\n\n\"It's a solid indie label,\" Laurenne says, \"that will allow us a ton of freedom to do what we want creatively but will also give the Darts a presence overseas, which has been one of the band's goals. The label is connected closely with Trash Can Radio, an exciting new UK-based radio show that is starting to come into its own, and it also has top notch physical distribution worldwide. We are really looking forward to playing in Europe this May and putting out a new full-length release on the Dirty Water imprint over the summer. The band could not be more psyched about what 2017 holds.\"\n\nAs for this year, it still holds a Phoenix show on Saturday, Dec. 17, at Lost Leaf with the Vooduo and 16 Eyes. The action starts at 9 p.m.\n\nSnake! Snake! Snakes! return with even more new music for 2016\n\nIt’s only been eight months since Snake! Snake! Snakes! released “Tranquilo,” as strong a contender as I can imagine for the title of best local album of the year. And here they are with something new – a four-song EP called “Wait Up,” recorded at Tucson’s Midtown Island Studios with producer Matt Rendon.\n\nAnd if the first track they’ve shared from the EP – a piano-rocking opener called “Breakdown” – is any indication, it would seem this record picks up pretty much exactly where the last one left off, with reckless abandon to spare.\n\nThe full EP should be released before the week is out. And they’re planning on making a video. In the meantime, you should definitely check out “Breakdown.”\n\nBassist Christopher Sanchez says, “We had no plan for the release whatsoever. It was kind of by accident really. We were supposed to go on a small weekend tour through New Mexico and Colorado, but were having trouble getting bands and venues locked so we just decided to cancel and use the days to go record.”\n\nThey’d heard about Rendon through friends who had recorded there, he says, and they had nothing but great things to say. Now, Snake! Snake! Snakes! have nothing but great things to say as well.\n\n“We think it sounds great,” Sanchez says of the EP, which Rendon recorded and mixed in three days in October. “And he really captured what we felt we sound like live.”\n\nCrescent Ballroom's biggest New Year's Eve block party yet\n\nCrescent Ballroom has announced the details on its biggest New Year's Eve block party yet. The club is blocking off both Second and Third avenues outside the venue with entertainment by Kalliope & the Walter Show, DJ Sean Watson and Phoenix Afrobeat Orchestra.\n\nCrescent owner Charlie Levy says, \"Every year, New Year’s Eve at Crescent gets bigger and bigger. This year, we’re expecting thousands of people and the thing that makes it exciting for us is all the different experiences under one roof.\"\n\nMost of the action is actually under one sky, taking place outside the venue.\n\n\"We’re getting the guys from Walter Productions to bring all their fun, crazy art cars from Burning Man to take over the back parking lot and Third Avenue with their artistic direction and Burning Man sensibility,\" Levy says. \"So we’re gonna have a really fun dance party in the back lot. Inside Crescent, we want to kind of keep it a little more relaxed and quiet, where if you want to go and have a cocktail and sit at a table and have maybe a little bit more of a quiet evening, you have that going on. And then we’re closing down Second Avenue to have Phoenix Afrobeat Orchestra play outside with some really fun DJs. Plus, with the balcony now, you can sit on the balcony and watch them do their thing.\"\n\nLevy says there's something very special going on at midnight in that back lot.\n\n\"I can’t tell you what it is,\" he says. \"But everyone is gonna have their cellphone out taking pictures of this.\"\n\nPhoenix Afrobeat Orchestra's David Marquez says, \"It's going to be an Apocalyptadelic-it's-the-end-of-the-world-so-lets-go-crazy vibe with human capital, flames from the depths of the earth, and the most raw/primal grooves to dance the night away!\"\n\nTickets are $17, on sale now at crescentphx.com.\n\nJimi Hendrix pedals and amp to be auctioned in Scottsdale\n\nA small yet truly awe-inspiring treasure trove of musical items once used by the late Jimi Hendrix is going up for auction New Year's Day at J. Levine Auction & Appraisal in Scottsdale. The items – a wah-wah pedal custom-built for Hendrix prior to his legendary Woodstock set, an amp used in his earliest days at the helm of the Hendrix Experience, and a prototype three-transistor fuzz pedal – have been consigned by Dave Weyer, or the Amp Doctor, as he’s been billed.\n\nWeyer, who designed both pedals and repaired and modified the amp, worked with many of the premiere artists of the Woodstock era, including Neil Young, Crosby Stills and Nash, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Vanilla Fudge, Three Dog Night, and Ike and Tina Turner.\n\n“We’ve spent a lot of time reviewing the provenance, listening to audio recordings, and examining photos and films from Woodstock, and we are confident that this was the wah pedal Jimi used during Woodstock,” said Antoine Gedroyc, J. Levine’s instruments and audio manager and consignment specialist. “It’s an honor and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to represent such an important part of music and American history.”\n\nWeyer says of the wah-wah pedal: “It can be identified by the lack of a Vox logo on the front, the relief where the logo was supposed to be glued on, a West Coast sticker on the bottom, and Jimi’s signature on the inside of the casing wall, applied at a difficult angle, but identifiable nonetheless — and, of course, the things he loved the most, the low noise and the sharp sweep, clearly audible in the Woodstock recordings.”\n\nSebastian Bach signing memoir in Phoenix\n\nSkid Row frontman Sebastian Bach will be in Phoenix on Monday, Dec. 12, to sign his new memoir at Changing Hands Phoenix.\n\n\"18 and Life on Skid Row\" discusses his rise to fame, touring with the likes of Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, Motley Crue, Soundgarden, Pantera, Nine Inch Nails and Guns N’ Roses, the breakup of his band and his personal life.\n\nIf you go: 7 p.m. Monday, Dec. 12.

This is all before she's transformed into Glitter McQueen.\n\n“It's pretty straightforward really,\" the singer explains. \"We worked with Frank Thomas to convey a pretty obvious message complete with ‘perfection’ manifesting as a literal mannequin. The chorus harkens to the overall concept - that we just ‘can't seem to get it together.’ It can be incredibly difficult to live up to others’ ideals of how you should be, but in the end it's all Glitter McQueen - a fabrication of what's beautiful, or cool, a facade. It's a shallowness. The video kinda shows the artist process we go through. The alone-in-a-room-scratching-out-some-chords phase... to creating something... to sharing that something (aka the party scene) which can really be one of the most fun parts. Followed by the glamorized photoshoot scene -- which was meant to show that aspect of trying to fit a particular mold or be liked and accepted. Often to be ‘good enough,’ we fight the compulsion to change everything about ourselves. That's why the character in that scene looks so strikingly different than the others. To show a false image. Art makes us vulnerable, but our hope is to not let that hold us back from being sincere.”\n\nThere is No Us mixing EP with Slayer producer Terry Date\n\nPhoenix’s There is No Us have enlisted the aid of famed metal producer/engineer Terry Date, whose credits range from Metal Church to Deftones, Pantera and Slayer, to mix their new EP at his Seattle studio.\n\nDate says, “With the current events in America, the message in their music is as important and relevant as ever, and that's exciting.”\n\nScheduled for a spring release, \"Generation of Failure” finds the local rockers taking aim at Donald Trump, economic inequality, political corruption and online bullying.\n\nSinger Jim Louvau says when he and guitarist Andy Gerold, a former member of Marilyn Manson, first started working on music together, they were writing songs with Date in mind.\n\n“So it felt like the perfect match when he decided he wanted to be a part of the project,” Louvau says. “Terry's back catalogue of records includes some of the most important metal releases all of time but what really struck us was newer records he's produced like Bring Me The Horizon's 'Sempiternal.’\"\n\nLouvau and Gerold formed There Is No Us in early 2015 to “expose the failure of the human race,” as they put it, adding bassist Amy Abramite and guitarist Jared Bakin to the fold before releasing their debut EP, \"Farewell To Humanity,\" in September.\n\nSupport the station that supports the scene at KWSS-FM Pledge Drive weekend\n\nWe’re heading into Pledge Drive Weekend for the community-driven independent station most likely to spin your favorite local music, KWSS-FM (93.9). And they’re kicking it off this Friday with a local-music showcase at Pho Cao, where you should definitely plan on eating lunch or dinner, maybe both, because the food is awesome. They’re broadcasting live from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nFor those who may be wondering “Why a pledge drive?,” I can answer that.\n\nKWSS-FM is a non-profit station that relies on listener support to underwrite expenses such as music licensing, promotional materials, broadband connectivity, studio and transmitter facilities, insurance, power, web hosting and phones to consider. Unlike NPR or PBS, KWSS is not a part of a larger network of stations. FCC regulations requires the station to be fully independent and locally operated here in Phoenix.\n\nThis is why they can support so many local artists. That and the exquisite taste of folks like Dani Cutler, who says, “The reason I have been volunteering my time to KWSS for nearly 10 years now is not only for my love of music, but the community. We are supportive of each other and all I want to do is help these local bands be recognized for their talents and hard work. Our station is the only independent alt-rock station on the FM dial, and we have the freedom to give them the air time they deserve. The Pledge Drive is a great introduction to KWSS and many of the bands we support.”\n\nYou can make donations now at http://bit.ly/PledgeDrive2016\n\nOr go to Pho Cao Friday to check out this lineup of locals.\n\n11:00 AM Ruca\n\n12:00 PM Mikey Foresteater\n\n1:00 PM Mill's End (Jeff Bump)\n\n2:00 PM Shawn Johnson\n\n3:00 PM The Glides\n\n4:00 PM Exploding Oranges\n\n5:00 PM Manic Monkeys\n\nJimmy Eat World join Artists for a Trump-Free America\n\nJimmy Eat World have joined forces with R.E.M., Moby and more in the Artists for a Trump-Free America project 30 Days, 50 Songs. It was originally 30 Days, 30 Songs, but so many artists came forward with music, they had to expand it to 50.\n\nThe Washington Post has declared it “a playlist of songs that Donald Trump will hate” and no fewer than four of the songs were featured on our Best October Singles playlist, from Aimee Mann singing “I don’t want this job / My god, can’t you tell? I’m unwell” in character as Trump to Death Cab for Cutie’s “Million Dollar Loan.”\n\nThe goal of the project, according to David Eggers, who assembled the playlist with Jordan Kurland, is to “motivate voters to stand against bigotry, sexism, hatred and ignorance.”\n\nThe 38th song in the series, released today, is Jimmy Eat World’s “My Enemy,” a jagged post-punk track that would have fit right in with the themes they address on “Integrity Blues,” their latest album.\n\nThe lyrics are more about letting go of the fears Jim Adkins feels the Donald Trump campaign has been manipulating than it is about the candidate himself. And like Jim James’ contribution to the project, “Same Old Lie,” it’s a perfect fit that also works outside the context of songs for a Trump-Free America.\n\n“There are dangerous and very real consequences for using fear of ‘The Other’ to motivate a potential electorate,” Jim Adkins. “While that’s nothing new in politics, what is newly alarming in context of the current presidential campaign, is how seemingly effective that strategy has been for a certain candidate. That candidate used the low-hanging fruit of fearmongering to gain his initial momentum and continues to employ variations of it to sustain his place. The only way to steel yourself against that kind of manipulation is to do the real self-work in discovering and letting go of your own fears. While that pursuit is difficult because it means fighting against your own ego, it remains worth the effort — not just for what it can do for us as individuals but even more for what it can do for our collective society. Are you willing to accept that maybe, just possibly, what you feel as a threat, isn’t?”\n\nOr, as he sings in the song, “You feel the tide is rising / That water’s cold as hell / Think enemies surround you / Everyone, except yourself.”\n\nTrunk Space reopens\n\nWell, it looks like the end of the end of an era. The Trunk Space will reopen in a new location less than five months after closing its doors on Grand Avenue.\n\nThe venue has issued the following statement about the new digs in Grace Lutheran Church that reads as follows:\n\n\"The rumors are true. The Trunk Space is BACK.\n\n\n\nAfter just under five nomadic months, we will have a stable home once again for DIY arts in downtown Phoenix. Yes, we are at Grace Lutheran Church. Maybe you’ve visited at one of our recent pop-up shows? The space we’re occupying is on the south side of their campus, in a space most recently occupied by a health clinic, and a Montessori school. We will continue to provide an open space for performance and art of all kinds, with an emphasis on that of the weirdo persuasion. Our stage will continue to be uncensored, and we already have several exciting shows in the works for you all.\n\n\n\nWe chose this location for a number of reasons, being walking distance to light rail and three high schools, across the street from our friends at Phoenix Center for the Arts, with plenty of parking onsite, walking distance to bars and restaurants, and still close to a variety of other music venues and art spaces.\n\n\n\nWith the new space, we’re very excited for new opportunities: art studios, classroom space, and a green room. All of these are in development and we’ll let you know as these get finalized. Our new performance room is about the same size as our old space, but slightly more square. And we have access to the Church’s basement, courtyard, multi-purpose room, and sanctuary for special occasions with acts that might be suited by a different space. And, hey, we might still host pop-up shows with our friends at FilmBar, Phoenix Center for the Arts, and 51West if the occasion calls—we’re flexible!\n\nAlso, we are now a nonprofit! Thanks to the fiscal sponsorship of Carefree Write Productions, we can now accept tax-deductible donations. To help with startup costs, we have set up a Razoo crowdfunding page with some fun rewards here: https://www.razoo.com/us/story/Trunk-Space-Opening\n\nThe Trunk Space is and will always be all ages, low-cost, volunteer-centered space ready for performance and art of any kind you can create. See something missing? Let us know, and let’s make it happen.\n\n\n\nWhen the Trunk Space decided to leave our long-time home on Grand, we considered leaving for good. Don’t want that to happen? THEN WE NEED YOU! The Trunk Space needs and will always need donors, coffee wizards, door people, bookers and promoters, art installers, sound engineers, social media managers, street team, and anything else that might keep this space running. Now is the time to make an impact.\n\n\n\nWe look forward to seeing you soon, and stay tuned for show announcements, volunteer needs and more. In the meantime, shoot us a message at thetrunkspace@yahoo.com. We’ll be needing your help to get this thing off the ground.\n\n\n\nWE ARE EXCITED.\n\n-Steph, Connor, Aislyn, Jose, Robbie, Amy, Ben, Seth, Alex, and the rest of the Trunk Space family\"\n\nFairy Bones added to national tour after opening sold-out Crescent Ballroom show\n\nBeing added to a sold-out show at Crescent Ballroom is always a cause for celebration when you’re playing in a local band. Chelsey Louise of Fairy Bones recalled the mood as they were heading into the Sept. 21 show with Highly Suspect: “The day of the show we were so excited, like kids on Christmas status.” And that’s before it even turned into an invitation to join the Grammy-nominated rockers on a string of West Coast dates.\n\nAs Louise and her bandmates were loading out after the show, their first since April, they started talking to the Highly Suspect crew and tour manager. “The conversation basically went like this,” Louise recalls. “’You guys were great, I wish you were on more shows with us!’ ‘We would love to. We will drop everything and do that.’ ‘Oh! Are you guys seriously local?’ ‘Yes. But we can be national?!’\"\n\nThe next day, Louise woke to an Instagram comment from the group’s lead singer, Johnny Stevens, saying they all enjoyed Fairy Bones’ set and they should do it again sometime.\n\n“We thought, cool; that's (expletive) amazing they like us that much, first show back,” Louise says. “Maybe they hit us up next time they play Phoenix. But then I got a call, asking if we wanted to do some upcoming tour dates. Starting next week. And I literally cried.”\n\nThe dates, which start Sept. 29 in Fresno and run through Oct. 10 in Montana, fit perfectly into their schedule. They’d taken some time off to record a single (which made our list of 15 Songs You Need To Hear Right Now) and didn’t have any shows planned until their single release show Oct. 14 at Rebel Lounge\n\n“And like we said to them, we would drop everything and go,” Louise says. “We only work to pay for the band, our house and food. Matt and I ran to Ben’s room to tell him the news and he was like, ‘Maybe they'll fire me.’ In the end, you're not gonna look back and think, ‘Boy am I glad I kept my dead end job.’ S--t like this doesn't happen without sacrifice. If you're serious about a career in music, you know that going in.”\n\nThe Sept. 21 show was the first time Louise had played guitar on stage.\n\n“So it was a really intense show for me,” she says. “All the songs are new, too. We don't have synths or piano anymore. I think this really made it feel like the ‘hiatus’ was worth it. Some really s---ty things happened to me, and I completely changed the way I write songs. I think that night and landing this tour felt really validating.”\n\nThaahum catches ear of 'Luke Cage' show developer\n\nPhoenix rapper Thaahum is so hyped for the Friday, Sept. 30, series premiere of “Marvel’s Luke Cage” on Netflix, he collaborated with another local artist, DJ Big Serg, on a video to celebrate the series. And the show’s developer, Cheo Hodari Coker, has tweeted about it twice since the track premiered Sept. 15 on YouTube, thanking Thaahum for the shout-out.\n\n“As an artist,” Thaahum says, “I feel some of the best music comes out of doing songs about things we like and are fans of ourselves. Being a Marvel fan and hearing that they were releasing a series that has hip-hop elements in it was just the thing to spark my creativity.”\n\nHe reached out to DJ Big Serg because he's also a comic book fan.\n\n\"Then once we realized we had a dope track,\" Thaahum says, \"we figured the next step would be to make a video out of it, and further hype the September 30th release of Luke Cage. Over the years I've done things like this in the past with great success. Rosario Dawson did a comic book called 'The Occult Crimes Taskforce' that I did a mixtape based on. It actually ended up in her hands & she really liked it. And years before that I did a couple songs about Kevin Smith movies that he liked as well.\"\n\nOn the track, Thaahum sets the tone by rapping, \"We'll be glorious the day we see / the Notorious C.A.G.E. / One-fourth of the Defenders' amazing team / No pretenders when it comes to get they streets clean.\" And before the track is through, there's a shout-out to Jessica Jones, whose Netflix series also features Cage.\n\nEuromerica comp raises funds for Parkinson's research\n\nMelanie Rogoff, an Arizona State University student who hosts a show called Euromerica on ASU's KASC 1330 AM Blaze Radio, has assembled a second compilation CD benefiting Parkinson's disease research.\n\nReleased in mid-December, “Euromerica and Friends: Volume 1” raised more than $1,000 for the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Disease Research.\n\n“Which is huge,” Rogoff says, “because that was the first time that I ever organized a charity CD. In addition, thousands of people from around the world gained an awareness of Parkinson’s Disease and the CD also exposed them to the amazing talent on the CD.”\n\nThe business management major started reaching out to artists about “Volume 2” in May, revisiting the first collection’s blend of local acts and artists from around the globe. This time, there are seven local acts, including IAMWE, Luxxe, Wanderer and 76th Street. The other artists are from California, New York, England, Switzerland, Australia and France.\n\n“To tie in with my radio show, Euromerica (a blend of pop/dance music from Europe and America), I wanted to really have more international artists in comparison to national artists,” Rogoff says. “I feel like a lot of people in America aren’t exposed to international artists unless they’re relatively mainstream, and I really want to expose people to the talent that not only lies within America, but from all over the world. I tried to aim, especially with the second volume, to have as much variety as possible.\"\n\nThe CD is available for sale at http://euromericaradio.bandcamp.com/releases through March 15.\n\nThe financial goal for this “Volume 2” is $1,200.\n\nAnother goal, she says, is “I thought to myself, ‘If I could introduce a superstar team of artists to the world, who would I have, and what would it look like?' Asking that question allowed me to figure out what artists I wanted to have, and, in turn, helped me realize my musical goal, which is exposing as many people as possible to some of the humblest, hardest-working and talented artists that I have had the pleasure of working with. I certainly would love to spread the word about my radio show as well.\"\n\nTo find out more about the compilation or Euromerica, go to Facebook.com/euromericaradio or Twitter.com/euromericaradio.\n\nWyves rock Tilted Kilt ads\n\nLocal rockers Wyves have been selected for a nationwide campaign of TV ads for Tilted Kilt Pub and Eatery. \"Jump Into The Water,\" the opening track on Wyves' new album, \"Spoils of War,\" plays under all the ads. In the longer ads, there is a point where you can see three members of the group \"performing\" along to the music (although drummer Evan Knisely is shown on keyboards).\n\nKnisely explains the unusual arrangement: \"(Bassist) Brenden (McBride) was out of town at Outside Lands, so we put (guitarist) Nick (Stirling) on bass, and they said no drums but wanted me to still be in it so we just stuck me on keys.\"\n\nWyves posted the news on Facebook, saying, \"We couldn't be happier to have our music featured for this thriving Arizona based company.\"\n\nWATCH: Tilted Kilt ad featuring Wyves' song \"Jump Into the Water\"\n\nJimmy Eat World plays 93.3 Alt AZ Zombie Prom at Fear Farm\n\nJimmy Eat World have announced a string of fall tour dates, including a stop in the Valley at Fear Farm – yes, Fear Farm -- in support of “Integrity Blues,” an album due to hit the streets Sept. 30.\n\nThe Fear Farm date of Saturday, Oct. 22, is the 93.3 Alt AZ Zombie Prom, which makes more sense than just a random date at Fear Farm. Also playing? Good Charlotte, the Struts, Lewis Del Mar, Barns Courtney, K. Flay and the Hunna.\n\nWatch: Haymarket Squares channel Woody Guthrie's spirit, talk reefer madness at azcentral studio concert\n\nThis is their ninth release and follows “Damage,” their fourth consecutive to go Top 20 on the Billboard album charts.\n\n“Integrity Blues” was produced by Justin Meldal-Johnson, Beck’s musical director.\n\nJim Adkins explained the inspiration for the album in an open letter to the fans:\n\n“It is about throwing away your default responses to life, accepting life on the terms of life and becoming willing to accept the best any of us have is to be in a state of progress.\n\nEmotional injury is usually our own making…our ego fighting to selectively ignore reality that may not reflect our expectations. When we allow a moment of honesty and look at the gap between our expectations and reality, all too often we find a place to identify as a victim. We take the disappointment gap personally. There is some kind of sick rewards in the imagined moral high ground. Self-righteousness leads to rationalizing tantrum behaviour (which is never a good look!) adding back into the feedback loop reinforcing a lack of self worth.\n\n“Your enemy is you. And unfortunately you know every button to push, every hidden fear and every secret regret. You speak to yourself in your own voice. And you have a very convincing pitch to work against your betterment in the hopes of those finish-line type expectations, maybe… finally… bringing you a sene of peace this time.\n\n“You break that reverse feedback loop of reinforcing negative self-worth through action.\n\nDoing your best to accept and live as a person doesn’t mean you’re always going to be happy. Staying one the best path you can may feel like lonely work sometimes. But then, happiness is one of those fleeting finish lines. Integrity matters because if you let the answer of ‘Who do I need to be?’ inform your question ‘What should I do?’, there just isn’t room for that negative cycle to get traction.”\n\nRoger Clyne & the Peacemakers tour \"Fizzy Fuzzy Big & Buzzy\"\n\nRoger Clyne & The Peacemakers are taking “Fizzy Fuzzy Big & Buzzy” by his old band, the Refreshments, on the road for a 20th anniversary tour that starts tonight in Austin, Tex.\n\nUniversal Records re-released the album earlier this year on vinyl and a tribute record is forthcoming with singles from Miles Nielsen (“Blue Collar Suicide”) and the Yawpers (“European Swallow”).\n\n22 local Phoenix music picks for September 2016\n\nThe Refreshments major label debut, “Fizzy Fuzzy Big & Buzzy” put the local rockers on the map out of Tempe’s thriving music scene in 1996. It peaked at #97 on the Billboard Top 200, and spun off the modern-rock radio classic “Banditos.”\n\nAll Clyne had in mind going into the making of the album was to “put those songs together so that it could be a classic,” as he told us earlier this year, going on to admit with a laugh, “We were aiming pretty high. But I think every new band should. And in a few people’s minds, we hit the mark.”\n\nClyne and the Peacemakers honored the 20th anniversary of the album earlier this year by playing the entire album, start to finish, in a run of 10 dates at their former stomping grounds, the Yucca Tap Room.\n\nAs I wrote in reviewing the seventh of those Yucca shows: “The Peacemakers approached those 20-year-old songs with an enthusiasm that managed to hit on all the right nostalgic notes while sounding as alive and in the here and now as if they’d written them a week or two before the show.\n\n“Of course, a number of those songs have gone on to be staples of the set. But hearing them played in the order in which they appeared on that Refreshments album on a stage where many of those songs were more than likely shaped by live performance was its own unique experience — which may be why all 10 shows sold out in a hurry.”\n\nThe Peacemakers are also in the midst of recording their eighth studio album for release early next year.\n\nThe tour dates are as follows.\n\nSeptember 8: Austin, TX @ Antone’s\n\nSeptember 9: Dallas, TX @ Gas Monkey Bar & Grill\n\nSeptember 10: Houston TX @ Firehouse Saloon\n\nSeptember 11: New Orleans, LA @ Parish Room\n\nSeptember 13: St. Louis, MO @ Blueberry Hill\n\nSeptember 14: Des Moines, IA @ Wooly’s\n\nSeptember 15: Sioux Falls, SD @ Icon Lounge\n\nSeptember 16: Minneapolis, MN @ Cabooze\n\nSeptember 18: Chicago, IL @ Lincoln Hall\n\nSeptember 20: Ferndale, MI @ The Magic Bag\n\nSeptember 21: Cleveland, OH @ The Grog Shop\n\nSeptember 22: Milwaukee, WI @ Shank Hall\n\nSeptember 23: Omaha, NE @ The Waiting Room\n\nSeptember 25: Fort Collins, CO @ Downtown Artery\n\nOctober 1: Chandler, TX @ SanTan Brewing Oktoberfest\n\nOctober 8: Albuquerque, NM @ Launchpad\n\nOctober 10: Kansas City, MO @ Knuckleheads\n\nOctober 11: Bloomington, IL @ The Castle Theatre\n\nOctober 12: Nashville, TN @ The High Watt\n\nOctober 13: Atlanta, GA @ Smith’s Olde Bar\n\nOctober 15: Falls Church, VA @ State Theatre\n\nOctober 16: Philadelphia, PA @ World Café Live\n\nOctober 17: New York, NY @ The Highline Ballroom\n\nOctober 19: Providence, RI @ Fete\n\nOctober 20: Teaneck, NJ @ Mexicali Live\n\nOctober 21: Hartford, CT @ Infinity Hall\n\nOctober 22: Cambridge, MA @ Middle East Downstairs\n\nOctober 23: Pawling, NY @ Daryl’s House\n\nNovember 12: Portland, OR @ Hawthorne Theater\n\nNovember 18: San Diego, CA @ Belly Up Tavern\n\nNovember 26: Flagstaff, AZ @ Orpheum Theatre\n\nBeef Vegan leaves Phoenix for Tucson\n\nThese are bittersweet days for fans of local music.\n\nBeef Vegan, who took over hosting the TMI Radio Show on KWSS-FM (93.9) in 2009 from a studio set up in what should have been his living room, is moving to Tucson after seven years as the best friend a local musician could hope to have in radio.\n\nBut it’s good news for Vegan, whose real name is Brad Pfirmann (yeah, I know, I always wanted to believe it was his real name, too).\n\nHe’s taken a job at one of Tucson’s three-biggest corporate radio stations, where he’ll co-host and produce a morning show.\n\nThat’s all the information he can give us at the moment. TMI? Not this time.\n\nAs Vegas explains the vow of silence, “They want to do this big unveiling with a press release, which sucks. All I can say is I’m going down to one of the top three stations in Tucson. That’s why I’ve been Vaguebooking. I don’t feel good about it. I’m like, “Oh, I’m THAT chick.” But I did it for a reason. They’re gonna do this whole advertising campaign. I think they’re gonna do a ‘Where’s the Beef?’ teaser campaign they’ve been joking about. They’re making kind of a big deal about it, which is cool, especially since I’m coming down there as the No. 2 guy.”\n\nHis last day on the air in Phoenix is Friday, Aug. 26. He’ll be broadcasting live from 6-11 a.m. from Stinger’s Sports Bar & Grill at 43rd and Peoria avenues in Glendale.\n\n“We’re doing one last Tequila Sunrise,” Vegan says. “It’s a great opportunity for all the listeners to come out to meet each other and say hi and goodbye to the show. We’re gonna have a bunch of performances from musicians and comedians. And jam sessions and games. It’s really a rare thing to be able to kind of get closure on something like this. Usually, people in radio, they get fired and you just don’t hear from them. A week later, you’re like, “Hey, whatever happened to so-and-so?” We get to do a victory lap and read listener feedback and play some of our favorite songs from the last seven-and-a-half years.”\n\nHe even has a final song picked out, which will, of course, be local.\n\nWhen I spoke to Kongos earlier this year, they talked about Vegan's support and what it meant to them.\n\n“Beef Vegan started playing us in 2011,\" Jesse Kongos told me. \"And obviously it’s a small station with not a lot of power, but it had a core listenership and we were like, ‘All right, there’s this guy Beef Vegan. Let’s send him our songs.’ Then, he tweeted that he was gonna spin it. So we listened and he was, like, raving about it.”\n\nWith Vegan’s support, their shows in Phoenix started getting bigger, and as Jesse says, “We were like, ‘Oh, so people hear our music and then they come to the show? That’s a good sign.’ ”\n\nNot that local is the DJ's only legacy on local radio.\n\n“A lot of people focus on the local-music aspect in the quote-unquote scene,” Vegan says. “But I think it was larger than that. I’ve gotten a lot of messages from people who say that it made them want to listen to radio again. And it wasn’t just local music. There was a lot of unsigned national and global music, a lot of under-the-war, not-corporate-playlist music that we got people passionate about. It was great to be able to be a tastemaker and live up to the person that I was compared to since I was 13. As soon as I hit puberty, old people all the time were like, ‘You sound like Wolfman Jack. You sound like Wolfman Jack.’ I didn’t even know who Wolfman Jack was. I was 13 years old growing up in the gangsta-rap era but I was already passionate about radio.”\n\nHe has mixed emotions.\n\n“I’m happy and proud,” he says, “that I accomplished an impossible goal through being insane enough to overwork myself and never give up and I’m sad that I created something very special with little to no help that I take immense pride in and now I’m leaving that behind. But I felt like it was definitely the time to kind of move forward in my career and do what’s right for me and my daughter. And that was to get paid and get health benefits and a 401K and become an adult, I guess.”\n\nAs for that last Tequila Sunrise, in addition to surprise performance, he's promising a lot of crying.\n\n\"You'll hear grown men cry on the radio,\" he says. \"You'll hear grown women cry, too. There will be a lot of f--king crying. Crying and tequila. Those shots of tequila will be coming through their tears.\"\n\nThe Haymarket Squares have 'Carpool Karaoke' moment with a U2 cover\n\nThe Haymarket Squares have gone \"minor-league viral,\" as singer Marc Oxborrow puts it, with a video recorded in a moving van that shows them performing a bluegrass rendition of U2's \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,\" Oxborrow singing lead vocals while driving as his bandmates accompany him on harmonies, accordion, harmonica and mandolin.\n\nThe video was shot somewhere in southern Colorado as they traveled from New Mexico to Colorado Springs on a nine-date tour that wraps this weekend with three gigs in one day – a festival date, a radio appearance and a bar show.\n\nPhoenix music news: Haymarket Squares have their own 'Carpool Karaoke' moment\n\nThey posted the video Sunday, July 31, to their Facebook page. In less than a week, it's been viewed more than 44,000 times while earning more than 600 Facebook reactions and 542 shares.\n\nAs Oxborrow explains the inspiration for the video, \"We like to make videos on tour, and often spend our time in the van working on harmonies and arrangements. So we figured it was time to combine the two and tackle a whole song. And we've finally got a van quiet enough not to drown out our voices in road noise.\"\n\nIt's a great arrangement of a great song, but watching them do it is half the charm, especially Oxborrow's facial expressions as he sings and drives. He's a videogenic guy, which is part of the reason they ended up topping our list of the best local videos of the first half of 2016 with \"Let's Start a Riot.\"\n\nWhy a U2 cover?\n\n\"There was an element of randomness,\" Oxborrow says, \"in keeping with the off-the-cuff feeling of filming in a moving vehicle. We wanted a song we hadn't performed before, something that we could learn quickly and would show off our harmonies.\"\n\nThen, he jokingly adds, \"And some of us may have been U2 fans in the distant past.\"\n\nMORE MUSIC: Get the Things to Do app | Latest concert announcements | Top concerts this week\n\nGlendale renames itself Paradise City for Guns N' Roses concert\n\nIt's our understanding that the grass will be green and the girls will be pretty on Monday, Aug. 15, when the city of Glendale will symbolically change its name for a day to Paradise City in honor of the Guns N' Roses concert playing University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nThe \"Not in This Lifetime Tour\" marks the first time Guns N’ Roses founder Axl Rose has shared a stage with Slash since 1993. The other founding member taking part in this year's biggest rock tour, Duff McKagan, has played dates with Rose as recently as 2014. Rolling Stone described the tour as a “triumphant return of one of the most important bands to cross rock music history.”\n\nLeaving their formal meeting attire behind and wearing Guns N’ Roses T-shirts, Glendale’s City Council members unveiled plans Wednesday, July 20, to celebrate the tour stop with a temporary name change. Mayor Jerry Weiers issued a proclamation calling for Glendale to be named Paradise City on Aug. 15, and a large sign welcoming fans to Paradise City was unveiled. Over the weeks leading up to the concert, fans will see other ways the city is setting the stage for a rock and roll paradise, including billboards welcoming Guns N’ Roses to Glendale.\n\n“Having lived in the West Valley my entire life and seeing the transformation of former farmland into the place where Super Bowls and championships are played and where top performers book their shows is exhilarating,” said Glendale Councilmember Samuel Chavira, who represents the Yucca District, which includes the stadium and adjacent Westgate Entertainment District. “It certainly does not get bigger than having one of the world’s best-selling bands of all time perform here and we are ready to welcome these rockstars to Paradise City.”\n\nGuns N’ Roses’ place in the rock-and-roll history books was secure from the day they crawled out of the gutter with their first full-length release.\n\n\"Appetite for Destruction\" felt as much like a rejection of the status quo in 1987 as the Sex Pistols' \"Never Mind the Bollocks\" had a decade earlier. But Guns N' Roses took their revolution to the masses in a way the Pistols never managed, topping the charts with the reckless abandon of a first release that sent three singles to the upper reaches of the Hot 100, including the chart-topping \"Sweet Child O' Mine\" — a power ballad with actual power.\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since they followed the spontaneous combustion of their masterpiece with the ambitious twin release of the \"Use Your Illusion\" albums.\n\nThey started losing members during the sessions for \"Use Your Illusion\" with the 1990 firing of drummer Steven Adler. Izzy Stradlin, the rhythm guitarist who'd written or co-written nine of the 12 songs on \"Appetite,\" quit in 1991, followed in 1996 by Slash, with McKagan staying on until his 1997 resignation.\n\nBogan Via reissue EP, announce headlining tour dates\n\nPhoenix synth-pop duo Bogan Via, who released a great new track called \"Throw It on the Fire\" earlier this year, are now releasing a deluxe reissue of their \"Wait Up\" EP with brand new remixes. Available for presale now at hellomerch.com, the reissue is a limited-edition 12-inch vinyl run of just 250 copies on transparent red with blue haze virgin vinyl.\n\nAll purchases include free digital download of the EP and an unreleased extended Director's Cut of Freddie Paull's inspired music videos for \"Kanye\" and \"Gatsby.\"\n\nIn other Bogan Via news, they've just announced their first headlining tour, which launches in Seattle on Sept. 28.

Located less than a half-mile from the US 60 freeway in the Mesa South Shopping Center, the store features the usual Zia assortment of pop-culture necessities – music on vinyl and compact disc, movies, games, books, toys, comics, musical instruments, electronics and a wide selection of T-shirts, posters and more.\n\nIt's the farthest east the local chain, which opened its first store in 1980, has gone in the Valley, a distinction previously held by Zia's Chandler superstore.\n\n\"So we're pretty excited to get to Mesa,\" says vice president and general manager Brian Faber. \"And it's so close to the US 60 that I feel like it's going to be really accessible for people even farther east.\"\n\nWhy Mesa?\n\n\"We've been such a strong East Valley chain for much our existence, from our Tempe store being a flagship location for so long and adding Chandler to the family,\" Faber says. \"So Mesa just made sense. We really looked Valley-wide and this particular opportunity presented itself and it was the right fit for us. Right place, right time, great landlord and it's been great to work with the city of Mesa.\"\n\nThe goal, Faber says, is \"to bring the total Zia experience\" to Mesa, from in-store appearances to offering cash and store credit for used items.\n\nAdding to Faber's excitement, he says, is the fact that it's their first all-new location in the Valley in a long time for the chain, which also has stores in Las Vegas and Tucson.\n\n\"The other local stores have all moved and expanded in the past 10 years,\" he says. \"But in terms of opening a purely new store in the Valley, it's the first one in 10 years. So we're pretty excited. This is a brand new store in a brand new city for us. We're proud to be a part of the city of Mesa's business family. There's already some good record stores and some good entertainment stores in Mesa and we're happy to join that group.\"\n\nZia Records Mesa will fill the rest of 2016 with special events — in-store signings, live music and a Black Friday bash, featuring limited edition vinyl, CDs, and a store-wide sale.

Gilbert Rd, Mesa, AZ, 85204.\n\nJimmy Eat World on Rolling Stone best pop-punk album list\n\nJimmy Eat World have made another all-time best-of list in Rolling Stone. And this time, they're pop-punk, not emo, joining Green Day, Blink-182, Generation X and the Ramones on a list of the 10 Best Pop-Punk Albums of All Time.\n\nThe Ramones?!!\n\nWell, that's just silly, right? They are definitively punk, no qualifiers needed.\n\nBest punk debut albums of the '70s: Ramones and Sex Pistols to Patti Smith and Wire\n\nIt's a reader's poll, but Rolling Stone does appear to condone the confusion when it writes, \"If the Ramones set the groundwork for what pop-punk would become, Green Day made it a radio reality.\"\n\nAs for Jimmy Eat World, I wouldn't call them pop-punk, either, but they made the list with \"Bleed American.\"\n\nRolling Stone writes that \"Jimmy Eat World may have arguably been the point where pop-punk and emo merged, making the two genres closely related in the new millennium. Heavy riffs became intertwined with emotional depth as the band were direct about their feelings and offered tender comfort on tracks like 'Sweetness' and 'The Middle.' While early pop-punk had a bit more snarl, Jimmy Eat World were the pop-punk band you could bring home to mom.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Valley rockers placed two local classics in the upper reaches of Rolling Stone's countdown of the 40 Greatest Emo Albums of All Time.\n\nReleased in 1999, \"Clarity\" placed 13th on the list, one spot ahead of Weezer's \"Pinkerton.\" \"Bleed American\" placed 9th, edging out Fall Out Boy's \"From Under the Cork Tree.\"\n\nAt the time, Jim Adkins told us, \"I don't consider them 'emo' at all. It's amazing to know those albums still are important to people. Flattering. But, it would be my personal take that while some of the records were coming from a generally similar scene, what 'emo' means could be debatable. Maybe that's just it. It's sort of the blanket term for bands who happened to be touring and recording around a certain time. With a similar outlook on how to operate.\"\n\nWe didn't ask him how it felt to make a pop-punk list because we're pretty sure we know the answer and the man has more important things to do than tell us why that album isn't pop-punk.\n\nCait Brennan inks a demo deal with Seymour Stein\n\nThe legendary Seymour Stein, now President of Sire Records and Vice President of Warner Bros. Records, has offered Cait Brennan a deal to cut a demo for the labels with producer Andy Paley.\n\nStein is known for having signed such pioneering Hall of Famers as Madonna, the Pretenders, Talking Heads and the Ramones. Paley has produced recordings by the likes of the Ramones, Madonna, Brian Wilson, Debbie Harry and Jonathan Richman.\n\nBrennan is a Phoenix-based artist who after a Kickstarter campaign that managed to raise more than $7500 was able to release her debut album, “Debutante,” early this year. She’s 47.\n\n“It’s almost impossible to process,” Brennan says. “Seymour Stein discovered and signed Madonna, the Ramones, Talking Heads, brought us the Smiths, Depeche Mode, Echo and the Bunnymen, the Undertones, k. d. lang, Ice T, Against Me! The list is endless. Of course I was hoping he might be interested in my stuff but the music fan in me just wanted to ask him a trillion questions. Nothing is in any way final or certain; he may hear my demos and pass, but that there was even enough interest to get this far. To even get to meet with him let alone be asked to make music for him, is the absolute highest of compliments.”\n\nStein heard “Debutante” and loved it, which led to a meeting when Brennan flew to New York City for some shows.\n\nAZCentral also loved the album, weighing in with, \"This pop classicist has packed her first album with songs that marry timeless hooks to introspective lyrics. Setting the tone with the wistful, McCartney-esque intro of “Good Morning and Goodnight,” the singer delivers an album that should speak to several generations of power-pop enthusiasts, whether they cut their teeth on Big Star and the Raspberries or Teenage Fanclub in the ‘90s.\"\n\nStein also told Brennan — repeatedly — that she had \"one of the greatest and most unique voices he’d ever heard,” she says. “I have been pretty much impossible to live with ever since. Maybe he says that to all the girls, I don’t know, but considering the legendary artists he’s worked with over the years, it was one hell of a compliment.”\n\nNow, she’s heading to Los Angeles to track four to six songs with Paley on the label’s dime.\n\n“If Sire likes the demo,” Brennan says, “then we'll begin negotiation about a full record deal; if they don't, they can either ask me to do other demos or we can shake hands and walk away. So there's no obligation for them to sign me (or for me to sign) but it's definitely something that has the potential to lead to a full deal. It's a modestly-budgeted demo session, I'm not getting paid, but it's an opportunity. With Andy at the helm, we will likely record at Reseda Ranch Studios, where I recorded both ‘Debutante’ and my upcoming second album, Introducing ‘The Breakdown According To Cait Brennan,’ with contributions from my co-producer and musical collaborator Fernando Perdomo (who currently plays in Jakob Dylan's band).”\n\nAnd regardless of what happens, the deal allows her to record with Paley.\n\n“It’s ridiculously great to get to work with him,” she says. “He’s a musical savant and has an amazingly warped sense of humor. He really gets my songs. But he’s obsessed with the lyrics. There’s a woman-scorned revenge theme in a few of my songs, and Andy’s constantly asking me ‘Is that true? did that actually happen? did you really do that to the guy?’ A lot of the time the answer is a qualified ‘Kind of, yes’ but once in a while I have to say ‘Yes, Andy, I locked a guy in an Airstream and set it on fire with kerosene when he cheated on me, then I fled the jurisdiction and flew to Amsterdam with my lover.’ And he takes two hesitant steps back and goes ‘I can never tell when you’re kidding.’ I think I should keep it that way.”\n\nShe’s hoping to release “Introducing The Breakdown According to Cait Brennan” in mid-October.\n\n“If Sire decides they want me for keeps, that may change,” Brennan says. “But for now, we’re proceeding as if nothing has changed and I’m still the same plucky, unsinkable indie-gal with a heart of gold as always. The Susan Boyle of indie glam and soul, really. Even if nothing else comes of it, it’s just quite an honor. To go from 800 bucks in loose change to Seymour Stein’s office. Not a bad life for a kid who grew up in the desert in a trailer park out by Turf Paradise.”\n\nGin Blossoms are cutting their new album with the R.E.M. production team of Don Dixon and Mitch Easter\n\nTaylor Upsahl, Wolvves in Best May singles playlist\n\nTwo local artists made our best our best May singles playlist, joining the likes of Rihanna and Radiohead. You can hear the songs and read what won us over here.\n\nRPM Orchestra films video at Trolley Museum\n\nHow did RPM Orchestra come to shoot their music video for \"Song of Sheba\" inside a street car at the Phoenix Trolley Museum?\n\nAs Pete Petrisko, who supplies the shortwave radio effects on the recording and directs the video explains, \"We knew we wanted a location that fit the era of the slang heard in the lyrics. At the same time, news broke that the Phoenix Trolley Museum would have to find a new location. That's when we decided to make the restored trolley itself the star of our video. It's a creative way to raise public awareness about the museum, and its pending relocation, by showing this downtown treasure to a wider audience.\"\n\nThat required them pitching the video concept and story outline to the board at the museum for approval, but after that, the museum stayed out of their way. \"They were very supportive,\" Petrisko says, \"of us following our own creative vision.\"\n\nThe video opens with a haunting toy-piano melody complemented by archival footage of a trolley shot by Phoenix businessman Bob Miller in 1948. The scene is an excerpt from the \"Our Last Trip\" DVD that's shown to museum visitors.\n\nIt’s when Jocelyn Ruiz starts singing that the action shifts to the Petrisko shot inside the street car housed at the museum. The passengers go about their business as a woman in white (long-time collaborator, choreographer/dancer Debra Minghi, with whom they’ve done live multi-disciplinary performances in the past) makes her way down the aisle.\n\nTheir first collaboration was “BUTOH+MUSIC,” performed at Bragg's Pie Factory during Art Detour 24. The second, “Animalogue,” was funded by the National Endowment for the Arts' Our Town grant program, as part of Roosevelt Row CDC's A.R.T.S. project series in 2013. They’re also collaborating on “Displaced - An Immersive Theater Experience,” set to premiere Oct. 1 at Unexpected Gallery.\n\nBut getting back to “Song of Sheba,” Minghi had free rein, Petrisko says, to choreograph her movements as “a metaphorical retort to the idea that a woman's assumed role is that of pretty bride or perfect angel, set in an era that included passage of the 19th amendment, a sexual revolution embodied by the flappers of the Roaring '20s, and women entering the workforce in increased numbers during WWII.”\n\nPetrisko directed a couple of one-off music videos for local bands a few years ago, he says. “But this more cinematic approach is new territory. I'm working out a visual storytelling style here, with an eye toward creating original film shorts (scored by RPM Orchestra) in the future.”\n\nin addition to Ruiz (on vocals, keyboard, toy piano) and Petrisko, \"Song of Sheba\" features Jim Dustan on bass, Erik Hunter on drums and percussion and Vic Void on laputaphone.\n\nFormer KTAR producer in Justin Timberlake video\n\nIf you've seen the video released this week for Justin Timberlake's new summer smash \"Can't Stop the Feeling,\" then you probably recall a very animated dancer in a Member's Only jacket busting loopy moves outside a car wash.\n\nThat's David Moskowitz, who moved to LA after 13 years in news/talk radio here in metro Phoenix, including lengthy stints at KFYI and KTAR, where he produced the Marconi Award-winning \"Preston Westmoreland.\"\n\nNews/talk radio may not seem like a stepping stone to a role in a Timberlake video. In fact, when Moskowitz first read the email blast from a casting director saying, \"If you like to dance,\" his initial reaction was: \"Dancing’s not really my thing, but what the hell? I’ll give it a shot.”\n\nHe didn't know he was auditioning for Timberlake. The email that led the aspiring actor to overcome his suspicion for casting auditions held at a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf only referred to a \"MAJOR recording artist.\"\n\nMoskowitz was thinking it could be Beyonce. Or Ariana Grande. Maybe even J.Lo. Either way, it seemed worth driving to a coffee shop.\n\nAs he recalls: \"The guy with the iPad who was shooting me for about three minutes put a Bluetooth speaker on the ground, and he plays Michael Jackson’s 'Don’t Stop Til You Get Enough.' So, I start doing my MJ moves. I start moonwalking. Granted, it wasn’t smooth like Michael Jackson. I’m a White, Jewish balding guy moonwalking. I did backwards and forwards, did spins, did my mime, acted like I was smoking a joint. I don’t smoke pot for reals. I did all kinds of crazy stuff. Then somebody popped out of a store next to the coffee shop and started applauding when I was done.\"\n\nDespite the applause, he was worried that maybe he'd blown the audition after complaining of a lack of signs directing him to the audition when he showed up to the coffee shop, where none of the employees knew a thing about it.\n\n\"I told the guy, 'Hey Mike, I was just sort of venting to you because I’m sitting here for 15 minutes. I didn’t know who to ask. There’s no sign. I hope you don’t hold this against me.' I thought I'd totally blown it. Then I get a call 9 in the morning from the guy who I thought hated me. He said, 'You were the director’s first pick. Are you available these dates?' I was blown away.\"\n\nAnd it wasn't just any director, either. Mark Romanek has won 20 MTV Video Music Awards and three Grammys.\n\nAs for Timberlake? Mokowitz says, \"He was so down-to-earth, personable, warm and friendly. I just think the world of his talent. I had the utmost respect for the guy even before I did this video. So it was a pleasant surprise finding out who it was for.\"\n\nMatty Steinkamp's 'Play' makes timely plea for music education\n\nOriginal Alice Cooper lineup writes new music\n\nWill Alice Cooper's next album include a reunion of the four surviving members of the lineup that produced such early Cooper classics as \"Killer\" and \"Love it to Death?\"\n\nThat's the word on the street. And the person who put the word out there is no lesser an authority on all things Alice Cooper than Cooper himself.\n\nIn an interview with the Weekender, Cooper said, “I wrote three or four songs with (drummer) Neal Smith and (guitarist) Mike Bruce. And so we worked together in Phoenix for about two weeks just writing songs and demoing songs. And you never know which ones are going to make the album, but I said let’s do that.\n\nCooper added “(Bassist) Dennis Dunaway wrote two or three things. We haven’t seen those yet, but I know Dennis has always written great stuff. It’s fun to go back and work with guys you haven’t worked with in awhile. It’s not trying to recapture your youth. It’s trying to recapture a sound. And it’s a very elusive sound.”\n\nThis should come as fairly awe-inspiring news to Cooper fans.\n\nWhen Dunaway and Cooper met, the singer hadn't yet adopted the ghoulish persona that made him a star. He was still Vince Furnier, class clown and student athlete at Cortez High School on the northern edge of Phoenix. They bonded in Mrs. Sloan's art class over their interest in Salvador Dali and Rene Magritte and shared their first onstage experience at a Cortez talent show, spoofing the Beatles for their classmates with another future member of the Alice Cooper band, Glen Buxton, who died in 1997.\n\nAt first, they were known as the Earwigs. Changing their name to the Spiders, they recruited Bruce, a North High football player, and scored a big regional hit with a single called “Don't Blow Your Mind.” After changing their name yet again, to the Nazz, they relocated to Los Angeles in 1967, where Smith, a Camelback High grad who'd been in art classes with Dunaway, Cooper and Buxton at Glendale Community College, joined on drums.\n\nThe rest, of course, is history, from massive hits to major tours. In 1973, their U.S. tour in support of the chart-topping “Billion Dollar Babies” broke box-office records then held by the Rolling Stones. In 2011, they took their rightful place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nKONGOS most-added at U.S. alternative radio\n\nThat new Kongos song, \"Take It From Me,\" is the most-added track of the past two weeks at alternative radio across the country, currently climbing the U.S. alternative radio charts at No. 19. Meanwhile, the video, which features the brothers in \"Big Head Mode\" from the video game \"NBA Jam,\" has racked up more than 165,000 views on YouTube/Vevo in less than a week.\n\nIn other big news, Fox Sports handpicked Kongos as its artist of the month for May. As part of this initiative, four songs from \"Egomaniac\"—“Take It From Me,” “I Don’t Mind,” “I Want It Free,” and “Look At Me” — will be played during broadcast sports events all month-long.\n\nThe Paradise Valley brothers hit the mainstream hard in 2014 when a three-year-old song from \"Lunatic,\" \"Come With Me Now,\" became the double-platinum breakthrough most bands only dream of. The song enjoyed a five-week run at No. 1 on the Billboard alternative-songs chart while earning the Kongos brothers — Johnny, Jesse, Dylan and Danny — a deal with Epic Records, home of Michael Jackson and the Clash.\n\nCould \"Take It From Me\" be the song that builds on that momentum?\n\nWritten by Jesse, the song tops a pulsating dance beat with an accordion riff that's sure to speak to anyone who came on board with that big single, a chant-along chorus, a pitch-shifted vocal hook, hiccups in all the right places and a brilliant slide-guitar lead. \"Take It From Me\" has been part of the live set for a while now. There’s a video on YouTube of them playing an early version of the song at Summerfest in 2014, but the single sounds more like a pop hit. They’ve refined what worked and added elements that lend a more contemporary vibe to the proceedings.\n\nWhen I spoke to Dylan in December, he talked about the long road to recording “Egomaniac.”\n\n\"It’s been a long time that this album has been not necessarily in the works,” he said, “but we’ve been waiting to get around to it because it kind of took a couple years for it get rolling for us, and then we were already kind of moving on to this album. We had some of the material written, we were starting to work on it, and then when “Lunatic” took off, we put it on the back burner because we had to give “Lunatic” a real shot with touring and supporting the album. So we were really excited to finish touring this year and get started on this album. There are some huge songs. Without getting into the details, there’s a common theme to the whole album, and sonically it’s just a really big sound. There’s a lot of layering and really big drums. We were really going for an in-your-face kind of sound.”\n\nThe album hits the streets on June 10.\n\n16 Phoenix artists with new music in the works, from Roger Clyne to AJJ, Kongos, Diners and Love Me Nots\n\nThe Maine take on a Justin Bieber song for 'Covers (Side B)'\n\nLocal rockers the Maine have recorded a cover of the recent Justin Bieber single, \"Love Yourself\" as the first taste of a sequel to December's \"Covers (Side A),\" aptly titled \"Covers (Side B).\"\n\nThe \"(Side A)\" EP featured 90’s pop tunes reinvented by the Maine with guest appearances by Technicolors' Brennan Smiley and Mayday Parade’s Derek Sanders.\n\nDrummer Pat Kirch says, “It is always a great learning process to see how other songwriters put songs together. We always have a good time recording cover songs because of the lack of pressure. We like to use cover songs to take some chances with sounds that we normally don't try.”\n\n“Love Yourself” will premiere on the Maine's website at 5 .m. Thursday.\n\nWhy \"Love Yourself?\"\n\nJohn O’Callaghan explains.\n\n\"To Beliebe or not to Beliebe is not the question here because no one can deny the quality of Sir Justin's tune. We haven't fully converted to the church of Bieber just yet, but we decided to try our hand at covering this religious hymn.”\n\nIt's not a jokey cover, either. In fact, it's kind of weird that Bieber's single spent two weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100, but the Maine's recording feels more like a pop hit — a richly textured, atmospheric Wall of Sound with O'Callaghan bleeding emotion all over the vocal.\n\nThe track listing for \"Covers (Side B)\" has not yet been announced in full but Kirch says, \"We have not covered any current songs in a long time so we wanted to branch out and try something current.”\n\nThe \"Covers (Side B)\" EP is out.\n\nTaylor Swift singing and dancing to Jimmy Eat World\n\n\"OK, activities,\" she says. \"Getting ready to go out.\"The minute-long video starts with her looking for something to play on her iPhone, walking us through the process with narration. Taylor Swift has released an Apple Music ad that features her dancing and singing along to \"The Middle\" by local rockers Jimmy Eat World.\n\nWith that, she pulls up a menu titled \"Getting ready to go out\" and says, \"Oh my God, I love this song. I used to listen to this in middle school all the time.\"\n\nThen, the music starts and Taylor lip-syncs every line, dancing around her bathroom in a joyous display of total fan-girl abandon while using her lipstick as a microphone.\n\nDoll Skin drop full-length album\n\nDoll Skin -- singer Sydney Dolezal, guitarist Alex Snowden, bassist Nicole Rich and drummer Meghan Herring — have released a full-length version of their \"In Your Face\" EP, produced by David Ellefson of Megadeth. The bassist signed the teen sensations last year to his label, EMP, which is distributed by Megaforce, responsible for launching the careers of Anthrax and Metallica.\n\nRetitled \"In Your Face (Again),\" the new edition features nine tracks, including “Furious Fixation”, mixed by Richard Easterling (American Head Charge, Fuel), and a “Punk’D” demo version of their first single “Family of Strangers.”\n\n\"It's a rocking kick in the face that you don't want to miss,\" says Richie. \"We've got some fun new surprises on it and it'll leave you wanting more.\"\n\nThe video for current single “Let’s Be Honest” premiered exclusively via Revolver magazine earlier this month.\n\nThe girls are on tour now with Otep.\n\nMORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest\n\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.Twitter.com/EdMasley.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/15"}]}
