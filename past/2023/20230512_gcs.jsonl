Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis Pramod Acharya Sugam Pokharel", "Aimee Lewis", "Pramod Acharya", "Sugam Pokharel"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2022/06/22/westminster-dog-show-2022-how-stream-best-show-dogs-watch/7691258001/", "title": "Westminster Dog Show 2022: How to stream Best in Show, dogs to ...", "text": "They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks.

Wasabi the Pekingese won last year's honors.\n\nHere's what you need to know about this year's event:\n\nBEST PHOTOS: Flawless pups of all shapes and sizes at the 146th Westminster Dog Show\n\nHow can I watch the 2022 Westminster dog show?\n\nWednesday's broadcast begins at 7:30 p.m. ET on FS1, with streaming on westminsterkennelclub.org, the WKC App and the FOX Sports App.\n\nHow does dog show judging work?\n\nThere are seven different breed groups at Westminster: Herding, Hound, Non-sporting, Sporting, Terrier, Toy and Working. Breeds are evaluated based on the standard set by their parent club, meaning competing dogs aren't compared to other competitors, but to the ideal proportions, weight and size, head shape, gait and other qualities of the breed.\n\nOnce a dog wins its breed, it is judged within its group. Group winners then move on to the Best in Show category.\n\nWhat new dog breeds have been added?\n\nTwo newly American Kennel Club-recognized breeds are joining the 2022 competition: the Mudi and Russian Toy. That brings the number of eligible breeds entering Westminster to 211.\n\nThe Mudi is a \"medium-sized, versatile farm dog from Hungary\" that was bred to herd sheep and cattle, while the Russian Toy is a \"small, squarely built dog\" that is a favorite of the Russian aristocracy, according to Westminster Kennel Club. The Mudi joins the Herding Group and the Russian Toy joins the Toy Group.\n\nWhere will the 2022 Westminster dog show be held?\n\nThe 2022 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is being held at Lyndhurst, a National Trust for Historic Preservation property, in Tarrytown, New York, instead of its traditional Madison Square Garden home.\n\nLyndhurst, once owned by railroad tycoon Jay Gould, is located 25 miles north of New York City's Madison Square Garden, which Westminster typically calls home. The estate was designed in 1983 by architect Alexander Jackson Davis, and has been dubbed America's Finest Gothic Revival mansion.\n\nThe 2021 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show was also held at Lyndhurst, but the event was not open to spectators due to New York State's COVID-19 regulations.\n\n\"We love having spectators back. It was tough for everyone last year,\" said Gail Miller Bisher, director of communications for the Westminster Kennel Club, to the USA TODAY Network.\n\nContributing: Emily Leiker, Steve Gardner", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/business/southwest-airlines-service-meltdown/index.html", "title": "Flight cancellations: Why Southwest Airlines is melting down | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nA punishing winter storm that dumped multiple feet of snow across much of America led to widespread flight cancellations over the Christmas holiday. By Monday, air travel was more or less back to normal – unless you booked your holiday travel with Southwest Airlines.\n\nMore than 90% of Wednesday’s US flight cancellations were Southwest flights, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Southwest canceled more than 2,500 flights. The next highest: SkyWest, with 77.\n\nSouthwest warned that it would continue canceling flights until it could get its operations back on track. The company’s CEO said this has been the biggest disruption he’s seen in his career. The Biden administration is investigating.\n\nWhat gives? Southwest had a combination of bad luck and bad planning.\n\nThe storm hit Chicago and Denver hard, where Southwest has two of its biggest hubs – Chicago Midway airport and Denver International airport.\n\nMore bad luck: The storm hit just as the so-called tripledemic surged across America, leaving people and their families sick with Covid, the flu and RSV. Although Southwest says it was fully staffed for the holiday weekend, illness makes adjusting to increased system stress difficult. Many airlines still lack sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they’re allowed to work under federal safety regulations.\n\nUnderinvestment\n\nBut Southwest (LUV) also hurt itself with an aggressive schedule and by underinvesting in its operations.\n\nSouthwest’s schedule includes shorter flights with tighter turnaround times, which are causing some of the problems, Kathleen Bangs, a FlightAware spokesperson, told CNN.\n\n“Those turnaround times bog things down,” Bangs said.\n\nStranded customers have been unable to get through to Southwest’s customer service lines to rebook flights or find lost baggage.\n\nEmployees also said they have not been able to communicate with the airline, the president of the union that represents Southwest’s flight attendants told CNN Monday.\n\n“The phone system the company uses is just not working,” Lyn Montgomery, President of TWU Local 556, told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “They’re just not manned with enough manpower in order to give the scheduling changes to flight attendants, and that’s created a ripple effect that is creating chaos throughout the nation.”\n\nOn a call with employees Monday, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson explained that the company’s outdated scheduling software quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the storm cleared, according to a transcript of the call that was obtained by CNN from an aviation source.\n\nThe extreme cold, ice and snow grounded planes and left some crew members stranded, so Southwest’s crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight crews can work, complicating Southwest’s scheduling efforts.\n\n“The process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our technology,” Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew, but the company’s scheduling software wasn’t able to match them quickly and accurately, Watterson added.\n\n“As a result, we had to ask our crew schedulers to do this manually, and it’s extraordinarily difficult,” he said. “That is a tedious, long process.”\n\nWatterson noted that manual scheduling left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.\n\n“They would make great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would unravel their work,” Watterson said. “So, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.”\n\nIn reducing the company’s flights by two thirds, Southwest should have “more than ample crew resources to handle that amount of activity,” Watterson said.\n\nA lack of tools\n\nThe problems Southwest faces have been brewing for a long time, said Captain Casey Murray, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.\n\n“We’ve been having these issues for the past 20 months,” he told CNN. “We’ve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.”\n\nHe said the airline’s operations haven’t changed much since the 1990s.\n\n“It’s phones, it’s computers, it’s processing power, it’s the programs used to connect us to airplanes – that’s where the problem lies, and it’s systemic throughout the whole airline,” he said.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan, in a message to employees obtained by CNN, acknowledged many of Murray’s concerns, and promised the company will invest in better systems.\n\n“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Jordan told employees. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”\n\nHe said the airline is “committed to and invested in” improving its systems, but “we need to be able to produce solutions faster.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday urged consumers to check if they’re eligible for compensation as cascading airline delays have disrupted holiday travel across the country.\n\n“Our Administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable,” Biden tweeted.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation said it is investigating.\n\n“USDOT is concerned by Southwest’s unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays & reports of lack of prompt customer service,” the agency tweeted. “The Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan.”\n\nTo recover, Jordan told the Wall Street Journal the company plans to operate just over a third of its schedule in upcoming days to give itself the ability for crews to get into the right positions.\n\nNot Southwest’s first rodeo\n\nIf this is all ringing a bell, that’s because this isn’t the first time Southwest’s service melted down in epic fashion. In October 2021, Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over a four-day period, costing the airline $75 million.\n\nSouthwest blamed that service meltdown on a combination of bad weather in Florida, a brief problem with air traffic control in the area and a lack of available staff to adjust to those problems. It has admitted it was having service problems caused by short staffing even before the thousands of canceled flights stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nSimilar to this month’s service mayhem, Southwest fared far worse than its competitors last October. While Southwest canceled hundreds of flights in the days following the peak of October’s disruption, competitors quickly returned to normal service.\n\nLater that month, on a call with Wall Street analysts, then-CEO Gary Kelly said the company had made adjustments to prevent a similar meltdown in the future.\n\n“We have reined in our capacity plans to adjust to the current staffing environment, and our ontime performance has improved, accordingly,” said Kelly on October 21. “We are aggressively hiring to a goal of approximately 5,000 new employees by the end of this year, and we are currently more than halfway toward that goal.”\n\nAnd, just like the latest disruption, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association claimed the cancellations were due to “management’s poor planning.”\n\n– CNN’s Ross Levitt contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2014/10/19/fraser-crossfit-games/17535055/", "title": "Colchester man finds 2nd calling in CrossFit", "text": "Austin Danforth\n\nFree Press Staff Writer\n\nOutside, it's pushing 90 degrees on an early September afternoon in Williston. The windows and doors are wide-open in the absence of air-conditioning. That the air isn't really coming or going matters little at this point. Mathew Fraser's next three hours at Champlain Valley CrossFit aren't designed to avoid the heat.\n\nMusic blaring as a group session hits its stride in the main gym, Fraser, a chiseled 5-foot-6 and 190 pounds, retreats through a door to a smaller space. The orange-walled room has the same rubber-padded floors, the same equipment, space to operate.\n\nHe sets his cellphone down on a wooden box and opens a text message. Attached is a picture of hand-written directions for that day's training, a series of exercises to complete as quickly as possible. First up: 10 snatches of 175 pounds, taking the bar from the floor to above his head and back.\n\nHe is done in 20 seconds.\n\nThen, as he catches his breath, Fraser adds more weight. The 24-year-old from Colchester plunges his hands into a 5-gallon bucket of chalk and begins the next phase of his workout. There's always another phase of the workout when you've made a name for yourself as a rising star in the world of competitive fitness.\n\nChris Polakowski, like others who know Fraser well, isn't surprised by his former weightlifting protege's recent success, the highlight of which was a runner-up finish at the world CrossFit Games in July to earn the title \"second-fittest man in the world.\" But Polakowski laughs with pride retelling how his daughter Katie's status as a Vermonter is recognized in Massachusetts gyms with the question, \"You know Mat Fraser?\"\n\n\"To her he's just Mat but to these people Mat has become an icon,\" Polakowski said.\n\nNow there are sponsors, planes to catch, stacks of posters to autograph, prize money to collect.\n\n\"It's very strange going to a competition and (have) people asking to get a picture with me,\" Fraser said. \"I still feel like the same kid who's half-clueless with CrossFit. I still feel like it's my first day in the gym. Like, who's going to want a picture of me? That's weird.\n\n\"And there was a line.\"\n\nKeeping up with Fraser became a sport unto itself in the weeks after the CrossFit Games. \"Here\" grew to be an increasingly fluid term.\n\nOne day, it could be Washington, D.C. to compete for the New York Rhinos in the National Pro Grid League, a fledgling sport combining elements of CrossFit in a team format. The next day it could be an engineering class at the University of Vermont's Votey Hall.\n\nA week later, it could be an individual competition in Miami. Or Minneapolis. Or New York City.\n\n\"I've been on 32 airplanes in the last five weeks,\" he said earlier this month.\n\nArriving here required stints in Colorado, an operating room in California, Northern Michigan University, the oil fields of Alberta, and countless stops between. Six years of near-perpetual motion since leaving Colchester in 2008.\n\n\"The day I graduated, I took off,\" Fraser said. \"The day we had our graduation ceremony, I showed up with my car packed. Got my diploma, took a picture in my cap and gown and then got in the car with my dad and left.\"\n\nSix years of working with Polakowski had transformed Fraser from a seventh-grader \"on the scrawny side,\" his coach recalled, to an age-group national champion weightlifter bound for the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs.\n\nProjecting that type of world-class athletic ability at a young age is a hit-and-miss enterprise. But as Candace Fraser rattled off a number of her son's accomplishments before he took up weightlifting, the potential was easy to see. Then considering that she and his father, Don, formed a pairs figure skating duo for Canada at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, it grows clearer still.\n\nStanding at 6 months. On water skis at 18 months. Slalom water skiing at age 6. A self-taught, weekend aerial ski champion as a teenager.\n\n\"One day we went to the Sugarbush terrain park and there was an aerial competition on ... that was the only way he was going to be able to use the terrain park that day,\" Candace Fraser said.\n\nFraser took the lead with one backflip but another skier matched the trick. He figured he'd need a double backflip — something he'd never done before — to win. So he did it.\n\n\"He tucked it in, did the second, landed and won,\" his mother said. \"He has a good kinetic sense where his body is and his capabilities. Somebody might look at that and think he's reckless but he's not.\"\n\nWith his full attention, weightlifting never stood a chance. Polakowski's facility at Essex Middle School, and his emphasis on teaching technique above all, was the perfect proving ground.\n\n\"It was easy for me to teach him technique because all you had to do was demonstrate it once and he would understand what his body was supposed to do,\" Polakowski said. \"That athletic ability made it an easy teaching experience. Kids sometimes don't always get it. He got it real quickly.\"\n\nThe offer to join the Olympic Training Center, where Fraser could train full-time, provided the ideal next step.\n\nThe singular focus of the lifestyle made progress inevitable. The sometimes-monotonous schedule that came with it was prone to peaks and valleys.\n\n\"Wake up. Eat. Train. Cold tub, hot tub. Eat. Grab a three-hour nap then do the same thing over,\" Fraser said.\n\n\"You liked it when things were going well. When you were making progressions, when you were feeling good, you wanted to do nothing else,\" he said. \"When you're dealing with knee pain, elbow pain, back pain, it's hell. It's depressing. You have one priority for your day and you can't do it.\"\n\nHowever, the experience hit an all-time low in 2009. Fraser heard his back pop while performing a clean-pull, \"kind of like a deadlift with a shrug,\" he said. After taking a week off, he was encouraged to return to training. Then, during a squat, the right side of his L5 vertebrae gave out.\n\n\"That was a week before the junior world championships in Romania so I just put on a belt, ate some ibuprofen and competed,\" Fraser said. \"On the plane ride over, too, I caught strep throat. It wasn't a fun trip.\"\n\nConsulting with surgeons in Denver afterward, Fraser heard he would never lift again. He spent the next several months in a full-torso brace to see if the break would heal on its own. It didn't.\n\nFinally, a California-based surgeon affiliated with the Olympic program offered a potential solution. His procedure inserted two titanium plates with six screws and has held up ever since.\n\nAfter the injury, Fraser left Colorado to enroll in the Olympic Education Center at Northern Michigan. He resumed training, hopeful to make the 2016 U.S. Olympic team if Chicago won the right to host the games. When the bid failed, and his program took a financial hit, the time came to make a decision.\n\n\"I was coming back from a bad back injury, I was training with resentments, the funding got cut ... I just went, OK, every sign is pointing to time to move on,\" Fraser said.\n\nThe first incarnation of Champlain Valley CrossFit existed in Jade Jenny's garage in his senior year at Champlain College. Its next phase involved Jenny dragging equipment to a spot at Dorset Park in South Burlington for whomever was inclined to show up.\n\n\"There was nothing. If you typed in 'CrossFit' and 'Vermont' in Google, there was nothing that came up,\" said Jenny, 28. \"So I created my own blog and called it 'CrossFit in Vermont' and was blogging my training.\"\n\nWhen Jenny opened the doors for real, for a living, at a Williston Road location in September 2010, it was just the second CrossFit facility in Vermont. The membership has grown from a few dozen to roughly 300 — and it's one of five competing locations in Chittenden County.\n\n\"At the time there was maybe 2,000 affiliates (nationwide) when we opened,\" Jenny said. \"There's over 10,000 now.\"\n\nThe blend of weightlifting, gymnastic movements and endurance elements that originally hooked Jenny soon hooked others eager to push themselves and boost their own all-around fitness.\n\n\"Our strength coach dragged Jason (Russell) and myself into it,\" said UVM women's soccer coach Kristi Lefebvre of her introduction. \"He was doing it to stay in shape and then of course we decided to get competitive at it.\n\n\"I wish it had come along earlier. It's awesome. It's the fittest I've been in my life.\"\n\nThe Olympic-style weights were what gained Fraser's attention.\n\nAfter spending the summer of 2012 working in the oil fields of Alberta, he returned to Vermont to double-major in engineering and business at UVM. He needed something to do and Jenny's gym, now a 10,000-square-foot space on South Brownell Road in Williston, had the type of equipment he could toss around to get back in shape.\n\nSoon enough Jenny's girlfriend, Dani Horan, an elite-level CrossFit competitor herself with back-to-back 18th-place finishes at the Games the last two years, convinced Fraser to join a class. He already had the foundation to excel and it didn't take long for his weaknesses — most noticeable with cardiovascular activities — to begin to disappear.\n\n\"Being cardiovascularly conditioned is much easier to build to a high level than it is to get strong,\" Jenny said. \"Elite-level strength takes longer to build than elite-level conditioning and he'd been lifting weights since he was 12, more or less. He was already as strong as he needs to be at the peak of the sport of CrossFit.\"\n\nThree months later, Jenny convinced Fraser to enter his first competition by posting the $75 entry fee himself — a friendly, no-worries loan to pay back if he happened to win.\n\n\"Then he won it,\" Jenny said. \"Pretty handily, too, I think.\"\n\nThe result, $500 in cash, went a long way toward charting the course of the last 18 months.\n\n\"It was after that, I asked Jade and Dani, 'Are there other competitions like that? Prize money?'\" Fraser said.\n\nTwo victories later, one in Boston good for $2,000 and another in New Hampshire worth $4,000, life looked a lot different.\n\n\"I'm a full-time student with no job, living at home and I went from having nothing to having $6,000 in cash sitting on my bedside table,\" Fraser said. \"I was like, 'This is unbelievable. This is the greatest thing ever.'\"\n\nWhen the CrossFit Games re-aired on ESPN last week, Fraser suggested to one of his training partners, Tyler Armstrong, that they kick back and watch with some Chinese food and ice cream. Of all the things Mat Fraser does — rowing, lifting weights, running, swimming, pull-ups and toe-ups, you name it — cooking isn't one of them. He has a sponsor for that now.\n\nHe also has a soft spot for Ben and Jerry's.\n\n\"I'll vouch that he definitely ate at least a pint of ice cream,\" Armstrong said.\n\nTwo years of CrossFit have transformed Fraser's physique, in spite of the Phish Food and high-calorie refueling at Chipotle and Five Guys after especially long days in the gym.\n\n\"My legs have shrunk, my upper body has gotten big, I have abs — that's all new,\" Fraser said. \"Beacuse Olympic weightlifting is just legs ... All my old jeans are like garbage bags on me. They're huge.\"\n\nThe guy who used to sweat his way up a flight of stairs can watch himself, from the comfort of his own couch, charge through four days of draining competition and give four-time world champion Rich Froning his toughest fight yet, just 50 points adrift in his first appearance.\n\nThe difference between the two athletes, one the standard-bearer, the other the rising star, could be measured in winnings — Froning took the $275,000 winner's share, while Fraser collected a cool $75,000 for second — as well as their approaches to the sport.\n\n\"We did an interview after and someone asked, 'How much time do you spend during the day training?'\" Fraser said. \"Rich's response was from 8 in the morning until about 7 at night I'm in the gym ... on the hour, every hour, I'll do a workout — something like that. They asked third place and he said like two hours in the morning, an hour in the afternoon, two hours at night.\n\n\"Then they asked me and I said I trained an hour or two a day,\" Fraser said. \"They were like, 'What the ...? What do you mean?\"\n\nIt means there's room to improve. And with the sport's increased exposure and financial support, the arrival of the Pro Grid League, and Fraser's own intrinsic motivation, there's reason to improve as well.\n\n\"I fear for the rest of the group next year. I know he's going to come back even better,\" Polakowski said. \"That's him. I saw it for five years as a weightlifting coach and now I get to watch him do it in CrossFit.\n\n\"I guarantee whatever little weakness he might have, he'll eliminate it.\"\n\nContact Austin Danforth at 651-4851 or edanforth@freepressmedia.com.

The 16-year-old sprinter and hurdler heads to the Rio Olympics as the youngest member of the U.S. track and field team. First, though, she wants to get home, hug her dog and eat some junk food before taking on the world.\n\nMcLaughlin caps a whirlwind few weeks with a stroll down the red carpet at the ESPY Awards on Wednesday night. She's attending as winner of the girls' national prep athlete of the year trophy she picked up Tuesday night.\n\nShe arrived in Los Angeles directly from making her first Olympic team by finishing third in the 400-meter hurdles at the U.S. trials last Sunday in Oregon. Her time of 54.14 seconds was a world junior record.\n\n\"I don't think it's hit me yet,\" she said.\n\nAfter mingling with some of the world's best professional athletes, McLaughlin goes home to Dunellen, New Jersey, for a brief visit. She's missing Gamble her cockapoo dog, whom she hasn't seen in three weeks.\n\nHer parents, Willie and Mary, are scrambling to join her in Rio.\n\n\"There's no way we're going to let our baby girl go to another country without us being there,\" said Willie, who works from home as a network engineer for AT&T. \"Besides, how many times do you get to see your kids in the Olympics?\"\n\nMary joked, \"We'll just be buying a lot of bug spray.\"\n\nWillie McLaughlin qualified for the 400-meter semifinals at the 1984 U.S. trials, but didn't make the Olympic team. Mary McLaughlin, who works at Rutgers University, is a former runner, too. The couple met at Manhattan College in New York City.\n\n\"We planned for it for years,\" Willie said of his daughter's Olympic qualification, \"but it's actually here and it's hard to believe.\"\n\nHer sister and two brothers will watch from the couch \"and party at the house,\" Sydney joked.\n\nMcLaughlin couldn't have predicted she would be in Rio. Her high school track season began with a diagnosis of mononucleosis that kept her out 1 ½ months. Her mother had a heart attack.\n\n\"Every Olympian has two or three major struggles before they make it,\" she told the crowd at the prep awards. \"I didn't know if I was going to make it and somehow I did.\"\n\nAt trials, McLaughlin had what she called \"a mental breakdown\" before her first event. She called her dad in full freak-out mode, panicked at the prospect of being a teen running against grown women.\n\nHer coaches calmed her down and \"three races later I'm an Olympian,\" she said.\n\n\"When you put her on the track, you're not running against a 16-year-old,\" Willie McLaughlin said. \"You're running against a very talented, seasoned athlete. That's what these women are finding out the hard way. I told her, 'They're more scared of you than you are of them. They've got more to lose than you and that's the attitude you need to take into it.'\"\n\nMcLaughlin has a modest goal for her first Games.\n\n\"I'm just going to get the experience. There's so many more years to try again and so many more races to run,\" she said. \"I don't even think I'm thinking about place or time. I'm going to hang out with the girls on the team. It's kind of like vacation and work at the same time.\"\n\nFrom a dad's perspective, Willie McLaughlin hopes his daughter gains confidence and hones the ability to interact and talk with anyone at the Olympics.\n\n\"She's been really blessed with talent that other people simply don't have,\" he said.\n\nMcLaughlin told Sydney that because of her track talent she can go places and do things that others can't.\n\n\"Don't be afraid of that,\" he told her. \"Don't be afraid of doing things new.\"\n\nFrom his perspective as a track coach, Willie is encouraging his daughter to step up her nutrition and embrace the lifestyle of a high-level athlete. That means cutting out junk food and some of \"the 16-year-old baggage,\" as he calls it.\n\n\"We had the boys, going to the mall, all that other stuff,\" he said, smiling. \"She needs to mature into that woman that's really going to take care of her body and take care of her instrument of success.\"\n\nSydney, named for her dad's favorite actor Sidney Poitier, is already showing her stuff in the nail art department. McLaughlin's long fingernails were decked out in sparkling silver polish, a popular trend among female sprinters.\n\nShe turns 17 on Aug. 7, days before the track competition begins in Rio. She'll be a senior this fall at Union Catholic High in Scotch Plains with some wild stories to tell.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/sport/sled-dog-racing-winter-olympics-beijing-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Winter Olympics: The fast and furry world of sled dog racing | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nAt the 1928 Winter Olympic Games in St. Moritz, Switzerland, demonstration sports – not part of the official program – were included for the first time. With demonstration events ceasing to exist after 1992, in this mini-series, CNN Sport explores some of these ‘lost sports’ of the Winter Games.\n\nFor most, a dog is a man’s best friend.\n\nBut for select few, they’re also integral to a competitive sport – welcome to the world of sled dog racing.\n\nDebuting as a demonstration sport at the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, 90 years later, the sport is still alive and barking as dogs pull their harnessed drivers, or mushers, around courses across the globe.\n\nMost popular in the Arctic regions of North America and Europe, any mention of sledding and the breeds of dogs involved – huskies, malamutes and similar Nordic breeds – always come with the association of snow.\n\nYet Matt Hodgson, Great Britain’s first world champion in purebred sled dog racing, is living proof that a relative lack of snow is no barrier to success when passion is involved.\n\nThe Deadly Sins\n\nBased in the occasionally cold but rarely arctic southeast of England, Hodgson has developed his childhood fascination with dogs of the far north into Infury Dogs – a five-time medal winning sled dog team.\n\nHodgson cites Jack London’s 1903 novel The Call of the Wild as one of his earliest influences, an interest that quickly turned to love with the arrival of his first dog, Ranger – an Alaskan Malamute puppy – in 2005.\n\nThese days Hodgson runs with his pack of six “Deadly Sins” – all dogs taking their name from one of the seven biblical vices.\n\nIt is an etymology that seems extremely harsh given their impeccable training and talent, not to mention their cuteness – compounded by the arrival of two adorable Greenland Dog pups, Nimis (gluttony) and Pride, in February last year.\n\nInfury's litter of Greenland dogs, born February 2021. Infury Sleddogs\n\nYet there is a method to the madness, Hodgson explains. Having intended to call his first sled dog – assumed to be female – Envy, Hodgson was forced to rethink when his Canadian Eskimo Dog was born male.\n\nInvidia, the Latin origin of ‘envy,’ was the replacement name of choice and subsequently set a trend, though Hodgson assures that “they’re my ‘deadly sins,’ rather than being deadly sins.”\n\nDistracting deer\n\nNo rest for the wicked then, as training begins from puppyhood.\n\n“First of all, they’re my pets, so they’ve got to be good dogs all round,” Hodgson tells CNN Sport, with all dogs attending puppy classes to nurture good behavior and sociability, laying the groundwork for sledding further down the line.\n\nTraining is gradually built up over a two-year period – after half a year, pups are allowed to run loose alongside the adults before being “hooked up” towards the ends of runs a few months later to get a feel for the harness.\n\nInvidia, a Canadian Eskimo dog, relaxes in the snow. Infury Sleddogs\n\nA gradual build up is crucial and each dog varies, Hodgson says, but within a year dogs can begin club level competition. Between 15 and 18 months, the international level beckons.\n\nMembers of the public trekking through the forests of East Sussex at unsociable hours may be lucky enough to catch the Infury Dogs racing past on one of these sessions, with Hodgson having a permit to run on Forestry England land at certain times – typically at less busy periods – in order to fulfil his impressive five to six days of training per week.\n\nYou may hear shouts of “Haw!” and “Gee!” as the dogs turn left and right, as Hodgson, with no reins or any physical connection to the pack, must rely on verbal commands alone, taught through constant reinforcement.\n\nIf you’re very lucky, you may even catch Hodgson “wrapped around a tree” when the dogs catch sight of a streaking rabbit or deer.\n\n“Most of the time, they listen,” Hodgson laughs. “That’s all part of the fact that you’re running with animals rather than a machine.”\n\nHodgson and team race through the New Forest in southern England. Infury Sleddogs\n\nGold medal retrievers\n\nIn competition, though, the Infury Dogs are very much machines.\n\nHodgson – who tends to compete in “short” races of up to eight kilometers (almost five miles), depending on terrain – has amassed five medals for Great Britain since his first international outing in 2015.\n\nHis crowning moment came in 2019 when Infury’s relatively inexperienced team soared to victory at the UK’s maiden World Championships – becoming Team GB’s first ever world champion in purebred sled dog racing.\n\nHodgson celebrates winning gold on snow at Zuberec, Slovakia in 2020. Infury Sleddogs\n\nYet for Hodgson, self-proclaimed “consistently last” for his early international outings, winning has never been the absolute priority.\n\nThough disrupted by the pandemic – with a December trip to Belgium canceled following the Covid surge of the Omicron variant – the sport has taken Hodgson and his dogs around the world.\n\nTravel restrictions willing, Sweden calls for the World Championships in March, with the tantalizing prospect of competing at the Östersund Ski Stadium in Östersund.\n\n“I love the dogs and the dogs take so much pleasure from it – if they didn’t enjoy it, they wouldn’t run and it wouldn’t be a lot of fun,” Hodgson said.\n\n“I like the camaraderie, I like the social elements, and I love sharing my love of dogs with people who also have a love of dogs, so it’s a coming together of different people. It’s nice to do well, but that’s not the main thing.”\n\nLux and Ava pull Hodgson at Zuberec. Infury Sleddogs\n\nAn Olympic return?\n\nNow, 10 years shy of the 100th anniversary of sled dog racing at the Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport, talk continues to swirl of the sport one day making a return to the Games.\n\nHodgson says the International Federation of Sled Dog Sports (IFSS) has been petitioning the International Olympic Committee (IOC), but he holds his own reservations on the suitability of the sport for Olympic status – fearing a “can of worms” opened up by logistics, finances and the very nature of the sport.\n\n“Trying to take tons of dogs and travel from North America or somewhere around the world, it’s so expensive and there’s no money in it,” Hodgson said.\n\n“There’s so many distances, so many categories – which do you select? Is it going to be teams of huskies or teams of greyhound crosses? What distances are they going to run? Does it reflect the sport?”\n\n“Then there’s the issue of, ‘Is the Olympics about human sport? Is this actually human athletics?’” Hodgson adds, referencing the long-running “furor” around equestrian sports at the Games.\n\nYet theoretically given the chance to compete in “his version” of the sport, Hodgson would “absolutely love” to represent GB at a Games.\n\nUntil then, it’s racing through forests – and the occasional tree – in East Sussex for Hodgson and his “Deadly Sins.”", "authors": ["Jack Bantock"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2016/02/02/4-things-do-wisconsin-rapids-weekend/79694056/", "title": "4 things to do in Wisconsin Rapids this weekend", "text": "Nathan Vine\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nWISCONSIN RAPIDS - Want to see some bar stool races, or people jumping into icy waters for a good cause?

The WKC recognizes 211 different breeds of dog, and the whole point of the competition is to find the dogs that adhere most to their breed’s standards (hence all of the underbelly scrutinizing). The show’s finalists each represent the best of seven different groups of dog breeds: herding, hound, non-sporting, terrier, toy and working. While the four dogs already set to head to the final may vary in size, two virtues bind them together: They’re all very good at being the types of dogs they are, and they all have excellent names.\n\nTrumpet, winner of the 2022 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show's Hound Group. C. Frausini for WKC\n\nBloodhounds are “one of the oldest breeds of dogs that hunt by scent,” according to Westminster Kennel Club classifications. A discovery by a trained bloodhound can even be used in a court of law! The American Kennel Club describes the ideal bloodhound expression as “noble and dignified, and characterized by solemnity, wisdom, and power.” Trumpet has nailed it.\n\nNon-sporting Group: Winston (French bulldog)\n\nWinston, winner of the 2022 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show's Non-sporting Group. H. Mansfield for WKC\n\nAh, Winston. A classic French bulldog name for a classic guy. According to the WKC, Frenchies don’t have a lot of, well, useful skills. But they make up for it by being cute. “Most French Bulldogs excel at being friendly, loving clowns whose raison d’être is to be adored,” their breed description says. Winston’s smiling little face has certainly gotten him far. (Also, one of Winston’s owners is an NFL defensive lineman! That counts as a skill for him, right?)\n\nToy Group: Hollywood (Maltese)\n\nHollywood, winner of the 2022 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show's Toy Group. C. Frausini for WKC\n\nHollywood looks like she thinks she’s better than everyone else, and she’s right. Toy dogs are bred for human companionship and laps of luxury. The WKC Maltese breed description says they have been popular pets among royalty for centuries, due to their “elegance and beauty.” Hollywood, star that she is, bested several other toy beauts, including Porsche, the first Russian toy dog to make it to the semifinals.\n\nHerding Group: River (German shepherd)\n\nRiver, winner of the 2022 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show's Herding Group. H. Mansfield for WKC\n\nGerman shepherds are favorites in the herding group, and it’s easy to see why. Not only are they extremely smart and enthusiastic, they can be trained for work in law enforcement and the military. And yet, the WKC points out they are also family friendly, and make great service dogs. A German shepherd named Rumor won the WKC’s Best in Show in 2017. Can River vie for a repeat?\n\nWednesday night will determine the finalists from the terrier, hunting and working groups. But only one of the final seven can be the top dog!", "authors": ["Aj Willingham"], "publish_date": "2022/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/politics/trump-liv-golf-tournament-saudi-arabia/index.html", "title": "LIV Golf: Controversial Saudi-backed golf tournament to begin ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe top controversies upending both the sporting world and international relations are coming together this week at Donald Trump’s New Jersey golf club, with the former President stepping right in the middle of the drama.\n\nStarting Friday, Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster will host the third event for LIV Golf, the new Saudi-backed professional circuit that has rocked the sport’s main professional organizer, the PGA Tour, by pulling away big-name golfers with larger, guaranteed paydays.\n\nIn the run-up to this weekend’s tournament, Trump has promoted the event in interviews and public statements, encouraging golfers to join LIV Golf and disparaging the PGA Tour.\n\n“Just arrived in Bedminster for the big LIV Tour Golf Tournament,” he posted Wednesday on Truth Social, the social media site he created. “Record money to winners, great excitement. Come on out on Friday, Saturday or Sunday to watch the great play by the best players!”\n\nTrump is benefitting from his professional relationship with LIV Golf, especially after officials at PGA of America pulled the 2022 PGA Championship from Bedminster following the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol. In October, LIV Golf will hold its final competition of the year at another Trump property, Trump National Doral in South Florida.\n\nBut while activists, media outlets and others have expressed concerns that LIV Golf provides international legitimacy to the ruling regime in Saudi Arabia, which has been accused of human rights violations for years, Trump has brushed aside such criticisms.\n\nDuring an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier this week, he spoke approvingly about how the golf tour, which is financed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, has already improved the kingdom’s reputation.\n\n“I think LIV has been a great thing for Saudi Arabia, for the image of Saudi Arabia,” Trump told the Journal.\n\nA spokesman for Trump did not respond to questions from CNN.\n\nHuman rights groups and media organizations have questioned both LIV Golf’s organizers and players over the tour’s connection to Saudi Arabia. Several of those questions have centered around the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nA US intelligence report released last year determined that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the operation to capture or kill the Saudi journalist, confirming reports soon after the murder that the CIA had made the same conclusion. During his presidency, however, Trump publicly downplayed allegations that bin Salman was involved as his administration strengthened US ties with the Saudis.\n\nBut LIV Golf’s event at Bedminster has also raised the ire of some survivors and families of victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Speaking on Tuesday at a press conference near Bedminster, Terry Strada, chair of 9/11 Families United, said the group was “appalled” by the “offensive, disrespectful and hurtful” tournament at Trump’s club, which is just 50 miles from the site of the 2001 New York attack. Strada said she was “very disappointed” in Trump, but noted that he was not the main target of the group’s criticism.\n\nIn an interview with ESPN at his club Thursday, Trump reiterated that he has been “friends” with people in Saudi Arabia for a “long time.”\n\n“Frankly, what they’re doing for golf is so great. What they’re doing for the players is so great,” the former President said.\n\nAsked what he would say to the families of 9/11 victims who are protesting the LIV Golf event, Trump appeared to question whether there was knowledge of the Saudi involvement in the terrorist attacks.\n\n“Nobody’s gotten to the bottom of 9/11, unfortunately, and they should have, as to the maniacs that did that horrible thing to our city, to our country, to the world,” he said. “So nobody’s really been there. But I can tell you that there are a lot of really great people that are out here today.”\n\nFollowing Trump’s remarks, Strada told CNN that the former President “knows full well it was the Kingdom. He did everything in his power to protect the kingdom while in office by reneging on a promise he made to 9/11 families he would declassify FBI reports re: Saudis involvement in 9/11.”\n\nThe new circuit has drawn criticism from the PGA Tour, which has suspended players who have signed on with LIV Golf, as well as from some of golf’s biggest stars, including Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy. The allure of LIV Golf for the sport’s top athletes – including larger purses and guaranteed payouts – threatens the PGA Tour’s dominance and seems to have caught the legacy organization off guard.\n\nTrump himself seems to be relishing the damage to the PGA Tour, with which he’s had a rocky relationship. While his clubs have hosted events for the PGA and other professional golf events in the past, the PGA Tour has not held an event at a Trump property since a March 2016 tournament at Doral. And after stripping Bedminster of the 2022 PGA Championship, the organization has been squarely in Trump’s sights.\n\n“All of those golfers that remain ‘loyal’ to the very disloyal PGA, in all of its different forms, will pay a big price when the inevitable MERGER with LIV comes, and you get nothing but a big ‘thank you’ from PGA officials who are making Millions of Dollars a year,” Trump wrote last week in a post on Truth Social. “If you don’t take the money now, you will get nothing after the merger takes place, and only say how smart the original signees were.”\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has spoken out about professional sports since entering politics. During his presidency, he frequently criticized the National Football League for allowing players to protest during the national anthem. And last year, Trump joined other Republicans in calling on Americans to boycott Major League Baseball after the league moved its All-Star Game from Atlanta following a new Georgia election law.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction.", "authors": ["Michael Warren"], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}]}

Leading up to their celebratory parade, newspapers ran proclamations from King Rex of carnival that balconies should be draped in purple, gold and green.\n\nThis is where things are less certain. It is unknown why these specific colors were chosen.\n\nSome accounts suggest they were selected for their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism. Others believe they were inspired by the house colors of the Russian Grand Duke, who is said to have handed out beads with the three colors to the crowds during his visit.\n\nMore:What you should bring to Mardi Gras parades\n\nIt's even possible that the Rex organization took the initiative and chose those colors in honor of Grand Duke Alexandrovich.\n\nErrol Laborde, historian and editor for the New Orleans Magazine, argues otherwise. While researching his book \"Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization,\" he offered another theory.\n\nLaborde suggests the colors were based on heraldry — the system of which coats of arms and other armorial bearings are devised, described, and regulated. The rule of tincture states that metals, gold or silver, should not be placed next to other metals, and colors should not be placed next to other colors.\n\nAlthough the colors are now typically displayed in purple, green and gold, an order that doesn't comply with the rule of tincture, the Rex organization might have been trying to create a tricolor to represent its \"kingdom,\" Laborde says. And a kingdom must have a flag.\n\nMore:Places to eat in Lafayette along the Mardi Gras parade route\n\nBut why three colors? The United States, Great Britain, and France each have tricolor-ed flags, and at the time they were the ruling countries of the world.\n\nWhen choosing from the color wheel, some of the choices seem obvious. Purple is widely associated with royalty. White was considered but at the time was heavily used on other national flags, and thus avoided.\n\nBoth metals and colors are necessary in a coat of arms, according to the heraldry system, so then gold, another obvious choice, was picked, according to Laborde.\n\nAnd according to heraldry, there are only five acceptable color choices left: red, blue, purple, green and black. Laborde believes the final choice came down to purple, gold and green or purple, gold and black.\n\nPhoto gallery:The Royal Order of Unicorns celebrate their annual Mardi Gras ball\n\nNo one is sure why green was picked over black, but it has become part of the pageantry of Mardi Gras.\n\nIn 1892, the colors gained symbolism to go along with the Rex Parade theme \"Symbolism of Colors.\" Purple means justice, green means faith, and gold means power.\n\nContact Victoria Dodge at vdodge@theadvertiser.com or on Twitter @Victoria_Dodge", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/reviewed/2023/02/08/black-owned-businesses-to-support/11212675002/", "title": "Black-owned businesses: 74+ brands and retailers you can support ...", "text": "Reviewed Staff\n\nReviewed\n\n— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed's editors.

She’s someone that means a lot to me.\"\n\nIn 2013, when Regina Williams was diagnosed with Lupus, Wilson found himself raising awareness of the disease, a chronic inflammatory condition that causes the body to attack its own healthy tissues and organs, according to the Michigan Lupus Foundation.\n\nWilson took part in a PledgeIt campaign to help benefit Lupus Detroit last year, and he was an ambassador for the group's Lupus Walk to raise funds to help cure the disease.\n\nIn Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Rams, he'll wear orange- and white-painted shoes with a ribbon on the toe to help bring more recognition to Lupus Detroit.\n\n\"It’s my aunt, my cousins, it’s different people in my family,\" Wilson said. \"My wife’s aunt. So it’s something that has affected both of our families and something that we’re very blessed to be a part of, obviously, because we raise awareness, but something that’s tough to deal with.\"\n\nWilson is one of at least 19 Detroit Lions players plus coach Matt Patricia taking part in the NFL's annual \"My Cause, My Cleats\" program this week. Here are some of their other stories:\n\nMatt Cassel: Big Oak Ranch\n\nCassel said he became in involved with Big Oak Ranch, a Christian home for children in need in Springville, Ala., through his former Kansas City Chiefs teammate, Brodie Croyle.\n\nCroyle's father, John, founded the home in 1974, and Cassel said Croyle \"has kind of taken over\" operations of the facility now.\n\n\"It was an organization that was built on the principle of helping kids that had been abused, hurt, neglected, and giving them a home, a safe home that they can raise them in, a loving environment that would be based on Christian principles,\" Cassel said. \"They do a tremendous job and they’ve helped hundreds of kids over the years. They’ve probably got — I don’t want to give you an exact estimate, but they’ve got a lot of kids there now that they raise. They've got a boys home and a girls home. They raise them, they adopt them, they educate them. They take care of them until they’re ready to move out. So it’s an amazing organization.\"\n\nMatt Patricia: Word of Honor Fund\n\nPatricia has talked at length about his appreciation for service members, and said earlier this year part of the reason he wears his beard is as a tribute to military personnel around the globe.\n\nThe Word of Honor Fund provides support for the surviving children of fallen Navy SEALS and special operations personnel.\n\n\"(I have) a lot of friends in the military, especially a lot of friends in the Navy and the Navy SEALs,\" Patricia said. \"It’s a cause that kind of remembers those that have fallen or gone and that brotherhood response to making sure that they take care of those left behind. So, it’s a good organization to try to give the kids of those that have lost loved ones that promise to take care of them.\"\n\nRelated:Patricia: All this losing 'drives me to ... do more'\n\nDarius Slay: Coastal Soccer Outreach\n\nSlay runs a tutoring and mentoring center in his hometown of Brunswick, Ga., with his cousin, a local youth soccer coach.\n\nThe Coastal Soccer Program is a joint effort between the Glynn County school system and Brunswick Recreation Department to get more kids involved with soccer.\n\nSlay said he picked the colors for his shoes — yellow, blue and red — as a tribute to his favorite soccer team, Real Madrid.\n\n\"There's just a lot of stuff that I didn’t have that I felt like could have helped me be better at what I wasn’t great at,\" Slay said. \"I wasn’t the smartest guy. I didn’t have no tutors and stuff like that to help me build my character up and my learning ability. I had to learn from scratch, trying to figure out how to do it myself, but I’m just trying to give these kids a better opportunity at a brighter opportunity than I had.\"\n\nTyrell Crosby: Oregon Children's Hospital\n\nCrosby first became involved in the OHSU Doernbecher Children's Hospital as a player at Oregon, when he joined cancer survivors in helping to design the uniform Oregon wore for its \"Stomp Out Cancer\" game against Nebraska last year.\n\nIt was there that Crosby worked with a young cancer survivor, Sophia Malinoski, on helmets and sideline gear for the game, and learned the story of how she was diagnosed with cancer after suffering a concussion playing soccer.\n\nThe two stayed in touch, and Crosby said he decided back in the spring before he was drafted by the Lions that he wanted to use this week to help raise funds for the Children's Hospital and cancer research in general.\n\n\"If you look at (my cleats), it’s a Lion stomping on cancer and that was pretty much her design,\" Crosby said. \"She used a duck for Oregon, but ever since then I’ve just really had a huge passion to try to help promote (the hospital) as much as possible and throughout my cleats you can see different things that represent her and then also people that I’ve lost from cancer, my high school track coach Blaine Thompson.\n\n\"So on one cleat it’s the Lions, but the O is a cancer ribbon and one is purple for pancreatic cancer and his initials in it and then the other one is gold is for pediatric cancer in it and it has Sophia's initials. ... Ever since I pretty much met her I’ve always looked up to her. She overcame cancer at a super young age, and just listening to her story has continued to inspire me.\"\n\nDeShawn Shead: Shead The Light\n\nShead started his own foundation three years ago to help underprivileged children in his hometown of Palmdale, Calif.\n\nHe runs a free football and life skills camp annually in which he talks to children about making the right choices, and he hosts a tournament in the Spokane, Wash., area, called The Fish and Chip, that features fishing and golf.\n\nShead said anywhere from 200-350 children attend the camp, which he hopes to expand into a multi-day event that features guest speakers and classroom work in the near future.\n\n\"A lot of (kids in my hometown) are living in low income and poverty and there’s a lot of gang violence going on in this world,\" Shead said. \"So I talk to them about making the right choices, talking about what it means to have integrity and what it means to work hard and find a way through any hard, tough situation. And the big thing I harp on is perseverance and be able to persevere through these situations. So that’s one of my focuses.\"\n\nRelated:Kerryon Johnson, 2 others out for Sunday's game vs. Rams\n\nContact Dave Birkett: dbirkett@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @davebirkett.

Special introductory offer for new subscribers only.\n\nBlechman said his research of the nightlife in The Villages found many one-night stands and “serial monogamy,\" but not a swingers scene.\n\n“I was quietly on the hunt for any sign of swingers,” he said, “but I didn’t find them. And if there was a loofah code, it would have made it much easier.”\n\nFact and fiction hard to separate at The Villages\n\nFor years, The Villages has been batting down stories that claim there’s a higher incidence of sexually transmitted disease there than in Miami.\n\nRyan Erisman, who publishes the “Inside the Bubble” blog about life in The Villages, wrote that the new stories about residents using loofahs to signal their sexual appetites aren’t true.\n\n“The Villages regularly leads the nation in number of new home sales,” Erisman wrote. “I think that if this luffa rumor were actually true they’d probably be selling a lot more!”\n\nSo how did this loofah story come to life?\n\nGet ready for a real Florida answer: a local drag queen.\n\nOne of the main vectors is an Orlando-area drag queen who goes by the stage name Tora, and is now starring as the lead role in a Villages production of the musical La Cage aux Folles.\n\nTora made a TikTok video last month that shows grandparent-aged Villagers shopping for loofahs, and scenes of cars and golf carts adorned with different color poufs. It’s played to a soundtrack of the Dubskie song, “Oh No Oh No Oh No No No!”\n\n“They are everywhere!” Tora wrote.\n\nThe drag queen’s video has been watched at least 6.3 million times, and spun off into stories in The New York Post and London’s Daily Mail. \"Not so aloof-ah!,\" read the London tabloid headline about the \"frisky senior swingers\" in Florida.\n\nBlechman’s not surprised that stories like this resonate and become the object of fascination.\n\n“There’s a lot of bias about age in our culture, and with anything about older people having sex there’s an eww factor. People are both interested and repulsed at the same time. It’s a sign of ageism.\n\n“I wish for older people to have sex,” he said. “All the power to them.”\n\nThe non-sexy truth about the loofah puffs\n\nSo, if they’re not driving around with loofahs on their cars and golf carts on a quest to find a group activity more bracing than canasta, what are they for?\n\nIt's because people forget where they parked, and the colorful loofah poufs help them find their cars, Erisman, the Villages blogger said.\n\n“Much like putting a colorful luggage tag on your black suitcase so that it stands out among all of the other black suitcases on the luggage conveyor,” he wrote. “It’s the same idea, if you’ve ever stepped outside of Publix on a sunny central Florida afternoon and tried to spot your white car among a sea of all the other white cars, and don’t quite remember which aisle you parked down.”\n\nSo, it’s more about being confused than enthused.\n\nOh, well. Another good story shot down by too much reporting. Just in case, I phoned up legendary retired Palm Beach Post sportswriter Chuck Otterson, who has been a resident of Century Village in West Palm Beach for the past 20 years.\n\nAny loofah-signaling swingers in Century Village?\n\n“The only thing I noticed was that some people put plastic flowers on their aerials,” Otterson said. “But that’s just to help them find their cars.”\n\nFrank Cerabino is a columnist at The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA TODAY Florida Network.

They intervened, dropped the eviction and agreed to allow Hatfield to stay in her apartment for the rest of the year.\n\nJoy Hatfield is disabled, has cancer and recently was notified she would be evicted from her Gilbert apartment.\n\nHatfield, who lives alone with her two service dogs, said she has never been late or missed a rent payment.\n\nManagers at the Painted Trails Apartments said the 57-year-old former business owner created a disturbance at the apartment that drove away prospective renters.\n\nSpecifically, they accused Hatfield of harassment. They said she was banging on walls so hard during a showing of an adjacent model that they lost a lease.\n\nHatfield said that on the day she was accused of banging on the walls, she she was at the doctor — and has the paperwork to prove it.\n\n\"I couldn't bang on anything,\" Hatfield said. \"I was at a doctor's appointment from 11:15. I didn't get home until after five.\"\n\nHatfield said the managers were uninterested in her responses. She said they refused to discuss her case and were happy to leave her with no place to live during the holidays. She said they threatened her with a $5,000 bill for attorney fees and broke- lease fees.\n\nPainted Trails manager Cheryl Sword expressed little sympathy toward Hatfield.\n\n\"She doesn't have breast cancer, I'll tell you that right now,\" Sword said, before twice hanging up during phone interviews. \"Do you want the number of our attorney?\"\n\nHatfield's case illustrates the lack of protection tenants have when it comes to disputes with landlords in Arizona. She was served with a 10-day notice and told that the case would be heard in court and that she could plead her case there.\n\nHatfield said she hired an attorney who was unable to get a response from apartment managers or their attorney. When it became clear the case would land in court, the lawyer wanted a down payment that Hatfield said she could not afford to make.\n\nShe started packing boxes.\n\n\"I don't know where I was going to go. I'm willing to move out. I just wanted time to find a new place. ... maybe next month,\" she said. \"Just let me pack up and find a place.\"\n\nHatfield has battled cancer for years. She underwent a lumpectomy, but in 2009 the cancer returned. She said this year the cancer metastasized and has affected her bones. She is being treated at Banner Desert Medical Center in Mesa.\n\nHatfield said she was diagnosed with lupus at an early age. Lupus, an autoimmune disease, attacks and damages different parts of the body, including joints and organs. Hatfield has also had two back surgeries and has problems with her right hip.\n\nIn 2007, Hatfield moved to Arizona from Southern California, where she owned a business that did medical and legal transcription. She said she was fleeing an abusive marriage to a Los Angeles Police Department officer, who committed suicide after their separation.\n\nHatfield earns about $4,200 a month from disability and her former husband's pension.\n\nShe said when managers presented her with a 10-day notice, they asked her to sign a paper acknowledging the complaint against her. She said she did so, but only under duress and wrote as much on the form.\n\nHatfield said after her attorney failed, she was resigned to the eviction.\n\n\"Sometimes things are just not worth fighting for,\" she said.\n\nHer friend Mary Sohmers disagreed. Sohmers questioned the fairness of the eviction.\n\nSohmers said she never had heard of people being kicked out of an apartment when they pay their rent on time.\n\n\"It wasn't right,\" she said.\n\nSohmers contacted Call 12 for Action and asked for help for her friend.\n\nPainted Trails is owned by RK Properties, a Southern California-based company that operates apartments in six states. Managers in California responded within minutes to calls about Hatfield's eviction, saying they had no interest in processing an eviction over the holidays.\n\nSteve Urquhart, RK regional manager in Arizona, said he was unaware of the eviction. He said he wanted to quickly meet with Hatfield and work out a solution.\n\nLess than one business day later, he agreed to drop the eviction and worked out an agreement that lets Hatfield stay in her unit until Jan. 15 with no additional fees or penalties.\n\nUrquhart described it as a miscommunication.\n\n\"The eviction is a generated piece of paper, and unfortunately it fell on the holidays, right before Thanksgiving,\" Urquhart said. \"The manager of the complex just didn't have any answers for her (Hatfield).... We met with her and apologized to her over the date of eviction.\"\n\nHatfield said the extension will allow her to time to find a new apartment and give her time to pack. She said she was thankful RK Properties was willing to work with her. She said the compromise allows the apartment manager to get rid of her and saves her thousands in fees.\n\nShe said the extension wouldn't have happened without Call 12 for Action's intervention.\n\n\"I've spent the last two weeks crying,\" she said. \"I don't want to be 57 and homeless.\"\n\nReach the reporter at robert.anglen@arizonarepublic.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/us/five-things-april-19-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for April 19: Ukraine, Covid, Twitter, Drop tower ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 Things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’re up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Between Friday and Sunday, more than 3,200 flights were canceled and about 9,000 flights were delayed, according to the data group FlightAware. The increase in delays and cancellations comes just days after Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg urged airline CEOs to improve their flight schedules and better respond to disruptions.

Coronavirus\n\nThe CDC’s mask mandate for travelers is no longer in effect on airplanes and other public transport methods following a federal judge’s ruling yesterday. US District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle said the mandate was unlawful because it exceeded the authority of the CDC and because its implementation violated administrative law. “The agencies are reviewing the decision and assessing potential next steps,” a Biden administration official said last night, adding the CDC still recommends that people continue to wear masks in indoor public transportation settings. After the mandate was struck down, several US airlines announced that masks are now optional on their aircraft – including Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Alaska Airlines and JetBlue.\n\n'Huge shift in travel policy': Travel mask mandate no longer in effect 02:13 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Gen. Mark Milley\n\nTwitter has indicated that it’s not interested in being bought by Elon Musk without a fight. After the Tesla and SpaceX CEO offered to buy Twitter last week, the company’s board implemented a shareholder rights plan, known as a “poison pill,” that would make it harder and more expensive for Musk (or any other would-be buyer) to acquire the company without the board’s approval. Now, eyes are back on Musk to see how he might respond to the board’s defensive measure. Musk, who currently owns around 9% of shares in the company, could decide to withdraw his bid, or he could sit tight and exercise the still-significant influence he’d have at the company as one of its largest shareholders. Musk said last week that he has a “Plan B” if his bid falls through, although he declined to elaborate on what it is.\n\nWhy conservatives are embracing Elon Musk's Twitter move 06:22 - Source: CNN\n\n5. Haiti\n\nFollowing the death last month of a 14-year-old boy who fell from an amusement park ride in Orlando, Florida, a forensic engineering firm hired to investigate the incident found the ride’s operator made manual adjustments to two seats. Those adjustments were made “presumably, to allow for larger riders, which should not have happened based on the manufacturer’s guidelines,” State Rep. Geraldine Thompson said in a news update yesterday. According to the report, the harness on one of the seats was manually loosened to to allow a restraint opening of near 7 inches – about 4 inches more than the normal opening range for the restraints. The FreeFall drop tower manufacturer’s guidelines also put a rider’s weight limit at 250 pounds; Tyre Sampson – the teen who died – weighed approximately 340 pounds, his family told CNN. Authorities said they are working to conclude the investigation before assessing what penalties may come.\n\n14-year-old boy fatally falls from amusement park ride 01:48 - Source: CNN\n\n5. UK deportations\n\nThe right-wing conspiracy outlet Infowars has filed for bankruptcy protection as its founder Alex Jones faces several defamation lawsuits. The move, which could pause civil litigation against the companies, comes after Jones was found legally responsible for damages in three defamation lawsuits related to false claims he made about the 2012 Sandy Hook mass shooting. In the aftermath of the shooting, in which 26 people were killed, Jones baselessly said the incident was staged. He later swore in a deposition that a “form of psychosis” caused him at the time to believe it was staged. The documents filed on Sunday sought bankruptcy protection for Infowars and Prison Planet, another one of Jones’ right-wing outlets.

No flying cars yet, but our rides have advanced considerably since the movie's 1985 debut.\n\nBack then, we could barely imagine satellite navigation, automated steering, reconfigurable touchscreens or Bluetooth-enabled smartphones. But beyond movie cars, there were some highly regarded models on the roads in 1985.\n\nHere's a look at how much they've changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nC4 Corvette\n\nOnly in its second year, the C4 set standards with its integrated frame, digital instruments and 230-horsepower V8. Later in the decade, the ZR-1 would challenge European supercars. Today's C7 boasts reconfigurable infotainment screens, seven-speed transmission, magnetic ride control and 455-horsepower V8. The 650-horsepower Z06 still gives Europeans fits.\n\nMustang SVO\n\nBig news for Mustang in the mid-1980s was the 200-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine in the SVO. Its Fox platform was still young. Three decades later, Mustang pays homage to 1965 with sexy style, but returns to 1985 with a turbo-four — now achieving 310 horsepower and 32 mpg. Finally, an independent rear suspension!\n\nHonda Accord\n\nA look at photos tells you how far Honda has come. Accord was the automaker's flagship; Acura was a year in the future. It had square edges, sparse interior, spindly wheels and 110-horsepower four-cylinder, but was becoming a global benchmark. Today's larger Accord Hybrid achieves up to 50/45 mpg city/highway and still is built in Ohio.\n\nMercedes 300E\n\nDuring 1985, Mercedes transitioned from the W123 to W124 E-Class, the latter was then considered the world's best car. (I went to the movie in my grandmother's '79 W123). Both proved so durable that they're still widely driven. Today's E-Class is topped by the E63 with its 577-horsepower V8, adaptive cruise control and cloud-based infotainment.\n\nDodge Caravan\n\nIn the mid-'80s, family transport was being redefined by the four-cylinder (100-horsepower) front-drive Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager. They and SUVs put the final nail through the mainstream station wagon's hood. Today's Grand Caravan features seats that fold into the floor, sophisticated safety systems and 283-horsepower Pentastar V6.\n\n\n\n\n\nToyota Pickup\n\nMarty McFly's black 4x4 was the vision of his reality after a long trip to 1955. An entire generation of kids wanted one. Flash ahead and Marty would surely recognize today's version. Although larger, better equipped and more capable, the truck's rugged style and off-road prowess remain. Buy one and you may still be driving it in 2045.\n\nBMW 5-Series\n\nWatching Biff buff George McFly's 5-Series in the driveway was a sweet moment. BMW was not yet at Mercedes standards, but that car filled yuppie dreams. Project ahead three decades to envision the M5's 560-horsepower turbo-V8. The plug-in i8 supercar would have blown George's feeble mind.\n\nDeLorean DMC-12\n\nIt took genius to cast a rear-engined, stainless-steel, gull-winged sports car as a movie star. It made DeLorean immortal. Given its 130-horsepower six-cylinder engine, reaching 88 mph didn't happen quickly. Should you want to go back to the future yourself, contact DeLorean Motor Co. at delorean.com for a refurbished car.

And it’s being propelled even more by the 79-year-old President’s age, which has prompted questions about what kind of campaign schedule he’d be able to keep up.\n\nFear runs deep of yet another unfavorable Biden comparison to Jimmy Carter, who survived a 1980 primary challenge from Ted Kennedy but not the lasting wound going into the general election. Democrats privately hoping Biden might reverse course and not run are petrified that they’re backbiting their way into allowing Trump and Trumpism back into power.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped muted worries from going around the West Wing, according to four aides familiar with the conversations, that someone may yet emerge ahead of the President’s planned spring 2023 formal reelection campaign launch. Biden advisers expect to stick to that no matter what happens, including if Trump decides to jump in early.\n\n“Nothing about our timeline changes, but we’re prepared if he decides to run,” one person familiar with the Biden team’s political planning said about Trump.\n\nBut even Rep. Ro Khanna, the California congressman and former Bernie Sanders campaign co-chair, who first won his seat by beating an incumbent in a primary, said he won’t entertain the thought of jumping in against Biden, although he’s aware he’s being whispered about – so much that a close friend had a dream over July Fourth weekend that he did it.\n\n“Absolutely not,” Khanna told CNN. “I plan to support (Biden) because of the danger that Donald Trump poses. I would certainly not do anything to weaken him, and I hope no one else will do anything to weaken him. He’s still the safe brand in the midwestern states to make sure Trump is kept far away from the Oval Office.”\n\nThat also goes for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has been causing the most antsy whispers from the Biden orbit with his comments calling out a lack of Democratic action and energy and his buying a July Fourth ad in Florida hitting Gov. Ron DeSantis, a prospective 2024 GOP candidate. Newsom, who’s facing reelection in November, compared the Democratic dynamics to those he initially faced in his recall election last year, when he and advisers worked to scare off several Democrats who’d looked at jumping in against him.\n\n“The success of our recall was about unifying around our party and defining the opposition. We need to unify the Democratic Party and not destroy ourselves from within,” Newsom said. “We need to have our President’s back. But we also have to get on the field. He needs troops. He has to govern. Our job is to organize, and it’s to have his back.”\n\nThe same goes for J.B. Pritzker, the billionaire first-term Illinois governor who also drew some behind-the-scenes brushback from Biden world by delivering a speech about his exhaustion with the Democratic status quo in famous first-presidential primary state New Hampshire. The Democrat, who’s running for a second term in November, lit up even more speculation with his response to the Highland Park shooting in his state earlier this month, which was more forceful than Biden’s.\n\nBiden “has said he’s running for reelection and I support that,” Pritzker told CNN, adding that though he thinks some other opponent may yet emerge, Biden “will win the nomination, and yet, it’ll be Ted Kennedy running against Jimmy Carter … They will lose and they will take away from the President. That’s not what we need right now.”\n\nThe speculation is at a high enough fever that when Pete Buttigieg’s PAC reactivated on Twitter at the end of June to endorse a few candidates for US House and state legislature, several plugged-in operatives began to wonder if this was the first step in the transportation secretary relaunching as a candidate. His attendance at Democratic National Committee events and meetings with a few potential future donors only sparked more talk.\n\nBut there’s nothing to that, according to a Transportation Department spokesperson, who said, “Buttigieg has had no involvement in Win the Era PAC since his nomination as Secretary. He is 100 percent focused on his job at DOT, including implementing President Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law.”\n\nSome have talked about Jared Polis, the Colorado governor known for straying from what became Democratic orthodoxy on Covid-19 lockdowns and is facing voters this fall. He has a personal fortune, several operatives noted, and while not enough to self-fund, enough to possibly seed a campaign and feel confident that he wouldn’t have to worry about endangering future job prospects. Polis campaign spokesperson Amber Miller said he’s “not considering anything like that and is focused on running the state of Colorado. If he is re-elected, he plans to serve his entire term as governor of Colorado.”\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has repeatedly said Biden intends to run and that she’d be his running mate, and no one around her or anywhere else believes she’d be able to pull off a campaign that started by breaking with him.\n\nSanders, the Vermont senator who has twice sought the Democratic nod, told CNN last month he would not run against Biden. A spokesperson for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, told CNN that nothing has changed since the Massachusetts Democrat told NBC News that she’s not running for president in 2024 and would be supporting Biden. Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ top political adviser and former campaign manager, said trying to run by appealing to his wing of the party “would be an almost insurmountable climb to get to the top of that mountain, given that Bernie has said he’s going to be supporting Joe Biden if he runs for re-election.”\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated a member of Democratic House leadership to come to Congress, told late night host Stephen Colbert at the end of June that she was more focused on preserving American democracy than presidential speculation.\n\nBut she’s also held off on saying she would support Biden for reelection, noting that the President hasn’t said he’s running himself.\n\nAsked by CNN if that left space for her to consider running a youthful, progressive primary against him, a spokesperson for the congresswoman didn’t return requests for comment.\n\nFacing a ‘soft’ primary\n\nCarter-Kennedy isn’t the only historical example on Democrats’ minds. There’s Ronald Reagan’s bruising 1976 primary campaign against Republican President Gerald Ford, which helped pave the way for Carter’s win. Or George H.W. Bush never quite recovering from Pat Buchanan’s 1992 primary campaign, which hurt him with the GOP base heading into the general election.\n\nSeveral senior Democrats, though, cited 1968, when President Lyndon Johnson faced a primary challenge from Eugene McCarthy. Eventually, other candidates jumped in, leading the President to withdraw that March from running for reelection.\n\nOperatives around a number of prospective presidential candidates argue that Biden is already facing a “soft” primary challenge from many directions. The goal, they say, is not to run against Biden, but rather to implicitly reassure the President that Democrats have other good options from the next generation or two, and that he should be comfortable passing the torch to them.\n\nThe other goal is for Democrats to get as ready as they can, on the chance that Biden drags out his reelection decision and then changes his mind so late into the presidential cycle that other candidates are hobbled in launching campaigns and raising money.\n\nFor all the free media attention that would come from declaring a primary campaign against Biden, no one seems to want to go down as blowing a hole in the party for Republicans to march back through – particularly at a moment when apocalyptic feelings are so high. This is about future ambitions, too: Those would-be candidates are aware Democratic voters would never forgive a spoiler.\n\n“It’s about us having his back, not taking back some wing of the party,” Newsom said. “It’s about everybody disabusing ourselves that we have the luxury of division from within.”\n\n“I believe there will be plenty of time post-Donald Trump to debate the future of the Democratic Party,” Khanna said. “For people who have future ambition, they’d much rather be running in a post-Donald Trump and post-Joe Biden world.”\n\nBarack Obama faced a flurry of primary speculation at about this point ahead of his own reelection campaign 12 years ago – to the point that Gallup tested how well he’d do if Hillary Clinton ran against him, and Sanders started poking around in New Hampshire about jumping in against him.\n\nMany of the Democratic leaders, operatives and donors who spoke to CNN about having these conversations insist it’s precisely their fear of Trump beating Biden that is driving them to cast around for possible other options.\n\nNot only is Biden now clocking lower approval ratings than almost every Democratic governor and senator on the ballot in November, but several internal Democratic polls have shown him struggling against Trump in battleground states.\n\nAsked if he understood what was generating the talk of a primary challenge that he thinks may yet emerge, Pritzker paused. First, he reiterated his support of Biden. Then, he repeated his call for more energy and action, without mentioning the President specifically.\n\n“We absolutely need to be stronger and louder in our condemnation of the right wing and what they stand for, and in our defense of the liberties of women and those who are marginalized,” Pritzker said. “There is a palpable change in attitude among Democrats.”\n\nPushing back on the nudging\n\nBefore he launched his 2020 campaign, Biden advisers had bounced around the idea of a one-term pledge as a way to answer questions about his age. Biden nixed the idea, saying he’d never be able to get anything done as an immediate lame duck. He’s made similar comments about what would happen to his power at home and on the world stage if he were to announce he’s not running for reelection.\n\nFew around Biden see that changing. Some even suggested that a primary challenger could inadvertently help him recover from approval numbers stuck below 40% by giving him a foil. If that challenge came from the left and allowed him to argue he hasn’t kowtowed to progressives – as Republicans and some Democratic moderates claim – several operatives said that would be even better.\n\nBut as White House aides regularly point out, no incumbent president has launched a reelection campaign this early, and Biden was the last serious primary contender to announce a 2020 campaign, pushing back on those who urged him to declare earlier.\n\n“There’s nobody who’s more infamous about his inability to make a decision about running for president of the United States,” joked one Democratic member of Congress, who asked not to be named. “And hey, he’s President.”\n\nAnd while four years ago at this same point ahead of the 2020 cycle, the Democratic National Committee was deep into preparations for primaries and debates, no such efforts are underway.\n\nLong before he became famous for managing Howard Dean’s anti-establishment 2004 presidential campaign (in what was an open Democratic field), Joe Trippi was a young aide to Kennedy’s 1980 primary challenge, running the floor operation for several states on the floor of the convention that summer.\n\nTrippi said he hopes anyone thinking of a Biden primary realizes it would be “murder-suicide,” and warned his fellow Democrats: “Nothing good can come from it.”\n\n“I learned that lesson the hard way as a young idealistic progressive in the late 70s early 80s,” Trippi said. “What we got for it was eight years of Reagan and four years of H.W. Bush.”", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-best-reads/2018/06/29/hogans-heroes-star-bob-crane-scottsdale-murder-40-years-later/733260002/", "title": "40 years later, 'Hogan's Heroes' star Bob Crane murder still intrigues", "text": "This is a tough two-week stretch for Bob Crane Jr.\n\nHis 67th birthday was two days ago. Friday marks the 40th anniversary of his father's murder. And July 13 would have been his father's 90th birthday.\n\nCrane's father was Bob Crane, the handsome, all-American star of \"Hogan's Heroes,\" a campy 1960s TV sitcom about smart-alecky World War II prisoners of war who continually outsmart their bumbling German captors.\n\nHe was found murdered in his Scottsdale apartment on June 29, 1978, his skull bashed in with a blunt object and an electrical cord around his neck. His death — and the sordid revelations that followed — stunned Hollywood, his fans and his family.\n\nAnd though it's been 40 years, and though he now knows things that he wishes he didn't, hardly a day goes by that Bob Crane Jr. doesn't think about his father.\n\nHe is not alone.\n\nRELATED: Shocking murders in metro Phoenix history\n\nBob Crane Sr., has been the subject of a full-length feature film, several books, and numerous documentaries and TV news stories.\n\nHis case is popular on true-crime podcasts, and earlier this year a YouTuber posted a shaky hand-held video tour of the Scottsdale condominium complex where Crane died. It has almost 1,000 views.\n\nA leading man (with secrets)\n\nSo why are we still so fascinated with Bob Crane?\n\nThe one-time Los Angeles radio personality had only one hit television show, and it didn't even get a farewell episode because they didn't do them back then.\n\nAfter the show, there were only a few guest spots, minor roles in a couple of Disney films, a failed TV pilot. All of which signaled a generally downward career arc that led directly to the dinner theater circuit, which is how the star came to be in Scottsdale in June of 1978.\n\n\"You can't forget, that's my problem,\" Crane told The Arizona Republic in a recent interview. \"I can't forget this date — it's still a bad dream.\"\n\nCrane said there are a number of reasons why the public still craves information about his father.\n\nFirst, the show is still on TV. Its World War II setting makes it timeless, and it never really ages. And though the show was was canceled in 1971, has been in almost perpetual syndication ever since.\n\n\"It started in 1965, and it's still a cash cow,\" Crane said, adding that he doesn't receive a dime from it because his stepmother inherited his father's estate when he died.\n\nSecondly his father was a good-looking guy who played a hero who always had a wisecrack and always knew the right thing to do. Audiences loved him then and still do today.\n\n\"It was the age of the leading man — Robert Conrad on 'Wild Wild West' and Robert Culp on 'I Spy,' \" Crane Jr. said. \"They were all-American heroes.\"\n\nAnd third, and perhaps most compelling, is the nature of the investigation, which revealed salacious details about Crane's sex life, and the fact that the murder is technically still unsolved.\n\n\"To root for Col. Hogan and then to find out about a second sordid life shocks and baffles people to this day,\" Crane said. \"Everybody has secrets, but his went public in a big way.\"\n\nThat Jekyll-and-Hyde disconnect between the affable leading man and the darkly sex-obsessed pornographer who not only made his own films, but also performed in them, feeds into what Crane described as the \"Yin and yang of celebrity-dom.\"\n\n\"People love to see celebrities on the rise, but after a while you want them to be human again,\" he said.\n\nHe likened it to the recent case of Roseanne Barr, who suddenly shot back to the top of the public consciousness and then just as suddenly crashed after a racist tweet.\n\n\"It was over in a second, and people were fascinated with how fast it could implode,\" he said.\n\nLooking for the dark side\n\nLeo Braudy, a University of Southern California professor who teaches courses in literature, popular culture and film history, agreed that the double-edged sword of celebrity helps explain why people are still captivated by Crane's story.\n\n\"We love them on the way up, then love to hate their success,\" said Braudy, whose book, \"The Frenzy of Renown,\" explores the nature of fame and the public's fascination with it.\n\n\"The whole enterprise of gossip is an effort to get behind the façade,\" Braudy said. \"Crane becomes a prime example. … Is the person we see on screen really who we think they are, or do they have a dark side?\"\n\nHe drew a comparison to stars from earlier Hollywood eras whose allure endured after they were linked to sexual scandal: Charlie Chaplin, who had a proclivity for underage girls, and Ingrid Bergman, whose affair with Italian director Roberto Rossellini was denounced on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n\nBraudy said another factor in the ongoing fascination with Crane is the fact that the murder is still unsolved.\n\n\"It's sort of mysterious,\" he said. \"It's not quite clear what happened. It's a puzzle, and people want to work it out like they do with the Kennedy assassination.\"\n\nCrane had been starring in a production of a play called \"Beginner's Luck\" at the Windmill Dinner Theater in Scottsdale when he was killed. He was found bludgeoned to death with a cord around his neck by a co-star who had gone to Crane's apartment to work with him on some lines from the play.\n\nThe only suspect in the case, longtime friend John Carpenter, remained free for years before Scottsdale police were able to charge him. He finally came to trial in 1994, 16 years after the murder, but he was acquitted because of questions about the forensic evidence in the case.\n\nReopening the investigation\n\nJust last year, Phoenix television anchor John Hook published a book about the Crane case and was able to get access to some of the blood samples that were used as evidence and have them retested.\n\n\"It consistently ranks as one of the great unsolved celebrity murders of all time,\" Hook said, noting that gets requests for interviews and speaking engagements about the case \"all the time.\"\n\nIn his book, \"Who Killed Bob Crane?\" Hook set out to \"end the speculation\" about Crane's death by using forensic science the way famed attorney Vincent Bugliosi attempted to in his 2007 book about the Kennedy assassination.\n\nHook focused on DNA technology, which wasn't available at the time of the murder and was only rudimentary in its use during Carpenter's trial.\n\n\"If we can retest stuff, maybe we can prove that the blood that was found in Carpenter's car was Bob Crane's,\" said Hook, an anchor for KSAZ-TV (Channel 10).\n\nRELATED: New book delves into unsolved Scottsdale murder of actor Bob Crane\n\nHe noted that jury believed Carpenter was the murderer, but they didn't believe the evidence.\n\nAlmost from the time Crane's body was discovered in his bedroom of the Winfield Place apartments (now condominiums) in Scottsdale, authorities made critical mistakes that later undermined their case.\n\nFor starters, Scottsdale police failed to adequately secure the crime scene. They allowed his co-star, Victoria Berry, into the apartment to answer the phone several times, potentially contaminating the crime scene. In addition, the Maricopa County Medical Examiner climbed over Crane's body and shaved his head to examine the fatal wound, Hook said.\n\nAnd while evidence photos show a piece of what appears to be human tissue on the door of Carpenter's rental car, the crime lab at the state Department of Public Safety either lost that critical piece of evidence or never bothered to recover it in the first place.\n\nCrane and Carpenter had been friends for years. Carpenter, who died in 1998, was a sales manager for Sony and then Akai. He shared a mutual interest in the latest electronic gear with Crane.\n\nThey also shared a mutual interest in women and pornography. In Crane's apartment, police found video tapes Crane had made of himself and numerous women, along with photographic negatives of nude women.\n\nDuring the investigation, Carpenter told police that right before the murder, Crane showed him a book of Polaroid snapshots of naked women, including some he'd met at the dinner theater. Police were unable to find it in Crane's apartment. It was one of the only things missing — the other was a camera tripod — from the apartment, which showed no sign of forced entry.\n\nBoth Hook and Crane's son said that Crane may have been growing tired of Carpenter, who police identified as a suspect almost from the start. Two days after Crane's body was discovered, police found blood on the door panel of the car Carpenter had rented.\n\nWhile the blood was Crane's type — B — it couldn't be conclusively linked to Crane, and the Maricopa County Attorney's office refused to allow Scottsdale police to arrest Carpenter.\n\nAn arrest, an acquittal\n\nAlmost 14 years to the day after the murder, authorities finally arrested Carpenter, citing a new analysis of the crime scene and blood and tissue evidence.\n\nThe new theory held that the missing tripod was the blunt instrument used as the murder weapon, and that the blood in Carpenter's rental car had dripped from it when he leaned it against the car door. A key piece of evidence was a photograph of tissue, thought to be from Crane's skull, but the actual sample was never produced.\n\nThe case finally came to trial in 1994. After eight weeks of testimony, the jury deliberated for nearly three days before acquitting Carpenter.\n\n\"What was the speck?\" jury foreman Michael Lake asked after the trial. \"Nobody knows what it was, not even the doctors. ... You can't prove someone guilty on speculation.\"\n\nAfter nearly two decades, Hook had blood samples from the car door retested using newer DNA technology.\n\nThe results indicated two separate profiles, neither of which matched Crane.\n\nHook said the \"crazy result\" does cast doubt on whether police had the right guy and likened it to the JonBenét Ramsey case in Colorado, saying the lack of certainty only deepens people's fascination with the case.\n\n\"If we'd gotten a different result, that would have been expected,\" he said. The unexpected result \"makes it more of an alluring story.\"\n\n'It's always there'\n\nIn his own 2015 book, \"Crane: Sex, Celebrity and my Father's Unsolved Murder,\" Bob Crane Jr. talks about coming to terms with both his father's death as well as his secret life.\n\nBut that's small comfort.\n\n\"I hate the word 'closure,' \" he says. \"It rings so false with me. You move on — you've got to live your life — but it's always there.\"\n\nFor now, he'd just like to be able to have a conversation with his dad. The last time he talked with him was when his father called him to wish him a happy birthday two days before he died.\n\n\"I think about all the things he missed. He loved technology, and he missed out on CDs, cellphones, digital.\n\n\"He would have loved it all, but it wasn't to be. The big question is why? It didn't have to be that way.\"\n\nFive ironies about the Bob Crane case\n\nOne of the last episodes of \"Hogan's Heroes\" was called \"Hogan's Double Life.\" The play Crane was starring in when he died, \"Beginner's Luck,\" was about a man having an extramarital affair. Crane was going through a bitter divorce with his second wife at the time of his death. She had played the commandant's secretary on \"Hogan's Heroes.\" Because the divorce wasn't final, she inherited Crane's estate. The apartment complex where Crane died is now a condo complex with the same name, Winfield Place. Units rarely come on the market, and when they do, they sell quickly. Most residents know of the murder but don't seem to be bothered by it. The Windmill Dinner Theater at Scottsdale Road and Shea Boulevard later became a strip club. It is now an auction house.\n\nREAD MORE:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/03/05/review-red-army-absorbing-look-soviet-hockey-program/24376247/", "title": "Review: 'Red Army' absorbing look at Soviet hockey team", "text": "Bill Goodykoontz\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK\n\n4 stars %28out of 5%29\n\nVyacheslav Fetisov%2C the legendary defenseman%2C proves to be an engaging%2C if difficult%2C subject.\n\nThe system that sustained the Russian team would eventually betray it.\n\nIt's clear about two minutes into \"Red Army,\" Gabe Polsky's absorbing documentary about the Soviet Union hockey team that dominated international play for decades, that this is going to be good.\n\nVyacheslav Fetisov, the legendary defenseman, is on camera, though he obviously doesn't want to be. He ignores Polsky's questions while fiddling with his phone. We don't see Polsky, but we hear him, badgering on, though in a good-natured way. He sounds excited; Fetisov does not.\n\nFinally, he gets a reaction from Fetisov: a raised middle finger.\n\nAnd we're off.\n\nDespite this rocky start, or maybe because of it, Fetisov is an engaging presence throughout the film. In many ways, this is his story, one of sacrifice and skill, grace and toughness. He serves as a kind of stand-in for the system that was so successful, so intrinsically tied to the Soviet system, yet ultimately betrayed by it as it began to unravel.\n\nYet even now, after the fall of communism and the rise of Vladimir Putin, there is no escaping it.\n\nFetisov grew up poor but talented. He was selected for the team coached by Anatoly Tarasov, a chubby grandfather type (at least in pictures) who incorporated chess and ballet into his methods. Tarasov created a swirling, team-first approach that flummoxed opponents.\n\nBut he was eventually replaced by the brutal, KGB-connected Viktor Tikhonov, whose unrelenting methods — the team trained 11 months of the year — wore down the players.\n\nThe biggest disappointment for the team was, of course, the U.S. Olympic team's greatest achievement: the upset win in 1980 at Lake Placid, N.Y. It is a signature moment in American sports. For the Soviets, it was an embarrassment, particularly given hockey's place in Russian life: It was meant as a symbol of superiority over the rest of the world. Tikhonov dumped several players after the defeat. The Soviets would win gold in 1984 and 1988.\n\nBy this time, the National Hockey League was wooing Russian players. When they finally started saying yes, the collapsing Soviet government demanded that they send home large chunks of their salaries. Fetisov resisted for years, then was denied the chance. It would take a face-to-face confrontation with the minister of defense before Fetisov would leave under terms he could live with.\n\nA miserable stint with the New Jersey Devils would lead to a reunion of sorts with other former Soviet players in Detroit, and back-to-back Stanley Cup championships for the Red Wings. Tarasov would have been proud. The Russian players struggled in the hard-hitting NHL game. Only when they reunited and got back to the weaving team play — sublimating the individual for the collective — would they again find success.\n\nIf you've ever wondered why anyone in his right mind with the opportunity to defect wouldn't do so, Polsky offers evidence. In part, KGB goons assigned to travel with the team prevented it, but for someone like Fetisov, it was never an option. He is Russian through and through, his love for his country overshadowing the harsh betrayals communism repeatedly offered.\n\nPolsky keeps things lively, both visually and with his editing. But the sometimes-lighthearted approach never undermines the serious business at hand. It enhances it. Hockey is and always has been more than a game to Fetisov and his teammates, more than even the cliched \"way of life.\" It was their life and, in many ways, still defines them. \"Red Army\" succeeds in large part because Polsky never forgets that the strongest armies are made up of individual soldiers working together, and the Soviet team was a prime example.\n\n'Red Army'\n\n4 stars (out of 5)\n\nDirector: Gabe Polsky.\n\nCast: Vyacheslav Fetisov, Scotty Bowman, Anatoli Karpov.\n\nRating: PG for thematic material and language.\n\nNote: At Harkins Camelview 5.\n\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com.

The CNN Original Series airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET.\n\nCNN —\n\nOver the past 70 years, media mogul Rupert Murdoch built a small Australian family newspaper company into arguably the most powerful conservative media empire in history. With a market cap of $13.50 billion, News Corp is one of the most influential companies on the planet.\n\nThe story behind the ruthless business tactics, political maneuvering and dynastic family battles that have gone into the making of this media powerhouse would be perfect fodder for one of the News Corp news outlets or TV channels, if it were not about Rupert himself. Now, as the seemingly invincible figure advances into his nineties, speculation through the worlds of business, politics and entertainment about who will succeed him as the leader of News Corp has reached a fever pitch.\n\nHere’s a look at who’s who in the potential line of succession and the wider Murdoch clan.\n\nPatriarch\n\nRupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp and co-chairman of 21st Century Fox, at the Sun Valley Resort in 2018. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nRupert Murdoch\n\nAustralian-born Rupert Murdoch, 91, is the media magnate who grew the small newspaper company he inherited from his father in 1952 into News Corporation, Ltd., the multi-billion dollar global media empire with a presence in cable, film, television, internet, satellite, sports, publishing and other fields. At different points the conglomerate has included the newspapers News of the World, the Sun, the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal; Twentieth Century Fox film studio; the Fox Broadcasting network; Fox News Channel; HarperCollins publishing, and the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nMurdoch has been married four times and fathered six children over the course of his seven-decades long career. Several of Murdoch’s children have followed him into the family business. Murdoch’s penchant for pitting the siblings against each other in a years’ long competition to see who will succeed him as head of News Corp is widely believed to be the inspiration for the popular HBO series, “Succession.”\n\nMurdoch’s ruthlessness extends far beyond his family circle. Early in his career he developed the tactic of confronting competition by buying them or running them out of business. Dealings at his British tabloid papers came under scrutiny in 2011 when it was discovered reporters were hacking the phones of royals, celebrities, and crime victims to get their stories. The Murdoch family brand made headlines again when Fox News Channel CEO Roger Ailes was forced to resign amid sexual harassment allegations in 2016.\n\nMurdoch still holds the top post at News Corp, the second incarnation of the now defunct News Corporation which broke up into two companies in 2013. It is unclear who will lead the company when he passes.\n\nPotential Heirs\n\nLachlan Murdoch in 2018. Stephanie Keith/Getty Images\n\nLachlan Murdoch\n\nLachlan Murdoch, 50, is Rupert Murdoch’s oldest son with his second wife, Anna. He began learning the family business at a young age through internships at his father’s media outlets. He rose quickly through the executive ranks and by 1997 had become chairman and chief executive of News Ltd. At the time, his father described Lachlan as his heir apparent, “the first among equals.” His ascension continued smoothly until 2005. That year, Lachlan abruptly quit his executive positions at News Corporation after a battle with Ailes over the direction of the cable news network – effectively taking himself off the heir apparent track. Lachlan then launched his own investment company, Illyria Pty, in Australia. After an extended absence, Lachlan returned to the family business in 2014 and resumed his position as a potential heir to the empire, becoming CEO of Fox Broadcasting and executive chairman at 21st Century Fox. Shortly after, Lachlan’s younger brother James was tapped to be CEO of 21st Century Fox in a power-sharing experiment orchestrated by Rupert between the brothers. The experiment proved unsuccessful, and Rupert sold 21st Century Fox to Disney in 2019. Lachlan now holds the roles of executive chair and CEO of Fox Corporation and co-chairman of News Corp, as well as executive chairman of NOVA Entertainment, an Australian media company.\n\nJames Murdoch in 2019. Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\n\nJames Murdoch\n\nJames Murdoch, 49, is Rupert Murdoch’s fourth child and second son with his second wife, Anna. James’ early career choices was at odds with his father’s conservative newspaper empire. He dropped out of Harvard in 1995 to start his own hip-hop record label, Rawkus Records. After several years, he transitioned into executive roles within News Corporation and assumed the role of corporate company man. After Lachlan quit Fox in 2005, James was increasingly seen as the new heir apparent to his father.\n\nIn 2007, James became chairman of BSkyB. In 2011, he was named deputy COO of News Corporation, and chairman and CEO of News International. But as James was climbing to new heights within the empire, the company became engulfed in scandal when investigators and journalists discovered staff at some Murdoch tabloids in Britain had been hacking the phones of public figures and crime victims to get their stories. James was forced to step down as chairman of BSkyB as a result.\n\nAfter several years hiatus, he rejoined the family business, eventually becoming chairman of Sky and CEO of 21st Century Fox, co-leading the company with older brother Lachlan, who served as executive chairman. The joint leadership arrangement didn’t work out, and James left 21st Century Fox in 2019 when the company was sold to Disney, and then left Sky when majority control was acquired by Comcast. Long known as the lone liberal of the Murdoch clan, James’ political differences with his family came to a head and he resigned from the board of News Corp in 2020, writing at the time, “My resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.”\n\nElisabeth Murdoch at the British Fashion Awards 2016 in London. Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nElisabeth Murdoch\n\nElisabeth Murdoch, 53, is Rupert Murdoch’s second child, the first he had with second wife Anna Murdoch. Elisabeth began her training in the family business early with internships and entry level jobs at Murdoch properties. In 1996 she became managing director of Sky Networks at BSkyB. But several years later she was passed over for the role of chief executive at Sky.\n\nRupert considers Elisabeth to be most like him, but he has been more dismissive of her attempts to take the throne, saying at one point she’d have to figure out how many children she wanted to have before planning further advancement at the company. In 2000 she left the family business and went on to found Shine, one of the UK’s biggest independent production companies with shows like “The Biggest Loser,” “Master Chef,” and “History Cold Case.”\n\nWhen News Corporation acquired Shine in 2011, Elisabeth attempted to take a seat on the News Corporation board, but scrutiny over the phone hacking scandal prevented that from happening. She left Shine after a merger with two other production companies. In 2019 she established a new production company, Sister, and in 2021 Sister funded the opening of a London branch of Ghetto Film School, a non-profit program geared toward introducing young people of color to the entertainment industry.\n\nWives\n\nPatricia Booker\n\nRupert Murdoch and his first wife, Patricia Booker, a former department store model and flight attendant, married in 1956. She gave birth to his first child, a daughter named Prudence, two years later.

A few months after his divorce from Patricia, Rupert and Anna married. They had three children together, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James, now the main contenders to be heir of the Murdoch empire. Over the years Anna published several novels, one of which featured a family that bore a striking resemblance to her own. She spent three decades raising their family and acting as Rupert’s loyal partner on the world stage. In the mid-1990’s, as Rupert approached conventional retirement age, Anna hoped his relentless drive to build the empire would subside, and he’d spend more time with her enjoying their golden years. Rupert was completely opposed to that idea. The disagreement led to an irreconcilable rift, and the two divorced in 1999, after 31 years of marriage.\n\nRupert Murdoch and his wife Wendi Murdoch at the Oscars in 2013.\n\nWendi Deng\n\nDeng, 53, Rupert Murdoch’s third wife, is mother of his two youngest children Grace Murdoch, 20, and Chloe Murdoch, 18. Wendi met Rupert when she was working at his Star TV network in Hong Kong. The up-and-comer immediately charmed the media mogul; one former colleague said, “She was always someone who was going to do well. We just didn’t realize how well.” They married in June 1999, two years after meeting and only 17 days after Rupert’s divorce with his second wife Anna was finalized. Wendi grew to be one of Rupert’s closest advisers and confidantes, but his older children opposed the marriage and viewed Wendi as a potential competitor for control of the Murdoch empire. But after 14 years the marriage fell apart amid allegations of Wendi’s infidelity, on which she has declined to comment.\n\nRupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall leaving St Brides Church after their wedding on March 5, 2016 in London, England.

Oh, that and more than 670 episodes, a record for a scripted prime-time series.\n\nThe 30th anniversary of \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire,” which premiered Dec. 17, 1989, is the latest milestone for the Fox animated classic, a culture-shaping series spawned by animated shorts that began as shorts two years earlier on “The Tracey Ullman Show.”\n\nMatt Groening's creation, centered around Homer and Marge Simpson and their three children, Bart, Lisa and Maggie, hit the rarefied air of 500 episodes in 2012 and joined “Gunsmoke” as only the second series to reach 600 four years later.\n\nIt finally surpassed that classic Western's 635 episodes in 2018 – commemorated with a black-and-white illustration of Homer and baby daughter Maggie dueling Marshal Matt Dillon. (FXX celebrates the 30th anniversary with a 15-day marathon of 661 episodes from the first 30 seasons that started Tuesday at 8 EST/PST.)\n\nIn a 2007 interview, Groening reflected on the broad and enduring appeal of the comedy, which helped make the Fox network: \"I love the style that we stumbled into, this high-velocity pacing that allowed us to do every kind of comedy we could think of, from the most highfalutin literary references to sub-Three Stooges physical abuse.\"\n\nAlthough \"The Simpsons,\" recipient of 34 Emmys, is years past peak cultural dominance and many fans profess their love for the early seasons vs. the later ones, new episodes perform well for Fox and the show's library serves as a major selling point for the Disney+ streaming service. It's renewed through its 32nd season in 2021, which would bring the tally to more than 700 episodes.\n\n'The Simpsons' nears 30: Why the show's first Christmas episode is still a fan favorite\n\nWith that in mind, USA TODAY (or “US of A TODAY,” as referenced on “The Simpsons”) takes a trip down Evergreen Terrace with a sampling of significant moments (OK, it’s our version of a “Simpsons” clip show).\n\n1989: The 'birth' of the show\n\n“Simpsons Roasting” is the only episode broadcast in the 1980s. (Weekly episodes started Jan. 14, 1990, with “Bart the Genius.”)\n\n“I love that above all else,” executive producer James L. Brooks said of the Christmas kickoff. “It was our birth, as far as I’m concerned.\"\n\n“The Simpsons” has maintained that connection over the years with memorable gift ideas – remember Bonestorm and Funzo! – and holiday-themed episodes, including this season's “Bobby, It’s Cold Outside,” which includes another \"Simpsons\" evergreen, the unholy Sideshow Bob (Kelsey Grammer). Believe it or not, “Holidays of Future Passed,” now 8 years old, was once considered a potential series finale.\n\n1991: Celebrity cameos become popular\n\nDustin Hoffman, credited as Sam Etic, voiced Lisa’s substitute teacher in “Lisa’s Substitute,” an early celebrity cameo in what became a sign of making it in Hollywood. The guest list includes three Beatles, two Rolling Stones and The Who (but not in a pear tree).\n\n1994: 100 episodes\n\n“The Simpsons” reached the 100-episode plateau, long TV's yardstick of endurance. But this show was just getting started.\n\nPlaying favorites:Who's Matt Groening's favorite 'Simpsons' character?\n\nGroening explained his confidence about the early prospects of a show that already had spawned viral catchphrases (“Eat My Shorts”), a zillion tie-in products and condemnation by President Bush (the first one; that’s how far back this goes): \"I knew if we could get on the air with weird yellow people that kids would tune in, and that their parents would watch with them.\"\n\n1995: Going 'three for three'\n\n“Treehouse of Horror,” an annual Halloween tradition, stands out for its sixth entry (Advertising mascots come to life, Groundskeeper Willie channels Freddy Krueger, Homer goes 3D), according to former head writer Mike Reiss, author of 2018's \"Springfield Confidential.\"\n\n\"Almost always one of the three installments on a ‘Treehouse of Horror’ is not so good. ... That was the first time I thought they went three for three, three really amazing segments.\"\n\n\"Treehouse XXV\" in 2013 may have one-upped the earlier installment with a dazzling opening salute to fantasy and horror by renowned director Guillermo del Toro.\n\n2000: 250 episodes and speculation\n\nMore than 400 episodes ago, when “The Simpsons” cracked 250, Groening already was answering speculative questions about the show’s eventual conclusion. \"I thought we would start and then live forever. But that's how I feel about life, which obviously is untrue.\"\n\nThe cartoon, which showcased boy rebel Bart early on, had long shifted to a Homeric focus. \"There's a lot more you can do with a grown man than you can with a 10-year-old boy,\" said Mike Scully, then overseeing the show.\n\n2003: 300 episodes\n\nAs the odometer hit 300, USA TODAY published a two-page report – “300 reasons to love ‘The Simpsons’” – that listed, among other things, 35 couch gags and 50 of Bart’s chalkboard declarations.\n\n2007 and 2008: A movie and a theme-park ride\n\nSpringfield residents made their big-screen debut with “The Simpsons Movie,” a critical and box-office hit that pulled in more than $500 million worldwide. After years of making fun of Disney, \"Simpsons\" producers have talked with the entertainment giant, which took over the show with its purchase of Fox assets, about a potential second movie or spinoff series.\n\nA year after the movie, plans for world dominance continued as “The Simpsons Ride” opened at Universal Studios Orlando.\n\n2012: 500 episodes\n\n“The Simpsons” hit 500 episodes, a prime-time feat previously achieved only by Matt Dillon’s lawman and a dog, “Lassie.”\n\n2015: Springfield comes to life\n\nAfter a smaller version opened in Orlando, Universal Studios Hollywood unveiled “The Simpsons’ Springfield,” complete with a steam-spewing nuclear plant; Moe’s Tavern; Dr. Nick’s clinic (“If you can put it in, we can take it out.”) and a Krusty Burger offering the Ribwich, that fabled sandwich made with “authentic letter-graded meat.”\n\nLongtime executive producer Al Jean was pleasantly surprised by the food quality. \"On the show, Krusty Burger is literally the worst restaurant of all time.\"\n\n2016: Homer takes calls – live\n\nSeeking to stretch, an episode featured a few minutes of Homer (Dan Castellaneta) answering viewer phone calls live with the help of motion-capture technology.\n\n2017: A stereotype sparks criticism\n\nComedian Hari Kondabolu critiques Kwik-E-Mart operator Apu Nahasapeemapetilon as an Indian stereotype in his documentary, \"The Problem with Apu.\"\n\nWhile many past shows have been criticized for depicting characters in insensitive or offensive ways, most of those are out of production, with plots and characters encased in amber. “The Simpsons” confirmed in August its commitment to keeping Apu (voiced by Hank Azaria) in response to reports it was writing the character out of the show.\n\n2018: A record-breaking 636 episodes\n\nAs “The Simpsons” passed “Gunsmoke” for the episode record, Groening reflected on the show’s history.\n\n“When we first started, we were part of the downfall of civilization. Bart said he was ‘an underachiever and proud of it, man.’ Simpsons T-shirts were banned in grade schools. I knew it would blow over,” he said. “At the heart of our show is a churchgoing family who eats dinner together every night and is very traditional. They drive each other crazy, but they do love each other.”\n\nAs for whether anything might be left on a “Simpsons” bucket list, Groening went along with the pie-in-the-sky (mmm, pie) question: “We need our own full theme park. We've got some rides and a Krusty Burger at Universal, but we need a 600-foot-tall statue of Homer at the center of a park. … And you eat dinner in his head.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/08/03/db-cooper-letters-decoded-indiana-veteran-thomas-colbert-point-robert-rackstraw/774858002/", "title": "D.B. Cooper: Letters decoded by veteran point to Robert Rackstraw", "text": "WHEATFIELD, Ind. — It was the incongruous string of numbers in a 1971 letter that first attracted Rick Sherwood.\n\n717171684*\n\n\"The numbers,\" he explained, \"just didn't belong.\"\n\nAnd he couldn’t let it go.\n\nSo, for hour after hour last winter, Sherwood, 70, sat in his man cave trying to puzzle out a solution to one of America’s most enduring pop culture mysteries: Who was the brazen skyjacker that parachuted from a jet with $200,000 in 1971, the fabled outlaw known to the world as D.B. Cooper?\n\nSherwood believes he found the answer that has stumped the FBI for 47 years. He says it was hidden in the 1971 letter and another allegedly written by the hijacker in 1972.\n\nThe D.B. Cooper mystery:Everything you need to know about the hijacking, the money and the letters\n\nWho is D.B. Cooper? Here are 11 possible suspects, including some who falsely confessed\n\nThe Army veteran who worked with codes during the Vietnam War says he reckoned it out in his cedar-lined room surrounded by an antique Rock-Ola jukebox, a leather sofa and a row of windows looking out on the pastures, trees and cornfields behind his home about 20 miles south of Valparaiso.\n\nNow, he and Thomas J. Colbert, author of a 2016 book about the Cooper mystery called The Last Master Outlaw, are preparing to show how the code was cracked. Sherwood’s numeric calculations bolster Colbert's book, which identified the same former military pilot as the culprit: Robert Rackstraw. Colbert has copyrighted the code decryptions. More details will be revealed Wednesday.\n\nRobert Rackstraw won't say he did it, won't say he didn't\n\nNewspaper accounts from the 1970s reveal Rackstraw was among the potential suspects the FBI investigated, but the California man was apparently cleared in the 1980s.\n\nRackstraw is the obvious person to debunk Sherwood's finding. But in a seven-minute phone conversation with IndyStar, he continued the cat-and-mouse game he's played for more than 35 years. At times over that period, it’s been clear to other interviewers that Rackstraw relished the attention and notoriety that comes with being associated with Cooper.\n\nRackstraw was a highly decorated Vietnam veteran and pilot with parachute training. He left the Army in 1971, just months before the hijacking. In the years that followed his life included a series of ups and downs. He was accused, and acquitted, of killing his stepfather and later stole an airplane and faked a crash to escape an embezzlement trial. But he later earned a law degree and taught in the University of California system.\n\nIn the brief conversation with IndyStar, Rackstraw declined four direct requests to deny claims by Colbert and Sherwood that he is the hijacker known as Cooper.\n\n\"Don't get down to the bottom line,\" he groused shortly before hanging up after being asked why he wouldn't just say he isn't Cooper.\n\n\"That's a 40 million dollar question for Christ's sake.\"\n\nAnd Sherwood, who has no law enforcement training, and had not used his knowledge of codes in decades, seems an unlikely person to have answered it.\n\nWhether he's right or not remains to be seen.\n\nThe FBI, which identified and cleared more than 1,000 suspects, closed its investigation into America's only unsolved hijacking in 2016 and is not likely to take another look at Rackstraw.\n\nWhen announcing the case was closed, the bureau said it appreciated \"the immense number of tips provided by members of the public,\" but is now interested only in two pieces of evidence from citizen-sleuths attracted to the Cooper mystery: the parachutes used by Cooper or some of the ransom money.\n\nAn Army veteran from Indiana gets involved\n\nSherwood's dive into the D.B. Cooper case started with a phone call out of the blue in 2015. It came from Colbert. Sherwood was skeptical as he listened to the stranger who claimed to be an author and movie producer.\n\n\"He said, 'Are you Rick Sherwood?' And I said, 'Yeah, who’s calling?' He says, 'My name’s Tom Colbert. I’m investigating the D. B. Cooper case and blah, blah, blah,'\" Sherwood recalled. \"And I’m going, 'Oh yeah, right.' In fact, it was true.\"\n\nColbert had already zeroed in on Rackstraw as he was wrapping up work on his 2016 book. He enlisted Sherwood's help while looking for Vietnam vets who may have encountered Rackstraw in the service. Sherwood was among more than a dozen men from Rackstraw's unit that Colbert contacted to assist his \"cold-case\" team.\n\n\"He wanted to find somebody that was in the 371st and had dealt with Rackstraw,\" Sherwood said.\n\nThe Gary native wasn't any help with that.\n\nSherwood said he doesn't believe he ever met Rackstraw, but it's likely they communicated by radio. Rackstraw filled in briefly as a helicopter pilot with the mission Sherwood was assigned to from 1968 until 1970, when he concluded his 26-month tour of duty in Vietnam and returned to the states.\n\nLike many Americans, Sherwood was aware of the daring 1971 hijacking.\n\n\"I knew they gave him some parachutes, and he got a bunch of money,\" Sherwood said. \"That's all I knew.\"\n\nBut things changed after Sherwood took the call from Colbert. Even though he hadn't directly encountered Rackstraw, Sherwood and Colbert talked several times over the next few months. Those conversations led to Colbert mentioning Sherwood several times in his book, in passages describing the war-time conditions and the nature of the then-secret mission called Left Bank. During his enlistment, Sherwood said he worked in radio communications with pilots using encoded messages. The unit also attempted to capture and decipher encoded enemy messages.\n\nSherwood's contact with Colbert piqued his interest in the Cooper case, but it would be another two years before Sherwood stumbled onto an internet post about one of the letters the hijacker allegedly wrote after the crime. There was something about the letter's wording that perplexed Sherwood. And there was that nine-digit number and asterisk that didn't seem to fit.\n\nHe called Colbert and asked about the letter. He also asked Colbert if he knew what the number meant. Colbert said he didn't think anyone knew.\n\nSherwood wondered if the number could somehow be the key to a code. Suddenly, he found himself drawn even deeper into the enduring mystery that has spawned scores of books, movies and theories about the man behind the hijacking.\n\nSherwood goes 'overboard' trying to decode the letters\n\nTo family and others who know Sherwood well, its no surprise he would wind up neck-deep in the decades-old mystery. Sherwood admits he's always ready for a challenge, even if its only the crossword puzzle in the Sunday newspaper.\n\n\"I just kind of go overboard doing things,\" he said.\n\nStepping up to a challenge, in fact, has been a common theme in Sherwood's life. He enrolled in a difficult Army intelligence training program after a recruiter told him he didn't have what it took to do the work. After the war, he reinvented himself when the job he expected to hold for a lifetime disappeared in the steel industry downturn. When he couldn't find a U.S. flag after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, what did he do? He built a 30-by-20 flag out of scrap metal and 22,000 lights.\n\nOne thing he never expected, however, was a return to the work he'd done with codes in the Army.\n\n\"To be absolutely honest with you, I never thought I'd ever have to use Morse Code or any of the codes that I was trained on ever again,\" Sherwood said as he sat at one of two tables in the center of his man cave. He built the addition on the back of his home. It was supposed to be a deck, but morphed into a screened-in porch. And when his wife said she wanted windows? Well, Sherwood took up that challenge, too.\n\nOn the tables are neat stacks of papers and file folders. They include copies of the post-hijacking letters allegedly written by Cooper. There also are dozens of pages of handwritten notes Sherwood has made, along with numeric calculations that harken back to his days in the Army. There is also a Playboy magazine. Its from June 1970. The Playmate of the Year issue.\n\nSherwood said he spent hours over several weeks at the table last winter going over what's come to be known as \"letter five.\" The typed letter from the FBI's Cooper file was released to Colbert last year through a Freedom of Information Act request. It has an FBI evidence stamp dated Dec.17, 1971.\n\nCopies of the letter were sent to the Washington Post, New York Times, Seattle Times and Los Angeles Times. The tone is taunting. \"I knew from the start that I wouldn't be caught,\" it begins.\n\nBut there was no explanation for the string of numbers — 717171684*. As Sherwood pored over the letter, he also wondered why all the newspaper names had been written out, except for the \"Wash Post.\" And why had the writer marked the four copied sources with \"ccccccc?\"\n\nNumbers and repeated words help crack the code\n\nAware of and hoping to confirm Colbert's focus on Rackstraw, Sherwood set to work looking for hidden message that would link the letter to Rackstraw. Colbert said he, too, was anxiously awaiting the results of Sherwood's sleuthing.\n\n\"I think it took me two weeks, just hour after hour,\" Sherwood said. \"I was going through everything I could possibly think of.\"\n\nFinally, he called Colbert back.\n\n\"I said 'I need at least another set of numbers so I can correlate one to the other,'\" Sherwood said.\n\nColbert found a second set of numbers on a copy of the letter that had been sent to the Los Angeles Times. He passed it to Sherwood, but it didn't help.\n\nSherwood's wife, Cheryl, recalled heading to bed alone many of those nights as her husband stayed at his table covered with papers.\n\n\"He would spend hours and hours and hours out there ...,\" she said. \"I kept telling him, I go, 'You keep running this heater, you're going to cost us a fortune.'\"\n\nFinally, Sherwood said, he gave up trying to use the two long strings of numbers to find some correlation to the alphabet. Instead he focused on the first number itself from the Washington Post letter. That's when, Sherwood said, he had his first \"a-ha\" moment.\n\nCould the 717171 mean the 371st, the unit he and Rackstraw were both attached to briefly?\n\n\"When the 371st come up, I seen that, I'm going 'Yes, this is it. This is the beginning of breaking that code.\"\n\nUsing a simple letter counting system, Sherwood said he found other clues that pointed to Rackstraw. From the \"ccccccc\" he deciphered \"Army Security Agency\" and from \"Wash Post\" he found \"Top Secret.\"\n\nWhen he notified Colbert, the author was elated. He also had another challenge for Sherwood.\n\n\"You're not done yet, Rick,\" Sherwood recalled Colbert telling him. \"I've got three or four other letters that have been out there all this time.\"\n\nA hidden message: 'I am 1st LT Robert Rackstraw'\n\nColbert sent the other four letters and it didn't take nearly as long for Sherwood to find what he believed were hidden messages in each of them. He said all four letters included messages using slight variations on the code he'd used.\n\nThe old Playboy magazine also helped him. One of the Cooper letters was written with letters cut out from a copy of the magazine. But there were just too many letters, Sherwood determined, to make sense of.\n\nA niece obtained a copy of the magazine from a friend and Sherwood saw the name of the centerfold. When he subtracted the letters from her name, he said, things started making more sense. Sherwood and Colbert said it appeared the hijacker was sending a message to accomplices who helped him escape after the hijacking.\n\nBut it wasn't until June that Sherwood said he found the mother lode in another letter the FBI released in May.\n\n\"I read it two or three times and got back on the phone and told Tom, 'This is Rackstraw.' I said, 'This is his M.O. This is how he writes. He's taunting. He's doing everything like he's done in these other letters.'\"\n\nColbert's response was direct: \"Can you break the code?\"\n\nSherwood went back to work at his tables in the man cave.\n\n\"A couple weeks later,\" he said, \"I had that one.\"\n\nHe had suspected the author had hidden his name in the final letter — and he believes he found it. Sherwood said he uncovered secret messages by keying in on repeated words and phrases, then applying his knowledge of codes.\n\nFirst, he focused on a line that says \"and please tell the lackey cops, D.B. Cooper is not my real name.\" Sherwood said it hides the coded message \"I am 1st LT Robert Rackstraw.\"\n\nAnother line that includes the phrase \"through good ole Unk\" goes to the heart of the crime, Sherwood said. He contends it actually says \"I want out of the system and saw a way by skyjacking a jet plane.\"\n\nSherwood admitted he could be wrong — finding what he wanted to because he was working from the assumption the letters were the work of Rackstraw. But he thinks there is just too much for it to be coincidence or wishful thinking gone awry.\n\nRobert Rackstraw: From war hero to murder suspect\n\nColbert's book paints Rackstraw as disillusioned and vengeful after being forced out of the military for alleged misconduct. It also describes a man with the training, skills, moxie and motive to pull off the daring crime — and to survive a nighttime jump from the Boeing 727.\n\nRackstraw had a history of minor scrapes with the law as a young man, but things got serious when he was accused of the embezzling thousands of dollars in a check-kiting scam. Before his trial, newspaper accounts from the 1970s reveal, Rackstraw fled the U.S. for Iran.\n\nWhen he was returned to the U.S. in early 1978, Rackstraw faced a new charge. He was accused of murdering his stepfather. It was during that time that two local investigators in Stockton, California, alerted the FBI to Rackstraw as a possible Cooper suspect.\n\nRackstraw was acquitted of the murder in the summer of 1978, but fled authorities again before an October hearing in the embezzlement case. Newspaper accounts say he rented a small airplane and claimed in a fake May Day radio transmission that he was crashing into Monterey Bay. He was taken back into custody in Southern California in January 1979.\n\nA headline in the Reno Gazette on Feb. 9, 1979, said Rackstraw offered a \"tongue-in-cheek denial\" to claims he was Cooper during a jailhouse interview.\n\n\"You want me to say I'm not D.B. Cooper — okay, I'm not D.B. Cooper,\" Rackstraw told reporters for Gannett News Service. The story said \"it is obvious that Robert Wesley Rackstraw delights in tantalizing reporters and authorities alike with another obscure hint in the 1971 skyjacking case ...\" It added Rackstraw \"clearly enjoyed his role as the newest focal point of speculation about the case.\"\n\nRobert Rackstraw calls D.B. Cooper sleuths 'fake news'\n\nIn July 1979, Rackstraw was sentenced to two years in prison in the embezzlement case. A probation officer's report prior to the sentencing, the Stockton Record reported, \"punctured (Rackstraw's) self-made image as a war hero.\"\n\nWhile Rackstraw had received numerous medals and commendations, including a Silver Star for valor, a newspaper report revealed he \"was not a Green Beret and that despite his claim of receiving five Purple Hearts, he actually had none and had never even been wounded in combat.\"\n\nRackstraw was released from prison in 1980. His most serious criminal allegations behind him, according to Colbert's book, Rackstraw went on to earn a law degree. In the ensuing years, he taught and worked at a boat shop.\n\nDespite his refusal to directly deny that he is Cooper, Rackstraw told IndyStar that Colbert's claims are \"fake news.\"\n\n\"It was a hurrah movement, I guess, a eureka movement for Colbert grasping at the last straws,\" he said of the recent announcement that Sherwood had cracked the mystery of Cooper's identity.\n\nIn a self-filed motion last year opposing Colbert's request for the FBI to release records from its Cooper files, Rackstraw described himself as a \"Disabled Homeless Veteran.\" But he listed a return address in Coronado, California, a resort city in the San Diego Bay.\n\nHe also listed an email address that starts with \"airbornebob.\" Only Rackstraw knows if that moniker is a reference to his military days nearly five decades earlier, a nod to his role as a one-time Cooper suspect — or something else.\n\nContact Tim Evans at 317-444-6204 or tim.evans@indystar.com.

Similar to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, LBD robs patients of their cognition and motor skills, but typically progresses more quickly, making basic problem-solving and comprehension difficult for those affected.\n\n\"He was the bravest man in the world, playing the hardest role of his life,\" says Schneider Williams, 56, an artist and brain health advocate who serves as vice chair of the American Brain Foundation. \"For someone as brilliant as Robin, who put his heart and soul into his career, to just start losing his abilities ... it was devastating for him to watch what it means to be human slipping through his fingers.\"\n\nBefore Robin Williams' death, it seemed 'he was getting better'\n\nWilliams' last screen roles included 2014's \"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\" and the CBS sitcom \"The Crazy Ones,\" which aired for one season from 2013-2014. While shooting both projects, the actor would frequently forget lines and fumble words. He experienced extreme anxiety as a result, calling his wife and collaborators at all hours of the day and night, worrying that his performances were subpar or unusable.\n\n\"It was getting harder and harder (for him) to get it right, and he was consumed with that,\" Schneider Williams says.\n\nInsecurities crept into his personal life as well. Growing increasingly self-conscious, Williams often chose to stay home rather than meet up with friends or play impromptu comedy shows. The documentary details how he was prone to panic attacks and thrashing in his sleep, and would lie awake for hours with delusional thoughts.\n\nSeveral months before his death, Williams awoke with an unshakable fear that his friend, comedian Mort Sahl, was in grave danger. He tried texting and calling Sahl for hours, and desperately wanted to drive over to Sahl's apartment to make sure he was OK. Schneider Williams repeatedly told her husband that Sahl was fine, and they finally went to sleep around 3:30 a.m.\n\nThe months to follow proved challenging, but Williams seemed to be on the upswing in his final days, his widow says. The comedian had recently moved into a separate bedroom on doctor's orders, and he was sleeping and feeling better. The night before his suicide, he wished her \"Good night, my love,\" and headed into his room to read on his iPad. They had planned to meditate together the next morning, which had become a daily ritual.\n\n\"All signs looked like he was getting better,\" Schneider Williams says. \"We were in the middle of adjusting medications for his Parkinson's and depression, and had just switched a couple of them. It appeared that he was starting to sleep better, and he seemed more engaged and interested in reading. But clearly, that (wasn't the case). Robin's suicide was really a consequence of brain disease; his brain was so compromised. I look at it like, Robin wanted to end the disease – he just didn't realize that meant he would end, too.\"\n\nSpeculation about his suicide was 'devastating' for loved ones\n\nImmediately following Williams' suicide, media reports speculated why he might have taken his own life, blaming depression, financial troubles, and his past struggles with substance abuse.\n\n\"That was pretty devastating,\" Schneider Williams says. \"I just blocked it out as best I could because I had to deal with things that were far more important in the moment. And that was getting to the bottom of what Robin and I had just gone through.\"\n\nWilliams' three kids – Zak, 37, with first wife Valerie Velardi; and Zelda, 31, and Cody, 28, with second wife Marsha Garces – do not appear in \"Robin's Wish.\"\n\nRachel Karten, a spokesperson for Williams' children, confirms to USA TODAY that they declined to participate in the film.\n\n\"We had these really intense conversations with some people on their end and eventually they were like, ‘This is all too much new information for us to be a part of,'\" director Tylor Norwood says. \"I didn't leave with the sense that they were against it.\"\n\nSchneider Williams hasn't been in touch with any of his children. (They settled a legal battle over his estimated $100 million estate out of court in 2015.)\n\n\"We've all moved on and I wish them well,\" she says. \"I'm not aware whether they've seen the film. I hope they get a chance to eventually. I can understand where that might be hard.\"\n\nFor her, it's still too difficult to watch any of Williams' work. But she finds comfort in the strides that have been made in LBD research, and hopes to carry on her late husband's mission of spreading comfort to others.\n\nTwo years before his death, \"Robin and I were discussing what we wanted our legacy to be in life,\" Schneider Williams remembers. \"Without missing a beat, he said, 'I want to help people be less afraid.' And I said, 'Robin, that's amazing, honey, because you're already doing that. That's your special superpower.' \"\n\nIf you or someone you know may be struggling with suicidal thoughts, you can call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) any time day or night or chat online.\n\nCrisis Text Line also provides free, 24/7, confidential support via text message to people in crisis when they dial 741741.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2020/04/20/peter-guber-warriors-not-get-doc-like-1997-98-bulls/5169480002/", "title": "Why Golden State Warriors won't have a documentary similar to ...", "text": "As part of the team’s ownership group, Peter Guber has a window into the Golden State Warriors’ dynasty. As part of the group that produced “The Last Dance” documentary, Guber also has a window into the Chicago Bulls’ dynasty.\n\nTherefore, it is not surprising that Guber considered the Warriors as a possible documentary subject as they eventually won three NBA titles in five seasons.\n\nGuber, the Warriors’ co-executive chairman and founder of Mandalay Entertainment, told USA TODAY Sports he had varying talks in recent years with business partner Mike Tollin, as well as with Warriors majority owner Joe Lacob, and Warriors president and chief operating officer Rick Welts about the idea. The Warriors decided against having a camera crew embedded with the Warriors as the Bulls allowed during the 1997-98 NBA season to capture their sixth NBA championship in eight years.\n\n“Once you do that, you actually affect the outcome of other things,” Guber said. “Turning the camera on with an expectation that you’re going to get to a particular point with a sports team or career or something like that? It’s a dangerous business. It’s hubris.”\n\n'THE LAST DANCE':Takeaways from first episodes of documentary on Michael Jordan and Bulls\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nMJ ON 1980s BULLS:Michael Jordan addressed time he walked out of drug-fueled Bulls party as a rookie\n\nDREAM TEAM JERSEY:Michael Jordan's game-worn 1992 Olympics jersey sells for $216K\n\nThe Warriors credentialed Andy Thompson, the vice president of content production for NBA Entertainment, and his camera crew during the team’s five consecutive trips to the NBA Finals (2015-2019) and for other marquee playoff and regular-season games. NBA Entertainment has that arrangement for all Finals teams so it can produce a championship movie about the winning team. But they were not given access to Warriors practices, coaches meetings and the trainers’ room as the Bulls allowed in the 1997-98 season.\n\nAs USA TODAY Sports and other outlets reported, the Bulls gave NBA Entertainment that access because of varying conditions. The Bulls had already announced that coach Phil Jackson would leave following the 1997-98 season, a development that made Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen to admit Jackson’s eventual departure would coincide with theirs. Jordan agreed on the access so long as he retained authority on when or if the footage would ever be released.\n\nGuber, who was part of an ownership group with Lacob that purchased the Warriors for $450 million in 2010, noted the Warriors had no sense on when their championship window would begin and end. Therefore, they opted against having a similar setup.\n\n“You have to let [coach] Steve Kerr, [general manager] Bob Myers and the players build their culture and their organization, and hope that it will emerge into a really unique enterprise and success,” Guber said. “Then you go back and try to paint the painting of it with a film or documentary afterwards, rather than say, ‘Let’s capture it now because we’re going to win nine championships in a row or something like that.’ I don’t think you can do that. I don’t think that's a good undertaking. It will affect what you are doing.”\n\nRegardless, a Warriors documentary would presumably spark plenty of interest.\n\nThe Warriors became the second team in NBA history along with the Boston Celtics to appear in five consecutive NBA Finals. The Warriors developed a team-oriented culture that featured two of the NBA’s best shooters (Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson) an intense defender (Draymond Green) and a former All-Star turned reserve that won the 2015 Finals MVP (Andre Iguodala). After eclipsing the 1995-96 Bulls’ regular-season record (73-9), the Warriors squandered 3-1 series lead to Cleveland in the 2016 NBA Finals. The Warriors then signed free-agent Kevin Durant, who fielded criticism for leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder while helping the Warriors win two more NBA titles with two Finals MVP performances.\n\n“The chemistry that makes that all work is incredibly elusive,” Guber said. “You put the same type of people together in a different year, and it doesn’t work. Health plays such a role in it.”\n\nTherefore, the Warriors lost to Toronto in the 2019 NBA Finals partly because of two significant ailments. Durant injured his right Achilles tendon in Game 5 after missing the previous 14 playoff games with a strained right calf. In a decisive Game 6 loss, Thompson then tore the ACL in his left knee and stayed sidelined all of next season.\n\nDurant then left for Brooklyn as a free agent after fielding frustration all season about speculation about his future, which partly led to an argument with Green. The Warriors traded Iguodala to Memphis in a cost-cutting move, and key reserve Shaun Livingston retired. Curry then injured his left hand in the fourth game of the season, an injury that sidelined him for 58 games. The Warriors were in last place (15-50) before the NBA suspended the season on March 11.\n\n“I saw it. I lived it. I experience it and participated in it,” said Guber, who is auctioning off his 2015 championship ring with all the proceeds supporting Feeding America, Meals On Wheels, World Central Kitchen and No Kid Hungry. “It was one slip of an Achilles heel, one turn of an ankle or one argument on a court. That changes the chemistry, the action, the drama and the narrative. It’s a four-letter word called life. That’s why documentaries are compelling.”\n\n'FORMER CHICAGO RESIDENT':'The Last Dance' viewers delight in Barack Obama chyron\n\nTIM FLOYD:Coach who replaced Phil Jackson offers insight on 'The Last Dance'\n\nBOB KNIGHT:Coach called Michael Jordan 'best basketball player I've ever seen play' long before most\n\nThat is why “The Last D” documentary is compelling. In the first two episodes, the documentary captures Jordan berating teammates in practice and belittling GM Jerry Krause in front of the team. It weaves together footage of Jordan’s rise at North Carolina and in the NBA along with Jordan’s final season with the Bulls. It features exclusive interviews with 105 people, including Jordan and major characters with the Bulls. The NBA said the first two episodes drew an average of 6.1 million viewers, which the league said is the most-viewed ever for an ESPN documentary.\n\n“It’s the 34th time I’ve seen it. They’re just as good,” Guber said. \"The most important thing is that after 20 years, Michael Jordan permitted this to be done. So we got lucky. But the idea is that you still have to make a story and a narrative that is compelling and feels fresh and engaging. I think all of our folks did that. I’m very pleased.”\n\nFor more than 35 years, Guber -- who is also a co-owner of baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers and Major League Soccer's Los Angeles FC -- has become involved with various movie projects as the founder of Mandalay Entertainment, chairman and CEO of Sony Entertainment and Polygram Entertainment as well as the president of Columbia Pictures. With those various stints, Guber has overseen projects including \"Rain Man,\" \"Batman,\" \"The Color Purple,\" \"Midnight Express,\" \"Gorillas in the Mist,\" \"Soul Surfer,\" \"The Kids Are All Right,\" \"Bernie,\" \"Donnie Brasco,\" \"Sleepy Hollow\" and \"Afterburn.\" His projects have received a combined 50 Academy Award nominations. So, as Guber noted, “this is not my first rodeo.”\n\nThompson, Tollin and Jason Hehir (director) played larger roles in the project. Hehir interviewed Jordan three times for a combined eight hours after working with Jordan’s advisors, Estee Portnoy and Curtis Polk. But Guber played a valuable role in other ways. Guber helped arrange other interviews, including Kerr and Miami Heat president Pat Riley. Guber had ongoing conversations with the late NBA Commissioner David Stern and current NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who oversaw NBA Entertainment during the Bulls' 1997-98 season. Guber also gave feedback after watching the various rough drafts.\n\n“You think you just stick the camera in front of people and they talk? That’s not what really good filmmaking is about. It’s about letting the involvement of the narrative emerge in the process and shaping the participants so there is a point of view,” Guber said. “It really reveals not just the aptitude of Michael Jordan, but the attitude of Michael Jordan. It had such a powerful effect on everyone in the arena. Not only his team, but the ownership and management and the fans. That is what makes the film so revealing and interesting.”\n\nThe film focused on the Bulls’ attempt to win their third consecutive NBA title for a second time, Jordan’s dominance, Dennis Rodman’s unpredictability and ongoing tension among Jackson, Jordan and Pippen with the late Bulls general manager Jerry Krause. ESPN will air two additional episodes of the 10-part series every Sunday for the next month. At some point, it seems inevitable the comparisons between the Bulls and Warriors’ dynasties will emerge. Guber argued it is an impossible comparison to make.\n\n“There wasn’t a 3-point shot back then that dominated the game,” Guber said. “Big guys played a different role in the game. The whole evolvement of ESPN and television and broadcast of sports has become so much more complex in the last five, seven and 15 years. All of that plays a part.”\n\nPerhaps a future filmmaker addresses that material and more in a future Warriors documentary.\n\n“Hopefully,” Guber said. “That’s for others to tell.”\n\nFollow USA TODAY NBA writer Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/health/encanto-therapy-immigration-wellness-cec/index.html", "title": "'Encanto': Therapists ARE talking about Bruno -- and other ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: This story contains spoilers for “Encanto,” which is currently in theaters and streaming on Disney+.\n\nCNN —\n\nKadesha Adelakun bought toys from “Encanto” before she even had a chance to see the movie.\n\nShe knew characters from a multiracial Afro-Latino family would be an important addition to her office in Kennesaw, Georgia, where she holds play therapy sessions and makes a point of finding toys that reflect the diversity of her young patients’ lives.\n\nWhen she finally watched the movie on Disney+, Adelakun realized the figurines were an even better fit than she’d imagined. The plot of “Encanto,” she says, perfectly captures issues many families are going through.\n\n“There are so many layers, so many dynamics,” Adelakun says.\n\nWhile catchy songs from “Encanto” are topping the charts, Disney’s latest animated film is drawing praise from therapists like Adelakun for another reason: the way the movie portrays trauma and healing.\n\nTherapists who spoke with CNN say they’re talking about the movie with their clients – many of whom are first-generation children of immigrants who see themselves reflected in the story, hear their experiences in the soundtrack, and are using “Encanto” to speak out about things that otherwise might go unsaid.\n\n“I think it’s going to have a great impact on society. … People are seeing this movie and they’re realizing they’re seeing themselves in it,” Adelakun says.\n\nHere’s a look at several key “Encanto” characters and the conversations they’re sparking:\n\nThe healer trying to keep her family whole\n\nDisney\n\nThe character: Mirabel\n\nThe song that stands out: “Waiting On a Miracle”\n\nWhat therapists are hearing:\n\nAt the beginning of “Encanto,” Mirabel introduces us to the Madrigal family, gleefully describing each person’s “gift,” or magical power. We later learn that the magic and the family’s enchanted house have a darker side, originating in a traumatic moment after the family was forced to flee their home, trudge through the wilderness and cross a river seeking safety.\n\nMirabel is the only member of the Madrigal family who doesn’t get a gift. But in the end, her power is in seeing her family members for who they are and doing all she can to keep them together.\n\n“Mirabel was really the glue to the family, but no one was really seeing it,” Adelakun says.\n\nAnd it’s no coincidence that her character is someone many can identify with, says Mara Sammartino, a therapist in Fairfield, California.\n\n“Our parents come here fleeing war, poverty, violence. They come here, they establish a life, and then we’re born into this duality, and we’re not seen in one, and we’re not seen in the other. I think that’s why Mirabel’s character resonates,” says Sammartino, whose parents came to the United States from Nicaragua. “She is part of that duality. She’s the only one that’s in touch with the community. … She’s the only one that’s (leaving the house) and going out, talking to people. Then she comes back home and she’s kind of put in her place and told, ‘you actually don’t have anything to contribute.’”\n\nJenny Lemus, a psychotherapist in Chicago, says she heard feelings many of her clients have expressed for years in Mirabel’s song, “Waiting on a Miracle.”\n\n“She’s trying to communicate with her grandmother – ‘Look, this is what I’m experiencing. I want to be seen.’ A lot of times, the younger generations, what I’ve seen over the years, they want to be seen (by their families), they want the acknowledgment at least, and they’re not getting it,” Lemus says.\n\nThe perfectionist who feels she can’t fail\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/Everett Collection\n\nThe character: Isabela\n\nThe song that stands out: “What Else Can I Do?”\n\nWhat therapists are hearing:\n\nAt first glance, Isabela looks like she has it all; she can make flowers out of thin air and tosses her long hair like she doesn’t have a care in the world. But her song reveals how limiting perfectionism can be.\n\nAdelakun, whose parents came to the US from Trinidad and Tobago, says the message is relatable for many immigrants’ children – including her.\n\n“In my family, one of the main things is about not letting your family down … especially when you know they’ve made sacrifices to come to this country, to send you to good schools, to live in certain neighborhoods, just the importance of not letting your family down and trying to hold up to their expectations,” she says.\n\nFirst-generation children constantly “get the message that we need to be more,” says Lemus, whose parents immigrated to the United States from Guatemala. And those pressures, she says, can take a major toll.\n\n“There’s a lot of anger. Sometimes we don’t know where the anger comes from. Why do I feel so angry with my parents or grandparents? What’s going on?… You see that a lot with first-generation Latinos, a lot of resentment building up because of that pressure that is unspoken within the family dynamic,” Lemus says.\n\n“‘Encanto’ had such a beautiful way of portraying that in subtle ways. … Those of us that saw the movie and related to it, we got the message. We related so much to it. And I think that’s why it’s been such a hit.”\n\nThe sibling carrying the weight of her family on her shoulders\n\nFrom Disney/Youtube\n\nThe character: Luisa\n\nThe song that stands out: “Surface Pressure”\n\nWhat therapists are hearing:\n\nBig-muscled Luisa is used to carrying anything her family needs her to handle. And her song confessing that she’s about to crack under the weight of it all is resonating with many people.\n\n“It describes what anxiety feels like perfectly,” says Lemus, whose patients are predominately first-generation Latinos.\n\n“A lot of clients relate to Luisa, who is experiencing the pressure of … carrying the burden for their younger siblings … having that pressure (of) protecting the younger siblings from their own experiences. It is eye-opening, and I’m so glad that I have clients that are very insightful and can relate to it.”\n\nSeeing Luisa’s struggle depicted on screen can help those who are dealing with similar difficulties better understand and describe their own situation, Sammartino says.\n\n“I think ‘Encanto’ gives a little bit of space for some clients. They can say, ‘Oh, well, look at Luisa.’ They’re not going to say, ‘Well, that’s me.’ They say, ‘Luisa experiences that. I feel for Luisa.’”\n\nThe family secret that goes unspoken\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/Everett Collection\n\nThe character: Bruno\n\nThe song that stands out: “We Don’t Talk About Bruno”\n\nWhat therapists are hearing:\n\nWhen it comes to Bruno, who’s ostracized by his family and ends up hiding in the walls of the Madrigal house so he can be nearby but not have to face them, there’s plenty to talk about.\n\nBruno’s gift is seeing the future, and his family members blame him when the prophecies come true. Some of his mannerisms have sparked speculation about other possible diagnoses for the character, who’s the focus of the movie’s most popular song.\n\n“He thinks differently. He sees things differently,” Adelakun says. “We have family members who are also neurodivergent or have mental health issues, and because they’re different, they get shunned, or they’re not spoken about.”\n\nFamily secrets like the stories that come out when Bruno is discussed in the film are a common sign of the intergenerational trauma many first-generation families deal with, Lemus says.\n\n“We don’t talk about feelings. We don’t talk about emotions. We don’t talk about trauma. It’s so taboo to bring it up, and it’s uncomfortable to even express ourselves,” says Lemus, who says she tries to work with patients to help them learn how to better communicate those feelings.\n\n“But also, she says, “without the expectation that it’s going to be taken the way we expect it to be. Because…we don’t know how our parents or grandparents are going to take those hard conversations. … Generation from generation, if you didn’t learn how to express your emotions, you’re not going to know how to communicate in a healthy way.”\n\nThe matriarch who passes down her trauma\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios\n\nThe character: Abuela\n\nThe song that stands out: “Dos Oruguitas” (played in the background during a flashback showing the traumatic origins of the Madrigal family’s powers)\n\nWhat therapists are hearing: Protecting her family and their enchanted home is Abuela’s top priority. She’s obsessed with maintaining their magical powers and fails to realize how her experiences as a young mother – fleeing her home and losing her husband – have shaped her and her family. It’s only when the house crumbles and she almost loses everything that she sees her role in fracturing the family.\n\nFor Sammartino, it’s a perfect example to point to when she’s trying to help her clients empathize with their elders.\n\n“My way of trying to support my clients is to really develop a lens of empathy for their parents and the trauma that they experienced,” Sammartino says. “Like Abuela in the movie, her husband was murdered in front of her. Why wouldn’t she be overprotective?”\n\nIt’s a classic illustration of intergenerational trauma, Adelakun says – and something that’s likely to increasingly resonate as the film gets a wider audience.\n\n“As more people see this movie, or as more people talk about it, I think you’re probably going to see more people realizing they have repressed these things. I wonder how many people we’re going to see say, ‘I didn’t realize, or I forgot, but I had those same experiences, too,’ or, ‘I didn’t realize I was doing that to my family members.’ Abuela didn’t realize she was doing all this to harm her family,” Adelakun says.\n\nIn the movie, Abuela apologizes once she realizes the harm she’s caused.\n\nBut Lemus cautions there’s one thing that’s important to remember.\n\nIn real life, she says, Disney endings are rare.\n\n“We don’t see that outcome often. When we do see it, when we see the Mirabels of the world making changes for their family and making changes for themselves, it’s so beautiful,” she says. “It’s also beautiful when they do the work and when they realize they need to set boundaries in their families.”\n\nSometimes, families become estranged rather than coming together with a shared understanding. It’s a sad outcome, Lemus says, but doesn’t stop individuals from coming to terms with trauma and giving a healthy start to future generations.\n\nEven without a Disney ending, she says, it’s possible to heal.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

But it appears the administration may end up with some more time to consider its plans after Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Monday issued a temporary hold on the order lifting the policy.\n\nA surge of migrants at the US-Mexico border in recent days has already raised alarm among Democrats and Republicans, some of whom have called on the White House to find a way to extend the restrictions, and has placed immigration – a politically precarious issue – back at the forefront. The White House has said the administration is bound by a court order.\n\nBut Roberts paused that order in response to an emergency appeal by the leaders of several GOP-led states. In a brief order, signaling that the court wants to act quickly, Roberts asked the Biden administration to respond by 5 p.m. ET Tuesday to the appeal.\n\nThe brief order from Roberts does not necessarily reflect the final outcome of the case, but it means the policy that allows officials to swiftly expel migrants at US borders will stay in effect at least until the justices decide the emergency application.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement following Roberts’ order that “as required by the Supreme Court’s administrative stay order, the Title 42 public health order will remain in effect at this time and individuals who attempt to enter the United States unlawfully will continue to be expelled to Mexico,” adding: “While this stage of the litigation proceeds, we will continue our preparations to manage the border in a safe, orderly, and humane way when the Title 42 public health order lifts.”\n\nFor weeks, the administration has been bracing for the end of Title 42 that was invoked at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and allowed officials to turn away migrants encountered at the US southern border. The lifting of the authority means a return to traditional protocols at a time of mass migration in the Western Hemisphere, stressing already-overwhelmed resources.\n\nOfficials have been weighing policies to try to stem the flow of migrants heading to the US southern border. Among them is a proposal that would bar migrants from seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border if they could have received refuge in another country they passed through, mirroring Trump-era asylum limits. The proposal is being finalized and is expected to be announced this week prior to the lifting of Title 42.\n\nThe new rules are likely to generate outcry and legal challenges from immigration advocates, who have pushed for an end to Title 42. Enacting a version of a Trump-era asylum rule could also pose political challenges for Biden, who vowed to enact a more humane immigration policy than his predecessor.\n\nThe Biden administration tried to wind down the Title 42 program earlier this year, but a coalition of mostly GOP-led states – in a separate case filed in Louisiana – successfully sued to block the Department of Homeland Security from ending enforcement.\n\nTitle 42 becomes a top White House concern\n\nInside the White House, the pause on the termination of Title 42 will not have any effect on what have been intensive behind-the-scenes preparations for the end of the authority, according to a White House official.\n\nWhile the Department of Homeland Security serves as the lead agency on the issue and has said their preparations continue, the looming end of the pandemic-era public health authority has been a central focus for the last several weeks inside the West Wing, with senior White House officials playing a significant role in the internal debates over policy options to address an expected surge of migrants at the border.\n\nThere are no plans to slow the ongoing effort, the official said, given the possibility any delay is only brief in nature. “We’ve always been aware of the role the courts have in this process, but it’s not something that changes the approach,” the official said.\n\nOfficials will also continue to press Congress to approve the inclusion of more than $3 billion in additional funding to assist their preparations at the border as part of the omnibus funding bill.\n\nThe looming end of Title 42 has been a source of heightened concern, particularly as numbers of migrants attempting to cross the border increased in the days ahead of the order’s expiration. Biden has come under fire from border-state lawmakers for his handling of the matter. His advisers have convened meetings almost daily to weigh their options.\n\nIn formulating their plans, officials have sought ways to bring order to the situation at the border, where images of long lines and crowded holding facilities have generated outcry. Their goal has been to deter migrants from crossing illegally while still preserving their ability to legally apply for asylum.\n\nWhether the new asylum policies can deter migrants from attempting to enter the US remains unclear. Large numbers of migrants have already arrived at the Mexico side of the border awaiting Title 42’s expiration. Administration officials have said many of them are being exploited by smugglers offering false promises related to the end of Title 42, and officials are doubtful those practices would be altered by new rules.\n\nAnd economic and safety conditions in the countries the migrants are leaving remain unstable and have worsened since the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is actively monitoring intelligence to try to determine how many migrants are moving toward the US southern border and where they’re heading, though human smuggling organizations often influence pathways.\n\n“It’s a cat and mouse game,” one senior Homeland Security official said.\n\nAn intelligence memo, from the Homeland Security Office of Intelligence and Analysis, circulated last week underscored the concern within the administration over an increase in arrivals, citing human smuggling organizations adjusting their methods and how migrants may shift their calculus.\n\nOn the US side of the border, officials have been striking contracts to move migrants to other border stations for processing to avoid overcrowded facilities, the senior DHS official said. The administration has also identified cities within the United States to move migrants for processing – an idea that’s long been considered among officials – but no decision has been made yet.\n\nIn a document outlining border security preparedness, DHS broke down its six-pillar plan, which was released in the spring and has since been updated. It includes scaling up ground and air transportation capabilities to transport migrants for processing and remove them, leaning on a CBP One mobile application to process asylum seekers, and increasing referrals for prosecutions for repeat border crossers, the document said.\n\nWhite House pushes back against criticism\n\nThe White House has pushed back on calls for the administration to find a way to extend the controversial public health authority, saying it is bound by court orders.\n\nImages from the border have raised alarm among elected officials, some of whom have publicly questioned the Biden administration’s readiness and preparations to handle the expected influx of people trying to enter the United States.\n\nOver the weekend, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia called on Biden to “use every bit of power he has as an executive to find a way or ask for an extension.”\n\nThe White House official declined to elaborate when asked whether Biden has the authority to secure such an extension.\n\nThe White House has insisted that the end of Title 42 does not mean that the US border will suddenly be open to all – and that there are existing processes in place to process the claims of asylum-seekers. The administration has also pointed to monthslong work that the Department of Homeland Security has been doing to prepare for the increase in migrants arriving at the border, while also calling on Congress to approve extra funding that the administration has requested to manage the situation.\n\nOver the weekend, a federal law enforcement source familiar with daily operations in South Texas told CNN that border authorities in the Rio Grande Valley have encountered between 900 and 1,200 migrants daily during the past two weeks.\n\nBiden to discuss migration with Ecuadorian president\n\nMigration in the Western Hemisphere will be discussed between Biden and Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso on Monday, according to a White House official, who stressed that Ecuador has been “setting an important example” on the issue.\n\nThe two leaders will also follow up on several issues discussed during this year’s Summit of the Americas, including an agreement to increase security cooperation to tackle drug-related gang violence, the official said.\n\nOver the summer, against the backdrop of the Summit of the Americas, Biden announced a regional partnership to address mass migration in the Western Hemisphere. The agreement, dubbed the Los Angeles declaration, was signed onto by multiple Western Hemisphere nations.\n\nUnder the declaration, governments are expected to commit to expanding temporary worker programs, bolstering legal pathways like refugee resettlement and family reunification, providing support to countries hosting large migrant populations, and cracking down on human smuggling networks.\n\nBiden and Lasso will revisit those efforts Monday, the official said.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated when the Biden administration announced its intention to end Title 42.

Its purpose was to prohibit border control agencies from holding migrants in \"congregant settings,\" like holding stations, where COVID-19 could spread rapidly. In effect, though, Title 42 gave the government the power to rapidly expel any migrant, without giving them an opportunity to make a case for staying in the country legally, including to seek asylum.\n\nThere have been multiple legal challenges to the policy.\n\nOn Dec. 19, the Supreme Court blocked a plan by the Biden administration to lift Title 42 restrictions on Dec. 21, as ordered by a lower court. On Dec. 27, the Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in February on whether 19 Republican-led states, including Texas, can challenge a lower-court ruling that ordered the Biden administration to lift Title 42.\n\nLatest Title 42 update:El Pasoans troubled by National Guard tactics\n\nBut the Supreme Court canceled the case in February after the Biden administration said it would end the nation's COVID-19 emergency order, effectively ending the Title 42 expulsions authority and rendering the arguments moot.\n\nThe CDC officially rescinded the policy a year ago, in April 2022, saying it was \"no longer necessary\" after \"considering current public health conditions and an increased availability of tools to fight COVID-19.\"\n\nWhat is Title 42?\n\nThe name refers to Title 42 of the U.S. Government Code established July 1, 1944. The law grants federal authorities the power to deny entry of people and products into the country to limit the spread of a communicable disease.\n\nThe Trump administration invoked the authority in March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic, and the Biden administration has continued to use Title 42 expulsions as a method of border control.\n\n\"Title 42 is not an immigration authority, and the order has been used to supersede federal law at the border ‒ which is under Title 8 of the U.S. Code ‒ and abrogate legal rights that have been guaranteed to arriving migrants for decades,\" according to an explainer published by the nonpartisan National Immigration Forum.\n\nWhen will Title 42 end?\n\nThe use of Title 42 expulsions at the Southwest border is expected to end when the nation's COVID-19 emergency order expires May 11.\n\nOn April 1, 2022, the Biden administration announced its plans to rescind the Title 42 order. The policy was to officially end on May 23 but was caught in legal wrangling for months.\n\nHomeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement then that the department would process migrants according to \"standard procedure,\" placing them in removal proceedings. It's still unclear exactly how asylum-seekers and other migrants will be processed once Title 42 expulsions end.\n\nTitle 42 has been a political hot potato. President Joe Biden has faced criticism by Republicans for wanting to end the use of quick expulsions at the border and by Democrats for not ending the expulsions soon enough.\n\nIn the case canceled by the Supreme Court in February, Arizona, Louisiana and Missouri led a coalition of states, including Texas, in challenging the Biden administration's effort to lift Title 42, arguing that their states' health care, law enforcement and education systems would be overly burdened by an influx of undocumented immigrants if the public health restriction is lifted.\n\nHow is the Title 42 border policy used?\n\nThe Border Patrol has applied Title 42 differently in different border regions, depending on the resources available and the demographics of migrant groups. Enforcement of the order also varied under the Trump and Biden administrations.\n\nUnder the policy, migrants who cross between ports of entry can be picked up by Border Patrol, processed and expelled ‒ sometimes within hours. Title 42 has been applied both to those migrants who seek to evade border agents as well as those who turn themselves in with Border Patrol to seek asylum.\n\nStory continues below.\n\nThe Border Patrol's ability to expel unauthorized migrants under Title 42 has been limited by which migrants Mexico is willing to accept, and how many, at different points along the border. The rate of Title 42 expulsions also can be influenced by the demographic makeup of who is crossing where.\n\nMigrants from Mexico, Central American nations, Cuba and Venezuela can be expelled to Mexico under an agreement between the U.S. and Mexico. Others, including Haitians, have been expelled to their countries of origin unless they have legal documents to reside in Mexico, in which case they can be sent back to Mexico.\n\nBorder agencies expelled unaccompanied migrant children for a time under the order during the Trump administration, but the Biden administration stopped the practice.\n\nIn El Paso, the expulsions have taken the form of the Border Patrol walking migrants to the top of an international bridge and instructing them to walk south into Juárez. In some cases, the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector transfers migrants for expulsion at border crossings in other parts of Texas and in Arizona.\n\nHow many migrants have been expelled?\n\nSince the start of the Title 42 policy, the Border Patrol has expelled migrants nearly 2.8 million times, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nTitle 42 allows for quick returns without repercussion, and that has encouraged some migrants to try again and again. Multiple crossings by migrants surged after the order went into effect.\n\nIn El Paso, the Border Patrol has leaned heavily on Title 42, where 63% of Border Patrol encounters have resulted in a Title 42 expulsion over the life of the policy, according to CBP. Between January and March, between two-thirds and 73% of encounters each month have resulted in expulsion.\n\nMexico permits Title 42 expulsions at some, but not all, of its border crossings.\n\nAcross the Southwest border, the use of Title 42 expulsions is much lower. From January to March, between one-third and 36% of encounters resulted in expulsion, in part, because Mexico doesn't accept expelled migrants in some locations.\n\nMore:Homeland Security: Nearly 20K Venezuelans subscribe to 'lawful pathway' pilot program\n\nJohn Moritz of the USA TODAY Network-Texas and John Fritze of USA TODAY contributed to this report.

The order does not necessarily reflect the final outcome of the case.\n\nThe states had raced to the Supreme Court earlier in the day in an emergency bid to keep in place a Trump-era immigration policy that is set to go off the books Wednesday.\n\nA federal district court judge had vacated the policy last month, calling Title 42 “arbitrary and capricious.” The judge said the program could remain in effect until December 21.\n\nAlready, federal officials and border communities have been bracing for an expected increase in migrant arrivals as early as this week, as the issue of immigration continues to ignite both sides of the political divide. The Department of Homeland Security has been putting in place a plan for the end of the program that includes surging resources to the border, targeting smugglers and working with international partners.\n\n“As required by the Supreme Court’s administrative stay order, the Title 42 public health order will remain in effect at this time and individuals who attempt to enter the United States unlawfully will continue to be expelled to Mexico,” the department said in a statement following Roberts’ order. “While this stage of the litigation proceeds, we will continue our preparations to manage the border in a safe, orderly, and humane way when the Title 42 public health order lifts.”\n\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich – who took the lead for the states – said in a statement earlier Monday that “getting rid of Title 42 will recklessly and needlessly endanger more Americans and migrants by exacerbating the catastrophe that is occurring at our southern border,” adding: “Unlawful crossings are estimated to surge from 7,000 per day to as many as 18,000.”\n\nBrnovich had told the justices in court papers that they should put the lower court ruling on hold. As an alternative, he said that the justices should grant an “immediate” temporary injunction to maintain the status quo and also consider whether to skip over the appeals court and agree to hear arguments on the merits of the issue themselves.\n\n“Failure to grant a stay here will inflict massive irreparable harms on the States, particularly as the States bear many of the consequences of unlawful immigration,” Brnovich argued.\n\nLate Friday night, the DC Circuit US Court of Appeals ruled against the states, holding that they waited an “inordinate” amount of time before trying to get involved in the case. That order triggered the emergency application at the high court, which was addressed to Roberts, who oversees the DC-based appellate appeals court that ruled in the case.\n\nRoberts is likely to refer the matter to the full court.\n\n“This is a longstanding problem, more people are fleeing persecution, gang violence, failed states and climate change than ever before,” said Stephen Yale-Loehr of Cornell Law School, who has been critical of the policy. “Even without Title 42, we would have more people than ever before trying to enter the United States,” he added.\n\n“Title 42 is not an effective way to manage our borders, instead, we need to both enact immigration reform in the United States and work with other countries so that people don’t feel so desperate to leave in the first place,” Yale-Loehr said.\n\nIn the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a public health order that officials said aimed to stop the spread of Covid-19. The border restrictions were controversial from the moment the Trump administration announced them.\n\nIn the case at hand, six families that unlawfully crossed the US-Mexico border and were subject to the Title 42 process brought the original challenge.\n\nIn court papers, their lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union argue that Covid-19 was always a thinly veiled pretense to increase immigration control. “There is no legal basis to use a purported public health measure to displace the immigration laws long after any public health justification has lapsed,” said Lee Gelernt, an ACLU lawyer representing the migrant families in the suit.\n\nThe Biden administration objects to the states’ attempt to intervene in the ongoing dispute and has said it is prepared to allow the program to end, but stresses it is still appealing the district court opinion to preserve the authority of the government to impose public health orders in the future.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said earlier Monday that the administration would have more details Tuesday on its plans ahead of the rule’s planned expiration and reiterated the US would continue to enforce its immigration laws amid the current influx.\n\nInside the White House, the pause on the termination will not have any effect on what have been intensive behind-the-scenes preparations for the end of the authority, according to a White House official.\n\nWhile the Department of Homeland Security serves as the lead agency on the issue, it has been a central focus for the last several weeks inside the West Wing, with senior White House officials playing a significant role in the internal debates over policy options to address an expected surge of migrants at the border. There are no plans to slow the ongoing effort, the official said, given the possibility any delay is only brief in nature.\n\n“We’ve always been aware of the role the courts have in this process, but it’s not something that changes the approach,” the official said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/politics/supreme-court-title-42/index.html", "title": "Supreme Court says Trump-era border restriction will remain in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court said Tuesday that the controversial Trump-era border restriction known as Title 42 will remain in effect while legal challenges play out, a move that ensures that federal officials will be able to continue to swiftly expel migrants at US borders at least for the next several months.\n\nThe 5-4 order is a victory for Republican-led states that urged the Supreme Court to step in and block a lower court opinion that ordered the termination of the authority. The Biden administration has said it was prepared for the authority to end and had put in place precautions to guard against confusion at the border and any potential surge of migrants.\n\nIn its order, the court also agreed to take up the states’ appeal this term. The court said it would hear arguments on the case during its argument session that begins in February 2023.\n\nJustices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan said they’d deny the application, but they did not explain their thinking. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch also dissented and explained his thinking in an order joined by liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nGorsuch said he does “not discount the States’ concerns” about border security. But Gorsuch noted that Title 42 was put in place to combat Covid-19, and “the current border crisis is not a Covid crisis.”\n\n“Courts should not be in the business of perpetuating administrative edicts designed for one emergency only because elected officials have failed to address a different emergency,” Gorsuch wrote.\n\nSince March 2020, Title 42 has allowed US border agents to immediately turn away migrants who have crossed the southern border in the name of Covid-19 prevention.\n\nImmigrant advocates and public health experts have long denounced use of the public health authority along the US southern border, arguing it was an inappropriate pretext for barring migrants from entering the United States. In nearly three years, the authority has been used over 2 million times to turn migrants away, according to US Customs and Border Protection.\n\nAt the border, migrants have been waiting in encampments in Mexico for months, anticipating the end of the authority so they can make their claim of asylum in the US. Immigrant advocates have tried to disseminate updates and information to migrants, but desperation has grown, especially as temperatures drop.\n\nEl Paso, Texas, has been at the center of the crisis as thousands of migrants have crossed that region of the border. The city opened government-run shelters at its convention center, hotels and several unused schools to care for migrants, though some have still had to sleep on the streets in cold temperatures.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been putting in place a plan for the end of the authority that includes surging resources to the border, targeting smugglers and working with international partners.\n\n“We will continue to manage the border, but we do so within the constraints of a decades-old immigration system that everyone agrees is broken. We need Congress to pass the comprehensive immigration reform legislation President Biden proposed the day he took office,” the department said in a statement.\n\nThe White House said it would comply with the order.\n\n“Today’s order gives Republicans in Congress plenty of time to move past political finger-pointing and join their Democratic colleagues in solving the challenge at our border by passing the comprehensive reform measures and delivering the additional funds for border security that President Biden has requested,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\n\nAsked to respond to the ruling, President Joe Biden told reporters his administration will enforce the Trump-era immigration restriction, even if he thinks it’s past time to revoke it.\n\n“The court is not going to decide until June apparently, and in the meantime we have to enforce it – but I think it’s overdue,” Biden told reporters on the White House South Lawn.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar acknowledged to the Supreme Court last week that returning to traditional protocols along the border will pose a challenge, but said there’s no longer a basis to keep the Covid-era rules in place.\n\n“The government in no way seeks to minimize the seriousness of that problem. But the solution to that immigration problem cannot be to extend indefinitely a public-health measure that all now acknowledge has outlived its public-health justification,” Prelogar wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court.\n\nLawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union, who are representing families subject to Title 42, had in arguments underscored the dangers faced by asylum seekers subject to the authority and sent back to Mexico.\n\nLee Gelernt, the lead counsel for the plaintiffs in the case, told CNN in a statement that they are “deeply disappointed” by the ruling, but will continue to fight to end the policy.\n\n“We are deeply disappointed for all the desperate asylum seekers who will continue to suffer because of Title 42, but we will continue fighting to eventually end the policy,” Gelernt said.\n\nSteve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, called the order “procedurally bizarre.”\n\n“This order is procedurally bizarre, in that it agrees to a request to freeze a district court ruling by states that weren’t even parties to that decision solely to decide whether they should have been allowed to intervene and defend that ruling on appeal,” Vladeck said. “Title 42 aside, that has enormous potential consequences for the ability of states going forward to fight to keep the current president from rescinding policies of her predecessors.”\n\nThe GOP-led states had argued that they’d be harmed by the lifting of the authority because of the influx of migrants entering the United States.\n\n“The border crisis that Respondents bizarrely and eagerly seek to cause would also inflict enormous harms to the States,” a filing, submitted last Wednesday, reads.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue Priscilla Alvarez", "Ariane De Vogue", "Priscilla Alvarez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/05/04/when-will-title-42-expire-border/70180278007/", "title": "When will Title 42 expire?

The Biden administration is set to stop enforcing Title 42 – which allows for the expulsion of migrants at the US-Mexico border – on Wednesday.\n\nThe Republican-led states previously indicated that if the appeals court ruled against them, they’d seek the intervention of the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the new order, the DC Circuit denied the states’ request to intervene in the case and dismissed as moot the states’ request that it put the lower court’s ruling on hold.\n\nThe unsigned order was handed down by a circuit panel made up of an Obama appointee, a Trump appointee and a Biden appointee.\n\nThey wrote that the “inordinate and unexplained untimeliness” of the states’ request to get involved in the case “weighs decisively against intervention.”\n\nThe case is a lawsuit the American Civil Liberties Union, representing several migrants brought In January 2021 challenging the program. The appeals court noted on Friday that the Republican-led states had long known that their interest in keeping the policy in force would diverge from the Biden administration’s approach to the case.\n\nThe appeals court wrote that “more than eight months ago, the federal government issued an order terminating the Title 42 policy.”\n\n“Yet these long-known-about differing interests in preserving Title 42—a decision of indisputable consequence—are the only reasons the States now provide for wanting to intervene for the first time on appeal,” the DC Circuit said. “Nowhere in their papers do they explain why they waited eight to fourteen months to move to intervene.”\n\nThe ACLU attorney representing the migrants praised the court’s decision.\n\n“The states are clearly and wrongly trying to use Title 42 to restrict asylum and not for the law’s intended public health purposes,” the attorney, Lee Gelernt, told CNN in an email. “Many of these states were vigorously opposed to past COVID restrictions but suddenly believe there is a need for restrictions when it comes to migrants fleeing danger.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan said after the ruling that the administration has a “robust effort underway” for managing the border following the policy’s expected lifting next week.\n\n“To be clear: the lifting of the Title 42 public health order does not mean the border is open. Anyone who suggests otherwise is doing the work of smugglers spreading misinformation to make a quick buck off of vulnerable migrants,” Hasan said in a statement. “We will continue to fully enforce our immigration laws and work to expand legal pathways for migration while discouraging disorderly and unsafe migration. We have a robust effort underway to manage the border in a safe, orderly, and humane way when Title 42 lifts as required by court order.”\n\nThe White House also urged Republicans in Congress to agree to more border funding and work on comprehensive immigration reform. The Biden administration has asked Congress for more than $3 billion as it prepares for the end of Title 42 to help shore up resources for border management and technology.\n\nThe administration’s handling of Title 42, which the Trump administration put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic, has been the target of litigation from both supporters and opponents of the program.\n\nLast month, US District Judge Emmet Sullivan struck down the program. But Sullivan put his ruling on hold for five weeks so that the Biden administration would have time to prepare for the policy’s wind down. The administration has also appealed the ruling, arguing that the program was lawful, even if federal public health authorities have determined it is no longer necessary.\n\nAs the December 21 deadline for Sullivan’s ruling to go into effect approaches, officials have been preparing for a surge of migrants. More than 1 million migrants have been expelled under the rule, which is a public health authority the Trump administration began using at start of the Covid-19 pandemic to expel migrants before they went through the asylum application process.\n\nRepublican-led states, in their attempts to intervene in the case, allege that allowing the policy to terminate would “cause an enormous disaster at the border.”\n\nThey have argued that the “greatly increased number of migrants that such a termination will occasion will necessarily increase the States’ law enforcement, education, and healthcare costs.”\n\nThe Biden administration opposed the states’ attempt to intervene and their request to keep the policy in place, calling the requests untimely and unjustified.\n\n“The States could have sought to intervene after the CDC acted to terminate the Title 42 orders in April 2022,” the administration wrote.\n\nThe migrants who challenged the program in the case also opposed the states’ request, writing in a court filing that the states were “transparently interested in Title 42 as a restriction on immigration and asylum” rather than as a public health measure.\n\nThe Biden administration tried to wind down the Title 42 program earlier this year, but a coalition of mostly GOP-led states – in a separate case filed in Louisiana – successfully sued to block the Department of Homeland Security from ending enforcement.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated when the Biden administration announced its intention to end Title 42.

Its end could now restore access to asylum for arriving migrants, allowing them to enter the US and make their case in immigration court.\n\nSullivan had found the Title 42 order to be “arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.”\n\nPrior to Title 42, all migrants arrested at the border were processed under immigration law. Thousands of migrants sent back to Mexico have been waiting along the border in shelters. Officials have previously raised concerns about what the end of Title 42 may portend, given limited resources and a high number of people trying to enter the country.\n\nSullivan’s ruling also comes on the heels of the resignation of US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Chris Magnus, who had been asked to resign by Alejandro Mayorkas last week.

The agency, he said, should have reexamined its approach when vaccines and tests became widely available.\n\n“With regard to whether defendants could have ‘ramped up vaccinations, outdoor processing, and all other available public health measures,’… the court finds the CDC failed to articulate a satisfactory explanation for why such measures were not feasible,” Sullivan wrote.\n\nThe judge also concluded that the policy did not rationally serve its purpose, given that Covid-19 was already widespread throughout the United States when the policy was rolled out.\n\n“Title 42 was never about public health, and this ruling finally ends the charade of using Title 42 to bar desperate asylum seekers from even getting a hearing,” American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt, who argued the case, said in a statement.\n\nThe injunction request came from the ACLU, along with other immigrant advocacy groups, involves all demographics, including single adults and families. Unaccompanied children were already exempt from the order.\n\nThe ACLU does not oppose the Biden administration’s request for a stay of Tuesday’s ruling through December 21, the administration noted in their filing.\n\nIn a statement following the ruling, the Department of Homeland Security said that, if granted, “the delay in implementation of the court’s order will allow the government to prepare for an orderly transition to new policies at the border.”\n\nThe department added that it would continue to enforce immigration laws at the border, work with other countries to take action against smuggling networks and “address the root causes of irregular migration.”\n\nThe public health authority was invoked at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and has been criticized by immigrant advocates, attorneys and health experts who argue it has no health basis and puts migrants in harm’s way.\n\nSullivan had previously blocked the Biden administration from expelling migrant families with children apprehended at the US-Mexico border.\n\nEarlier this year, in anticipation of lifting Title 42 and under pressure from lawmakers, the Department of Homeland Security released a 20-page plan to manage a potential increase of migrants at the border. A separate federal judge struck down the administration’s intent to end Title 42 at the time.\n\nThe CDC said at the time it’s no longer necessary given current public health conditions and the increased availability of vaccines and treatments for Covid-19.\n\nBut in May, a federal judge in Louisiana blocked the Biden administration from ending Title 42.\n\nSince that court order, the administration has continued to use Title 42 and most recently, expanding it to include Venezuelan migrants who have arrived at the US southern border in large numbers.\n\nIn October, there were more than 204,000 arrests along the US southern border and over 78,400 expulsions under Title 42, according to CBP data.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Priscilla Alvarez Tierney Sneed", "Priscilla Alvarez", "Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2023/01/01/what-is-title-42-border-immigration-policy/69764253007/", "title": "What is Title 42? The US border policy, explained", "text": "Leer en español\n\nThe pandemic-era border restriction known as Title 42 has been used to rapidly expel migrants nearly 3 million times since it was enacted in 2020.\n\nTitle 42 allows U.S. officials to swiftly expel migrants seeking asylum at the nation's borders and shutter ports of entry. The restriction has hindered asylum access in the country for over three years and has survived two attempts to rescind the policy.\n\nBarring a last-minute court filing, the restriction is expected to expire on May 11.\n\nHere are some answers to your questions about Title 42.\n\nWhat is the Title 42 policy at the border?\n\nTitle 42 is a rarely used section of the U.S. Code dating back to 1944 that relates to public health and welfare. Under section 265 of the code, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is allowed to prohibit the entry of non-citizens into the country if they believe there’s a \"serious danger\" of the introduction of a communicable disease into the U.S.\n\nTitle 42 was first invoked under the Trump administration during the pandemic in March 2020, with the reasoning it would mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in immigration facilities.\n\nThe policy, however, has continued to be used under the Biden administration as a tool to manage migration flows at the southern border even as the public health emergency has subsided.\n\nWhen will Title 42 end?\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced in February that the end of the COVID-19 pandemic public health emergency on May 11 will also end Title 42.\n\nThe fate of the restriction was previously in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nTitle 42 was set to lift on Dec. 21 but was allowed to remain in use by a last-minute order by Chief Justice John Roberts. On Dec. 27, the high court ruled that the border restriction must continue as it weighs the arguments in the case.\n\nPotential end: Title 42 limits on migration could be ending. What could happen next?\n\nThe order stemmed from a request by an Arizona-led coalition of 19 conservative states that asked the court to intervene in the case.\n\nThe lifting of the public health emergency, however, mooted the Supreme Court case.\n\nWhat plans are in place once Title 42 ends?\n\nU.S. officials are expecting the number of migrant encounters at the southern border to increase to 10,000 a day after May 11. The Biden administration has announced a patchwork of plans and policies ahead of Title 42’s sunset in order to manage migrant encounters at the border.\n\nHere’s what they are:\n\nIncrease the use of expedited removals for migrants who can’t establish a legal basis in the country or fail their credible fear interview.\n\nEstablish regional processing centers, starting in Colombia and Guatemala, where migrants can book appointments to determine if they’re eligible for lawful pathways to Canada, Spain and the U.S.\n\nImpose harsher consequences for unlawful entry into the country, including a five-year ban from reentry.\n\n“Double or triple” deportation flights for migrants from some countries.\n\nEstablish a potential rule that would require migrants to apply for and be denied asylum in one of the countries they passed through on their way to the U.S.\n\nBiden also is deploying 1,500 troops to El Paso, but Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said May 7 that they can be moved elsewhere along the border if necessary. They will not take part in enforcement activities, but will perform administrative tasks that will allow more Border Patrol agents to get out into the field.\n\nHow does Title 42 affect the Arizona border?\n\nTitle 42 has been applied differently in Arizona's two U.S. Customs and Border Protection sectors.\n\nIn the Tucson sector, which covers 262 miles between New Mexico and Yuma County, nearly 47% of encounters ended with a Title 42 expulsion thus far in fiscal year 2023, according to CBP data.\n\nIs Border Patrol ready?US officials offer few details on plans when Title 42 policy lifts\n\nIn the Yuma sector, slightly over 7% of encounters ended with a Title 42 expulsion.\n\nThe differences are mainly related to the nationality of the migrants apprehended.\n\nThe number of migrants Border Patrol agents must process will “likely be double or greater” once Title 42 is lifted, placing further strain on the agency, according to a September U.S. Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General report.\n\nThe report documented that “guidance to agents on when Title 42 goes away is scarce” and there are no plans for what processing alternatives could be used when the border restriction ends. The report found that Border Patrol is “unprepared” to meet the increase in processing and placement burdens.\n\nBiden recently announced that 1,500 active-duty troops would be deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border ahead of May 11. Army and Marine Corps personnel will be tasked with helping relieve Border Patrol agents by performing administrative duties, such as data entry and ground-based detection.\n\nWho does Title 42 apply to?\n\nThe order has been used more than 2.6 million times in encounters with migrants. The restriction has bottled up tens of thousands of migrants in Mexican border communities who are waiting for their chance to request asylum in the U.S.\n\nThere are roughly 660,000 migrants currently in Mexico, acting CBP Commissioner Troy Miller told the House Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee on April 19.\n\nThe number of migrants comes in addition to the 287,000 internally displaced Mexican nationals, according to United Nations statistics Miller cited.\n\nFor over three years, the policy has been used to rapidly expel migrants and asylum seekers to Mexico or their home countries.\n\nPorts of entry have largely turned away asylum-seeking migrants with few exceptions granted through humanitarian parole. With official ports closed, many migrants have resorted to requesting asylum between ports of entry, often taking more remote and dangerous routes.\n\nWhy are some migrants not expelled under Title 42?\n\nTitle 42 has been primarily applied to migrants from Mexico, Venezuela and the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Under agreements with Mexican government authorities, nationals from these countries can be sent back across the land border to Mexico.\n\nIn October, the Biden administration expanded the scope of Title 42 to include Venezuelan migrants, a population that had been exempt from the restriction.\n\nBiden further expanded the use of the restriction in early January when he announced that migrants from Cuba, Haiti and Nicaragua could also be quickly expelled to Mexico.\n\nBorder rhetoric:'Border invasion' becomes talk of GOP candidates. Here's what to know\n\nThe expansion of Title 42 for those four nationalities was married with parole programs for migrants from those countries.\n\nThe programs allow for 30,000 people from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti and Nicaragua to apply for parole each month. Applicants would receive a two-year work permit if they pass a rigorous application process and have a qualifying sponsor in the U.S.\n\nAt the same time, Mexico agreed to take 30,000 expelled migrants from those four countries per month.\n\nAll other nationalities, except for Ukrainians, are subject to be sent back to their home country or to a country that has agreed to receive them.\n\nStill, migrants from other countries are less likely to be rapidly deported under Title 42 because of frosty U.S. relations with their home countries.\n\nSometimes border officials cannot immediately expel migrants to Mexico or their countries of origin under the policy, such as unaccompanied children who are exempt from the restriction.\n\nCan asylum seekers request exemptions from Title 42?\n\nYes, asylum seekers can request exemptions from Title 42 through the mobile government application, CBP One.\n\nMigrants can schedule appointments at certain ports of entry where U.S. officials will determine if they can enter the country to request asylum.\n\nOnce Title 42 expires, the app will be used to process all migrants seeking asylum.\n\nMigrants and advocates have decried the glitchy app that is rampant with setbacks and obstacles. The app often freezes and kicks users out at critical points in the application process.\n\nFamilies have been separated due to not being able to book an appointment together and the app has had difficulty in recognizing people with darker skin tones.\n\nCBP One:This family fled Mexico and sought asylum through an app. Not everyone is so lucky\n\nAdditionally, too few daily appointments are released to meet the number of asylum seekers trying to book a time along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nHow does Title 42 affect asylum seekers?\n\nMigrants have decried Title 42 as it has impeded their ability to seek asylum in the U.S. while they’re fleeing violence, threats and economic instability in their home countries. Advocates have criticized the policy that has forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexican border communities for months, facing discrimination and dangerous conditions at the hands of organized crime.\n\nTitle 42:Migrants remain in limbo as border health restriction’s future remains uncertain\n\nMexican cartels and criminal organizations have repeatedly preyed on the vulnerable migrant population that is stranded in Mexico to fuel their lucrative profits. If migrants are expelled under Title 42, they’re swiftly thrust back into the clutches of the awaiting cartels and coyotes, sometimes, in a matter of hours.\n\nThe nonprofit Human Rights First has documented more than 13,400 reports of “murder, torture, kidnapping, rape” and other violent attacks against migrants expelled to Mexico under Title 42 since Biden first took office.\n\nThe continuation of Title 42 has forced asylum seekers to remain in a limbo of perilous conditions as they await their opportunity to seek asylum.\n\n'Overwhelming':As Title 42 policy winds down, community leaders on border detail preparations\n\nHow did Title 42 get to the Supreme Court?\n\nOn Nov. 15, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington, D.C., vacated the policy and gave the Biden administration five weeks to prepare for the end of the restriction, slating the restriction for a Dec. 21 end.\n\nThe Biden administration subsequently appealed Sullivan's order, focusing on the authority of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue orders regulating migration.\n\nTitle 42:Judge blocks border health policy, expulsion of migrants\n\nAfter Sullivan's ruling, Arizona, alongside a coalition of other Republican-led states, filed a motion to intervene in the case in an effort to delay the end of Title 42. In the motion, the states argued that the Biden Administration had \"abandoned their defense\" of Title 42 by only asking for a five-week stay.\n\nA federal appeals court then rejected a bid from the group of Republican states to intervene in the case, clearing a path for the litigation to head to the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Dec. 19, two days before Title 42 was set to expire, the Arizona-led coalition of states filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, asking the high court to keep Title 42 in place.\n\n“Getting rid of Title 42 will recklessly and needlessly endanger more Americans and migrants by exacerbating the catastrophe that is occurring at our southern border,” Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, said in a news release announcing the emergency request.\n\nThat same day, the Supreme Court then issued a temporary stay on the restriction before ordering the policy to remain in place on Dec. 27.\n\nWhat happened when Title 42 was ending in May 2022?\n\nIn April 2022, the CDC determined that the public health order was no longer necessary after considering the array of mitigation measures and the low community levels of COVID-19 nationwide. Their public health assessment found that 97% of the U.S. population lives in counties with low levels of COVID-19.\n\nTitle 42 repeal:Judge's ruling blocking the repeal of Title 42 divides Arizona politicians, communities\n\nCDC officials announced Title 42 would be terminated on May 23, 2022, to \"enable the Department of Homeland Security to implement appropriate COVID-19 protocols.\"\n\nIn May 2022, a federal judge in Louisiana blocked the Biden administration from rescinding Title 42, leaving the policy in place.\n\nU.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays, from the Western District of Louisiana, placed the temporary restraining order to stop the administration from moving forward. His decision stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Brnovich, along with 20 other Republican attorneys general, in April 2022.\n\nHave a news tip or story idea about the border and its communities?

Yet the Biden administration continued to lean on Title 42 despite objections from its allies.\n\n“In consultation with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), this termination will be implemented on May 23, 2022, to enable DHS time to implement appropriate COVID-19 mitigation protocols, such as scaling up a program to provide COVID-19 vaccinations to migrants and prepare for resumption of regular migration under Title 8,” the CDC said in a highly anticipated announcement.\n\n“After considering current public health conditions and an increased availability of tools to fight COVID-19 (such as highly effective vaccines and therapeutics), the CDC Director has determined that an Order suspending the right to introduce migrants into the United States is no longer necessary,” the agency added.\n\nMigrant families and single adults will continue to be turned away at the US-Mexico border until that date, barring exceptions.\n\nThe lifting of the pandemic-restrictions is expected to have immediate ramifications and would mean a return to traditional immigration protocols that have been in place for decades.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is preparing for a worst-case scenario of up to 18,000 people trying to cross the border daily, a number sure to overwhelm the already full border facilities.\n\nThe department is preparing temporary facilities to handle an increase of people, deploying hundreds of officers to assist, and leveraging partnerships with other federal agencies, among other measures. This week, DHS also began offering Covid-19 vaccines to migrants encountered at the US-Mexico border and is expected to grow that program in the coming weeks.\n\nWith the lifting of Title 42, migrants might be detained or removed if they don’t have an asylum claim. Migrants may also be released into the US while they go through their immigration proceedings, and if released, might be enrolled in alternative detention programs for continued monitoring.\n\n“Once the Title 42 Order is no longer in place, DHS will process individuals encountered at the border pursuant to Title 8, which is the standard procedure we use to place individuals in removal proceedings,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement Friday.\n\n“Nonetheless, we know that smugglers will spread misinformation to take advantage of vulnerable migrants.

But the border issue’s emergence in discussion provides a window into a complex policy and political moment.\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat who has long pressed the administration to terminate Title 42, is far from alone. Administration officials have received a steady stream of calls from lawmakers as well as state and local officials, reflecting often sharply divergent views on the merits of the authority, people familiar with the matter said. The calls, however, all echoed consistent concerns about the termination of Title 42 and what it will mean along the border in recent weeks.\n\nIt’s a dynamic that has played out as the Biden administration intensively prepares for a moment officials have long grappled with how to navigate. To some degree, it’s the latest phase of an effort that has long been underway, with officials keenly aware since the opening days in office that at some point the pandemic-era policy would come to an end. Personnel and technology infrastructure have been directed to key entry points, with increased levels and resources expected to be announced in the days ahead.\n\nAsked about concerns inside the administration about the potential for a surge at the border once Title 42 goes away, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre listed off a series of personnel, processing and infrastructure efforts that have been put into place.\n\n“We’re going to do the work, we’re going to be prepared, and we’re going to make sure we have a humane process moving forward,” Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday at the White House briefing.\n\nStill, the cross-cutting viewpoints on border policy have converged with the significant diplomatic component tied to managing a rapid shift in the countries of origin of the migrants apprehended at the border, one that has added a new layer of difficulty for the administration.\n\nThroughout, administration officials have stressed that the only viable long-term solution will come from congressional action, noting encouragement with a bipartisan framework released in the Senate last week.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the discussions, however, the long-shot bipartisan immigration deal led by Sens. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, and Kyrsten Sinema, who recently announced that she is leaving the Democratic party and registering as an independent, is essentially dead this Congress.\n\nThe framework, which would have extended protections for Dreamers and extended Title 42, was unlikely to build momentum in the brief lame-duck session.\n\nCNN has reached out to Tillis’ and Sinema’s offices for comment.\n\nDespite a legal process that remains up in the air, officials are deep into preparation as they stare down ominous signs of what may come next.\n\nAlready, over the weekend, more than 2,400 migrants crossed into the United States each day in only one section of the border, according to a senior Border Patrol official, marking what he described as a “major surge in illegal crossings” in the El Paso, Texas, sector.\n\nHomeland Security officials have described the mood within the administration as concerned and worried about an influx in the near term.\n\nBorder planning underway\n\nIn the face of losing Title 42 and amid concerns of a surge, officials have weighed what immigrant advocates have described as a draconian approach by creating hurdles for migrants seeking asylum in the United States. The asylum proposal was included in a memo sent from the Department of Homeland Security to the White House, one source told CNN.\n\nWhite House officials have also been in daily conversations with DHS officials about planning, sources told CNN. The National Security Council, which has been heavily involved in migration management amid mass movement across the Western hemisphere, has also played a critical role, sources said.\n\n“The team has been working really hard to ensure we’re taking steps to manage the expiration of Title 42 and put in place a process that’s orderly and humane. And we believe in doing so, we can protect our security concerns,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday.\n\nIf adopted, the asylum proposal would be reminiscent of a policy put in place during the Trump administration that dramatically limited the ability of migrants to claim asylum in the US if they resided or traveled through other countries prior to coming to the US. No decision has been made on the proposal.\n\nAdministration officials have also set other plans in motion in anticipation of a surge of migrants when Trump-era Covid restrictions are lifted this month following a court order blocking the use of Title 42. The legal fight intensified this week when 19 Republican-led states asked a federal appeals court to rule on their request to suspend the termination of the policy by Friday, according to a court filing.\n\nSince March 2020, when the authority was invoked, border officials have turned away migrants at the US-Mexico border more than two million times.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is preparing temporary facilities to process migrants, including in El Paso, as well as discussing ways to return non-Mexican migrants to Mexico through existing legal mechanisms aside from Title 42, according to two Homeland Security officials who stressed there’s been hourslong meetings daily to plan for an influx of migrants.\n\nIn a document outlining border security preparedness and obtained by CNN, DHS broke down its six-pillar plan, which was released in the spring and has since been updated. It includes scaling up ground and air transportation capabilities to transport migrants for processing and remove them, leaning on a CBP One mobile application to process asylum seekers, and increasing referrals for prosecutions for repeat border crossers, the document said.\n\nIn it, DHS also stressed the need for congressional action to update outdated statutes and help create a functioning asylum system, as the current one is under immense strain.\n\nBut just days away from the anticipated end of Title 42, plans are still being sorted out.\n\n“The 21st (is) going to be a disaster. There are so many things in the pipeline, but nothing is ready (to) go,” one official said, referring to December 21 when Title 42 is set to end.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas underscored the whole of government approach in a statement, noting that mass movement of people around the globe has posed a uniquely difficult challenge.\n\n“Despite our efforts, our outdated immigration system is under strain; that is true at the federal level, as well as for state, local, NGO, and community partners. In the absence of congressional action to reform the immigration and asylum systems, a significant increase in migrant encounters will strain our system even further,” he said.\n\n“Addressing this challenge will take time and additional resources, and we need the partnership of Congress, state and local officials, NGOs, and communities to do so,” he added.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, however, has called Title 42 critical and criticized what he called a “whack a mole” approach to the issue.\n\n“If there’s a surge in the valley, they’ll move people down there. If there is more people crossing let’s say, Del Rio, Eagle Pass they’ll move agents over there. Now they’re moving agents to El Paso. This is not the way to secure the border,” Cuellar said Wednesday on “CNN This Morning,” adding a call for Biden to visit the border and see the situation for himself.\n\n“I don’t know why they keep avoiding the border and saying there’s other things more important than visiting the border,” he said. “If there’s a crisis, show up. Just show up.”\n\nMajor surge in arrivals expected\n\nOfficials have already been contending with thousands of migrants crossing the border daily and expect those numbers to increase in the coming days and weeks, overwhelming already-strained resources.\n\nCNN previously reported that DHS is preparing for multiple scenarios, including projections of between 9,000 to 14,000 migrants a day, more than double the current number of people crossing.\n\nOver the weekend, US border authorities apprehended more than 16,000 people, US Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz said on Twitter. Among the cities seeing an influx in migrants is El Paso, which has previously grappled with a surge of migrants.\n\nEl Paso city officials said Tuesday they’re monitoring the situation and are in ongoing discussions with federal, state, and local partners. Mayorkas also visited El Paso on Tuesday where he met with the Customs and Border Protection workforce and local officials.\n\nThe Biden administration is also asking Congress for more than $3 billion as it prepares for the end of Title 42, according to a source familiar with the ask.\n\nThe request is intended to shore up resources for border management and technology and is part of broader funding discussions. It is not specific to the end of Title 42, the source said.\n\n“If Republicans in Congress are serious about border security, they would ensure that the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security have the resources they need to secure our border and build a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system,” White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan said in a statement.\n\nOther border cities are also bracing for an influx of arrivals, including Laredo, Texas.\n\nCuellar, who represents Texas’ 28th District, told CNN he’s in close touch with the city of Laredo about preparations, adding that the city may bus migrants to other locations as they’ve done in the past if nonprofits can’t handle the influx of arrivals.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Priscilla Alvarez Phil Mattingly", "Priscilla Alvarez", "Phil Mattingly"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}]}

Experts on the panel said they were confident they could, and the benefits of making the pill more widely available far outweigh any risks.\n\nThe advisers' decision is not binding, but the 17-0 vote paves the way for the likely approval of the pill's over-the-counter availability. The FDA is expected to make a final decision this summer.\n\nIf the application is approved, Opill will be the first contraceptive pill to be sold over the counter in the United States. It would join emergency contraceptives like Plan B on pharmacy shelves.\n\nKathryn Curtis, a scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was part of the panel, said selling Opill over the counter has the \"potential to have a huge public health impact,\" adding that \"the large body of evidence on the safety and effectiveness is very reassuring.\"\n\n\"The evidence demonstrates that the benefits clearly exceed the risks,\" Curtis said. \"The benefits of moving Opill over the counter include increased access to contraception ... reduction in unintended pregnancy and associated risks, and improved reproductive autonomy and improved equitable access to contraception.\"\n\nFDA raised concerns in initial review\n\nThe decision comes after the FDA raised numerous concerns in an initial review over the drugmaker Perrigo's application to sell Opill over the counter.\n\nTheir main concerns included if people would be able to correctly follow the labeling directions, and if they may not realize when Opill isn't appropriate for them without counseling from a doctor.\n\nFor example, people with a history of breast cancer should not take the pill, and those with abnormal vaginal bleeding should talk to a doctor first. But some participants in these categories incorrectly said Opill would be appropriate for them in preliminary research.\n\nThe panel largely set aside initial concerns Wednesday when given the opportunity to ask questions about Perrigo's research.\n\n\"The history of women’s contraception is a struggle for women’s control over their reproduction, and we need to trust women,\" said Dr. Katalin Roth, a professor of medicine at George Washington University and a member of the advisory panel.\n\nMurray S. Kessler, CEO and president of Perrigo, said the vote is the start of a \"new, groundbreaking chapter in reproductive health.\"\n\nMedical organizations react to birth control pill vote\n\nFor years, medical organizations and advocates for increasing access to birth control have pushed to have over-the-counter birth control pills available in the United States.\n\nMedical organizations, including the American Medical Association, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support selling the birth control pill over the counter.\n\nFree the Pill and other advocacy groups that support improving access to contraceptives rallied outside the White House on Monday in support of making Opill available over the counter.\n\nVictoria Nichols, project director of Free the Pill, called the Wednesday vote \"a historic step forward for reproductive health.\"\n\n\"Decades of coalition-driven advocacy and research efforts that have centered the voices of those most impacted by barriers to contraception caused by systemic inequities have made this possible,\" Nichols said in a Wednesday statement. \"It is past time for an over-the-counter birth control pill, which has the potential to advance reproductive justice and expand health equity.\n\nA 2015 study in the Journal of Women's Health found that nearly one-third of adult women who have tried to get birth control pills have faced problems obtaining a prescription or refills. They faced challenges including scheduling an appointment in time, getting to a clinic, paying for pills or accessing insurance. Uninsured and Spanish-speaking women were more likely to report difficulties, according to the study.\n\n\"For too long, barriers to birth control, including the prescription requirement, have prevented people from getting the contraceptive care they need, with the barriers falling hardest on Black, Indigenous, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders, Latinx folks and other people of color,\" said Monica Simpson, executive director of the reproductive justice organization SisterSong.\n\nHow does birth control pill Opill work?\n\nOpill uses the synthetic hormone progestin to block sperm from the cervix, preventing pregnancy. Most other birth control pills use progestin and estrogen, and progestin-only pills like Opill are often recommended for people who can't take combination pills because of health reasons.\n\nHormone-based pills, like Opill, have long been among the most common forms of birth control nationwide and have been used by tens of millions of people since the 1960s.\n\nOpill was first approved in the U.S. in 1973. The pill is currently sold without a prescription in the United Kingdom. Other contraceptive pills are available without prescription across much of the globe, including in South America, Asia and Africa.\n\nDig deeper: Reproductive rights\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/17/health/fda-vaccine-authorization-younger-kids/index.html", "title": "FDA authorizes Covid-19 vaccines for younger children | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines are now authorized for emergency use in young children. The US Food and Drug Administration expanded the authorizations for the vaccines Friday to include children as young as 6 months.\n\nHowever, shots can’t be given until the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisers have voted on whether to recommend them – a vote is scheduled for Saturday – and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky has signed off on that recommendation. The White House has said vaccinations for younger children may begin next week.\n\nModerna’s vaccine is now authorized for use in children 6 months through 17 years and Pfizer/BioNTech’s for children 6 months through 4 years. About 17 million kids under the age of 5 are now are eligible for Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nPfizer's vaccine for children under 5 being manufactured. Pfizer\n\n“Many parents, caregivers and clinicians have been waiting for a vaccine for younger children and this action will help protect those down to 6 months of age. As we have seen with older age groups, we expect that the vaccines for younger children will provide protection from the most severe outcomes of COVID-19, such as hospitalization and death,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert M. Califf said in a news release. “Those trusted with the care of children can have confidence in the safety and effectiveness of these COVID-19 vaccines and can be assured that the agency was thorough in its evaluation of the data.”\n\nPreviously, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was authorized for people 5 and older and approved for 16 and up, and Moderna’s vaccine was authorized only for adults.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, called Covid-19 vaccines for younger age groups a “milestone.”\n\n“It is a bit of a milestone to bring down the age range for these vaccines as we work through this,” Marks said Wednesday in a meeting of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee.\n\nIn that meeting, the committee members voted unanimously in favor of expanding the authorizations to include children as young as 6 months.\n\n“To be able to vote for authorization of two vaccines that will protect children down to 6 months of age against this deadly disease is a very important thing,” said committee member Dr. Archana Chatterjee, dean of the Chicago Medical School at Rosalind Franklin University.\n\nShe compared the day to December 2020, when the first Covid-19 vaccines were authorized for adults and older teens.\n\n“I’m really pleased that we’ve reached this kind of milestone,” said committee member Dr. Ofer Levy, of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital, who also likened the moment to when Covid-19 vaccines previously were authorized for other age groups.\n\n“I recall our first vote a year ago or more on the first Pfizer authorization,” Levy said. “I was one of the 17 votes in favor. I remember those early discussions – even then, should the 16- and 17-year-olds be included? At that point, that was a controversial topic that was being discussed. And here we are now, as a committee unanimously recommending authorization down to 6 months of age. So we’ve come a long way.”\n\nWill the youngest children get vaccinated?\n\nMany public health experts worry that even though the Covid-19 vaccines are now authorized for younger age groups, parents of these children might not take their kids to receive the vaccinations.\n\nThere is already slow uptake of Covid-19 vaccines among children in the United States.\n\n“Having vaccine options for the youngest children is very important; however, we have seen a relatively low uptake of Covid vaccines in children in the 5- to 12-year-old group, and so my concern is that uptake in the youngest children under 5 years old might also be lower than we would like,” Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nBarouch, who is not involved in the FDA’s decision, helped develop and study the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nHe said there were “striking” differences in how many adults are fully vaccinated compared with children and teens.\n\nChildren 5 to 11 were the most recent group to become eligible for vaccination, in November. But just 29% of these children are fully vaccinated with their two-dose primary series in the United States, according to the CDC, compared with about:\n\n60% of adolescents 12 to 17\n\n64% of adults 18 to 24\n\n67% of adults 25 to 39\n\n75% of adults 40 to 49\n\n82% of adults 50 to 64\n\n94% of adults 65 to 74\n\n88% of adults 75 and older\n\n“We are planning and preparing for the rollout of pediatric vaccines. Of course, there’s a lot of work to be done to look at uptake of this vaccine. Some of the polls and surveys that have gone out to the public have indicated an ongoing lessening of parents considering giving their children these vaccines over time,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nAccording to a Kaiser Family Foundation’s Vaccine Monitor survey, published in May, only 18% of parents of children under 5 said they would vaccinate their child against Covid-19 as soon as a vaccine was available.\n\n“I think the more the pandemic is in the rearview mirror for some people – or they believe it is – then the less compelled they will be to do this, and so we have a big public health education campaign ahead of us,” Freeman said. “Also, health departments at the local level will be looking to understand the landscape of their community in terms of how many providers, pediatricians and pharmacies have actually signed up to give out the vaccine.”\n\n‘Benefits seem to clearly outweigh the risks’\n\nUnder the FDA’s authorization, the Moderna vaccine can be given as a two-dose primary series, at 25 micrograms each dose, to infants and children 6 months through 5 years of age. For older children, ages 6 to 11, the doses are administered at 50 micrograms.\n\nVials of Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine for younger children being filled. Pfizer\n\nThe Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine now can be given as a three-dose primary series, at 3 micrograms each dose, for use in infants and children 6 months through 4 years.\n\nThe FDA’s vaccine advisers have determined that the benefits of both vaccines outweigh the risks and that the vaccines have been “well-tolerated” among the children who received them in clinical trials.\n\n“The benefits seem to clearly outweigh the risks, particularly for those with young children who may be in kindergarten or in collective child care,” committee member Oveta Fuller, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School, said of the Moderna vaccine.\n\nCommittee member Dr. Art Reingold added that even though the risk of Covid-19 hospitalization and death is lower for young children than for adults, children already get vaccinations to protect them against diseases for which their risk is low.\n\n“If we have a vaccine whose benefits outweigh the risks, then making it available to people is a reasonable choice. I would point out that we as a country continue to give a large number of vaccines to children where the risk of the child dying or being hospitalized of those diseases are pretty close to zero,” such as polio and measles, said Reingold, of the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe number of Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths in children is concerning and much higher when compared with influenza-related deaths and hospitalizations, Marks said.\n\n“There still was, during the Omicron wave, a relatively high rate of hospitalization during this period,” he said. “That rate of hospitalization actually is quite troubling, and if we compare this to what we see in a terrible influenza season, it is worse.”\n\nMarks said the number of deaths for children 4 and under during the first two years of the pandemic “also compares quite terribly to what we’ve seen with influenza in the past.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“We are dealing with an issue where I think we have to be careful that we don’t become numb to the number of pediatric deaths because of the overwhelming number of older deaths here. Every life is important,” he said, adding that “vaccine-preventable deaths are ones we would like to try to do something about.”\n\nHe added that the Covid-19 vaccines are an intervention similar to the influenza vaccine, which has been broadly and routinely used and accepted to prevent deaths in all ages.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/18/health/children-under-5-covid-vaccine-explainer-wellness/index.html", "title": "The FDA has authorized Covid-19 vaccines for children under 5 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization on Friday for both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for young children. Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted unanimously on Saturday in support of giving babies and other kids as young as 6 months a Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nCDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signed off on the plan, clearing the way for the vaccinations to be administered this week.\n\nParents may be reluctant to actually get them when they become available, an April survey found. Just 18% of parents of children under 5 said they would vaccinate their child against Covid-19 as soon as a vaccine became available, according to an April Kaiser Family Foundation Vaccine Monitor survey.\n\nNearly 40% of those surveyed said they would “wait and see” before vaccinating their young children, 11% said they would get the vaccine for their kids only if required, and 27% said they would “definitely not” get the Covid-19 vaccination for their child.\n\nEven parents who are eager to vaccinate likely have questions. How confident should they feel about the FDA’s decision? When will vaccines be available to young kids, and how will families access them? Which vaccine is better, Pfizer or Moderna? If my child already has had Covid-19, should they still be vaccinated? And what if my kid turns 5 soon – should I hold off?\n\nI spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health” and the mother of two children under 5.\n\nThe following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nCNN: How are you feeling about the FDA’s decision?\n\nDr. Leana Wen: I’m thrilled and so relieved. It’s been a year and a half since adults first started getting the Covid-19 vaccine. There are about 17 million children not yet eligible for vaccination, and FDA’s authorization was a major hurdle to have crossed. Now that the CDC has also recommended both vaccines, I’m really looking forward to getting my young kids – ages 2 and almost 5 – the same exceptional protection that my husband and I have.\n\nThe FDA and its external advisers went through a rigorous process and conducted independent analyses of data submitted by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. They found that three doses of the Pfizer vaccine and two doses of the Moderna vaccine were safe and produced a strong immune response, on par with the antibody response seen in young adults. They also found that both vaccines reduced symptomatic infection in this younger age group.\n\nI’m reassured by the thorough, careful and deliberate process this regulatory agency took, and, when the CDC gives the go-ahead, as I expect they will, I’ll be calling my pediatrician to get both of my kids vaccinated.\n\nCNN: When do you think vaccines will become available to kids under age 5, and how should parents and caregivers access them?\n\nWen: Pending the CDC decision, which came Saturday, states had already been able to order vaccines, which means some doctors’ offices, community health centers, health departments and pharmacies may have them in stock and ready to give by next week.\n\nThe first place that I’d encourage eager parents to consult is their pediatrician’s office. Parents are used to getting kids vaccinated there, and the pediatrician will know when and if they plan on giving the Covid-19 vaccine. If they don’t plan to carry the vaccine, they would be able to recommend other trusted locations in the community.\n\nYou could also contact your local pharmacies, though note that many pharmacies may not be equipped to provide shots to young kids. Your local city or county health department and state health department also might have resources, as will children’s hospitals in your area.\n\nCNN: How will parents choose between the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for their kids?\n\nWen: Both vaccines are safe, and both are effective. Both vaccines induce strong antibody levels, which correlate with protection against severe disease in older age groups. Preliminary results indicate that the three-dose Pfizer vaccine is more effective at preventing symptomatic infection – though these are early studies – and both vaccines induce strong antibody levels, which correlate with protection against severe disease in older age groups.\n\nI think there will be a variety of parental preferences here. There are some parents who are eager to get their kids vaccinated as quickly as possible. In that case, the two-dose Moderna vaccine may be preferable, because the second dose is given four weeks after the first, and two weeks after that, their child will be considered fully vaccinated. If a child starts the series next week, they could be fully vaccinated by mid-August and in time for the next school year.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSome other parents might want their children to have the highest level of protection possible, even if it takes longer. Or, they might feel more reassured from Pfizer because it has been given for months to 5-11 year olds. The Pfizer three-dose vaccine definitely takes more time. The first two doses are given three weeks apart, then the third is given two months after the second. So it would take until at least mid-September for a child to be fully vaccinated with Pfizer, even if they get the first dose next week. The dosage of the Pfizer vaccine is also lower than Moderna’s, which some parents might also prefer, though there does not appear to be a difference in degree of possible side effects – such as fever, fatigue and irritability – associated with the different doses.\n\nStill other parents may just want to give their kids whatever they have access to first. I think all of these are reasonable decisions, as the CDC recommends both vaccines equally.\n\nCNN: What about kids who have already had Covid-19? Should they still be vaccinated?\n\nWen: Yes. Vaccination after recovery from infection provides more durable and longer-lasting protection than recovery alone. I hope the CDC addresses at their meeting the question of how long kids should wait to get vaccinated after they recover from the coronavirus. The CDC has made it clear that those children who have had Covid-19 should still be vaccinated.\n\nCNN: Should children turning 5 soon wait to get the higher dose or get vaccinated now?\n\nWen: No, they shouldn’t wait. The CDC is following the guidance they used previously for the 5- to 11-year-old group, which is to say that the 11-year old – and in this case, the 4-year old – should not wait. Start the vaccination process now, and then when the child turns 5, they can get the higher dose.\n\nCNN: What if parents are unsure about the vaccine and want to wait and see?\n\nWen: I believe that all parents want the best for their children. My best advice is to talk to your pediatrician, whom you trust with other aspects of guidance for your children’s health. Personally, I feel very reassured by the thorough and careful process taken by our federal regulatory agencies and can’t wait to give my kids a safe vaccine that helps to protect them from the coronavirus.", "authors": ["Katia Hetter"], "publish_date": "2022/06/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/10/15/fda-panel-supports-booster-all-adults-who-got-j-j-covid-vaccine/8459008002/", "title": "FDA panel supports a booster for all adults who got J&J COVID ...", "text": "Johnson & Johnson's vaccine should be considered a two-dose vaccine rather than the one-and-done shot that had received initial authorization, a federal panel decided Friday.\n\nThe committee felt the 15 million Americans who got a single dose of the \"one and done\" J&J vaccine would be substantially better protected with a second one.\n\n“It was always going to be a two-dose shot,\" said Dr. James Hildreth, president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville.\n\nThe Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted unanimously, 19-0, to support what J&J describes as a booster at least two months after the initial shot.\n\nWatch:FDA panel backs lower-dose Moderna COVID booster\n\nLive COVID-19 updates:Vaccine panel recommends J&J boosters after data says vaccine's effectiveness has 'headroom to improve'\n\nData from J&J and real-world experience show that the single shot provides less protection against COVID-19 than the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, which are both two-dose regimens. Company studies suggest J&J's protection continues over time, while effectiveness against less severe disease appears to fade with the other two.\n\nCommittee members said they felt urgency to provide an extra dose of vaccine to people who received the single shot of J&J.\n\n\"There is a public health imperative here because what we're seeing is that this is a group with overall lower efficacy than we have seen with the mRNA vaccines.

There were lower rates seen in other countries, J&J said, likely because of different variants circulating there.\n\nBut surveillance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that the J&J vaccine is only 68% effective against hospitalization in most adults.\n\nFor all age groups, vaccine effectiveness is highest in Moderna vaccine recipients, at 95%, followed by Pfizer-BioNTech at 80% and J&J at 60%, a report published by the CDC on Sept. 17 found.\n\nThe two mRNA vaccines are more effective, even considering that their strength seems to wane over time, said Dr. Amanda Cohn, a vaccine expert with CDC’s National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases.\n\n“There were some other data which showed that real-world effectiveness (for J&J) is hovering more in the 50 to 60% range,” she said. “The effectiveness or protection with a single dose of the J&J vaccine is not equivalent to protection with either two doses of an mRNA vaccine, and certainly not in those groups who have now been authorized to receive a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine.\"\n\n\"The contrast has not been stated so starkly before,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Infectious Diseases Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, who is not a committee member.\n\nTo counter the decline in effectiveness over time, the committee has already approved booster shots for people who received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines and meet certain conditions.\n\nThe committee decisions on both the Moderna and J&J supplementary shots still need to be verified by a different advisory panel as well as top federal officials. The CDC advisory panel is expected to meet Oct. 20 and 21 to discuss extra doses for Moderna and J&J recipients.\n\nThe CDC continues to recommend that people receive extra doses of the same vaccine they got the first time.\n\nAfter the vote on the J&J second vaccine dose, the committee considered a study by the National Institutes of Health posted Wednesday which looked at mixing and matching booster doses of vaccine.\n\nIt included nearly 500 people and found that the J&J shot followed by either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine as a booster produced a stronger immune response than two doses of J&J. For people who got either the Pfizer or Moderna two-dose series, a booster dose of either mRNA vaccine was effective.\n\nThe committee decided that more data was needed from the ongoing study before it could make any suggestions on whether to allow people to get a booster shot different from their original vaccine.\n\nOne dose of the J&J vaccine still counts as \"full vaccination,\" according to the CDC.\n\nGovernment officials have said that the original doses of vaccine – one shot of J&J and two each of either Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech – would continue to be considered \"fully vaccinated\" for the purposes of employment, travel and venue entry.\n\nAbout 15 million Americans have been fully vaccinated with the J&J vaccine, compared with 103 million who’ve gotten Pfizer and 69 million who’ve gotten Moderna.

The Moderna booster shots are authorized under the same terms, including having to wait until six months after the second dose, but J&J vaccine recipients can get any booster two months after being vaccinated.\n\nA National Institutes of Health study found that a shot of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine after J&J provides higher levels of protection from COVID-19 than two shots of J&J.\n\nLetting Americans choose among the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines as a COVID-19 booster shot would increase protection against a disease that is killing an average of 1,093 Americans a day, the committee said.\n\n— Elizabeth Weise\n\nUK goes over 50,000 new cases in a day for the first time in three months\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson encouraged eligible citizens to get a booster shot of the COVID-19 vaccine as the U.K. surpassed 50,000 new infections in a day for the first time since July 17.\n\nThe 52,009 new cases recorded Thursday raised the U.K.'s weekly average to 46,791, the continuation of a troubling spike after they had dropped well below 10,000 in June.\n\nJohnson has been getting pressure to reinstate restrictions and require the use of face masks, but so far has resisted while saying new infections and deaths are close to what was expected when social distancing rules were relaxed.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Thursday, the 11th of May 2023. Today, a look at the slew of charges faced by Congressman George Santos. Plus, what the end of Title 42 means for migrants, and Trump holds a town hall.\n\n♦\n\nRepublican Congressman George Santos pleaded not guilty yesterday to 13 federal charges. He faces seven counts of wire fraud, three counts of money laundering, one count of theft of public funds, and two counts of lying to Congress, according to an indictment unsealed yesterday. Santos was released from custody on a half million dollar bond after his arraignment on Long Island in New York. If convicted, Santos could face up to 20 years in prison. He yesterday maintained his innocence and called the indictment a witch hunt.\n\n♦\n\nTitle 42 comes to an end tonight. For more on what the lifting of the pandemic era immigration policy means, I spoke with El Paso Times and USA TODAY Border Reporter Lauren Villagran. Lauren, welcome back to 5 Things.\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nHey, Taylor.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nTitle 42 comes to an end today. What does that functionally mean for migrants trying to enter the United States?\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nOh, it's a whole new scheme on the border, Taylor. I mean, new in the sense that we haven't been here for two years, nearly three, but we're going back to Title 8 processing. And there are a whole host of new rules that the Biden administration has put into force that will take effect at 11:59 PM tonight.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd you wrote about this targeted enforcement campaign. What's the latest on that from your reporting at the border?\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nYeah, so El Paso has seen a really big rush of migrants trying to cross the border, sometimes illegally in the waning days of Title 42. And the reason for that is that under Title 42, border authorities could quickly expel people, but there were also almost no consequences for an unlawful crossing. So people were trying to get in under these pandemic era rules, and there were more than 3,000 migrants living on the sidewalks and the street outside of churches and homeless shelters here in El Paso for the past two weeks. That census hit its high watermark on Monday, and US Customs and Border Protection announced that they were going to begin this targeted enforcement operation.\n\nAnd that didn't turn out to be a raid like it might sound like. What ended up happening were CBP agents and officers, often in plain clothes, went around dropping off flyers to migrants sleeping on the street saying, \"Please turn yourself in. There's going to be an enforcement operation. This is your chance to surrender and get right with the law.\" And I just heard from Border Patrol El Paso Sector Chief Scott Good that more than 900 people did turn themselves in. So the census of people on the street has gone way down, and the humanitarian crisis is not where it was a couple of days ago.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd we know that in the wake of Title 42 expiring, there's going to be this shift back to more criminal prosecutions. I'm wondering, Lauren, do criminal prosecutions for illegal entries work to deter migrants from trying again?\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nThe research on that is mixed, Taylor. Immigrant advocates will say that it really depends on the reasons that people are coming. They'll also say that a prosecution may have a deterrent effect for that individual who faces jail time. But that, broadly speaking, that's not real high on the list of things that migrants who are fleeing violence, persecution, or severe economic hardship are worried about.\n\nYou mentioned earlier that migrants are going to be seeing this new kind of enforcement at the border that includes prosecutions, but it includes a lot of other stuff. So the Biden administration has announced things like migrants who want to seek asylum are now going to have to prove that they already tried to seek asylum in a country that they passed through on their way to the United States border. That's not that different from the third country asylum ban that the Trump administration had instituted. Different nationalities are going to face different kinds of expedited removals. So Venezuelans, Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Haitians are now going to be able to be deported directly to Mexico. So no, it's not a Title 42 expulsion, but it is a fairly quick return to our neighbor to the South with additional consequences. A five-year ban on entry, an illegal entry charge, potentially, that could lead to an illegal re-entry charge and jail time. So migrants who are arriving at the Southwest border now and in the coming days are likely going to find a very different enforcement picture.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nLauren Villagran covers the border for the El Paso Times and USA TODAY. Thanks so much, Lauren.\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nThanks, Taylor.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nHouse Republicans yesterday rekindled accusations of so-called influence peddling against President Joe Biden. That's based on $10 million in payments from foreigners in Romania and China to Biden relatives and their business associates. But the accusations come without evidence of direct payments to Biden or changes in national policy. The White House dismissed the allegations as baseless innuendo from partisan rivals. Republican Congressman James Comer, head of the Oversight and Accountability Committee, distributed banking records showing multiple payments while Biden was vice president. He said, \"The Biden's foreign entanglements are breathtaking and raise serious questions about why foreign actors targeted the Biden family, what they expected in return, and whether our national security is threatened.\" Committee Democrats issued a statement saying that many of the bank reports Comer relied on were based on erroneous or unfounded claims. They said none of suspicious bank reports, \"allege or even suggest any potential misconduct by President Biden.\"\n\n♦\n\nAn FDA advisory panel yesterday unanimously recommended that the agency allow a birth control pill to be available over the counter in the US for the first time. After a two-day public meeting, experts on the panel said they were confident that people could safely and effectively take the drug Opill without professional supervision. The recommendation is not binding, but their 17 to zero vote paves the way for the likely approval of the pill's over the counter availability. The FDA is expected to make a final decision this summer. Medical organizations and birth control advocates have for years pushed for over-the-counter birth control pills in the US. The American Medical Association and others support selling the birth control pill over the counter.\n\n♦\n\nIt was not a night of apologies. Former President Donald Trump used his CNN Town Hall in New Hampshire last night to deny and denounce. I spoke with USA TODAY National Political Correspondent David Jackson for more. David, thanks for hopping back on the show.\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nHey. Sure. Thanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThis town hall took place a day after a jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse. How big of a topic was that last night?\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nFairly big. It came up quite early, as you might imagine. And it suggests again that no matter what else, Donald Trump will never apologize or never express regret for anything. He again claimed that he had never met Jean Carroll or knew who she was. And he said the jury's verdict and the judge were unfair, that he's going to appeal and that he will prevail in the end. He also said he didn't think it would hurt him politically, and in fact it might help him politically.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd what did Trump say about some of these other investigations surrounding him?\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nPretty much the same thing. They're in various stages. He's actually been indicted in New York on a campaign finance charge arising from a state grand jury. But he remains under investigation over January 6th over his handling of classified documents and over his efforts to overturn the result in Georgia. Those investigations are in various stages, but he basically summarized them all by saying, \"It's one giant witch hunt designed to try to knock me out of the presidential race.\" So he's trying to lay the groundwork for the same kind of argument in that he hasn't done anything wrong, it's only his enemies who are trying to get him politically.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd David, did Trump use the town hall to address any other 2024 presidential candidates?\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nPretty much, and he seemed to be running more of a general election campaign than a primary one. He kept most of the focus on Joe Biden, and he mentioned Ron DeSantis and other Republicans only in passing. The thing that struck me most was that he, right out of the gate, he talked about how he claims the 2020 election was rigged. Nevermind the total lack of evidence about that or the fact that no one has been able to substantiate any of his claims. But it's clear that he's going to try to make the conduct of the 2020 election a major campaign issue in 2024, no matter the fact that many voters, voters who aren't particularly Republican, aren't Democrats, are tired of hearing about it and they don't want to listen to that. They want to hear more about the future. But in any event, Trump is certainly going to make 2020 an issue in 2024.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd the debt ceiling fight has been in the news in a big way in recent weeks. Did Trump address this issue at all?\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nYes, and he pretty much stuck to his guns. He says the Republicans should be willing to risk a government default rather than accept a bad deal on the debt ceiling. I mean, he and other Republicans want some major spending reforms to accompany an increase in the debt ceiling. The Biden administration is balking at that. They want a clean debt ceiling height. Trump says he's willing to risk a default in order for the Republicans to get what they want. I mean, it's a pretty dramatic position and it's the kind of thing a Republicans don't really like to talk about in public because that would create financial havoc across the globe.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWhat was the overall mood of the night and of the town hall?\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nWell, with the crowd, it was a very supportive crowd. CNN invited about 400 Republican and near Republican voters, people who said they planned to vote in the primary up there, and they gave Trump a very warm reception. They often applauded his comments and they often chuckled at some of his jokes. They even had a laugh over one of his Jean Carroll explanations, which was quite jarring, I would say. So the crowd was very much with him, but the moderator, CNN's Kaitlan Collins, felt the need to correct some of Trump's many misstatements, and that led to several arguments throughout the proceedings. And at one point Trump called her a nasty person. So there was a fight between Trump and the moderator, but the rest of the crowd seemed to be enjoying the former president.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDavid Jackson, thanks as always.\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nRight. Thank you, sir.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things. If you liked the show, please subscribe and leave us a rating and review on Apple Podcasts.

But when it comes to pregnant and parenting people, it’s still an incredibly stigmatized issue,” said Emilie Bruzelius, a researcher at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and co-author of the study. “It’s really important that pregnant people aren’t overlooked in some of the programs and policies that are being put in place to address overdose.”\n\nIn the new study, Bruzelius and Dr. Silvia Martins, director of Columbia University’s Substance Use Epidemiology Unit, tracked trends in the overdose mortality rate from 2017 to 2020 among both pregnant and postpartum people and compared that to others of reproductive age, between 15 and 44.\n\nThey found that the overdose mortality rate among pregnant and postpartum people has been lower than the rate for others of reproductive age, but it’s increasing faster for those who are pregnant or within one year of giving birth.\n\nIn 2020, there were about 12 pregnancy-associated overdose deaths for every 100,000 births – a 46% spike in one year and an 81% increase since 2017.\n\nThere were about 20 deaths for every 100,000 people in the broader reproductive age group, but the rate grew more slowly, increasing 38% since 2017.\n\nPregnancy-associated deaths are different from maternal mortality, in that they capture deaths among pregnant or recently pregnant people from all causes and not just those that are found to be directly related to pregnancy. Data like this has only been consistently available since 2017, when all 50 states included a checkbox on death certificates to indicate whether the individual was pregnant or postpartum at the time of death.\n\nThe lack of reliable information on pregnancy-associated overdose deaths has made it challenging to delve into how and why trends might be different for this group compared with others, Bruzelius said.\n\n“Moving forward, now that all states have implemented this pregnancy checkbox, hopefully we’ll have better information to track these trends overall and make better decisions on programs and policies that could try to mitigate some of these trends.”\n\nBarriers to treatment\n\nExperts say that pregnant and parenting people can experience harmful discrimination when seeking treatment for substance-use disorder. And other unique barriers to access – such as medical needs while pregnant or child care after birth – can keep them away from care and at higher risk for a fatal overdose.\n\n“Everybody that walks through our door cares about their health. But they’re scared to walk in our door because the stigma and the discrimination that they are facing in society – and sometimes in health care – is overwhelming,” said Hendrée Jones, executive director for UNC Horizons, a substance use disorder treatment program specifically for pregnant or parenting women and their children based out of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.\n\n“They’re scared that their child is going to be removed by child welfare once they have identified as needing help for substance use disorder. We’re seeing pregnant and parenting people that come in, that have overdosed three, four, up to 60 times previously before walking in our doors. And that can mean a lot of loss.”\n\nIn October, the Biden administration reported on their plan to “help facilitate universal access to treatment and reduce overdose deaths in pregnant women.”\n\nThe report highlighted earlier research that found that individuals posing as pregnant women with substance use disorder were 17% less likely to be accepted for outpatient treatment appointments than other women, and access to treatment can be even harder for women of color, those who live in rural areas and those who don’t speak English.\n\nIt also emphasized the importance of preventing unnecessary foster care placement, acknowledging that having substance use disorder in pregnancy is not, by itself, child abuse or neglect.\n\n“Addressing this crisis requires a holistic approach focused on the unique needs of the maternal-infant dyad, addressing social determinants of health, physical and mental health needs, and fostering collaboration across agencies and service providers at all levels (federal, state, local, Tribal),” according to the report.\n\nMore deaths involve fentanyl\n\nJones said that it’s rare for women to begin using drugs while they’re pregnant. Instead, it’s most often the case that women become pregnant while experiencing a substance use disorder and have a hard time stopping.\n\nMirroring national trends, the new study found a large increase in pregnancy-associated overdose deaths that involved fentanyl and other synthetic drugs and psychostimulants in recent years. Those involving benzodiazepines, heroin and prescription opioids remained mostly stable.\n\nRates were found to be higher among those in the late postpartum stage – between 6 weeks and one year after giving birth – compared with those who were pregnant or in the early postpartum stage at the time of death.\n\nMore work is needed to understand this difference, but Bruzelius suggests that relapse might be a contributing factor.\n\n“If someone is able to cease opioid use, for example, during pregnancy and then they relapse, they could have had a higher likelihood of fatal overdose,” she said – especially with the increase of deadlier drugs like fentanyl.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nExperts also point to the mental health challenges that face anyone experiencing the postpartum period.\n\n“Somebody that has just given birth has had an incredibly life-changing moment. And often the way our health care system deals with them is the focus really changes from the pregnant person to the baby. So right from the beginning, we’ve set up this adversarial relationship with the mother versus child,” Jones said.\n\n“Parenting, even in the best of circumstances, can be really stressful. And if you don’t have the support and care that you need, and the coping mechanisms that you need, it really sets you up for having much less positive outcomes.”", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/politics/robert-califf-q-and-a/index.html", "title": "Dr. Robert Califf: The head of the FDA answers why parents are still ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDr. Robert Califf, a cardiologist by training, admits that he never imagined he would one day become an expert on infant formula.\n\nBut during the eight months Califf has served as head of the US Food and Drug Administration under President Joe Biden, baby formula emerged as one of the most urgent and time-consuming issues for the commissioner, after major recalls of formula produced at an Abbott plant in Michigan spurred a full-blown national shortage.\n\nWhile Biden administration officials have been scrambling to remedy the scarcity of infant formula for the better part of this year – doing everything from flying in crates full of formula from abroad to invoking the Defense Production Act to boost production – the shortage still isn’t over heading into the winter months.\n\nSome parents – nearly a third of households with a baby younger than one – said they struggled to find formula over the course of one week last month, while more than 4 in 10 households said they only had a week’s supply or less of baby food on hand. Those data points come from a recent US Census Bureau survey, which has some limitations including a limited sample size and no previous points of comparison on the baby formula issue.\n\nIn a lengthy interview with CNN this week, Califf predicted that the US was now “a couple of months” away from the situation normalizing to pre-recall levels and insisted that, despite ongoing reports of gaps on shelves and anxious parents, formula production was now consistently outpacing consumption.\n\nAt the same time, Califf wouldn’t rule out the possibility of the US needing to launch another “Operation Fly Formula” flight from overseas – “If something else happened that was unexpected, like a plant shutting down or some other phenomenon like that,” he said. The last flight, on September 29, delivered more than 100,000 pounds of Nestle formula from the Netherlands to the US.\n\nThe commissioner shared that at the peak of the formula crisis, he had more than one “very tense” conversation with the head of Abbott – the company that makes popular formula labels like Similac and specialty formulas such as EleCare.\n\nCaliff also said he has not spoken directly with Biden about the infant formula issue – “I’ve talked a lot with Ron Klain,” Califf said of the President’s chief of staff – and that while he has not visited the Abbott plant in Sturgis, Michigan, behind the recalls, he hopes to do that soon.\n\nSenior administration officials who have been intimately involved in addressing the baby formula shortage told CNN that a key issue they are currently monitoring is a “variety problem” – where at any given moment, store shelves might carry a lot of some products, but none of others.\n\nThe single biggest factor causing this imbalance? “The root cause of everything is the fact that Sturgis had to shut down, and Sturgis is still not fully back online,” one official said recently.\n\n“How do we prevent this from happening again?”\n\nWhile administration officials are starting to feel increasingly better about the availability of baby formula in the US, with production levels so far this year outpacing 2021 levels, the shortage invited a barrage of criticism and questions about what other important commodities could be vulnerable to similarly grave supply disruptions.\n\nIn interviews with CNN, officials pointed to the infant formula crisis as having prompted a kind of reckoning – and admittedly a much-needed one – for the government to put better systems in place to analyze the nation’s supply chains and pinpoint, ahead of time, the areas of real vulnerabilities.\n\nThis inter-agency work is still in the early stages, but officials insist that the federal government is already better equipped to tackle supply chain disruptions, and that there is coordination, data-sharing and analysis among the various agencies that simply didn’t exist before.\n\nOne food product that officials point to as an example is meat, because the meat processing industry is highly concentrated. Another example is sunflower oil: Ukraine was the largest exporter of it before the war.\n\n“I’d say every commodity we regulate pretty much has a risk at this point, because as we look at the future of foods, climate change, international strife – the fact that the industries have gone to ‘just in time’ distribution systems, which keep a low inventory to reduce costs, creates a system which is vulnerable,” Califf said.\n\nOn the baby formula crisis, and what message he would want to deliver to concerned parents and caregivers, Califf said: “I’m a grandfather and I have grandchildren and I’ve had children myself. We at the FDA are very aware of the difficulty this has caused for families and we want them to know that we’re working hard until we get things back to normal and will continue to work hard to deal with it, every single day.”\n\nQ-and-A\n\nCNN: Why do you think in the month of October, parents and families are still having trouble finding baby formula? Why is it that the US is still having to fly in formula from abroad?\n\nCaliff: Well, I mean, first of all, I would just say that it has taken time obviously to not only fill the shelves, but we’ve got this other issue – something that I never thought I would be an expert in – called SKU consolidation. And while we’re confident that the amount of formula being produced is greater than the amount consumed for quite a number of weeks and many of the retailers have a supply in the intermediate distribution chains, the producers are not making all the different types and sizes of formula that they made before the shortage because what they do is consolidate their production, as I think you know, they’ve been working three shifts seven days a week. … There’s still going to be empty spots on the shelves because all the different types and sizes of the formula are not being produced and distributed.\n\n… There are going to be distribution inefficiencies, I guess you call them, where some places may not get the supply that they were used to getting in the past. So, I think there’s really good evidence that it’s getting better, but we’re not all the way there yet. It’s going take a bit more time for the reasons that I just gave.\n\nCNN: Is there an estimated timeline for when you think the baby formula situation will basically return to normal? Are we talking about a couple more weeks, a couple more months, by the end of the year?\n\nCaliff: Timeframes are treacherous, you know that. First of all, I’d say we have to describe what normal is. If you’re talking about pre-pandemic normal, I think that’s very unpredictable. If you’re talking about post-pandemic, pre-Abbott recall normal, I’d say we’re in the months, you know, a couple of months timeframe. Because, as I said, the production is outstripping the demand by quite a bit at this point. So, it’s just a matter of filling up all those intermediate distribution points.\n\nA really important factor: This is when I was not in the job yet but early – I still vividly remember early in the pandemic – how there were all those empty shelves just about everywhere and infant formula never got back to the pre-pandemic state. But definitely, you know, with the Abbott recall, things changed very dramatically, as you documented quite vividly on CNN. So, I think our goal right now is to get back … to the post-pandemic normal, which, and then we have to work on all the supply chains on just about everything that we regulate.\n\nCNN: Administration officials I’ve spoken to basically said there’s not a set timeline for when, specifically, the flights – Operation Fly Formula – are going to end. They may not necessarily have something scheduled right now, but that the door is remaining open in case they need something. Do you have any sort of prediction as to how long you think the US will need to continue bringing in formula from abroad?\n\nCaliff: I don’t think we’re using flights right this moment. And it would only be if something else happened that was unexpected, like a plant shutting down or some other phenomenon like that, that we would need it. Because remember, we tend to talk about domestic and foreign but the companies – the two companies that really have had this enormous market share in the US – are global companies. Abbott is a global company and Rickett is actually headquartered in the UK. So, all the different people that are now bringing formula in who weren’t before are developing their own normal routes of distribution without the need for government assistance. So, we don’t think that’s going to be needed unless something unexpected happens.\n\nCNN: What exactly is happening right now with the Abbott plant in Sturgis? Some of the senior officials I’ve spoken to recently – they point to the fact that, one, the plant shut down, and two, it is still not fully back online. And they say that Abbott is the single root cause for some of the ongoing issues.\n\nCaliff: Well, I’d say the Abbott plant is a very old plant. It’s been there for a long time. And there were multiple problems and then we had that flood, which was like a once-in-a-hundred-year event, you can’t – it’s hard to imagine you would have such bad luck. And that, you know, causes even more problems and you know, I would say right now the Abbott plant is pretty much fully back online, but they are in a normal period of maintenance every year.\n\nAgain, I was not an expert on infant formula, but I feel like I’ve become one now. Every year around early fall, it’s been the norm in the industry to shut down for a couple of weeks to do all the maintenance and repair that you need. And when that happens, you know they’re probably in an old plant like that, they’re likely to discover some things that they want to tidy up but right now Abbott is exceeding their prior production that they had in years past by making it up in other facilities, so we’re still producing a lot of formula. The plan right now is to get a predicted projected maintenance phase.\n\nCNN: Why did they need a separate maintenance phase? All year, going back to February, they were presumably doing maintenance, right? They are trying to get the plant back up and running. The flood happened, as you mentioned.\n\nCaliff: I just think, you know, it’s very hard to look at things while you’re working three shifts a day, seven days a week. You’re really need to sort of look at everything functioning. I just think it’s the norm for the maintenance of facilities. I must say I’m not an industrial production expert. But one thing that happened, which I think is really important, we now have a system where all of the companies are sending us their projections on what they’re going to produce. And we’re also able to track what people are buying. I’ll point out to you that this is voluntary. We’ve tried to get congressional authority to get supply chain data as a routine and we’ve been unsuccessful so far. But we are able to track – not only track but also predict – the companies, you know, since we got started on this are pretty much right on target. So yeah, it’s a reason … that we’re as confident as we can be that things are on track.\n\nCNN: Have you been to that plant?\n\nCaliff: I have not, but I’m looking forward to going. I want to – hope to make a visit with Congressman Upton and maybe others who are in the Michigan delegation. But I’ve been on numerous calls with the leadership as we worked through this.\n\nCNN: Can you give us a sense of what your communication with folks at Abbott has been like going back to February? Were those conversations ever heated? Did you ever just say – we’re ticked off over here and this is really problematic and you better fix it?\n\nCaliff: Well, I think it’s fair to say that things were very tense in the initial conversations. We had that period before we reached agreement on the consent decree. It took a while to reach that agreement and, you know, once we realized the extent of the status of the plan, we were insistent that it get fixed and, in fact, insistent that we needed a consent decree, which essentially gives us joint responsibility for the functioning of the plant. So, it was definitely tense until we reached a consent decree. But once you got past that step, I would say that discussions have been professional. They have a very deep knowledge of the degree of consternation.\n\nYou know, many of our people have been working seven days a week – many, many calls on nights and weekends. And we’re doing this on top of the normal work the FDA has to do in the midst of a pandemic. So, they’re aware of how much stress is put on us, but I will say since the consent decree, it’s been very professional. They have followed through on what they said they were going to do. When problems have occurred, and there have been some, they’ve let us know so that we can work on them together. And we have people essentially, either physically or virtually in the plant every day.\n\nCNN: You mean FDA officials?\n\nCaliff: Yeah. Either there physically or on regular calls that occur between FDA and Abbott about things that they’re working on.\n\nCNN: When you spoke with Abbott, especially at the height of the crisis, was that with the head of Abbott directly?\n\nCaliff: The head of Abbott, yeah. We’ve had multiple calls, I would say, and very direct. When issues are seen on either side, we’ve called each other to try to minimize any misperceptions that might occur about what needs to be done.\n\nCNN: How is all of this affecting people right now who use WIC to get baby formula? Is it fair to say that given the different state-by-state policies, there are people in certain places who are feeling the crisis more?\n\nCaliff: Obviously, the WIC program is very important to the entire United States. Over half of infant formula goes through the WIC program and these massive contracts that are given state by state. So, the ones that were Abbott states obviously were directly impacted and WIC had to scramble, and the states had to scramble to provide alternatives for families, and that definitely caused some problems. But even the states that weren’t Abbott contracts, because all the other manufacturers were scrambling to make up for the total deficit, also experienced hardship. And I feel like in the United States, when things go badly, it’s always the people that were in the lowest income have the hardest time and that’s true in our health care system, and I think it was true – we are very sensitive to it and try to, continue to try to do what we can to make up for it. But there’s no question that this is the hardest on the people in the lowest part of our income.\n\nCNN: What is it that WIC program participants are dealing with right now? Are the lowest income families having the hardest time?\n\nCaliff: Well, first of all, I’d say the people who run the WIC program, they’ve worked really hard. To my knowledge, everyone can get infant formula. But there’s no doubt that a number of individuals and families have had to make efforts and spend time that they otherwise would not have had to do in order to get it. There was a quote in The Atlantic by one of your reporter colleagues that got my attention a couple of weeks ago, which I think describes the problem in America, related to the pandemic but it’s a similar issue. The quote was that “technological solution walks into the penthouses of America, and diseases seep into the cracks in America.” And I think you know, those with more wealth and more means are more able to do what it takes to find the formula they need. It’s harder on people who have more stressed circumstances.\n\nCNN: Baby formula aside – what are the food items that have been identified by your agency as potentially vulnerable to this kind of supply chain disruption that we’ve seen with baby formula, where one plant shutting down or one company having a serious issue could lead to this kind of nationwide shortage?\n\nCaliff: I’d say every commodity we regulate pretty much has a risk at this point, because as we look at the future of foods, climate change, international strife – the fact that the industries have gone to ‘just in time’ distribution systems, which keep a low inventory to reduce costs, creates a system which is vulnerable.\n\nDon’t forget that we also have drug shortages and we have a shortage of – I’m a cardiologist, we got a major shortage of contrast media because, again, we had market consolidation and one of the two companies with most of the market had to shut down its plant in China, which is making its entire supply for the US, which meant that if you came out with a heart attack or a stroke, finding a contrast or an angiogram was hard to do.\n\nAnd there’s a special component of this that relates to food that I think is worth knowing about. Infant formula is complicated. Right? It’s over 30 ingredients that have to be there in a specified amount, because you’re trying to simulate mother’s milk which is, you know, developed over generations to be sustaining of infants who need to grow and thrive. Many of those natural ingredients are in short supply. Some of them come from the Ukraine in predominance and so the Defense Production Act has had to be used multiple times to divert raw ingredients into the infant formula supply. That is just a sign that we do have vulnerable supply chains at this point.\n\nCNN: Are there are there a couple of items that you could point to that are particularly vulnerable?\n\nCaliff: Right now, it’s infant formula. Sunflower oil is one that we talk about, quite a bit.\n\nCNN: Sunflower oil?\n\nCaliff: Ukraine.\n\nYou don’t normally think about international war being a cause of disruption of supply of food in the United States, but you know, we’ve become a global supply chain system. So, we’ve got to develop approaches that allow us to predict and preempt these things, and that’s a big part of what we’re trying to convince Congress would be helpful.\n\nCNN: Given what’s going on in the world, and particularly with the war in Ukraine, there’s no guarantee that the American people won’t see this kind of crisis with another highly important consumer item? It could happen?\n\nCaliff: Yes, and it could happen with other commodities, too. I mean, remember, we almost had a railroad strike and that would have had a huge impact on you know, getting commodities from Point A to Point B at the right time. We’ve become accustomed to having what we want just in time. And the stores are used to keeping their stocks at a at a lower level because of the just in time system. It is a very efficient system until something goes wrong, which is why we really need an information hub for all these things to coordinate. Each of the companies has very sophisticated data about its own supply chain, but there is no master system that puts them all together and seeing what the totality would look like, so when something goes bad with one of them, like the Abbott situation, the system is not prepared to deal with it.\n\nCNN: When you say yes, of course this could happen with other commodities too, after this year with the baby formula crisis, is the government at least is on a pathway, does it have a plan or is better equipped now to at least try to prevent this from happening?\n\nCaliff: Yeah, here’s what I’ll tell you. … So, I think the most under-heralded – of course I would always say the FDA is the most under-heralded, but other than the FDA – the most under-heralded part of the government system during the pandemic has been a supply chain effort, which involves all parts of government. And they deal with things every single day that require coordination by the government with enormous needs for communication across all the different federal entities to get the right stuff to the right place at the right time. You remember that toilet paper and all the other things where there were problems. Keeping that going and pre-empting shortages has been a huge effort that I don’t think it’s gotten enough credit or attention.\n\nObviously, when something goes wrong, like with infant formula, it gets a lot of attention. And that’s understandable. But successes go unheralded, because, you know, you sort of assume that things ought to work. There are a lot of people working on this. So, the knowledge is there. What I’m concerned about is that the industry by and large, and all of the industries who would regulate the supply chain as commercial confidential information, that’s part of a competitive society, is part of a competitive edge. If you have a better supply chain in your company than a competing company, that’s an advantage and they don’t want to fork over that information.\n\nCNN: Have you spoken directly to President Biden about the baby formula issue?\n\nCaliff: I’ve not. I’ve talked a lot with Ron Klain. So, I have not spoken with the President about it, and I feel like I very much have direct line of communication with Ron Klain when needed and I think he communicates pretty well with the President.\n\nCNN: When the President said earlier this year that he wasn’t aware of the seriousness of the baby formula issue until around April, that was surprising for some people to hear. Do you have any insight into why it was around April that he was told about the gravity of the situation?\n\nCaliff: Well, again, I’ll remind you, as I said, there are – the supply chain team was working on multiple potential vulnerabilities and if you followed the in-stock rates and other metrics, it really wasn’t till about April that things really started to change. So, I think I think they were monitoring a bunch of stuff and they likely brought it directly to his attention when it – when the numbers started to change in a significant way. That’s my best take on it.\n\nCNN: What do reporters covering the baby formula issue really need to know or that you think they misunderstand? And separately, for parents and families and caregivers – anything you would really want them to hear from you?\n\nCaliff: Well, first of all, with regard to parents and caregivers … I’m a grandfather and I have grandchildren and I’ve had children myself. We at the FDA are very aware of the difficulty this has caused for families, and we want them to know that we’re working hard until we get things back to normal and will continue to work hard to deal with it, every single day.\n\nWith regard to reporters, I think right now, there are two big, maybe three big issues that I hope the reporters will pay attention to. The first is explaining to people about this SKU consolidation issue. Just because there are empty spots on the shelves doesn’t mean that there’s not enough infant formula and that is not an easy concept to get across. In fact, the in-stock rates that so many people quote, is not actually a measure of the amount of formula available compared to the amount that used to be available. It’s a measure of the number of types of formula available. It’s different. It measures something different than what most people think intuitively when they look at the number.\n\nSo, that’s one thing because I think it’s really important if there is enough formula that people buy what they need and not feel the need to go out and over-purchase, which … may create shortages for other people.\n\nThe second thing is when I said about the supply chain in general. I think it’s fair for reporters to ask the question, what’s the right degree to which the government should have access to supply chain data? I don’t really care if it’s the FDA or some other entity, but you … can go to the National Academy of Science Report on supply chains and see why it’s so important that we deal with this issue.\n\nAnd the third one as you know, as the supplies get up, it’s time to pivot to the question of: How do we prevent this from happening again? And we got this market consolidation and several other factors that are in play that we need to come up with policies that are likely to make the system more resilient, one of which, of course as I’ve said is being able to monitor the supply chain so that we can have reserve and stock and backup plans for facilities and all the things that didn’t exist before.\n\nCNN: Did you ever think that as a cardiologist, you would be a baby formula expert by October 2022? Has that been an unexpected experience for you?\n\nCaliff: Well, you know, when I was commissioner in 2016, I learned that every day as commissioner, you come in and you hear about something you’ve never heard of before and need to deal with. But this was definitely not on my radar when I was going through confirmation, that infant formula would be the single thing that took up the largest amount of my time. But that’s the job – it’s wherever the problem is, to work on it. We’re fortunate to have a lot of experts here at the FDA that one can rely on, and the commissioner has a particular role. And I had a chance yesterday to actually do some cardiology discussion and it was kind of nice to talk about something where you’re the expert as opposed to the hundred other things that I need to deal with.\n\nI would also just make the point that the process of science and policy is something that’s generalizable. So, everybody’s an expert in something but in jobs like this, you need to be able to span the horizon.", "authors": ["Mj Lee"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}, {"url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-health/2020/02/28/coronavirus-arizona-updates-virus-travel-safety-more/4903384002/", "title": "LIVE Arizona coronavirus updates: New cases, closures, advisories", "text": "Arizona Republic\n\nThe spread of a highly contagious coronavirus has had wide-ranging global impacts, including in the financial markets and government travel policies.\n\nTHE LATEST: This blog has moved.

Here are answers to some frequently asked questions: Ask us a new question here.\n\nTop White House advisers predict as many as 240,000 US deaths from coronavirus\n\nMarch 31: Members of President Donald Trump’s administration laid out dire estimates Tuesday to underscore the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, a grim prediction they said was at the center of the president’s decision to extend strict social distancing guidelines through the end of April.\n\nFederal public health officials said that between 100,000 and 240,000 could succumb to the virus by the end of the year — making it one of the nation’s worst public health crises — said Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator.\n\nWithout intervention, Birx said, as many 2.2 million could have died.\n\nPresented to the president over the weekend, the data explains why Trump backed down from an earlier notion of “reopening” the country by Easter, or potentially opening parts of the nation that were less hard hit, officials said. Trump announced Sunday he would extend social distancing guidelines through April 30.\n\nAmericans abroad urged to come home\n\nMarch 31: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is making his advice to U.S. citizens still overseas during the coronavirus crisis simple: \"Americans who wish to return home from abroad should so immediately and make arrangements to accomplish that,\" he stressed during a Tuesday briefing.\n\nWhile Pompeo said his repatriation task force remains committed to bringing all Americans home, he said the window to do so is closing.\n\n\"We do not know how long the commercial flights in your countries may continue to operate,\" he said as airlines have already slashed international service. \"We can't guarantee the U.S. government's ability to arrange charter flights indefinitely where commercial options no longer exist.\"\n\nIn the meantime, he urged Americans to register with their nearest embassy or consulate or do so online via STEP, the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program.\n\nAt-home coronavirus tests halted despite progress\n\nMarch 31: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration abruptly shut down sales of at-home coronavirus test kits earlier this month but some companies say they haven’t given up.\n\nThe scarcity of tests in general, coupled with consumers' desire to take control, makes the idea both intriguing and controversial.\n\nCritics say home tests may be unreliable, might delay necessary treatment and could soak up scarce resources. Proponents say at-home test kits could save money and resources – and in the near future could play a critical role in tracking COVID-19.\n\nThe FDA leaped into action on March 20 when several startup companies started selling or preparing to sell at-home kits.\n\nIn strong language, the agency called at-home test kits “fraudulent.”\n\nFeds launch inquiry of 4 lawmakers who sold off stock\n\nMarch 30: Federal authorities are reviewing the stock sales of four lawmakers just before the market slide triggered by the coronavirus outbreak, a person familiar with the matter said Monday.\n\nFinancial disclosure statements indicated that Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C.; Jim Inhofe, R-Okla.; Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga.; and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; their spouses or advisers sold large chunks of stock around the time lawmakers received behind-the-scenes briefings about the severity of the coronavirus, which has claimed more than 2,900 lives in the USA.\n\nThe senators denied any wrongdoing, and Burr asked the Senate Ethics Committee to review his transactions involving up to $1.6 million. The federal inquiry, which was in its early stages, was first reported by CNN.\n\nGov. Ducey issues stay-at-home order\n\nMarch 30:Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday issued a statewide \"stay-at-home\" order to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, preventing Arizonans from leaving their residences except for food, medicine and other \"essential activities.\"\n\nThe directive, which also allows for outdoor exercise, will take effect at the close of business Tuesday and apply through at least April 30.\n\n\"Already, things have shut down to a large degree,\" the Republican leader said at an afternoon press briefing, with Department of Health Services Director Dr. Cara Christ at his side. \"They're going to shut down even further.\"\n\nDucey indicated he did not consider the mandate a \"shelter-in-place\" order, however, saying that phrase is reserved for nuclear attacks or active shooter situations.\n\n\"Our goal here is to protect the lives of those we love most and to ensure the health care system has the capacity to provide them with the care and comfort they deserve,\" he said. \"We want people to stay at home.\"\n\nArizona schools closed for the rest of the school year\n\nMarch 30: Gov. Doug Ducey has extended the closure of all Arizona schools through the end of this school year.\n\nIn a joint statement Monday with Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman, Ducey wrote that the decision was made to align with guidance from the federal government.\n\n\"These efforts are crucial, and we recognize that schools are making every effort possible to continue providing instruction during closures,\" they wrote in the statement.\n\nOn Friday, Ducey signed legislation to allow students to finish the school year from home.\n\nThe plan mandates that schools offer classes in an alternative format, presumably online, so students could finish out the school year from home. It also includes provisions to ensure seniors in high school graduate.\n\nGov. Ducey holds 2 p.m. press conference\n\nSummer Olympics to kick off in July 2021\n\nMarch 30: Less than a week after announcing that the Summer Games in Japan would be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, organizers have decided on a new start date of July 23, 2021, according to an International Olympic Committee spokesman. The closing ceremony will be held on Aug. 8. The Tokyo Olympics had previously been set to start almost exactly one year earlier, running from July 24 through Aug. 9.\n\nArizona coronavirus cases now surpass 1K, with 20 deaths\n\nMarch 30: Arizona cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, now number more than 1,000, with 20 known deaths, new numbers posted by the Arizona Department of Health Services on Monday show.\n\nThe total identified cases in Arizona is 1,157, according to the latest state figures, with every one of the state's 15 counties now recording at least one case.\n\nThat's an increase of confirmed 238 cases, or 26%, since Sunday.\n\nArizona's new coronavirus cases increase to 912; deaths rise to 16\n\nMarch 29: The number of identified new coronavirus cases in Arizona rose to 912 on Sunday — a roughly 17% increase from the day before, according to data released by the Arizona Department of Health Services.\n\nThe number of reported deaths related to COVID-19 also increased by one to a total of 16 on Sunday.\n\nMore than 2,000 coronavirus patients have died in U.S.\n\nMarch 28: Just one day after the U.S. surpassed 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, the nation witnessed another grim figure: More than 2,000 COVID-19 patients have died.\n\nTesting continues to expand across the nation, and the U.S. is seeing daily spikes in the number of reported cases. Nearly 500 coronavirus-related deaths were reported Saturday, up from 1,544 confirmed deaths 24 hours earlier, according to Johns Hopkins University's data dashboard.\n\nThe death toll was 2,010 Saturday shortly after 6 p.m. ET. That number is expected to rise steadily in the coming days and weeks, and health officials say the number of cases is likely higher due to lack of testing. Nearly 18,000 new cases were reported on both Wednesday and Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nMore than 120,000 cases have been reported in the U.S.\n\nCases have been reported in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. New York has reported the most deaths, followed by Washington, New York and Louisiana, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nFDA authorizes 5-minute coronavirus test the size of a toaster\n\nMarch 28: CHICAGO – A five-minute, point-of-care coronavirus test could be coming to urgent care clinics next week, and experts say it could be \"game-changing.\"\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued Emergency Use Authorization to Illinois-based medical device maker Abbott Labs on Friday for a coronavirus test that delivers positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes, the company said.\n\nThe company expects the tests to be available next week and expects to ramp up manufacturing to deliver 50,000 tests per day.\n\nDays before closing, Caesars Entertainment said 3,200 workers would lose jobs\n\nLAS VEGAS – Four days before closing nine hotel-casinos along the Las Vegas Strip to slow the spread of COVID-19, Caesars Entertainment notified state officials that 3,200 workers would lose their jobs, according to documents obtained by the Reno-Gazette Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nIn a March 14 letter to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation, the company announced the cuts would happen the following day.\n\n\"Given the unknown certainty surrounding COVID-19,\" wrote Servando Lara, Caesars' director of labor relations, \"we are unable to make a determination as to whether the layoff will be temporary or permanent.\"\n\nOne day after the letter arrived, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered that all non-essential businesses across the state shut down to arrest the spread of COVID-19.\n\nArizona COVID-19 deaths up to 15; reported cases rise to 773\n\nMarch 28: Arizona's death toll related to the new coronavirus rose to 15, according to data released by the Arizona Department of Health Services on Saturday morning.\n\nThe number of reported cases around the state also rose to 773.\n\nAs of Friday, there were 13 deaths and 665 reported cases around the state. Cases grew from Friday to Saturday by roughly 16%.\n\nOn Saturday, Pima County announced an additional coronavirus-related death, bringing the county total to five.\n\nThe man was a hospice patient between the age of 18 and 40, the county said.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether the Pima County death was one of the two additional deaths announced by the state Saturday morning.\n\nMaricopa County reported a growth of 53 cases, with 96 of the 452 cases in the county requiring hospitalization.\n\nMember of Alhambra school community infected\n\nMarch 28: Alhambra Elementary School District announced Friday that someone who attended the school's non-sponsored trip to Magic Mountain has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe news was shared via an email to parents from Richard Stinnett, the school's principal. The email did not reveal whether the infected person was a student or other party.\n\nStinnett relayed in the email that the trip took place from March 6-8, more than two weeks removed since the person in question received their positive test. School has not been in session since the trip, Stinnett wrote.\n\nStill, the email communicated that the infected person is recovering at home while quarantined and that no other cases have been linked to this case.\n\nDisney World, Disneyland to stay closed indefinitely\n\nMarch 27: Citing an \"increasingly complex crisis,\" Disneyland and Disney World are going to stay closed \"until further notice\" due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Walt Disney Company said Friday.\n\nThe company's decision dashes hopes that the fabled theme parks would reopen by next month, as had been previously announced. Earlier this week, Universal Orlando Resort and Universal Studios Hollywood announced they were extending their closures through April 19.\n\nFor Disney, the concern was about making sure park-goers and employees aren't exposed to the virus.\n\n\"While there is still much uncertainty with respect to the impacts of COVID-19, the safety and well-being of our guests and employees remains the Walt Disney Company’s top priority,\" the company said in an email statement. It said the decision was \"in line with direction provided by health experts and government officials.\"\n\nTrump signs $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus intended to halt economic meltdown\n\nMarch 27: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump signed a $2 trillion bipartisan stimulus package Friday that is intended to address the threat of economic disaster posed by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTrump signed the measure – the largest stimulus in U.S. history – in the Oval Office hours after it was approved by the House of Representatives, an unusually rapid approval that underscored dire warnings of a recession as companies began to lay off workers and U.S. consumers hunkered down in their homes to avoid spreading the virus.\n\n\"I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first,\" Trump said at the signing.\n\nWhile the president’s signature ended the legislative effort on Capitol Hill, it marked a beginning to the government’s work managing the crisis. Now the Trump administration must rapidly pump hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy in the form of direct payments, loans and grants to hard-hit industries such as the airlines.\n\nThe stimulus package will provide $1,200 checks to many Americans – and more for families – while making available hundreds of billions of dollars for companies to maintain payroll through the crisis. It significantly expands the nation’s unemployment safety net and it directs a huge infusion of cash to hospitals and other medical facilities on the front line of fighting the pandemic.\n\nMarkets rallied in recent days on the news that Republicans and Democrats had reached a deal on the stimulus, recovering some of the staggering losses of the past several weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average remained down Friday in midday trading.\n\nHouse approves historic coronavirus package, sending $2 trillion bill to Trump’s desk\n\nMarch 27: WASHINGTON – The House voted to pass a $2 trillion coronavirus relief package – the largest emergency aid bill in history – that will offer $1,200 checks to Americans, extensive unemployment benefits for those out of work and financial relief to businesses and the health care industry hard-hit by the worsening crisis.\n\nThe House’s vote allows the bill to head to President Donald Trump’s desk for final approval. Trump has signaled he will sign the bill.\n\nThe vote comes one day after the U.S. reached two grim milestones, becoming the country with the most coronavirus cases in the world and reporting a record 3.28 million workers who applied for unemployment benefits in one week – the highest number in history since the Department of Labor started tracking data in 1967. The massive package aims to offer a financial lifeline to Americans and businesses that are hurting while also offering reassurance to the markets, which have been battered by fears that shutdowns related to the pandemic could throw the economy into a deep recession.\n\nUS neglected its medical stockpile, whistleblowers say\n\nMarch 27: A secretive cache of medical supplies to save Americans from deadly disasters for years lacked the funding to prepare for a pandemic as widespread as the coronavirus, former managers of the stockpile told USA TODAY.\n\nOverseen by a cadre of scientists, disease specialists and others at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Strategic National Stockpile houses roughly $8 billion in inventory for rapid deployment to anywhere in the nation in under 12 hours.\n\nBut its inadequate supply of ventilators, respiratory masks and other personal protective equipment will leave critical shortages for U.S. hospitals scrambling to respond to the mounting coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe stockpile had just 16,600 of the breathing machines and an estimated 12 million N95 masks at the start of the pandemic – not enough for the country, USA TODAY reports.\n\nThe latest: US COVID-19 count\n\nUS passes Italy, China as nation with the most confirmed cases of COVID-19\n\nMarch 26: The U.S. surged past China and Italy to become the planet's most infected nation Thursday, a stark milestone in the coronavirus era - and a reminder of its deadly, culture-changing effects on American life.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins University dashboard showed the U.S. with 82,404 COVID-19 infections as of 6 p.m., ET, moving past Italy (80,589) and China (81,782). More than 1,100 people have died in the U.S.\n\nPart of the reason for the nation's top ranking is cause and effect: The U.S. has drastically ramped up its testing protocols in order to identify infected people and those who may be carriers of the virus. As testing has increased, so has the number of confirmed cases.\n\nWatch: Trump speaks on coronavirus\n\nMarch 26: On a day when jobless claims smashed a record and U.S. deaths surged past 1,100 as the coronavirus tightened its grip on America, the prospect of a stimulus package soon becoming reality helped propel a third consecutive stock market rally Thursday.\n\nThe Labor Department, in announcing the unemployment claims numbers for last week, said what Americans already knew – that layoffs hit the hospitality and food service industries particularly hard. Other industries that struggled included health care and social assistance, arts, entertainment and recreation, transportation and warehousing, and manufacturing industries, Labor said.\n\nCongress was trying to supply a ray of hope. The House is scheduled to take up a Senate-passed, $2 trillion emergency aid proposal Friday. Swift passage was expected – after an initial hangup, the package flew through the Senate on Wednesday night by a vote of 96-0. President Donald Trump has expressed a willingness to sign the measure.\n\nDow posts best 3-day gain since 1931\n\nMarch 26: U.S. stocks notched their first three-day rally in six weeks Thursday on hopes that Congress will quickly approve a coronavirus rescue package for the economy while the outbreak in China shows signs that it has been largely contained.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1,351.62 points, or 6.4%, to close at 22,552.17. The blue-chip average has advanced 21.3% over the past three days, its biggest three-day gain since 1931. Those gains helped push the Dow back into bull market territory after ending its 11-year historic run this month.\n\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 added 6.2% to finish at 2,630.07. It has gained 17.6% over the past three days, its best percentage gain since 1933.\n\nThe gains came even as data revealed a record number of Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week after a wave of layoffs from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nArizona coronavirus cases top 500, with 8 known deaths\n\nMarch 26: Confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, topped 500 on Thursday, with eight known deaths, state numbers show.\n\nIdentified cases now total 508 across the state. Maricopa County has just shy of 300 cases.\n\nThe level of community spread, as listed on the state health department’s website, went from moderate to “widespread.” Community spread means the patient had no history of traveling to regions of the world affected by new coronavirus, and also had no known contact with anyone infected by it.\n\nHere's the difference between shelter-in-place and quarantine, and what police can enforce\n\nMarch 26: On March 19, California Gov.

But the change is not clinically significant, and experts say it shouldn’t cause worry.\n\n“The bottom line is, we really think these findings are reassuring for health and reproductive health,” and they dovetail with similarly reassuring data on the safety of Covid-19 vaccines regarding pregnancy and fertility, Dr. Alison Edelman, an OB/GYN and professor at the Oregon Health & Science University, Portland and the study’s lead researcher, told CNN.\n\nBut there is an individual relationship with the menstrual cycle that’s much more than clinical, Edelman said. And this research provides concrete information to help people understand what to expect, just like any other side effects.\n\n“Let’s say nobody told you that you were going to get a fever (after getting the Covid-19 vaccine). It’d be like, ‘What just happened?’ ” she said. “And people have different relationships with their menstrual cycle. For some people, maybe they’re planning pregnancy or trying to avoid a pregnancy. Even one day of change – and that’s a mean – can feel uncomfortable.”\n\nThe researchers note that the average increase in the length of menstrual cycle “appears to be driven largely” by women who received both doses of an mRNA vaccine – either Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna – within one menstrual cycle. For this group, cycle length increased by an average of about two days. But the change was only temporary and resolved within a couple months, the study found. There was not enough data to say how long the change lasted in the other women.\n\nRegulation of the menstrual cycle can be affected by daily life, environment and health stressors. The researchers ruled out pandemic-related stress as a cause of the changes.\n\nHowever, they note that mRNA vaccines create a similar robust immune response that could affect the regulation of the menstrual cycle temporarily.\n\nAn acute severe illness, such as Covid-19, could be “catastrophic” to this regulation, sometimes permanently, they wrote.\n\nOverall, only about 5% of vaccinated women had a clinically significant change in their cycle of more than eight days, but this rate was about the same among unvaccinated women. Neither vaccinated nor unvaccinated women in the study had a change in the length of their period specifically.\n\nIn August, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced an investment of about $1.7 million to support five research teams in studying the potential effects of Covid-19 vaccines on menstruation.\n\nThis is the first of those studies to publish, an incredibly quick turnaround time for such research.\n\nDr. Diana Bianchi, director of the NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, told CNN that the investment in this research was a direct response to concerns from the American public.\n\n“We were worrying that perhaps the lack of information was contributing to vaccine hesitancy in reproductive age women,” said Bianchi, who was not involved directly in the research. There was a desperate need to have scientific evidence to communicate with women about what they can expect when they get vaccinated, and time was of the essence, she said.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation survey from December found that nearly 60% of women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant said they were not confident that the COVID-19 vaccines are safe.\n\nBut evidence contradicting those worries continues to accrue.\n\nA study published Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that women who are vaccinated against Covid-19 during pregnancy face no increased risk for preterm or low-weight births.\n\nThe CDC recommends vaccination for all women who are pregnant, who were recently pregnant, who are trying to become pregnant or who may become pregnant in the future. Yet vaccine uptake among pregnant women is low: The latest data shows that only about 40% of pregnant women have been vaccinated.\n\n“The study, on the one hand, does validate what some women were saying on social media,” Bianchi said. “But overall, at a population health level, this slight change is really not of clinical significance. It should not affect fertility, and the benefits of being vaccinated and not getting Covid – even a mild version of the Omicron variant – are so much greater. You really should not be hesitant to be vaccinated.”\n\nShe also credits women on social media with calling attention to the fact that most clinical trials do not collect data on menstrual cycles, a signal of health and potential fertility that Bianchi says the NIH considers to be like a vital sign.\n\n“Most clinical research trials have not routinely collected information on how an intervention affects the menstrual cycle. To my knowledge, this is the first time that information has been brought up that a vaccine might affect the menstrual cycle. You don’t hear this with a flu vaccine, for example,” Bianchi said. “So we’re hoping that this is really bringing awareness to the importance of collecting information on the menstrual cycle when any intervention is contemplated.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe study researchers analyzed data from about 4,000 women who used the Natural Cycles app to track menstruation, including about 2,400 who became vaccinated over the course of the study and about 1,600 who remained unvaccinated.\n\nThis study does not specifically address fertility or other possible changes in menstrual cycles, such as symptoms or unscheduled bleeding. Researchers analyzed data only from women who typically experience regular menstruation cycles, but they note that many do not fit into this category.", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/01/06"}]}

Australia and the US were so worried that they sent delegations to the Pacific island, hoping to stop the agreement.\n\nBut China announced the deal had been signed on Tuesday, before the US delegation even had a chance to touch down.\n\nThough details of the final agreement haven’t been released, some onlookers say the agreement makes Australia less safe and threatens to further destabilize the Solomon Islands, where there’s already been backlash over the government’s close relationship with Beijing.\n\nBut beyond the political and security fears, experts say the situation is a reality check for Australia and its partners that they need to adopt a different approach to China’s rising influence.\n\n“Australia and the United States still haven’t woken up to the reality of Chinese power and how we’re going to deal with it,” said Hugh White, an emeritus professor of strategic studies at Australian National University, who previously worked as a senior adviser to the Australian defense minister and prime minister. “In both Canberra and Washington, they think that somehow we can make China go away, put China back in its box.”\n\nHow the pact came about\n\nConcerns over the pact had been swirling for weeks.\n\nAccording to a leaked draft document – which CNN has not been able to verify – the Solomons would have the ability to request police or military personnel from China to maintain social order or help with disaster relief.\n\nThe agreement appeared to relate to violent protests that rocked the country’s capital Honiara in November last year that were partly sparked by anger over the government’s decision to cut ties with Taiwan and switch allegiance to Beijing.\n\nProtesters targeted parts of Honiara’s Chinatown, prompting Sogavare to request help from Australia under a bilateral security treaty the two countries signed in 2017.\n\nSmoke rises from burnt out buildings in Honiara's Chinatown on November 26, 2021 after two days of rioting. CHARLEY PIRINGI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrom the Solomon Islands’ perspective, the separate agreement with China may have appealed, as it allowed the country to diversify its security relationship and leverage political posturing in the region, said Tarcisius Kabutaulaka, a political scientist at the University of Hawaii who hails from the Solomon Islands.\n\nBut others worry the agreement could be the first stage in a bigger plan – to establish a permanent Chinese military presence on the islands.\n\nThe reaction to Tuesday’s announcement of a signed pact was swift.\n\nIn a joint statement, the US, Japan, Australia and New Zealand said the pact poses “serious risks to a free and open Indo-Pacific.”\n\nSolomon Islands’ Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare insisted Wednesday the agreement doesn’t include permission for China to establish a military base, and urged critics to respect the country’s sovereign interests. “We entered into an arrangement with China with our eyes wide open, guided by our national interests,” he said.\n\nThe Chinese national flag flies outside the Chinese Embassy in Honiara, Solomon Islands, April 1, 2022. Charley Piringi/AP\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin stressed that the “open, transparent and inclusive” agreement doesn’t “target any third party.”\n\nBut despite the reassurances, there’s still little detail about what’s been signed – and onlookers say that in itself is worrying.\n\n“There’s still a lot we don’t know about what the agreement itself actually says, and also about what it will lead to,” said Australian National University’s White.\n\nPolitical scientist Kabutaulaka said he thought it was unlikely China would build a conventional military base in the Solomons because it would create a lot of “negative publicity” for Beijing, inside and outside the island nation.\n\nBut experts say that doesn’t mean China won’t have a military presence on the island – of some form.\n\nIf China does have the ability to bring ships and military personnel to the Solomons as the unverified draft document laid out, then there’s no real need for a physical military base, Kabutaulaka said.\n\nMihai Sora, an expert in Australian foreign policy in the Pacific at Australian think tank the Lowy Institute, pointed to Djibouti as a country that signed a security agreement that evolved into a naval base that Beijing refers to as a logistics facility.\n\nThe prospect of a Chinese base in the Pacific is unsettling for the US, which also has military bases in the region that are becoming more strategically important as China expands its military presence in the South China Sea. It’s also unsettling for Australia, which potentially faces the prospect of Chinese ships docking not far from home – the Solomons is around 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) from Australia’s northeastern coast.\n\n“It’s probably true that it would mean Australia is less secure as a result of this agreement,” Kabutaulaka said.\n\nBut, says White, a Chinese military base in the tiny nation only becomes a real issue for Australia during any potential conflict with China. The significance of any base hinges on how well Australia manages its relationship with China – a relationship that’s become increasingly fraught in recent years.\n\n“In practical terms … I don’t think that does nearly as much damage to Australia’s security as a lot of other people do,” White said. “It is a significant issue if we find ourselves in a major war.”\n\nAustralian Army soldiers talk with locals during a community engagement patrol through Honiara on November 27, 2021. CPL Brandon Grey/Australian Department of Defence/Getty Images\n\nWhat the future holds\n\nThe lack of public detail about what’s in the pact is not only concerning for the Solomon Islands’ international partners. Inside the small nation, uncertainty about what it contains has already prompted criticism.\n\n“It’s clear to me that the vast majority of ordinary Solomon islanders do not want a base here, or even this deal. A majority do not want China here at all in the first place,” the nation’s opposition leader, Matthew Wale, told Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s The Strategist.\n\nSome have suggested the deal itself could exacerbate tensions between those who support closer China ties and those who do not.\n\n“The discourse about geopolitical competition is creating divisions that could become domestically troubling,” said Kabutaulaka.\n\n“There is also a need for the international community, and for Solomon Islanders in particular, to look at the challenges internally that then created the kinds of things we saw in November of last year, that then in turn created the need for Solomon Islands to sign the security agreement with China.”\n\nThose challenges include economic inequality between islanders, with some taking their anger out on Chinese businesses they see as a symbol of closer ties with the mainland.\n\nBut the agreement also sends a much bigger message: that Australia and its allies’ approaches in the region isn’t working.\n\nAustralia has long talked up the idea of the “Pacific family.” But according to White, Australia pays little attention to the Pacific unless there’s questions about security. And more than that, Australia and its allies are still stuck in the past, imagining that China’s power can be minimized and those countries can remain the dominant powers in the region, he said.\n\n“More and more over the last few years, Australia has found itself moving to a position where our approach to managing the rise of China is to try and stop it happening,” he said. “That’s not going to work. Australia has to learn to live with Chinese power – and that includes Chinese expanded influence in the southwest Pacific.”\n\n“It just poses a challenge to us to lift our game to maintain our influence there – and that’s something we should be doing anyway.”", "authors": ["Julia Hollingsworth"], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/politics/white-house-pacific-island-summit/index.html", "title": "Biden hosts first ever US-Pacific Island Country Summit in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden is hosting the first ever US-Pacific Island Country Summit this week, a multi-day event in Washington focused on cooperation with the United States’ countries in the Pacific region.\n\nBiden’s effort to strengthen ties with the nations by having the summit comes amid the US’ increased focus on countering China’s global influence, and the gathering has already challenged American efforts to engage in strategic partnerships in the region.\n\nIn remarks on Thursday at the State Department with the Pacific leaders, Biden said, “A great deal of the history of our world is going to be written in the Indo-Pacific over the coming years and decades. And the Pacific islands are a critical voice in shaping that future. And that’s why my administration has made it a priority to strengthen our partnership with your countries.”\n\nLater Thursday, Biden will host the Pacific leaders for dinner at the White House and participate in an official family photo. A senior administration official told foreign pool reporters who cover the White House that the leaders will also on Thursday meet with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other members of Congress, as well as business groups at the US Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe summit kicked off on Wednesday when Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed leaders at the State Department and took part in events with several senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Gina Raimondo and Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry.\n\nWhile other presidents in the past have held summits with Pacific nations and the US, all Pacific Island countries have been invited to Washington for Biden’s summit. Leaders or representatives will be present from the Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Nauru and Vanuatu. Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretary General are attending as observers.\n\nOn Wednesday, amid a broad set of announcements about new commitments to the Pacific region, the White House said that “the United States has directly provided over $1.5 billion to support the Pacific Islands over the past decade and today has announced over $810 million in additional expanded programs.” The US will also recognize the Cook Islands and Niue.\n\nThe White House unveiled a nine-point declaration outlining the commitments, which focus on: supporting the US-Pacific partnership, building American capacity in the region, coordinating with allies and partners, climate, the economy, security and maritime cooperation, cyber security and connectivity, Covid-19 and health security and addressing war legacies.\n\nThe administration released a US-Pacific Island Strategy for the first time on Wednesday – a plan meant to complement the earlier release of the Indo-Pacific strategy.\n\nNotably, the strategy includes efforts to expand US diplomatic missions in the Pacific and commits to deploying additional personnel across the region. The strategy would also establish the first US envoy to the Pacific Island Forum and make several climate commitments, increasing the presence of Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Department of Defense in the area.\n\n“The purpose of this document is to make it obviously consistent with the goals and objectives of our larger framing. But this is specifically aimed at the concerns and the objectives in the Pacific as a whole,” a senior administration official previewing the summit said.\n\nThat official said that the summit is meant to address the most “daunting challenges of the Pacific” including on climate change, health concerns, education training, jobs, challenges associated with recovery from Covid-19 and overfishing. The White House has worked closely in the last months with Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Great Britain and others on these issues, the official added.\n\nThe Marshall Islands earlier this month suspended talks to renew its security partnership with the US, citing the longstanding impact of US nuclear testing in the area some 70 years ago.\n\nThe declaration unveiled on Thursday indicates that the US is “exploring (unexploded ordnance) assistance options for Kiribati and the Marshall Islands in late 2022 and maintains a Quick Reaction Force to support (unexploded ordnance) engagements across the Pacific at the request of host nation partners.”\n\nChina has been expanding its ties to countries in the Pacific Ocean in recent years, and Beijing signed a security pact with the Solomon Islands in April, promising cooperation in trade and education.\n\nNations including the US and Australia expressed concerns following the announcement, and the Chinese government has denied that the country will set up a military base on the Solomon Islands.\n\nDespite earlier reports suggesting the Solomon Islands would not sign onto the declaration, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that the leaders involved in the summit have come “come together around a declaration of partnership between the US and the Pacific, one that shows that we have a shared vision for the future and a determination to build that future together.”\n\n“So I’m very pleased that we have this today, that we’ve agreed on it, and it will give us a road map for the work that we’re doing in the future,” he added.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/08/asia/indonesia-us-military-exercises-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "title": "Joint US-Indonesia war games to expand to 14 nations as tensions ...", "text": "Jakarta, Indonesia CNN —\n\nThe Indonesian and United States militaries are expanding their annual bilateral exercises to 14 participating countries, the Indonesian Army said in a news release Thursday.\n\nTroops from the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Canada will be among those joining the Garuda Shield 2022 exercises from August 1 to 14, the army said. The 16th edition of the war games will include live-fire exercises, special operations and aviation components among other disciplines, it added.\n\nThe expansion of the exercises comes at a time of simmering tension in the region, with analysts saying the move signals Indonesia has moved closer to the US than China in military cooperation.\n\nLast year’s Garuda Shield involved two US Army divisions – about 1,000 soldiers – as well as their Indonesian counterparts in what the US Army said was the largest edition of the war games to date.\n\n“The two-week Garuda Shield joint-exercise continues to solidify the U.S. – Indonesia Major Defense Partnership and advances cooperation in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” a US Army statement said in advance of last year’s exercises.\n\nIndonesia did not give an estimation of how many troops from each of the 14 countries would participate in this year’s Garuda Shield.\n\nThe US military and US Embassy in Jakarta had no immediate comment on the exercises.\n\nSouth China Sea disputes\n\nIndonesia sits on the southern edges of the South China Sea, which has been a hotbed of military activity over the past few years as China has militarized disputed islands there and the US and its partners have challenged those claims.\n\nIn March, China’s state-run Global Times tabloid accused US Adm. John Aquilino, the head of the US Indo-Pacific Command, of attempting to copy the Ukraine crisis in the Asia-Pacific, rallying allies, partners and other countries in the region to confront China.\n\nThe Global Times comments came after Aquilino took journalists on a flight over the South China Sea to highlight Beijing’s militarization of the disputed islands.\n\nAnalysts say Indonesia has long tried to avoid taking sides in the US-China dispute in the South China Sea.\n\nBut they note that in the past year Beijing has been assertive in pushing its claims near the Natuna Islands in an area inside Indonesia’s Exclusive Economic Zone but also inside China’s “nine-dash line,” under which Beijing claims control over almost all of the South China Sea.\n\nAn Indonesian source said China’s current behavior is increasing the risk of conflict in the region as nations boost their military presence, including Indonesia, which has strengthened its forces around the Natuna Islands.\n\nBut don’t expect Jakarta to call out Beijing directly, said Collin Koh, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\n\nIndonesia “may avoid megaphone diplomacy and directly confronting … China over the South China Sea issues, but it’ll undertake actions that subtly signal to Beijing – and back home to the domestic audience – its desire to safeguard its national interests,” Koh said.\n\nHe called the expansion of the Garuda Shield war games “especially noteworthy” as “Indonesia is always cautious about signaling where it comes to sensitivities surrounding the South China Sea issues” and its ties with the United States and China.\n\n“Clearly Indonesia wishes to engage in external balancing in the South China Sea, while using this as a platform to project its stature and influence in terms of multilateral defense diplomacy,” Koh said.\n\nThe Indonesian source noted that Indonesia and China once held joint military exercises called “Sharp Knife,” but the last iteration of those was in 2014.\n\nNow, the source said, in terms of military cooperation Indonesia is clearly closer to the US than China.\n\nThe source also said Indonesia has long maintained close military ties with Japan and Australia, so their inclusion in Garuda Shield 2022 should not be surprising.\n\nBut the source said, because Japan and Australia like the US have been highly critical of China’s actions in the South China Sea, the news of the August

better police its exclusive economic zones.\n\nThe step follows an incident last week when a United States Coast Guard cutter, the Oliver Henry, was unable to make a routine port call because the government did not respond to a request for it to refuel and provision.\n\n“We have requested our partners to give us time to review, and put in place our new processes, before sending further requests for military vessels to enter the country,” Prime Minister Manesseh Sogavare said in a statement.\n\n“These will universally apply to all visiting naval vessels,” he said in the statement his office emailed to Reuters.\n\nSogavare added that he wanted to build national capacity to police the Pacific island nation’s exclusive economic zones.\n\nIn a speech on Tuesday afternoon to welcome the visiting US Navy hospital ship USNS Mercy, Sogavare said last week’s delay over the Oliver Henry was because the information had not been sent to his office on time.\n\nHe also confirmed delays in approving entry for the British navy ship HMS Spey, which also aborted its planned port call, the statement said.\n\nAs a result of the two incidents, the Solomon Islands is reviewing the approval procedures, it said.\n\nEarlier, the US Embassy in Canberra, the Australian capital, had said the Solomon Islands had notified it of a moratorium on navy vessels entering its ports.\n\n“On Aug. 29, the United States received formal notification from the government of Solomon Islands regarding a moratorium on all naval visits, pending updates in protocol procedures,” the embassy said in a statement.\n\nThe Mercy had arrived before the moratorium, the embassy said, adding that it was monitoring the situation.\n\nThe Solomon Islands has had a tense relationship with the US and its allies since striking a security pact with China this year.\n\nThe Oliver Henry was on patrol for illegal fishing in the South Pacific for a regional fisheries agency at the time it sought entry to refuel at Honiara, the Solomons’ capital.\n\nOn Monday, a US State Department spokesperson called the lack of clearance for the Oliver Henry “regrettable,” saying the US was pleased the Mercy had received clearance.\n\nSeparately, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said it was regrettable that “we’ve seen the Chinese try to bully and coerce nations throughout the Indo-Pacific to do their bidding and to serve what they believe their selfish national security interests are, rather than the broader interests of a free and open Indo-Pacific.”", "authors": [], "publish_date":

Reopening info for Bali, UK, Cayman Islands", "text": "Americans with a bad case of wanderlust may have to wait to vacation abroad – and while some countries have reopened or announced target dates to reopen, the pickings may be slim for a while.\n\nParts of the Caribbean and Europe have reopened from coronavirus restrictions, but the European Union extended its travel ban on Americans.\n\nThe EU first started lifting international travel restrictions on July 1, welcoming visitors from 14 countries, including Canada, South Korea and Australia. The U.S. was left off that initial list, and Americans remain barred from visiting the bloc.\n\nThough the U.S. State Department has lifted its advisory on avoiding international travel issued in March, the agency is returning to its system of country-specific advisories, noting that the customary level 1 through 4 advisories for specific countries on Travel.State.gov provide more detailed information about specific conditions in individual countries. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has a travel notice system and recommends against \"nonessential travel\" to much of the world.\n\nWhile this is by no means an exhaustive list, here's an update on some of the countries that are most popular with American travelers:\n\nLearn more: Best travel insurance\n\nCanada\n\nBorder status report: Americans and Canadians won't be able to cross the border in either direction for nonessential travel until Aug. 21, according to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nWhat can travelers expect once they're allowed in? There's a major loophole in the border-closure policy: The U.S. Embassy in Ottawa said the order does not apply to \"air, rail, or sea travel at this time, but does apply to commuter rail and ferry travel.\"\n\nAccording to the Canadian Border Services Agency, anyone who is not a citizen or permanent resident of that country must prove they are traveling for an essential purpose, are only transiting or are an immediate family member of a citizen or permanent resident. They must also have a plan to quarantine for 14 days, unless exempted.\n\n'It was the right thing': Trudeau announces extension of US-Canada border closure\n\nMexico\n\nWhen will the border open? Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf announced that theland border with Mexico would remain closed until at least Aug. 20.\n\nBut like the U.S.-Canadian closure order, the Mexican version does not apply to air, rail or sea travel, except for commuter rail and ferry travel.\n\nCosta Rica\n\nBorder status report: While the Central American country reopened to visitors from Europe and Canada on Aug. 1, it hasn't said when it will welcome back Americans.\n\nWhat can tourists expect?

It is unclear when exactly Pelosi will land in Taipei.\n\nThe US official added that Defense Department officials are working around the clock on monitoring any Chinese movements in the region and securing a plan to keep her safe.\n\nPelosi arrived in Singapore on Monday for the first official stop of the Asia tour, where she met with the country’s president, prime minister and other top officials.\n\nUS House Speaker Nancy Pelosi meets with Malaysian politicians on August 2. Fathin Suhaira/Bernama\n\nOn Tuesday, Malaysia’s state media Bernama confirmed that Pelosi and a congressional delegation had arrived in the country and were scheduled to meet with the prime minister and parliament speaker.\n\nThe delegation’s itinerary includes stops in South Korea and Japan, but no official mention has been made of a visit to Taiwan.\n\nDuring a regular foreign ministry briefing Monday, China warned against the “egregious political impact” of Pelosi’s planned visit to the self-governing island that China claims as a part of its territory and reiterated that its military “won’t sit by idly” if Beijing feels its “sovereignty and territorial integrity” is being threatened.\n\n“We would like to tell the US once again that China is standing by, and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army will never sit idly by. China will take resolute responses and strong countermeasures to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters, when asked about the fallout from Pelosi leading a congressional delegation to Taipei.\n\n“As for what measures, if she dares to go, then let’s wait and see,” Zhao added.\n\nUS House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, meeting with Malaysian politicians on August 2. Fathin Suhaira/Bernama\n\nThough China’s military did not mention Taiwan, the People’s Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command said it would “bury incoming enemies” in a video posted online Monday showing off its weaponry and fighting tactics. “Firmly stand by and ready for the fighting command; Bury all incoming enemies,” a message posted on Weibo said.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated the administration’s line that it is Pelosi’s decision whether she visits, adding, “we do not know what Speaker Pelosi intends to do.”\n\n“Congress is an independent, coequal branch of government,” Blinken said at the United Nations on Monday afternoon. “The decision is entirely the Speaker’s.”\n\nBlinken said that such a visit has precedent, noting past speakers and members of Congress have visited Taiwan.\n\n“And so if the speaker does decide to visit and China tries to create some kind of crisis or otherwise escalate tensions, that would be entirely on Beijing,” Blinken said. “We are looking for them, in the event she decides to visit, to act responsibly and not to engage in in any escalation going forward.”\n\nNational Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby earlier on Monday that the Biden administration will support Pelosi on a trip to Taiwan.\n\n“We want to make sure that when she travels overseas, she can do so safely and securely and we’re going to make sure of that. There is no reason for the Chinese rhetoric. There is no reason for any actions to be taken. It is not uncommon for congressional leaders to travel to Taiwan,” Kirby told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on “New Day.”\n\n“We shouldn’t be as a country – we shouldn’t be intimidated by that rhetoric or those potential actions. This is an important trip for the speaker to be on and we’re going to do whatever we can to support her,” Kirby continued.\n\nAsked if the US was prepared for fallout with China over the visit, Kirby said that “there is no change to our policy. No change to our focus on trying to keep a free and safe and open Indo-Pacific.”\n\nUS House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, left, and Singapore President Halimah Yacob shake hands at the Istana Presidential Palace in Singapore, Monday, Aug. 1. Mohd Fyrol/Singapore Ministry of Communications and Information/AP\n\nThe issue of Taiwan remains one of the most contentious. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping discussed it at length in a two-hour-and-17-minute phone call on Thursday, as tensions mounted between Washington and Beijing.\n\n“The question of Taiwan is the most sensitive, important core issue in China-US relations,” said Chinese Ambassador to the US Qin Gang at the Aspen Security Forum in July.\n\nWhile Biden has said publicly the US military did not believe it was a good time Pelosi to visit Taiwan, he has stopped short of telling her directly not to go, according to two sources.\n\nAdministration officials have worked over recent weeks to apprise the House speaker of the risks of visiting the democratic, self-governing island of 24 million residents, including in briefings from Pentagon and other administration officials. But Biden did not believe it was his place to tell her she should not go, and he has avoided commenting publicly about her trip since his initial statement on July 21.\n\nCNN Beijing bureau chief on why the timing of Biden-Xi call is critical 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nBiden said last month that the US military opposed Pelosi visiting Taiwan, though since then has refused to elaborate on the warnings. The White House has said it is up to the House speaker where she travels.\n\nStill, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently said he’d discussed a visit to Asia with Pelosi.\n\nThe administration takes extra care for Pelosi’s security when she travels overseas because she is in the presidential line of succession.\n\nAdministration officials are concerned Pelosi’s trip comes at a particularly tense moment, as Xi is expected to seek an unprecedented third term at the upcoming Chinese Communist Party congress. Chinese party officials are expected to begin laying the groundwork for that conference in the coming weeks, putting pressure on the leadership in Beijing to show strength.\n\nOfficials also believe the Chinese leadership doesn’t completely grasp the political dynamics in the United States, leading to a misunderstanding over the significance of Pelosi’s potential visit. The officials say China may be confusing Pelosi’s visit with an official administration visit, since she and Biden are both Democrats. Administration officials are concerned that China doesn’t separate Pelosi from Biden much, if at all.\n\nWhy one former diplomat is worried about Pelosi's visit to Taiwan 02:58 - Source: CNN\n\nPelosi has long been a critic of the Chinese Communist Party. She has met with pro-democracy dissidents and the Dalai Lama – the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader who remains a thorn in the side of the Chinese government. In 1991, Pelosi unfurled a black-and-white banner in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square to commemorate victims of the 1989 massacre, which said, “To those who died for democracy.” In recent years, she voiced support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Chinese embassy to the United States has objected to her expected trip, which was planned for April before Pelosi tested positive for Covid-19, urging members of Congress to tell the speaker not to make it.\n\n“I would say there’s been a full-court press from the Chinese embassy to discourage a trip to Taiwan,” Washington Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen, the co-chair of Congress’ US-China working group, told CNN. “I just don’t think it’s their business to tell us what we ought to be doing. That was my message back.”\n\nLiu Pengyu, spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the US, responded that his office is in “regular contact” with members of Congress, including Larsen.\n\n“On the Taiwan question, we have made our stance loud and clear,” Pengyu said. “The Embassy is making all our efforts to prevent the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the stability of China-US relations being damaged by the potential visit of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.”\n\n“We hope serious consequences could be avoided,” he added. “This is in the common interests of both China and the US.”\n\nMany Democrats and Republicans in Congress said it was Pelosi’s right to travel to Taiwan.\n\n“It is Speaker Pelosi’s decision alone on whether or not to travel to Taiwan, not any other country,” said Illinois Republican Rep. Darin LaHood, Larsen’s Republican counterpart on the US-China working group. “In our democratic system – we operate with separate but equal branches of government.”\n\n“It is inappropriate for foreign governments, including the Chinese government, to attempt to influence the ability or the right to travel for the speaker, members of Congress, or other US government officials to Taiwan or anywhere else around the world,” he added.\n\nOther members appeared to be more cautious about the diplomatically sensitive trip.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Rep. Judy Chu, the first Chinese American woman elected to Congress, said she has “always supported Taiwan.”\n\nBut when asked whether a Taiwan trip now would send the wrong message, Chu said, “You could look at it two ways. One is that the relationships are very strained right now. But on the other hand, you could say maybe that’s when Taiwan also needs to be shown the strength and the support.”\n\nWhen asked what she thought, she said, “I leave it up to those who are going to make that decision.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details Monday.", "authors": ["Eric Cheung Kylie Atwood Alex Rogers Kevin Liptak", "Eric Cheung", "Kylie Atwood", "Alex Rogers", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/asia/putin-g20-bali-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Putin will not attend G20 summit in person, Russian embassy says ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN —\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin will not attend in person a summit of leaders from the Group of 20 nations in Bali next week, the Russian embassy in Indonesia told CNN on Thursday.\n\nPutin will be represented by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, said Yulia Tomskaya, the chief of protocol at the embassy.\n\nTomskaya added that Putin is still deciding if he will join one of the meetings virtually.\n\nIndonesia’s Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, also said that Putin would not attend. Pandjaitan, who is helping to coordinate the summit, said the Russian President would be represented by “senior officials.”\n\nPutin’s decision not to attend the G20 summit in person saves him the embarrassment of being confronted – or shunned – by other world leaders over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The meeting will take place just days after the Kremlin announced Russian forces would retreat from a large swathe of Kherson – one of four Ukrainian regions Putin previously said Russia planned to annex in violation of international law.\n\nIn the lead up to the event, Western countries and Ukraine have pressured Indonesia, the G20 host, to step up its condemnation of Moscow and withdraw its invitation to Putin for the summit. Since invading Ukraine in late February, western democracies have treated Russia and Putin as a pariah on the world stage.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, who is attending the summit, said in March Russia should be ejected from the G20, a multilateral organization comprised of 19 of the world’s major economies and the European Union. Senior members of Biden’s administration have walked out of G20 events where Russian delegates are present.\n\nWhen asked if he would meet Putin one-on-one in Bali during an exclusive interview last month, Biden said he did not see a good reason to do so but it would “depend on specifically what he wanted to talk about.” Biden said if Putin wanted to discuss the jailed American basketball star Brittney Griner then he would be open to talking.\n\nJakarta has resisted pressure to single out Russia and has sought to remain a neutral position. It has invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the summit as a guest.\n\nZelensky has said that Ukraine would not take part in the G20 summit if Putin attends. The Ukrainian President is expected to join the meetings virtually.\n\nChina’s leader is attending\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping, who met Putin in Uzbekistan in September, is also expected to attend the summit and meet Biden for the first time since the American President took office nearly two years ago.\n\nBeijing has not officially confirmed whether Xi will attend the summit or meet with Biden. But on Wednesday, Biden told a news conference at the White House following the midterm elections that he will be having talks with Xi in Bali.\n\nBiden said he’s not planning to make any “fundamental concessions” and that they will discuss the economy and trade. But he declined to reveal what his message would be on US military support to Taiwan should China move on the self-governing island.\n\n“I’m gonna have that conversation with him,” Biden added, noting that they’ll lay out “what each of our red lines are.”\n\nTheir much-anticipated meeting comes as relations between US and China hit their lowest point in decades in a downward spiral that started under the former presidency of Donald Trump, as the two countries ramp up their rivalry in trade, technology, geopolitics and ideology.\n\nIn recent months, tensions have reached new highs following US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and the Biden administration’s ban on the sale of advanced chips and chip-making equipment to China.\n\nMeanwhile, under Xi, China has moved closer to Russia, united by their plummeting relations with the US and other Western countries. Weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Xi and Putin declared their countries share a “no-limits” friendship. Beijing has since refused to condemn the war in Ukraine, or refer to it as an “invasion.”\n\nAfter G20, Xi will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Bangkok, which kicks off next Friday, according to Thailand’s Foreign Ministry.

The ships’ transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States’ commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States military flies, sails, and operates anywhere international law allows,” it said.\n\nJohn Kirby, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Sunday that the two US Navy warships transiting the Taiwan Strait sent a “very clear” and “very consistent” message that “the United States military will sail, fly and operate wherever international law permits us to do so.”\n\n“This was planned long ago,” Kirby added.\n\nThe Chinese military’s Eastern Theater Command said it was monitoring the two ships, maintaining a high alert and was “ready to thwart any provocation.”\n\nThe guided-missile cruiser USS Antietam. US Navy\n\nThe strait is a 110-mile (180-kilometer) stretch of water that separates the democratic self-ruled island of Taiwan from mainland China.\n\nBeijing claims sovereignty over Taiwan despite China’s ruling Communist Party never having controlled the island – and considers the strait part of its “internal waters.”\n\nThe US Navy, however, says most of the strait is in international waters.\n\nThe Navy cites an international law that defines territorial waters as extending 12 nautical miles (22.2 kilometers) from a country’s coastline and regularly sends its warships through the strait in what it calls freedom of navigation operations, including recent voyages by the guided missile destroyers USS Benfold and USS Port Royal.\n\nThe Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville.

Shi Yi, spokesman for the People’s Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command, said after the Benfold’s transit on July 19.\n\nBeijing has ramped up military maneuvers in the strait – and the skies above it – following the visit by Pelosi to the island earlier this month.\n\nWithin minutes of Pelosi landing in Taiwan on August 2, the PLA announced four days of military exercises in six zones encircling the island.\n\nThe maneuvers included launching ballistic missiles into waters around Taiwan, numerous Chinese warships steaming in the Taiwan Strait and dozens of PLA warplanes breaching the median line – the midway point between mainland China and Taiwan that Beijing says it does not recognize but had largely respected.\n\nSince those exercises officially ended, PLA warplanes have continued to cross the median line daily, usually in double-digit numbers, according to statistics from Taiwan’s Defense Ministry. From August 8, the last of the four days of drills announced the night Pelosi landed in Taiwan, through August 22, between five and 21 PLA aircraft crossed the median line each day.\n\nIn July, the month before Pelosi’s trip, Chinese warplanes crossed the median line just once, with an unspecified number of jets, according to Taiwan’s Defense Ministry.\n\nIn addition, Taiwan reports between five and 14 PLA warships have been seen in the waters surrounding Taiwan.\n\nThe PLA’s exercises have been continuing this week, part of what is normally a busy season for Chinese drills.\n\nChina’s Eastern Theater Command said on Friday it had conducted “joint combat-readiness security patrols and combat training exercises involving troops of multiple services and arms in the waters and airspace” around Taiwan.\n\nThat announcement came after US Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, became the latest member of Congress to visit Taiwan defying pressure from Beijing, saying, “I will not be bullied by Communist China into turning my back on the island.”\n\nIn tweets Friday morning, the US senator, who does not represent the Biden administration, reiterated her support for Taiwan.\n\n“I will never kowtow to the Chinese Communist Party,” she said in one. “I will continue to stand with the (Taiwanese) and their right to freedom and democracy. Xi Jinping doesn’t scare me,” she added later, referring to China’s leader.\n\nNicholas Burns, the US ambassador to China, told CNN last week that Beijing’s response to the Pelosi visit to Taiwan has been “an overreaction.”\n\n“We do not believe there should be a crisis in US-China relations over the visit – the peaceful visit – of the speaker of the House of Representatives to Taiwan … it was a manufactured crisis by the government in Beijing,” Burns said in an interview from the US Embassy.\n\nIt is now “incumbent upon the government here in Beijing to convince the rest of the world that it will act peacefully in the future,” the ambassador said.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of concern around the world that China has now become an agent of instability in the Taiwan Strait and that’s not in anyone’s interest,” he said.\n\nOther US officials had said Washington would not be changing the way the US military operates in the region.\n\n“We’ll continue to fly, sail, and operate where international law allows, consistent with our longstanding commitment to freedom of navigation, and that includes conducting standard air and maritime transits through the Taiwan Strait in the next few weeks,” Kurt Campbell, US President Joe Biden’s coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, told reporters at the White House on August 12.\n\nChinese Ambassador to Washington Qin Gang said last week that the US transits only intensify tensions.\n\n“I do call on American colleagues to exercise restraint, not to do anything to escalate the tension,” Qin told reporters in Washington. “If there’s any move damaging China’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, China will respond.”", "authors": ["Brad Lendon"], "publish_date": "2022/08/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2021/05/19/covid-travel-restrictions-countries-fully-vaccinated-americans-europe/7284487002/", "title": "Have COVID vaccine, will travel: These are the countries open to ...", "text": "Corrections & clarifications: Germany’s, Spain's and Italy's entry requirements have been updated.\n\nAs vaccination levels continue to rise in the U.S. and around the world, countries that had been off limits to foreigners for more than a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic are beginning to reopen.\n\nOn June 18, the European Union added the U.S. to a list of countries for which travel restrictions should gradually be lifted.

At no other point in this century did the amount climb above 400.\n\nThis year's surge in cases largely is among unvaccinated people in New York City, suburban Rockland County, New York, and Washington state.\n\nThis century's record was hit as of April 26, which means the U.S. figure will only increase even if outbreaks slow in some communities.\n\nMore:Vaccines are definitely not linked to autism, and other facts you can throw at anti-vaxers\n\nAs the number of cases continues to increase, Food and Drug Administration officials took the unusual step last week of reminding people that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is safe and effective.\n\nLast week, Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said measles has again emerged as a public health threat. He added that it is an \"urgent public health priority\" to monitor measles, mumps and rubella and raise awareness about the importance of immunization.\n\nMore:As 71 additional measles cases confirmed, FDA reminds public vaccine is safe\n\nNew York and Washington state have reported the largest outbreaks. Washington state health officials said last week that the outbreak there was over, but new cases continue to emerge in New York, mostly among unvaccinated people in Orthodox Jewish communities, according to CDC officials.\n\n\"The outbreaks in New York City and New York state are the largest and longest-lasting since measles elimination in 2000,\" said Nancy Messonnier, the CDC's director of National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. \"The longer these outbreaks continue, the greater the chance that measles will again get a foothold in the United States.\"\n\nThe CDC said current outbreaks of three or more cases are in Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey and in California's Butte, Los Angeles and Sacramento counties.\n\nOther states that have reported at least one case are Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, Texas and Tennessee.\n\nMeasles is caused by a highly infectious virus spread through coughing and sneezing and can circulate among clusters of unvaccinated children or adults. It typically kills one or two per 1,000 cases and can cause long-term damage. Of children and adults with measles this year, 9% have been hospitalized and 3% have had pneumonia, according to the CDC.\n\n\"Measles can be serious in any age group, but particularly in children younger than 5\" and older adults, CDC Director Robert Redfield said.\n\nMore:Anti-vaxxers open door for measles, mumps, other old-time diseases back from near extinction\n\nThe disease has made a comeback among pockets of unvaccinated children and adults. Some parents reject immunizations because of false information, often distributed through social media.\n\nThe two-dose measles vaccine is 97% effective against measles, according to the CDC. The first dose is recommended at age 12-15 months. The second is recommended at age 4 to 6.\n\nThat immunization timeline is accelerated for children who are traveling abroad. The CDC recommends infants 6 months and older get the first dose of the MMR vaccine before they travel.\n\nThe current outbreaks are \"imported cases\" that occurred when non-immunized travelers returned home and spread measles in communities with large number of unvaccinated people. Of 44 travelers who returned to the U.S. with measles, more than 90% were either not immunized or their status was unknown, CDC officials said.\n\nRedfield said about 100,000 children under the age of 2 have not received their initial measles shot, making them vulnerable to the outbreak.\n\nCDC and other public health officials are emphasizing the importance of vaccination among children.\n\n\"It is imperative that we correct misinformation and reassure fearful parents so they protect their children from illnesses with long-lasting health impacts,\" Redfield said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/15/measles-outbreak-biggest-jump-this-year/3471982002/", "title": "Measles outbreak: 90 more cases reported for biggest jump this year", "text": "An additional 90 measles cases were reported across the nation last week, the biggest jump this year as the annual total continued its march toward record levels, federal health officials reported Monday.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 555 cases have been confirmed in 20 states in 2019, the second-highest total since measles was declared eliminated in the USA in 2000.\n\nThe numbers are up sharply from a week ago, when the total number of cases stood at 465 in 19 states. The highest total since 2000 was 667 in 2014. There were 372 cases last year.\n\nGlobally, the World Health Organization reported Monday that cases rose by 300% in the first three months of 2019 compared with the same period in 2018 – after consecutive increases over the past two years.\n\nThe surge in the USA has been fueled in part by the anti-vaccination movement – the majority of people who contract measles have not been vaccinated, the CDC said.\n\nOgbonnaya Omenka, a public health expert and assistant professor at Butler University, said the fact that the last U.S. death recorded was in 2015 generated complacency toward vaccinations.\n\n\"The impacts of misinformation and lack of trust have not been fully appreciated,\" Omenka told USA TODAY.\n\nMore:What are states doing about measles outbreaks?\n\nThe states that have reported cases to the CDC are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington.\n\nMost of the cases this year involve 17 outbreaks – defined as three or more localized cases – in New York, New Jersey, Washington, California and Michigan, the CDC said.

The disease is a prominent cause of death among children worldwide, and most of the 110,000 deaths in 2017 were children.\n\nWHO said in its statement that global data for the first three months of 2019 is provisional, but it cited a \"clear trend.\" Outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Madagascar, Myanmar, Philippines, Sudan, Thailand and Ukraine are causing many deaths – mostly among children, the agency said.\n\n\"Over recent months, spikes in case numbers have also occurred in countries with high overall vaccination coverage, including the United States of America, as well as Israel, Thailand and Tunisia, as the disease has spread fast among clusters of unvaccinated people,\" WHO said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/health/measles-outbreak-columbus-ohio/index.html", "title": "As measles outbreak sickens more than a dozen children in Ohio ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA growing measles outbreak in Columbus, Ohio, has sickened more than a dozen unvaccinated children and hospitalized nine of them, and local public health officials are seeking assistance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“We asked the CDC for assistance and they will be sending two epidemiologists at the end of the month to assist with our local investigation,” Kelli Newman, a spokesperson for Columbus Public Health, told CNN in an email Thursday.\n\nThe CDC confirmed Thursday that it is aware of the cases and is “deploying a small team to Ohio to assist on the ground with the investigation.”\n\n“State and local health authorities are in the process of notifying potentially exposed residents, making sure they are vaccinated, and helping any community members who may have been exposed understand the signs and symptoms of measles infection,” CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in an email to CNN. “Anyone who may have been exposed should follow up with their healthcare provider.”\n\nWhen the measles outbreak was first reported, only four confirmed cases had been identified in one child-care facility, which temporarily closed – but the number of cases and facilities involved has grown.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Columbus Public Health officials updated their investigation to include 21 confirmed cases at 10 daycare centers and two schools.\n\n“All cases are in unvaccinated children, and all but one are less than 4 years old. One child is 6 years old,” Newman said. Most of the infected children are 2 years old or younger.\n\nHealth officials with Columbus Public Health and Franklin County Public Health have been investigating these cases and tracing any contacts who may have been exposed to the measles virus.\n\nOfficials at Columbus Public Health are encouraging parents to make sure their children are up to date on their immunizations, including the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, known as the MMR vaccine.\n\nExperts recommend that children receive the vaccine in two doses: first between 12 months and 15 months of age and a second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is about 93% effective at preventing measles if you come into contact with the virus. Two doses are about 97% effective.\n\n“We are working diligently with the cases to identify any potential exposures and to notify people who were exposed,” Columbus Public Health Commissioner Dr. Mysheika Roberts said in a news release last week. “The most important thing you can do to protect against measles is to get vaccinated with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is safe and highly effective.”\n\nAbout 90% of unvaccinated people who are exposed to measles will become infected, according to Columbus Public Health, and about 1 in 5 people in the US who get measles will be hospitalized.\n\nHowever, the CDC says that more than 90% of children in the US have been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella by age 2.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease that can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes or if someone comes into direct contact with or shares germs by touching the same objects or surfaces. Measles symptoms may include fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and a rash of red spots. In rare cases, it may lead to pneumonia, encephalitis or death.\n\nThe measles outbreak in Columbus is a “fairly typical scenario” of an infectious virus finding its way into one environment and spreading among unvaccinated people, said Dr. David Freedman, professor emeritus of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and founding director of the Travelers’ Health Clinic.\n\nFreedman said that during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, while many people stayed home and some health-care facilities were closed, many children missed their routine immunizations – and they still may not have gotten their MMR shots.\n\n“There are a lot of children nationwide that are behind on their routine vaccinations. So I think the message is still, if your child is 1 year of age or older, they need to be vaccinated,” said Freedman, a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\n“Measles is not particularly a wintertime disease. It is not as likely to be affected by travel because it usually is in young, not immune children. Most adults are vaccinated,” he said. However, he added, “measles is highly contagious. Measles is probably the most contagious disease we know. It’s probably 10 times as contagious as Covid is.”\n\nThe history of measles in America\n\nIn 1912, measles became a nationally notifiable disease in the United States, meaning health care providers and laboratories were required to report diagnosed cases. In the decade afterward, an average of about 6,000 measles-related deaths were reported annually.\n\nIn the 1950s, researchers isolated the measles virus in a patient’s blood, and in the 1960s, they were able to transform that virus into a vaccine. The vaccine was licensed and then used as part of a vaccination program.\n\nBefore the measles vaccination program was introduced in the United States in 1963, an estimated 3 million to 4 million people got the disease each year nationwide, according to the CDC. Afterward, cases and deaths from measles in the United States and other developed countries plummeted. There were 963 cases reported in the United States in 1994 and 508 in 1996.\n\nThe last major measles outbreak reported in the US was in 2019. It was the largest since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000 and involved more than a thousand confirmed cases in 31 states – the highest number of cases reported in the US since 1992.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOverall, the number of measles infections reported in the United States each year remains low because of the widespread use of vaccines, said Dr. Martin Hirsch, professor of medicine at Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital, who also serves as editor of the Journal of Infectious Diseases.\n\nAs of October 28, a total of 33 measles cases have been reported this year in five jurisdictions across the United States, according to the CDC.\n\n“Over 90% of people in the United States have been vaccinated against measles, and even though it’s a highly transmissible virus, I wouldn’t expect to see the rates, for example, that we’re seeing with RSV now because we don’t have an RSV vaccine,” Hirsch said, referring to a surge of respiratory syncytial virus infections across the country, mostly among children.\n\n“Most of the cases of measles that we do see in the United States result from people who are coming to this country from other countries where the immunization rates are much less, followed by transmission to US residents who are not vaccinated,” said Hirsch, a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. “So the possibility that someone carrying measles virus coming into the country could spread into an unvaccinated population is always there.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/08/measles-outbreak-booming-number-cases-rocket-toward-record/3399260002/", "title": "Measles outbreak: Booming number of cases rocket toward record", "text": "The number of measles cases recorded across the USA rose by almost 100 last week as the annual total continued its march toward record levels, federal health officials reported Monday.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 465 cases have been confirmed in 19 states in 2019, the second-highest total since measles was declared eliminated in the USA almost two decades ago.\n\nThe numbers are up sharply from just a week ago, when the total number of cases stood at 387 in 15 states.

The outbreaks are linked to travelers who brought measles back from countries including Israel, Ukraine and the Philippines, the CDC said.\n\nThree outbreaks in New York state, New York City and New Jersey contributed to most of the cases.

However, any paralysis caused by polio is permanent.\n\n“This patient did present with weakness and paralysis,” Schnabel Ruppert said.\n\nThis is the first polio case diagnosed in the United States since 2013, according to the New York Department of Health.\n\nState and county health officials are advising health-care providers to stay vigilant for additional cases, and they are advising county residents to get vaccinated for polio.\n\n“The risk to an unvaccinated community member from this event is still being determined,” Ruppert Schnabel said. “We strongly advise anyone who’s unvaccinated to get vaccinated.”\n\nPolio vaccine is part of the CDC’s standard immunization schedule and is required for school attendance. People who are vaccinated are not expected to be at risk.\n\nThe New York case was identified as a revertant polio Sabin type 2 virus, indicating that it was derived from someone who received the oral polio vaccine, which contains a live but weakened form of the polio virus.\n\nOfficials say this suggests that the virus originated outside the US, where the oral vaccine is still administered, but they are investigating the origins of this particular case.\n\nHealth officials said Thursday that the person had not traveled outside the US before or after they were diagnosed.\n\nTypically, people who catch polio can spread it to others for about two weeks. Officials said the individual is not expected to be contagious right now because they are past that window of time and have normal immune function. But others may have been exposed before the case was diagnosed.\n\nThe oral polio vaccine is no longer authorized for use in this country. In the US, only the inactivated polio vaccine has been given since 2000.\n\nHealth officials think the strain of the virus the individual contracted originated through shedding from the orgal vaccine. A person cannot get polio from the vaccine itself, but in recent years, cases of polio linked to shedding have arisen in communities that have low vaccination rates.\n\nWhen this weakened strain of the virus circulates in under-immunized populations – typically in areas with poor sanitary conditions – the virus can acquire mutations and revert to a form that causes paralysis. These vaccine-derived viruses are different from wild polioviruses, which now circulate only in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nCounty health officials declined to give personal details about the case, but The New York Times reported that the patient is a man from the Orthodox Jewish community, citing unnamed local elected officials. Community newspaper New York Jewish Week also quoted multiple sources saying the same thing.\n\nRockland County is home to an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in which vaccination rates have historically been very low. In 2018 and 2019, Rockland County was the epicenter of a major measles outbreak that continued for nearly a year and sickened 312 people. County health officials reported at the time that only 8% of cases had been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella before the outbreak began.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“Based on what we know about this case, and polio in general, the Department of Health strongly recommends that unvaccinated individuals get vaccinated or boosted with the FDA-approved IPV polio vaccine as soon as possible,” State Health Commissioner Mary T. Bassett said in a statement Thursday. “The polio vaccine is safe and effective, protecting against this potentially debilitating disease, and it has been part of the backbone of required, routine childhood immunizations recommended by health officials and public health agencies nationwide.”\n\nPolio cases were once common in the United States and around the world. During one of the most severe outbreaks in 1952, the virus infected 58,000 people in the US, paralyzed more than 21,000 and killed more than 3,100. However, vaccination campaigns cut cases dramatically.

Of the 135 cases reported since October, more than 25 of them have occurred in 2019, according to state and county health officials. Many of the cases have affected the Orthodox Jewish community in Spring Valley, Monsey and New Square.\n\nNew York State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker warned of the potential dangers anti-vaccination communities could bring.\n\n\"We now face a renewed threat from a woefully familiar adversary,\" he wrote in a USA Today opinion piece about measles. \"Across New York state, the vaccination rate for two doses of the MMR vaccine among children is 96 percent.\"\n\nHe said that is a high and safe threshold, but that could change as communities refuse to vaccinate for various reasons.\n\n\"When people who refuse immunization cluster geographically, communities become extremely vulnerable despite an overall high rate of vaccination,\" he wrote. \"And because measles remains endemic in certain parts of the world, global travelers can expose those who are unvaccinated here at home.\"\n\nNew York state’s response to the outbreak include:\n\nWorking with county health officials, health centers and private providers to administer about 15,000 vaccines. Rockland County has held more than a dozen free vaccination clinics around the county, including one on Wednesday at the Martin Luther King Multi-Purpose Center in Spring Valley.\n\nZucker and Rockland County Health Commissioner Patricia Schnabel Ruppert have met multiple times with the rabbinical leadership and groups of mothers and pediatricians in the community to discuss the importance of vaccination.\n\nHealth officials have implemented a public awareness campaign in and around the county with signs posted at nearby airports alerting international travelers of the measles risk, signs in multiple languages about measles and vaccinations, doorhangers and leaflets specifically geared to the community with key messages.\n\nRockland County instituted mandatory school exclusions for students who are not vaccinated. Since the outbreak began, about 6,000 unvaccinated students in more than 60 schools and daycare centers were excluded. Many have been able to return to school, but there are still about 25 schools or daycare centers under exclusion orders and about 3,600 children are being kept home.\n\nMany of the Rockland measles cases originated in Israel, where there are about 3,400 cases. In 2018, 82 people brought measles from other countries in the greatest number of imported cases since measles was eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNationwide, there are 10 states reporting 101 measles cases in 2019 as of Feb. 7. Outbreaks are reported in New York, Washington state and Texas.\n\nWashington’s governor declared a public health emergency on Jan. 18 after 25 cases had been reported in Clark County. There are now 53 cases in Clark and one case in Kings County, which includes Seattle.\n\nThere were 17 outbreaks and 372 confirmed cases nationwide in 2018, the second highest number since measles was officially eliminated in 2000.\n\nPrior to that, the largest outbreak was in 2014, when 667 people from 27 states contracted measles. This was largely due to an outbreak in the Philippines and a large outbreak among an unvaccinated Amish community in Ohio, according to the CDC.

What starts as a fever can cause serious health complications and even death.\n\nThe U.S. eliminated the disease in 2000.\n\nBut an ongoing outbreak in New York could change the country's 'measles-free' status.\n\nMillions of Americans suffered from measles in the decades before the U.S. eliminated the disease in 2000. But if an ongoing outbreak in New York state continues into next month, the U.S. could lose its \"measles-free\" status.\n\n\"As a global leader in public health, it is mortifying that (the U.S.) may lose its measles elimination status,\" said Dr. Paul Spiegel, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health. \"The measles outbreaks should not have occurred as vaccination against measles is very effective.\"\n\nThe U.S. isn't alone. Four countries — Albania, Greece, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom — recently lost their measles elimination status, which the World Health Organization defines as the absence of continuous disease transmission for greater than 12 months.\n\nThe U.S. would immediately lose its elimination status if there is any case connected to the current outbreak on or after Oct. 2, according to CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund. If there's a case that was not transmitted through the current outbreak, however, then the U.S. would not lose elimination status.\n\nMeasles cases surpass 1,000 in 6 months:Medical experts worry\n\nUS sees 400 reported cases of measles:What are states doing about it?\n\nReported cases worldwide rose by 300 percent in the first three months of 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, according to preliminary data from the WHO. And that's likely an underestimate: WHO estimates that less than 1 in 10 cases are reported globally.\n\n“Re-establishment of measles transmission is concerning. If high immunization coverage is not achieved and sustained in every community, both children and adults will suffer unnecessarily and some will tragically die,” said Dr. Günter Pfaff, chair of the European Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination, in a press release last month.\n\nBefore the introduction of a vaccine in 1963, measles epidemics occurred about every two to three years worldwide and caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year, according to the WHO. In 2017, about 110,000 people died from measles, mostly children under the age of 5 years.\n\nThree outbreaks ongoing in the US\n\nThis year, the U.S. has seen its highest number of reported cases since 1992. There were 1,241 individual measles cases confirmed across 31 states from Jan. 1 to Sept. 5, according to CDC.\n\nOnly two states — New York and Texas — are currently experiencing outbreaks (defined as three or more cases). The nation's largest outbreak this year, concentrated in Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods of New York City, ended earlier this month.\n\nBut three others are ongoing: in El Paso, Texas, and in New York's Rockland and Wyoming counties.\n\nMeasles outbreak:As students head back to school, officials warn about risks\n\nMeasles in Ohio:State reports first case in two years amid national outbreak\n\nMore than 75% of the cases reported this year are linked to outbreaks in New York. They can be traced back to travelers who brought measles from other countries such as Israel, Ukraine and the Philippines, where large measles outbreaks are occurring, CDC says.\n\nThe ongoing outbreak in Rockland County began when an international traveler who had measles flew through Newark Liberty International Airport on Sept. 28, 2018, potentially exposing others to measles from Sept. 28 to Oct. 1, according to local authorities. Reports of rash onset in the county began on Oct. 1, 2018.\n\nNew York Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said Friday that his department was working closely with community stakeholders and local health departments to stop any continued transmission of measles in the state.\n\n\"Since the outbreak began last October, more than 71,000 doses of MMR vaccines have been administered in the counties where we’ve sustained our most aggressive public health response, a 70% increase in the number of vaccines administered from the previous year,\" Zucker said.\n\nMeasles is a one of the world's most contagious viruses. What starts as a mere fever can cause serious health complications and even death. CDC estimates that about 1 in 5 people in the U.S. who get measles will be hospitalized, and 1 to 3 out of 1,000 will die.\n\nWhy is measles back?\n\nThe global resurgence has been fueled in part by the anti-vaccination movement. While the measles vaccine is 97% effective, most cases in the U.S. this year have occurred among people who were not vaccinated, CDC says.\n\nProponents of the movement push the discredited theory that the MMR vaccine, administered to children, causes autism. Celebrity anti-vaxxers and social media campaigns have continued to champion this viral theory.\n\n“Probably the No. 1 factor we have to fight is misinformation, this concept some people have that vaccines are dangerous,\" Judd Hultquist, assistant professor of infectious diseases at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told USA TODAY earlier this year.\n\nVaccines not linked to autism:Facts you can throw at anti-vaxxers\n\nViral misinformation:Rise of 'anti-vaxxer' movement requires news literacy inoculation\n\nThis year, New York City bore the brunt of that misinformation campaign, which targeted Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods. In April, Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency and required unvaccinated people living in designated ZIP codes to receive the vaccine.\n\nThe city's health commissioner Oxiris Barbot said at the time that the outbreak was \"driven by a small group of anti-vaxxers\" in the targeted neighborhoods.\n\n\"They have been spreading dangerous misinformation based on fake science,” she said. “We stand with the majority of people in this community who have worked hard to protect their children and those at risk.\"\n\nThe best way forward is to launch a \"robust response to the anti-vaccine empire,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, professor of Pediatrics and Dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College.\n\n“We need to take aggressive steps to restore vaccine confidence and vaccine acceptance,\" Hotez said.\n\nMeghan McCain goes after anti-vaxxers:Slams 'stupidity' for endangering children\n\nHow can the US regain elimination status?\n\nTo requalify for elimination status, the U.S. would need to demonstrate that there was no continuous measles transmission in the country for at least a year.\n\nNordlund said the CDC plans to publish a webpage on elimination status sometime next week.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/26/measles-outbreak-trump-says-children-have-get-shots/3560304002/", "title": "Measles outbreak: Trump says children 'have to get the shots'", "text": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump, who in the past has promoted the theory that vaccines cause autism, said Friday that unvaccinated children should be immunized in light of measles outbreaks in several states.\n\n“They have to get those shots,” Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn as he was leaving for Indianapolis, where he was to address a National Rifle Association convention. “The vaccinations are so important.”\n\nTrump’s comments come as the number of reported cases of measles in the United State this year already has surpassed previous annual totals this century – less than four months into 2019, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMeasles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000. But 695 cases, mostly concentrated in New York City, already have been reported this year.\n\nIn California, hundreds of students and staff have been quarantined at the University of California, Los Angeles and California State University, Los Angeles because of possible measles exposure.\n\nTrump has a long history of comments urging caution on vaccines. Before he ran for president, he incorrectly suggested they may lead to autism. In more recent years, Trump has said he supports children getting vaccinations but argued the shots should be more spread out over time.\n\n“Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn't feel good and changes — AUTISM. Many such cases!” the president tweeted in 2014, drawing backlash from public health experts.\n\nDuring his campaign for president in 2016, Trump drew additional attention for meeting with prominent anti-vaccine proponents, but he has insisted in the past that he supports vaccines generally, just not the schedule on which they are given.\n\n“I'm not saying to not give vaccines, I am just saying give them small doses over a long period of time – not one massive dose for a child,” Trump tweeted in 2014.\n\nNumerous studies have discredited the theory of a link between autism and vaccinations. Official groups, including the CDC, have reported there is no proven link between vaccines and autism and no ingredients in vaccines that could cause autism. Still, a minority of parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children.\n\nVaccine hesitancy, defined as the reluctance or refusal to be vaccinated or to vaccinate your children, has been identified by the World Health Organization as one of the top 10 global health threats of 2019.\n\nMeasles surge:CDC says measles cases surge past yearly record for 21st century\n\nVaccine hesitancy: Facts alone don't sway anti-vaxxers.

There were 372 cases last year.\n\nGlobally, measles is a major concern. The World Health Organization describes the disease as a prominent cause of death among young children, despite the availability of an effective vaccine. More than 110,000 people, mostly children, died of measles worldwide in 2017. The last U.S. measles death on record was in 2015.\n\nMost of the U.S. cases this year take place where \"outbreaks\" – defined as three or more localized cases – have swept parts of New York, California, Illinois, Texas and Washington state, the CDC said.

The CDC said vaccinations are 97 percent effective, and the agency urged vaccinations for people traveling internationally.\n\nIn New York, Rockland County officials declared a state of emergency, citing more than 150 measles cases. The county barred unvaccinated youths under 18 from public places for 30 days, although parks and outdoor areas are not included.\n\nThe ban, which will be in effect for 30 days, prompted a backlash from a small group of anti-vaccination advocates, who protested Thursday in what they dubbed on Facebook a \"Rockland County – Unvaccinated Civil Disobedience.\"\n\nCommon measles symptoms include fever, runny nose, cough and a rash that can spread across the entire body.

According to USA TODAY Sports research, 32 of 33 NCAA women's champions visited the White House from 1984 to 2016. The lone exception was UConn in 2000 under Bill Clinton; The Hartford Courant reported that Clinton had to cancel the ceremony to attend a summit.\n\nWhile the NCAA men's champions — the Virginia Cavaliers — announced last week that they would forego a White House visit, citing scheduling concerns, the Baylor women were always more receptive. Mulkey told The Associated Press earlier this month that the team would accept an invitation and that visiting the White House is \"not a political issue for me.\"\n\nBaylor spokesperson Kyle Robarts declined to provide any background on the team's decision to visit the White House, including whether the players were consulted.\n\nThe 2017 women's college basketball champions, South Carolina, were invited to visit the White House alongside other NCAA champions but declined.

Auburn turned down the invitation because, its athletic director said, the date of the Gotham Bowl (Dec. 2) conflicted with Auburn’s end-of-quarter exams.\n\nLet us pause here and think about that for a second.\n\nOK. Never mind Gotham and Auburn and exams. The big news in the rest of the country was Ohio State’s Rose Bowl rejection.\n\nThe headline in Sports Illustrated was a bit punchier than The New York Times:\n\nAGONY INSTEAD OF ROSES IN COLUMBUS\n\nWhen Ohio State's faculty voted against sending its football team to the Rose Bowl, students erupted in wild demonstrations and for two days terrorized many of the school's professors.\n\nThe Dispatch devoted most of its front page to the football news and the ensuing riots.\n\nSixty years later — Tuesday night, to be exact — the Ohio State’s Varsity O club, in conjunction with a number of the school’s alumni associations, presented a wonderful webinar/retrospective called, “Rose Bowl Requiem – The 60th Anniversary of the Historic Faculty Council Vote.” (Alas, a recording of the program is not accessible to the general public.)\n\nOver time, those few crazy, autumn days of 1961 have been boiled down to a phrase or two, such as, “That was the university’s last stand against big-time football” or “Remember when Ohio State had its priorities in order?”\n\nYet, what happened was more complicated and incredibly nuanced, as Bill Shkurti explained during the webinar. Shkurti is an economist by training, a longtime and distinguished employee of the university and an author of many books, including, “Ohio State University in the 1960s.”\n\nIn 1961, Ohio State had 25,700 students (now 61,000), annual tuition was $300 (now $11,500) and the athletic budget was $1.7 million (now $239 million).\n\nShkurti’s co-host, Todd Jones, a former Dispatch sportswriter who now works as a senior writer for the school’s alumni magazine, laid out the on-field landscape: Practice in 1961 commenced on Sept. 9, the first game of the season was Sept. 30, the schedule included nine games and every game started at 1 or 1:30 p.m.\n\n“There was little or no emphasis on the national title,” said Jones, a Big Ten historian.\n\nGoal No. 1 was to win the Big Ten. Goal No. 2 was to go to the Rose Bowl. Freshmen were ineligible. There were 10 black players on the team — progressive for the time — including the three stars: Fullback Bob Ferguson and two sophomores, fullback Matt Snell and halfback Paul Warfield.\n\n“The Old Man,” coach Woody Hayes, was 48 years old and in his 11th season, and he had some heat on him. The Buckeyes were 10-7-1 over their previous two years and, it was said, the Old Man didn’t know how to use his halfbacks.\n\nBo Schembechler was the offensive line coach.\n\nThe Buckeyes began the season by tying Texas Christian and then ran the table. They hammered Michigan 50-20 (and, yes, Woody went for two in the final seconds). A Minnesota loss on the last day of the season meant Ohio State was the Big Ten champion for the 12th time in school history.\n\nThe Buckeyes finished 8-0-1, ranked No. 2 in the country behind Alabama and were off to the Rose Bowl.\n\nThings got complicated. The Big Ten’s contract with the Rose Bowl had lapsed; the bowl invitation was sent directly to the school. Conference rules said the faculty had control over the bid.\n\nTo use wide brush strokes: At the time, a mid-50s recruiting scandal was still fresh; faculty were engaged to deal with the fallout; and there was a simmering controversy about different benchmarks being used for athletic and academic scholarships. Suffice, there were faculty members who chafed at the perception of a “football school.”\n\nThe faculty council voted 28-25 to reject the Rose Bowl bid, and the students took to the streets. One day, there was a march of 2,000 from campus to downtown. The next, students marched to the faculty club before heading back down High Street.\n\nSports Illustrated described it: “They burned members of the faculty in effigy, snake-danced down the main street, surrounded the capitol building, broke windows, besieged and insulted their professors and generally raised the most hell that has been raised in Columbus since V-J day.”\n\nIt was football co-captain Mike Ingram who took a police bullhorn and convinced the marchers to return to their dorms.\n\nThe Old Man got the news in Cleveland, just prior to a speaking engagement. He disappeared for more than an hour to digest it. He returned to address his audience and said, “I don’t agree with those 28 ‘no’ votes, but I respect their integrity, if not their intelligence. We have to accept defeat under pressure and that may help us now.”\n\nMinnesota’s faculty voted 108-33 to go to the Rose Bowl. The Gophers beat UCLA 21-3.\n\nJones spoke with a number of Ohio State players, including Warfield, about 1961. It was among the most striking aspects of Jones’ research.\n\n“They were disappointed at the time,\" Jones said, \"but they look back on it now through the lens of a full perspective of life. It's something they learned from. They had no control of what happened.\"\n\nSixty years ago.\n\nmarace@dispatch.com\n\nGet more Ohio State football news by listening to our podcasts", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2015/04/24/ducking-the-spotlight-some-stars-decide-to-skip-nfl-draft/26311857/", "title": "Ducking the spotlight, some stars decide to skip NFL draft", "text": "AP\n\nThe hat-and-hug routine with the NFL commissioner that has become a rite of passage for many college football stars on draft night is not for everybody.\n\nThe waiting is the hardest part, even for players good enough to be invited to the draft, and some prefer to do it away from the ever-present eyes of a national television audience.\n\n\"I know that the draft is really a great event and a great thing to go to,\" said University of Pittsburgh offensive tackle T.J. Clemmings, a potential first-round pick who declined an invitation to attend the draft in Chicago next week. \"It also can be pretty stressful. Nobody knows where they're going to go. But the wait, I'd rather have that wait with my friends and family here at home in New Jersey.\"\n\nThere will be several noticeable absences when the three-day draft starts Thursday night, including potential top picks. Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston, Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota and Alabama wide receiver Amari Cooper all plan to skip the spotlight.\n\nEither Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback could be the first overall selection, with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers holding the top pick and in need of a passer. The last time the No. 1 pick did not attend the draft was 1994, when Cincinnati selected Ohio State defensive tackle Dan Wilkinson.\n\nBut this year, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell might have to wait until pick No. 3 or even 4 — Cooper could go in the top three, too — to pose for a picture with a just-drafted player, his new team's jersey in hand.\n\nNot to worry. Goodell won't be lonely. Twenty-eight players are scheduled to attend, including Southern California defensive lineman Leonard Williams and West Virginia receiver Kevin White.\n\nFrom 2000-09, an average of six prospects attended the draft, and even then some declined the invitation. Former Wisconsin offensive tackle Joe Thomas went fishing with his father the day he was drafted No. 3 overall by the Cleveland Browns in 2007.\n\nWhen the NFL moved the draft to prime time in 2010, it expanded the invitations and 17 prospects attended.\n\n\"More and more asked how they could take part,\" NFL vice president of football communications Michael Signora said.\n\nThe NFL pays for two first-class or four coach airline tickets for each player, whichever the player chooses, and two hotel rooms, plus some in-town transportation.\n\nSince 2010, the NFL has had at least 23 prospects attend each draft.\n\nPlayers often slip out of the first round and into Day 2 — which can be a little uncomfortable.\n\nQuarterbacks tend to draw the most attention, especially when they aren't selected as early as projected. Cal's Aaron Rodgers was the first to endure the long, televised wait when he dropped to No. 24 in 2005 before being scooped up by the Green Bay Packers. Southern California Heisman Trophy winner Matt Leinart (No. 10 to Arizona in 2006) and Brady Quinn (No. 22 to Cleveland in 2007) also endured the slide.\n\nLeinart said he's glad he had the experience of going to the draft, but he would plan things differently if he could do it over again.\n\n\"I would have stayed home, had a big party in my parents' house with all my closest family and friends over. Been just super relaxed. Played golf. Whatever it may be,\" he said. \"Enjoyed it with my family in a stress-free environment.\"\n\nLast year it was Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel who had to wait backstage, with TV cameras cutting to him on just about every pick as he checked his phone and took swigs out of a water bottle. The Browns ended up taking Manziel at 22, and the cameras switched focus to Teddy Bridgewater, Louisville's star quarterback.\n\nThe Vikings kept Bridgewater from having to return for Day 2 by taking him with the 32nd and last pick of the first round.\n\nGeno Smith was not so lucky back in 2013. The West Virginia quarterback tumbled all the way out of the first round after there was talk he could be an early first-rounder. Smith considered not showing up for Day 2, but did and the New York Jets took him with the seventh pick of the second round.\n\nMariota and Winston probably don't need to worry about sliding that far, but still have decided there's no place like home.\n\n\"I applaud their decision, being home in a comfortable environment,\" Leinart said. \"For Mariota, he's a shy person. That's not his deal. Jameis Winston is probably avoiding it for other reasons. To stay out of the media.\"\n\nWinston had a series of off-field issues at Florida State, including a rape accusation against him. He has said he plans to spend draft night with loved ones, including his paternal grandmother whom, he said, has type-2 diabetes and cannot make long trips.\n\n\"I want the people who have been there since Day 1 to enjoy this moment,\" Winston told NFL Network after his pro day at Florida State last month. \"It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that I would look forward to spending with my family.\"\n\nMariota will be in his beloved home state of Hawaii, with more than 200 people at his high school alumni clubhouse, he said.\n\n\"For me it was a way to culturally pay respect to where I come from and to be with my family and friends, and at the same time to be with everybody who has helped me get here, and making sure they are all a part of this moment,\" Mariota said. \"These are the people who got me here.\"\n\nThe commissioner can wait.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

And while Obama agrees with them on the stakes, many of those invitations are about to get turned down.\n\nMore than a dozen advisers and others who have spoken with Obama say the former president’s approach in the fall campaign will remain limited and careful. That cautious approach comes as Obama tells people his presence fires up GOP opposition just as much as it lights up supporters, that he has more of an impact if he does less and that he can’t cloud out the up-and-coming generation of Democrats.\n\nObama’s small staff has instead been coordinating which appearances he’ll make and which ads he’ll record with President Joe Biden’s White House political operation and the Democratic National Committee. A similar effort already happened with fundraising emails his name has been put on – political coordination between a sitting and former president, which – like so much else in current politics – is unprecedented.\n\nDemocratic operatives say they’re eager to see Obama play an active role – even now, they say, his best role is driving up crucial Black voter turnout in places like Philadelphia and Detroit – even as they note his appeal is shifting. Among the disinterested voter blocs are a rising generation too young to remember his 2008 win, those who argue that his failure to deliver on soaring promises helped set up the crisis of faith and political despair that has followed and those who have gotten tired of seeing how little he’s engaged.\n\nHe’ll make a handful of appearances on the campaign trail, bundling appearances for candidates for Senate and governor and secretaries of state, arguing that Democrats winning those races is essential to preserving democracy.\n\nBut beyond the midterm season, Obama sees a larger purpose to this latest phase of his post-presidency life. No matter how the midterms go, the former President will host what he’s calling a Democracy Forum two weeks after Election Day – the first event that he’s hoping to turn into an annual gathering, reflecting a recalibration of the Obama Foundation to focus on democracy in America and around the world.\n\n“We’ll explore a range of issues – from strengthening institutions and fighting disinformation, to promoting inclusive capitalism and expanded pluralism – that will shape democracies for generations to come,” Obama writes in an announcement of the event going out to donors and others involved with the foundation, first obtained by CNN. “We’ll showcase democracy in action around the world, and approaches that are working. And we’ll discuss and debate ideas for how we can adapt our democracies and our institutions for a new age.”\n\nBen Rhodes, a longtime adviser who has been helping plan the Democracy Forum, said that the foundation’s work is removed from politics but will reflect Obama’s priorities.\n\n“All the things he might care about as an ex-president – climate change, health care, avoiding war – all connect back to whether or not democracy survives, and frankly whether or not the worst-case outcomes happen in terms of who’s in charge of countries,” Rhodes said. “He sees it as the thread that connects everything he’s doing.”\n\nStepping back from an unwanted post-presidency role\n\nA common feature of Obama’s post-presidency period will be noticeably missing in this first midterm election under Biden.\n\nGone will be the rounds of mass campaign endorsement lists for statewide, House and state legislator candidates that Obama had been putting out since leaving the White House. The decision to stop those lists is a function, people who’ve been working with him say, of stepping back from the extended leadership role he played in the Democratic Party during the Trump years – a role they say he never wanted.\n\nNow Obama will only endorse candidates who have already been endorsed by Biden, to prevent any sense of potential daylight between them – and no further endorsements are coming this year.\n\nObama continues to occupy a unique place in politics: A former President who really wants to leave politics behind but whose popularity is growing; a man already six years out of office who is still more than a decade younger than Biden and other top Democratic leaders – not to mention Donald Trump, the man who succeeded him and appears set to run again in 2024.\n\n“I’m not sure I can think of him as an elder,” said Rep. Mike Levin, who was one of six first-time House candidates in California with whom Obama did a joint event for in 2018. All six went on to win. Levin in an interview last week was still talking about the 2008 race almost as if it just happened.\n\nMuch of Obama’s focus has been the multi-million-dollar deals continuing his transformation from president to brand. With the Emmy last month for the national parks documentary he narrated for Netflix, he’s a Tony short of becoming an EGOT, if his production company is included.\n\nSome Democrats mock his various ventures as “Obama, Inc.” Among them: Switching his podcast deal from Spotify to Audible, expanding productions under his Netflix deal and a second volume of memoirs – adding to the already 768-page book published in 2020 that stopped chronologically at the killing of Osama bin Laden during his first term.\n\nAnd with the early construction of his library Obama has moved from flashy PowerPoint demonstrations for donors to actual beams and columns on the South Side of Chicago, he is still courting multimillion dollar donors to fund it.\n\n“He’s happy Biden is president,” a friend of Obama’s told CNN. “And he’s being post-president as he sees fit.”\n\nAnd there are Democrats who are happy to see him take a step back.\n\n“One person is still in the ring as the one we look to to advance our values. The other guy is a celebrity,” said one high level Democratic operative. “If your passion is politics, you want to be with the person in the arena.”\n\nStill, Obama has quietly strategized with political leaders at home and abroad – from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to new, young, leftist Chilean President Gabriel Boric or British opposition leader Keir Starmer – while avoiding getting into the daily fray.\n\n“This idea that he should be the guy to sway people’s minds is just silly. That’s not his role. Does he speak inspirationally? Yes,” said the Obama friend. “But he’s a pragmatist.”\n\nEven the limited amount of appearances Obama has continued to do – as he’s tried to get back to the kind of post-presidency he was hoping for before Trump’s election – demonstrate how worried he is about anti-democratic trends on the rise and progressives giving up hope.\n\n“I’m not sure he would have been at COP26 and Copenhagen and holding a summit on democracy here at home if he wasn’t recognizing what’s happening broadly,” said Eric Schultz, a senior adviser who’s been working with Obama since the White House days, referencing last year’s climate summit in Scotland and a major speech on democracy in Denmark earlier this year.\n\nStaying involved behind the scenes\n\nAs much as Obama likes to insist that he’s ready to start playing a more background part, he consulted with both Biden and Schumer about the failed attempt to push through a bill on voting rights. He was also on the phone after Biden’s Build Back Better legislation collapsed, backing the idea of slimming down the bill to just be climate change provisions and whatever else was needed to get West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin’s support.\n\nHe spent months on phone calls with tech leaders and advocates, building up to a speech he delivered at Stanford in the spring aimed at rallying the elites and intellectuals into getting involved with what he described as essentially unregulated social media companies.\n\nA few weeks later, he gathered several Black journalists – The New York Times Magazine’s Nikole Hannah-Jones, Los Angeles Times executive editor Kevin Merida, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Wes Lowery, Columbia University School of Journalism dean and New Yorker writer Jelani Cobb and Washington Post global opinion editor Karen Attiah – in his Washington office to talk about the ways in which disinformation works its way into Black communities, and what could possibly be done to combat that.\n\n“He was in a space of how he could be helpful, how he could help to move things along from the seat he is in currently,” said Rashad Robinson, the president of the advocacy group Color of Change, who also attended the meeting.\n\nObama’s staff, meanwhile, has remained in regular touch with Biden’s political staff at the White House, strategizing about opportunities to speak up on the President’s behalf. He was a sounding board for Biden on the Afghanistan withdrawal and followed up with a strong statement of support.\n\nObama is still important stamp of approval during moments of celebration as well, like when he called in August to congratulate the President after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nObama’s disdain for the current turn in the Republican Party is clear and his pitch is a more dispirited take on the hopeful pitch he used to make – that Democratic ideas are more popular and that the more people who vote, the better Democratic candidates will do.\n\nAttendees at a rare Obama fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee in San Francisco saw a man in his new element: Tieless, in a large chair in the home of a co-founder of Qualcomm, delivering long answers to a room full of tech billionaires on a handheld microphone as he fielded set-up questions lobbed at him by Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson.\n\nThey were struck by the intensity of his attacks on Republicans. But they also noted how he seemed to be reflecting fresh on harbinger moments from his own presidency, like when he pleaded with Republican senators not to blow up the norms of government by blockading Merrick Garland’s nomination to the Supreme Court and marveling again how he said they didn’t care.\n\nThe former first lady still hates politics\n\nOne person Democrats almost certainly won’t be getting is the Obama they always say they want to see even more: the former first lady.\n\nMichelle Obama will be hitting the road herself, but her limited six-city tour won’t start until after Election Day. Instead of campaigning, she’ll be appearing with celebrities like David Letterman and Oprah Winfrey to promote the new self-help-minded sequel to her blockbuster 2018 memoir.\n\nHer last campaign appearance was a recorded speech played at the virtual 2020 Democratic convention. She told friends at the time that she felt too dejected about the state of the country – between Trump, the Covid-19 pandemic and the racial divisions that were freshly exposed that summer – to bring herself to campaign more than that.\n\nAt their portrait unveilings at the White House last month, she delivered what she said she knew was a “spicy speech” about the peaceful transfer of power. But she won’t be hitting the trail again, despite the many campaigns who believe her power is unmatched in connecting with the Black women who have proven the most important constituency in winning elections for Democrats.\n\nInstead, the Obamas are sticking to a rhythm that developed in the 2018 cycle: He’ll do the direct campaigning and she’ll take a less direct role as the leader of her officially non-partisan, multi-celebrity, co-chaired registration and turnout effort non-profit, When We All Vote.\n\nFocusing on the foundation more than midterms\n\nAlways returning to the Martin Luther King quote about the “long arc of history,” Obama’s interest has remained less on the midterms or 2024 than on the network of nearly 1,000 young leaders at the center of his foundation.\n\nGift Siziva, a young Obama leader from Zimbabwe who is now planning to run for his nation’s parliament in next year’s elections, said that seeing democracy threatened in America has made him more connected to Obama and to the repositioned work of the foundation.\n\n“To find the American democracy being tested itself by different phases and episodes over the last five years,” Siziva told CNN, “makes me understand that – for democratic crusaders globally – the fight for democracy is our reality.”\n\nIt’s also a reflection of the type of young people who’ve been brought in – when Sheila Babauta was introducing Obama at last year’s international climate conference, for example, she had already been part of a march outside demanding more. While protesters were literally taping themselves to the streets in Glasgow, other activists were already waiting to speak to Obama in a small two-hour session he held after his speech.\n\n“These moments are like an electric car when it goes to a charging station. It fills my battery and gets me going,” said Juan Monterrey, one of the inaugural Obama scholars and Panama’s delegate to last year’s climate convention.\n\nBabauta, a local legislator in her native Northern Mariana Islands, said her own association with the former president as a foundation young leader has filtered down to the children at a youth center on the island of Saipan where she works. The children “asked if me and President Obama and I are BFFs” after they found a picture of them together.\n\nObama is often the moderator but sometimes pipes in with advice, like when he met with European leaders in a closed-door session at his democracy speech in Copenhagen during which he pushed back on a question about how to handle opposition.\n\n“Sometimes it just turns out they’re mean, they’re racist, they’re sexist, they’re angry. And your job is then to just beat them because they’re not persuadable,” Obama said, according to a transcript obtained by CNN.\n\nBut he warned them also: “Sometimes we get filled up in our own self-righteousness. We’re so convinced that we’re right that we forget what we are right about.”\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the status of Gift Siziva’s campaign.

Several times in her Hall of Fame career, Baylor's longtime coach has come under scrutiny for comments that have been perceived as callous or, judging from the reaction to her comments Monday, dangerously misinformed.\n\nBaylor's head coach since 2000 after a long and successful career as a player and assistant at Louisiana Tech, Mulkey has led the Bears to 631 wins and three national championships, including a perfect 40-0 record in 2011-12 and a 37-1 mark in 2018-19.\n\nIn many ways, Mulkey has emerged as such a well known and talented coach, she is receiving the same kind of scrutiny, particularly when it comes to her behavior, as some of her legendary male counterparts like Bob Huggins or Jim Boeheim.\n\nIt's also fair game to examine her decision to accept the invitation of then-President Donald Trump to visit the White House, in the same way other coaches, like Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots, was criticized by some for accepting Trump's invitation after a number of players declined to attend.\n\nAfter Baylor won the 2019 title, Mulkey's team became the first female team — in any sport — to receive its own championship ceremony during Trump's presidency. More than 20 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct, with many allegations surfacing after the 2016 release of a recording in which then-candidate Trump used lewd language as he brags of kissing and groping women.\n\n\"It's not a political issue for me. It's an honor to go to the White House,\" Mulkey told The Associated Press in April 2019. \"I want everyone to say they went to the White House. Not many people can say that.\"\n\nHere are five instances that stand out from Mulkey's tenure with the Bears:\n\nAdvocating for no COVID-19 testing\n\n\"They need to dump the COVID testing,\" Mulkey said Monday, unprompted. \"Wouldn't it be a shame to keep COVID testing and then you got kids that test positive or something and they don't get to play in the Final Four? So you just need to forget the COVID tests and get the four teams playing in each Final Four and go battle it out.\"\n\nFor Mulkey to advocate against daily COVID-19 testing \"is mind-boggling,\" USA TODAY Sports' Nancy Armour wrote. \"The restrictions have been onerous and the testing is inconvenient. But to suggest throwing it all away now, less than a week before the men’s and women’s title games, is the height of irresponsibility.\"\n\nSurprisingly, Mulkey's stance comes three months after she tested positive for the coronavirus, which forced Baylor into a two-week pause on team activities and led to the cancellation of an earlier non-conference matchup against the Huskies.\n\n'Knock them in the face'\n\nMulkey came under criticism after winning her 500th career game in late February 2017, which came as Baylor was reckoning with the sexual-assault scandal that had occurred within the university's football program and broader athletics department.\n\nAddressing the home crowd over a microphone, Mulkey said, \"If somebody is around you and they ever say ‘I will never send my daughter to Baylor,’ you knock them right in the face.\"\n\nMulkey didn't back down from her remarks in an ensuing press conference, saying she was \"just tired of hearing it. I'm tired of people talking on a national scale that don't know what they're talking about.\"\n\nMulkey spoke with ESPN the next day and apologized \"for the very poor choice of words.\"\n\n\"My point was, 'Please don't paint, with a broad brush, the women at Baylor.' I didn't think about what I was going to say. I looked at my players, and the little girls and the women who are cheering for them. And I spoke with a lot of emotion.\"\n\nNCAA Tournament behavior\n\nMulkey has twice been publicly reprimanded by the NCAA for inappropriate comments on officiating and the women's tournament bracket, even drawing an unprecedented NCAA Tournament suspension after criticizing officials in the wake of Baylor's upset loss to Louisville in the 2013 Sweet 16.\n\nTwo years earlier, she was reprimanded for making \"disparaging comments on the integrity of the championship bracketing process,\" per the NCAA.\n\n\"The NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Committee noted this is the latest misconduct act by Mulkey during the past several championships and believes a more stringent penalty is appropriate to prevent these actions from continuing,\" the NCAA said in announcing her suspension.\n\nShe would miss Baylor's 2014 tournament opener against Western Kentucky before returning to lead the Bears to the Elite Eight.\n\nIn an Elite Eight game against Oregon State in 2016, Mulkey was given a technical for throwing her coat in disgust at what she felt was a missed call on the Bears' offensive end. Baylor would lose 60-57.\n\nCasting blame for the Louisville loss\n\nThat loss to Louisville in 2013 is counted among the most shocking results in women's tournament history: Baylor had won 74 of its previous 75 games and was seen as a lock for the Final Four, if not as the favorite to defend its national championship, while the Cardinals entered the postseason as the third-ranked team from the Big East.\n\nIn her postgame press conference, Mulkey unloaded on an officiating crew she felt was largely responsible for allowing the game to become \"way too physical.\"\n\n\"I thought that all three of them,\" meaning the officials, \"if they go past this round of officiating, it will be sad for the game,\" she said.\n\nStrained relationship with Brittney Griner\n\nIn a 2013 interview with ESPN, former Baylor superstar Brittney Griner said Mulkey told players not to be open publicly about their sexuality because it would hurt recruiting.\n\n\"It was a recruiting thing,\" said Griner, who came out publicly as gay during a 2014 interview with USA TODAY Sports. \"The coaches thought that if it seemed like they condoned it, people wouldn't let their kids come play for Baylor.\"\n\nThe No. 1 overall pick in the 2013 WNBA draft, Griner would expand on her relationship with Mulkey and the university at large in her 2014 autobiography, In My Skin: My Life On and Off the Basketball Court.\n\n\"I would love to be an ambassador for Baylor, to show my school pride, but it's hard to do that — it's hard to stand up and say, 'Baylor is the best!' — when the administration has a written policy against homosexuality,\" wrote Griner, who is considered one of the most dominant interior players in women's basketball history.\n\n\"I've spent too much of my life being made to feel like there's something wrong with me. And no matter how much support I felt as a basketball player at Baylor, it still doesn't erase all the pain I felt there.\"\n\nContributing: Mike Freeman, Tom Schad\n\nFollow colleges reporter Paul Myerberg on Twitter @PaulMyerberg", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/politics/pence-money-gop-midterm-candidates/index.html", "title": "Ahead of potential White House run, Pence is raising big money for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen former Vice President Mike Pence agreed to appear at an October 21 fundraiser for Derek Schmidt, the Kansas Republican’s campaign expected a positive response. But in the first 24 hours after the invitations went out last week, the campaign raised nearly $100,000 – a figure that astounded Schmidt’s operation.\n\n“It dropped my jaw to the floor,” said one adviser to Schmidt, who is running against incumbent Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. “We’re well over that now. That’s relatively unheard of for Kansas governor.”\n\nKansas is not the only campaign stop for Pence in the final weeks before Election Day. He plans to stump for Republican candidates across the country, including Washington state, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia. CNN has also learned Pence will join Gov. Brian Kemp on a bus tour across the crucial swing state of Georgia.\n\nThroughout the cycle, Pence has proven to be an in-demand surrogate and impressive fundraising draw for GOP candidates. To top members of his political team, Pence’s willingness to help candidates up and down the ballot reflects his “servant’s attitude.” But with an eye toward a possible run for the White House in 2024, the most recent Republican vice president is also enhancing his own political brand.\n\nDonors, operatives and other Republicans have noticed.\n\n“I think Pence has had a very impressive run in the last six months,” said Scott Reed, a veteran Republican strategist. “He’s moved around the country in a lot of the targeted districts, raised money, delivered a positive political message. And I think he’s picked up a bunch of political chits.”\n\nWhile former President Donald Trump remains the dominant figure within the GOP and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis commands plenty of attention and fundraising prowess, Republicans say Pence has quietly been a reliable presence for the party on the campaign trail. And Pence intends to press this advantage after the midterms, publishing his memoir on November 15, a week after Election Day, and embarking on a busy book tour. And his political team continues to grow, with around two dozen staffers occupying office space in Washington.\n\n“He’s putting together the building blocks to analyze if he has what it takes to run after November,” Reed added.\n\nPence hinted at his own ambitions on Wednesday, during an event at Georgetown University, when asked if he would support Trump as the Republican nominee in 2024.\n\n“Well, there might be somebody else I’d prefer more,” he said with a smile.\n\nBut Pence continues to insist his first priority is electing Republican majorities in Congress and more Republican governors.\n\nTo that end, the bus tour with Kemp will cap off what has been a busy midterm cycle for the Indiana Republican, including visits to 32 states, primarily to support candidates for governor and the US House, but also a handful of Senate hopefuls. According to a person close to Pence, he’s raised more than $10 million for GOP candidates this cycle, including six-figure hauls each for Kemp in Georgia and Lee Zeldin, who is running for governor of New York. At a recent fundraiser to support California House candidate Scott Baugh, Pence helped rake in half a million dollars in a key targeted race.\n\nAnd at a time when Republicans are divided on everything from policy emphasis to what role Trump should play in the party’s future, Pence has been broadly accepting of candidates from all sides of the divide. He has campaigned for everyone from the MAGA-aligned Senate candidate Blake Masters of Arizona to California Rep. David Valadao, who voted to impeach Trump.\n\nRepublican campaigns who have brought him in have also told CNN that Pence is a willing and relatively drama-free surrogate, especially when compared to other big-name figures in the party. They say Pence is willing to do whatever a candidate needs – rallies, smaller events, fundraising receptions – without asking for much from the campaigns, which, in competitive House races, are often strapped for cash and have relatively inexperienced staff.\n\n“He has been very low maintenance,” said the Schmidt adviser. “When [Virginia Gov. Glenn] Youngkin and DeSantis came to town, it was their show. This is a bit more deferential.”\n\nThat approach has helped Pence win and maintain friendships across the spectrum of the party and cultivated for him a reputation as a party-builder during the Biden administration. More than one Republican who spoke to CNN referred to Pence as a “bridge” – not just across wings of the party but also between the party’s Reaganite past to its more populist present.\n\n“Unless you’re a die-hard President Trump supporter that has accepted the conspiracy theories around the election, I think Pence is a bridge to the different elements of our party right now,” said one GOP operative working on House races this cycle.\n\nPence’s moves\n\nThe question remains whether Republican primary voters are seeking a consensus-building elder statesmen in their 2024 nominee for president – or whether the confrontational style of the current leading contenders for the nomination will prevail.\n\nPolling so far suggests Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have the edge. A Siena College poll this month found Trump with 47% support among likely GOP primary voters, with DeSantis at 28%. Pence came in a distant third at 9%.\n\nUnderlying these numbers is the persistent and potentially permanent break between Pence and his former running mate in the aftermath of January 6, 2021. Pence’s refusal to delay the counting of electoral votes was a pivot point in his political career, and the ambitious Republican has sought to manage carefully his approach to the legal and political fallout of his stand against Trump.\n\nFor his first several months out of office, Pence declined to speak extensively about January 6 or his role in resisting Trump. In public remarks, he tended to tout the accomplishments of the “Trump-Pence administration” – a formulation he continues to use – and would only say that he Trump did not “see eye-to-eye” about the 2020 election.\n\nThat began to change last year, as Trump continued to make his own statements castigating Pence’s inaction. In June 2021, Pence called Trump’s scheme to overturn the election “un-American.” And in April of this year, in a speech before a conservative legal organization in Florida, Pence declared that Trump was “wrong” to try to delay the counting.\n\n“Under the Constitution, I had no right to change the outcome of our election, and (Vice President) Kamala Harris will have no right to overturn the election when we beat them in 2024,” Pence said.\n\nThose comments won Pence the private plaudits of Republican donors and elected officials, a sign that among the party’s leadership class there is a hunger for moving beyond Trump’s focus.\n\nPence has also registered his resistance to Trump on this subject in his political activity, most notably in some key primary fights earlier this year. He supported and campaigned for Kemp in Georgia, for instance, against David Perdue, the former US senator backed by Trump. The former President was vocally opposed to Kemp, who, like Pence, defied Trump’s demands to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Pence even rallied with Kemp the day before the governor defeated Perdue overwhelmingly in the May 24 primary.\n\nBut in other instances, Pence’s preferred candidate fell short. In Arizona, most notably, Pence supported Karrin Taylor Robson in the gubernatorial primary against Trump’s preference, Kari Lake. Lake, based much of her campaign on her false claims the 2020 election was stolen in Arizona, won the primary over Taylor Robson, who was better funded and also the choice of the GOP establishment.\n\nMany Republicans are skeptical Pence’s apparent popularity with the party’s leadership class translates to much interest among GOP voters themselves.\n\n“He gets a camera out at an event, his people are all looking to raise money. You give the donors something for their investment. He’s a vice president,” said one GOP operative, when asked about what Pence brings as a surrogate. “I don’t think he’s a big help with messaging or turning out the base.”\n\nShaping policy\n\nBeyond trying to elect Republicans this fall, Pence has also sought to play a role in shaping policy and ideological direction of the GOP. His chief vehicle has been Advancing American Freedom, a 501c(4) group that has developed a “Freedom Agenda” that advisers say they hope will influence what they expect to be a Republican majority in the House and possibly the Senate.\n\nThe Freedom Agenda’s list of policy proposals, which the group released in March of this year and which Pence spoke about in an address at the conservative Heritage Foundation earlier this week, is a synthesis of familiar Reagan-era ideas embracing limited government, social conservatism and free enterprise with some of the more populist ideas that animated GOP voters during the Trump era – such as finishing the border wall and embracing a more aggressive trade policy to counter China.\n\nBut buried in Pence’s proto-presidential platform are some corrections to what traditional conservatives might consider the excesses or aberrations of MAGA populism. Chief among these is on foreign policy, where Pence has pushed back against opposition within some conservative spaces to the American funding of the Ukrainian military in the war with Russia.\n\nThis week, as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy suggested to Punchbowl News that a Republican majority might resist a “blank check” to fund Ukraine, Pence called on the United States to stay the current course.\n\n“I believe as we stand here today, as the arsenal of democracy, we must continue to provide Ukraine with the resources to defend themselves,” Pence said in his October 19 speech at Heritage.\n\nPence added that “there can be no room in the conservative movement for apologists to Putin. There is only room in this movement for champions of freedom.”\n\nSome in the traditional conservative wing of the party say there remains a desire for that more familiar view within the GOP – and that Pence is well-positioned to take on the mantle of a full-spectrum conservative.\n\n“There are some conservatives and Republicans who think Ronald Reagan is in the past,” said Art Pope, a donor to Pence’s Advancing American Freedom group. “Vice President Pence wants to bridge that past, and he’s uniquely positioned to be the messenger.”", "authors": ["Michael Warren"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}]}

The board of directors for the WGA, which includes both a West and an East branch, voted unanimously to strike after talks between the guild and Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of the nine largest studios, failed to reach a contract. Writers, they said, are facing an \"existential crisis.\"\n\nIf it feels like a TV repeat, that's because it's all happened before. For 100 days in 2007 and 2008, writers went on strike, bringing the entertainment industry to a halt. Now those behind everything from network series like CBS' \"NCIS\" to Marvel movies to streaming series including Netflix's \"Stranger Things\" will hit the picket lines for the first time in 15 years.\n\nLatest strike updates:Hollywood writers, slamming 'gig economy,' go on strike\n\nHollywood haschanged significantly since 2008, led by the rise of streaming services. This has upended the traditional pay structure in the industry and, as the WGA argues, has led more writers longer for less pay (streaming series often have longer production schedules but fewer episodes per season, which is how their pay is calculated). At the same time, entertainment conglomerates are seeing financial losses, cutting jobs and have been shelving TV shows and movies.\n\nWe answer every question about the strike.\n\nWhy did the WGA go on strike?\n\nWriters are primarily looking for more compensation, with many pointing to the rise of streaming as having a negative effect on their earnings. In TV, writers are often paid per episode, and where a broadcast series once produced 22 or more installments each season, streaming series are more typically eight to 13 episodes.\n\nResiduals or royalties, which earn writers, actors and producers (among others) money after a TV show's debut when it airs or streams elsewhere, are lower for streaming shows than for broadcast shows that air reruns on cable or syndication.These lower minimums were established when streaming was in its infancy, and because streamers often insist on exclusivity, limiting the distribution of their shows elsewhere. In their pattern of demands, the guild also asked studios to standardize compensation forscreenwriting – regardless of whether a film is released theatrically or on streaming – and increase studio contributions to the pension plan and health fund.\n\nWhat about my favorite TV shows?How the writers strike will shut down some TV, but not all\n\nIn a statement announcing the strike, the WGA said, \"The companies' behavior has created a gig economy inside a union workforce, and their immovable stance in this negotiation has betrayed a commitment to further devaluing the profession of writing ... They have closed the door on their labor force and opened the door to writing as an entirely freelance profession. No such deal could ever be contemplated by this membership.\"\n\nMembers of the guild tweeted details of the negotiations, including the AMPTP's counteroffers and outright rejections of many proposals, including setting a minimum number of writers to staff a show.\n\nWhy did the studios reject WGA proposals?\n\nThe studios approached the negotiations with \"the long-term health and stability of the industry as our priority,\" AMPTP said in a statement shortly before the talks began, and it has been a shaky time in the industry. Entertainment conglomerates and streaming services are looking to bolstertheir bottom lines, ratcheting back a spending spree on new content that has hurt profits. Many have reported losses from streaming to Wall Street in recent months and made plans to lay off thousands of employees.\n\nThe AMPTP said it presented \"a comprehensive package proposal to the Guild (April 30) which included generous increases in compensation for writers as well as improvements in streaming residuals. The AMPTP also indicated to the WGA that it is prepared to improve that offer, but was unwilling to do so because of the magnitude of other proposals still on the table that the Guild continues to insist upon.\"\n\nWhat TV shows and movies will be affected by a writers strike?\n\nViewers will first notice the effects on daytime and late-night talk shows, from \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and \"The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon.\" Topical talk shows depend on writers and tape shows the day they air. So a strike immediately forces a shutdown.NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" is also done for the remainder of the season, as three May episodes will be canceled. (The May 6 show was already being written for host Pete Davidson).Daytime soap operas also will run out of new episodes within a few weeks.\n\nMore:Is your favorite network TV show renewed, canceled or ‘on the bubble’? Our 2023 status report\n\nMost broadcast shows, such as NBC's \"Law & Order\" and ABC's \"Abbott Elementary,\" will finish their seasons; their finale episodes have already been written and filmed. But a prolonged strike could affect how soon they return in the fall. (A handful, including NBC's \"Quantum Leap,\" already produced episodes for next season in preparation for a strike.) Streaming shows operate with far longer lead times, meaning the delays caused by any work stoppage won't be felt for months. But it's uncertain whether actors (also unionized in the Screen Actors Guild) would agree to film projects from already completed scripts during a strike.\n\nMovies have an even longer lag time, so titles set to release in 2024 and 2025 are most likely to be affected by a strike, forcing delays.\n\nThe longer thestrike goes on, the more studios, streamers and networks will draw programming from non-WGA sources: Reality shows and foreign TV.

The strike comes after weeks of negotiations failed to generate a contract between the guild and Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of the nine largest studios.\n\nThe strike comes 15 years after the guild walked off for 100 days in 2007 and 2008, and in that time the entertainment industry has been upending by the rise of streaming services like Netflix. While the labor dispute goes on, work in Hollywood is grinding to a halt. What does that mean for the TV shows and movies you love to watch? Here's how the strike will impact network TV, streaming series and movies.\n\nWhat TV shows are affected by the writers strike? Talk shows, late night, 'SNL' go dark\n\nStephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel and others depend on writers and produce shows the day they air. The strike immediately forces a shutdown, a fact which \"Late Night\" host Seth Meyers addressed on the air last week. Some daytime talk shows, including \"The Kelly Clarkson Show,\" have also shut down. NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" which has three episodes scheduled for May, is finished for the remainder of the season, meaning former cast member Pete Davidson won't be returning to host. Reruns will fill these slots.\n\nMore:Hollywood writers, slamming 'gig economy,' to go on strike\n\nThe writers strike will hit soap operas next\n\nDaytime soap operas like \"Days of Our Lives\" and \"General Hospital\" operate on fast and furious production schedules, meaning they have the fewest finished scripts and episodes to air. In a few weeks they will also go dark.\n\nYour favorite network series are OK — probably\n\nMost broadcast shows, such as NBC's \"Law & Order\" and ABC's \"Abbott Elementary,\" will finish their seasons; their finale episodes have already been written and filmed. But depending on how long the strike goes on, their return dates in the fall are up in the air. (A handful, including NBC's \"Quantum Leap,\" started producing episodes for next season early in preparation for a possible strike.)\n\nThe strike won't affect streaming for awhile\n\nStreaming shows on Netflix, HBO Max and others, are produced much further in advance than their network counterparts. The schedule will be unaffected in the short term, but the strike could delay shows meant to return later this year and in 2024. It's uncertain whether actors (also unionized in the Screen Actors Guild) would agree to film projects from already completed scripts during a strike.\n\nWhat about movies?\n\nMovies have an even longer lag time from script to screen, so titles set to release in 2024 and 2025 are most likely to be affected by a strike, forcing delays.\n\nWhat can I watch during the writers strike?\n\nThis strike is different from the 2007-2008 work stoppage primarily because streaming services weren't a dominant form of entertainment consumption back then. The airwaves were filled with reality television and foreign imports. This time around there are hundreds of shows available to audiences on demand, meaning the strike won't leave viewers without options like last time. It's not clear how that will affect how long the strike lasts, and how negotiations will ultimately go.\n\n\"The companies' behavior has created a gig economy inside a union workforce, and their immovable stance in this negotiation has betrayed a commitment to further devaluing the profession of writing,\" the WGA said in a statement. The AMPTP said it presented an offer with \"generous increases in compensation for writers,\" and that it was prepared to improve its offer \"but was unwilling to do so because of the magnitude of other proposals still on the table that the guild continues to insist upon.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2021/10/18/strike-averted-wilmington-nc-film-union-producers-reach-agreement-iatse/8507063002/", "title": "Strike averted in Wilmington as film union, producers reach agreement", "text": "Film production in Wilmington is happening as scheduled Monday after a union representing tens of thousands of crew workers nationwide reached a tentative agreement with movie and television producers over the weekend, seemingly avoiding a nationwide strike that would've brought most productions to a halt.\n\nAccording to a news release from the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, or IATSE, the agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, or AMPTP, includes sought-after wage increases and mandatory rest periods for crew workers.\n\nThe AMPTP represents such major film and TV producers as Amazon, Disney, Netflix, Paramount, Warner Bros. and others. IATSE represents workers including grips, camera technicians, costumers and other jobs essential to film production.\n\nThe release said the agreement — which must still be approved by union members — \"affects 40,000 film and television workers represented by 13 West Coast IATSE local unions.\"\n\nThat agreement, however, does not immediately apply to 36 other IATSE locals, including IATSE Local 491, which has offices in Wilmington.\n\n\"Our folks are very confused right now,\" said Darla D. McGlamery, business agent for IATSE 491, which represents members in North Carolina, South Carolina and the Savannah area of Georgia.\n\nMore:Wilmington-shot 'Halloween Kills' is No. 1 at the box office; 'Hightown' shows off beaches\n\nMore:We all 'Scream': 2 new movie trailers drop for upcoming Wilmington-made horror films\n\nMcGlamery said negotiations between the AMPTP and IATSE Local 491 and other union locals resume on Wednesday and are expected to continue through Friday. She said it's possible a deal \"may look similar\" to the one the IATSE has already negotiated, although she's \"guardedly optimistic\" it could wind up being even better for film crew workers in the Southeast.\n\n\"We are not done yet,\" McGlamery said. \"We still have the opportunity to plead our case.\"\n\nHighlights of the tentative agreement, according to the IATSE release, include:\n\nA \"living wage\" for the lowest-paid crew members;\n\nimproved wages and working conditions for crew members on productions intended for streaming;\n\na retroactive 3 percent annual wage increase;\n\nincreased penalties paid to crew members required to work through meals;\n\nminimum of 10 hours of rest between workdays and 54 consecutive hours of rest on weekends;\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.’s birthday added as a holiday.\n\nIn early October, about 98% of IATSE members nationwide voted in favor of authorizing a strike, with about 90% of union members participating in the vote. Last week, IATSE President Matthew Loeb set an Oct. 18 deadline for calling a strike if an agreement had not been reached.\n\nAt issue was the lack of time off between work days that can stretch to well over 12 hours, and an expired agreement from 2009 that allowed for lower wages for workers on productions for streaming services, then termed \"new media.\"\n\nIn the news release, Loeb touted the tentative agreement, calling it a \"Hollywood ending ... We went toe to toe with some of the richest and most powerful entertainment and tech companies in the world, and we have now reached an agreement with the AMPTP that meets our members’ needs.”\n\nReaction across social media among some union members, who are not generally allowed by IATSE to speak with the media, was rater more muted. Some union members openly expressed disappointment or even said they would vote against the agreement.\n\nFilm industry trade publication Variety ran a story Sunday with a headline that read, \"IATSE Deal Could Be Rejected by Members: ‘Our Leadership Let Us Down.'\"\n\nMcGlamery said she's heard the complaints from the union's rank and file.\n\nAt the end of the day, McGlamery said, the ability of film crews in the South to churn out content in a way that is economically viable for the industry will ultimately serve to improve wages and working conditions for film crews throughout the industry.\n\n\"This is a story about how the South saved Hollywood,\" she said.\n\nThe Wilmington area is currently seeing its highest level of film production in years, if not ever, with at least eight projects currently in production or pre-production. In North Carolina, about $410 million in direct spending from film productions is expected this year, a number that would be, by far, an all-time record for the state.\n\nFilm Partnership of North Carolina\n\nIn other local film news, the Wilmington City Council announced Monday it would vote on using American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to launch a \"film and production workforce development initiative\" called the Film Partnership of North Carolina, according to a news release from the city.\n\nDetails on the program, called the first of its kind in the state, were presented by city staffers and \"key partners of the initiative\" on Monday as part of the council's agenda briefing.\n\nA vote on awarding the funding is set for the Wilmington City council meeting on Nov. 3.\n\n“Film is a cornerstone of our local economy and we must be intentional about keeping it that way.” Wilmington Mayor Bill Saffo said in the release. “This initiative will create a pipeline of qualified, local talent ready to work, while bolstering Wilmington’s status as a place where film is welcomed and embraced.\"\n\nThe initiative aims to provide an average of five weeks of on-the-job training for at least 90 pupils, who will be paid $15 an hour, with 10 hours of pre-approved overtime at time and a half.\n\nThe first training session is scheduled for later this year, and the emphasis is on hiring women and minorities, who are traditionally under-represented in the film industry.\n\nCollaborators in the partnership with the city include the N.C. Department of Commerce, the Wilmington Regional Film Commission, the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, GLOW Academy and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees union, or IATSE.\n\n“We have been recruiting and have placed several trainees over summer,” Darla McGlamery, business agent for IATSE Local 491, said in the release. “We are breaking records for film and production investments this year, and it’s important that we create a pipeline of well-trained talent to meet the demands of the industry.”\n\nContact John Staton at 910-343-2343 or John.Staton@StarNewsOnline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/05/03/education-fed-interest-rate-inflation-mccarthy-biden-debt-migrant-mexico-texas-manhunt/70174588007/", "title": "Education, Federal Reserve, interest rates, debt ceiling, Texas ...", "text": "A new report shows American students are lagging in U.S. history and civics education.

Know your rights | CNN Business", "text": "The abrupt and unceremonious way that thousands of Twitter employees got laid off last week was a spectacle.\n\nBut it was also a helpful reminder that while employers can get rid of many workers at will (and with zero graciousness), employees are not without rights when they are laid off en masse.\n\nHere’s a quick primer on what employees need to know.\n\nHow much advance notice should I get?\n\nFor a plant closing or a mass layoff, you should get at least 60 days notice, under the federal Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. Some states may require more notice – New York, for instance, requires 90 days. And states also may set stricter standards than the federal law, such as requiring employers with fewer workers to comply with the WARN Act.\n\nIf an employer is found to have violated the WARN Act, in addition to paying penalties to the state, it will be required to pay out up to 60 days (or more, depending on the state requirement) of back wages and benefits to those laid off, depending on how many days’ notice the company actually gave.\n\n“Notice” in this instance means notifying the community at large but also each individual who will be laid off, said employment attorney Michael DuPont, who is managing shareholder at the Minnesota-based law firm Wagner, Falconer & Judd and also provides legal services through LegalShield.\n\nIf a company lays you off abruptly, it may be found to have complied with the WARN Act so long as the effective date of your layoff is at least 60 days after the day you got notice that you’re being let go, said employment attorney Alex Granovsky, cofounder of the New York-based law firm Granovsky & Sundaresh.\n\nTechnically you will remain on the company’s payroll and will continue to receive pay and benefits in the interim, and then any severance you’re given would kick in.\n\nHow much severance am I entitled to?\n\nUn-fun fact: No law – federal or state – requires employers to offer you any severance when they lay you off, unless you have a union or individual employment contract that includes a provision for it.\n\nThat said, many employers do offer some form of severance to protect themselves from any potential legal claims you might bring as a result of your employment or termination.\n\nA second reason many offer severance: “Good will and fairness to the employees and to the community as a whole. To offer additional compensation in recognition of the potentially tough time the employee and community would [experience],” DuPont said.\n\nWhat do I give up in exchange for accepting severance?\n\nAn employer will want you to waive certain rights in exchange for money.\n\nPut bluntly, “the company covers itself in every way a former employee can hurt [it],” Granovsky said.\n\nGenerally speaking you will waive your right to bring a claim against the company, such as discrimination, hostile work environment, pay violations or any other alleged wrongdoing.\n\nYou also typically will need to agree to several clauses that prohibit you from harming the company, he said. They include:\n\nA confidentiality clause: This clause prohibits you from sharing details of the company’s business or even the terms of your severance agreement.\n\nA non-disparagement clause: This prohibits you from badmouthing the place.\n\nA cooperation clause: You agree to assist the company if it gets sued in the future over a matter that you know something about as a result of your tenure there.\n\nA non-cooperation clause: This prohibits you from helping anyone else trying to sue the company.\n\nA non-solicitation clause: This typically means you can’t poach your soon-to-be former employer’s clients or employees should you start working elsewhere or launch your own business.\n\nWaiving these types of rights does not, however, excuse the employer from having to pay you what is already owed, such as a pension or earned vacation or sick leave. “The consideration offered for the waiver of the right to sue … must be something of value in addition to any of the employee’s existing entitlements,” the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) notes.\n\nCan I negotiate the terms of the severance?\n\nIf you think you have legitimate claims against the company, your employer would almost certainly rather you not sue, so it will likely be more open to negotiating the terms of your severance instead.\n\n“A company would rather pay $100 now to avoid having to pay $150 later,” DuPont said.\n\nIf you don’t have a strong case that could justify filing a lawsuit, which you could use as a bargaining chip, you can still try to make the case for why your employer might sweeten your severance package.\n\n“Asking is fine. You should ask. There’s no harm in asking,” Granovsky said.\n\nYou might ask for more months of paid health benefits if you or a family member on your insurance plan is battling cancer, DuPont noted as an example. Or if you’re a long-term employee in good standing or you have a special skill set that the employer might want to tap in the future, you might make a compelling case for why the company should offer you some additional pay.\n\nShould I hire a lawyer?\n\nSince a severance agreement is an important legal document that will affect your immediate future, it can be helpful to have an employment lawyer with experience in severance cases review the company’s offer.\n\nIf hiring a lawyer directly is too expensive, you might consider a less expensive service like LegalShield, which only charges about $30 a month to gain access to an employment attorney in your state who can review your offer, make sure it complies with the law and make a call on your behalf to your employer if you’re seeking modifications to the agreement.\n\nIf your case is complicated and involves further legal action, or if your severance agreement is more than 15 pages long, your costs will be higher, but you will get a discount on the hourly fees of the lawyer on your case.\n\nOr, if you just have some very simple questions, some employment lawyers might offer a free consultation by phone.\n\nHow long will I have to decide whether to accept a severance package?\n\nUnder federal laws, if you’re 40 or older, you must be given at least 45 days in a group termination (21 days if your layoff is not part of a mass layoff) to decide whether to sign your severance agreement.\n\nIn either case, if you accept the offer you also must be given a 7-day period afterward to change your mind.\n\nThat said, each state may have its own requirements above the federal minimum requirements, DuPont said. So check your state’s Department of Labor site to see what its specific requirements are.\n\nWill I lose my severance if I start earning income again?\n\nMany employers may stop your severance payments if the company rehires you for a new position.\n\nIf you find a job elsewhere or start freelancing for others, some employers may choose to reduce your severance payments if your new source of income is less than what you used to be paid.\n\n“They may say, ‘If you make less money we’ll only pay the delta,’” Granovsky said.\n\nIn either case, your severance agreement should state explicitly what the employer’s policy is. So don’t sign it until you’re clear about those terms.\n\nBut if the agreement is silent on the issue then you likely may continue to receive your full severance while also earning income from another source. “So that’s a win for the employee,” DuPont said.", "authors": ["Jeanne Sahadi"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/07/11/50-worst-product-flops-of-all-time/36734837/", "title": "Product launch blunders: 50 worst flops of all time", "text": "Michael B. Sauter, Evan Comen, Thomas C. Frohlich and Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSome product launches can be spectacular failures, and Google Glass, an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted device with smartphone capabilities, failed in such a manner several years ago. It was meant to be the first piece of technology to connect the typical consumer to augmented reality.\n\nGoogle continues to attempt to find a place for the product, but its original launch was a definitive failure. In 2017, the internet giant announced the relaunch of the device to target to businesses rather than the general public, but whatever happens, it will be adopted by a meaningfully narrower audience.\n\nJust like success, failure is part of doing business. Entrepreneurs and large companies often take big risks, hoping for success but not always achieving it.\n\nThese failures take many different forms. When a product doesn’t sell, when it is recalled or discontinued, or when it otherwise does not come close to meeting a company’s expectations or plans, it can be marked as a failure. While failures are expected, some can be so catastrophic they can lead to permanent damage to a company’s reputation, layoffs, and even complete financial ruin.\n\nSometimes, it can take years, or even decades for a product flop to disappear from the market. This was the case with Betamax a video format which Sony introduced, expecting it to replace VHS. Despite being technologically superior to VHS, Betamax lost market share until it eventually vanished.\n\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed some of the greatest product launch blunders throughout history. Today, these product flops exist as case studies companies use to avoid future failure. They range from Ford’s Edsel in 1958 to 2016’s Galaxy Note 7. Many of these products led to losses in the hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions. In tech, film, the internet, the pharmaceutical industry, and more, these are the biggest product flops of all time.\n\nMore: Population migration patterns: US cities Americans are abandoning\n\n1. Google Glass\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Wearable technology\n\nGoogle first announced Google Glass -- an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted display with smartphone capabilities -- to the public in 2012. The announcement began with a statement of principle: “We think technology should work for you -- to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t.” After two years of disappointing sales, it was clear consumers did not need Google Glass. Google stuck to its principle, and in 2015 discontinued the product’s development. Privacy concerns, reported bugs, low battery life, bans from public spaces, and an inability to live up to the hype all stymied public adoption of the technology.\n\n2. The Newton\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1993\n\n1993 What it was: Personal digital assistant\n\nWhile the personal digital assistant would become a popular consumer electronics product in the late 1990s, the first PDA was one of the biggest product flops of all time. One year after Apple CEO John Sculley coined the term “PDA” in 1992, the company released the Newton MessagePad. While the device incorporated innovative technology such as a pen-based touch screen and the ability to sync with software on a personal computer, Apple sold only 50,000 units of the product in its first four months on the market. The Newton product line was discontinued in 1998.\n\nMore: Budweiser, Coors Light, Bud Light top list of best-selling beers in America\n\n3. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\nCompany: Atari\n\nAtari Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Video game\n\nSeveral video games have failed over the years, but arguably none as spectacularly as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The video game was created/developed shortly after the release of Steven Spielberg’s classic film. With only five weeks spent in development -- games typically take months, if not years, to program -- the game was notoriously difficult and sold miserably. Atari spent $21 million to purchase the rights to the franchise and $5 million on promotion of the game. The company made 4 million copies of the game, but sold only 1.5 million. Atari buried the leftover copies in a landfill.\n\n4. Satisfries\n\nCompany: Burger King\n\nBurger King Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: French fries\n\nIn 2013, Burger King introduced a new menu item advertised as a healthy alternative to their traditional french fries. Satisfries used a less porous batter, which caused the fry to absorb less oil than regular fries during cooking. While Satisfries were made with a healthier recipe, Burger King failed to convey the difference to customers. The fries were also more expensive than Burger King’s regular french fries, and failed to gain traction with consumers. The company discontinued the fries in 2014, less than a year after they were introduced.\n\n5. Premier smokeless cigarettes\n\nCompany: RJ Reynolds\n\nRJ Reynolds Year introduced: 1988\n\n1988 What it was: Cigarette\n\nR.J. Reynolds, the second largest U.S. tobacco company, began marketing in 1988 a smokeless tobacco product that was intended to be a safer way to use a cigarette. In addition to concerns over the product's actual safety, smokers missed the familiar elements of traditional cigarettes -- the smoke, the burn, and the flick. Another issue was the widely-reported unpleasant chemical taste, which one user described as resembling “burning plastic.” Reynolds sunk close to $1 billion into the product before pulling it off the market within a year.\n\n6. Cheetos Lip Balm\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 2005\n\n2005 What it was: Lip balm\n\nPopular lip balm brands such as Chapstick, Blistex, and Burt’s Bees, have successfully sold their products to Americans for decades. Many prefer such flavored varieties as cherry, mint, and vanilla bean. Not every popular flavor can be successfully turned into a lip balm, however, a lesson PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay learned the hard way in 2005. While Cheetos has been a popular snack for more than six decades, Cheetos-flavored lip balm failed to catch on with consumers.\n\n7. Terra Nova\n\nCompany: Fox\n\nFox Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: TV show\n\nEvery year, TV shows are cancelled before the end of their first season. While Terra Nova, which aired for one 13-episode season, is not unusual in this regard, it may go down as the most costly cancelled television show of all time. Documenting the time-traveling adventures of a 22nd century family fleeing a dystopian society for a prehistoric past, the pilot of the show alone cost Fox between $16 and $20 million to make. Terra Nova encountered numerous production mishaps while filming in Australia, including a flood that nearly killed a crew member. Ratings failed to meet expectations, and the show was not renewed for a second season. Fox is estimated to have spent more than $50 million on the failed show, not including marketing costs.\n\n8. Touch of Yogurt shampoo\n\nCompany: Clairol\n\nClairol Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: Shampoo\n\nIn keeping with the 1970s trend of incorporating natural food ingredients like lemon, herbs, and honey into beauty and hygiene products, Clairol -- at the time a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb -- thought a yogurt shampoo was just what the American consumer wanted. It turned out the company had grossly miscalculated. Many consumers were apparently confused as to what they had bought, as there were reported cases of people eating the shampoo.\n\nMore: Jeep, Disney, Coca-Cola top survey list of America’s most patriotic brands\n\n9. New Coke\n\nCompany: Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola Year introduced: 1985\n\n1985 What it was: Soft drink\n\nOver the 15 years leading up to 1985, Coca-Cola’s flagship cola drink had been losing market share to Pepsi Cola. To compete, the company changed the drink’s formula for the first time in 99 years -- but the move today is considered one of the greatest flops of all time. New Coke was met with public outrage and lasted only a few months. The company reintroduced its older formula, rebranded as Coca-Cola Classic.\n\n10. Windows Vista\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2007\n\n2007 What it was: Operating system\n\nIntroduced in 2007 as a follow-up to Windows XP, the Windows Vista operating system was everything its popular predecessor was not -- in all the wrong ways. Panned by customers and IT professionals alike, Vista reduced PC performance and caused a number of internet problems for users. As a result, Dell began offering Windows XP again on new laptops a few short months after Vista was introduced. Windows announced this month that it would no longer provide support for Vista, driving the final nail into the operating system’s coffin.\n\n11. Kitchen Entrees\n\nCompany: Colgate\n\nColgate Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Frozen meal\n\nMany of the worst product flops in recent memory were caused by otherwise popular brands wandering too far outside of their area of expertise. Colgate Kitchen Entrees may be the best example of such a product failure. When it came to pre-prepared frozen meals, Americans had plenty of options in the 1980s. Perhaps because consumers naturally associated the Colgate name with toothpaste, there was never much of an appetite for pre-made meals bearing the Colgate logo.\n\n12. Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water\n\nCompany: Coors\n\nCoors Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Sparkling water\n\nCoors and Coors Light are two of the most popular beers in the United States. Introducing Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water to the public in 1990, the Coors Brewing Company also sought to capitalize on the fast-growing bottled water segment in the United States. The water was Coors' first non-alcoholic product since Prohibition. The Coors brand name did not help to sell the product, however, as the beer-name branding may have confused or even frightened consumers. Coors let its trademark of Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water expire in 1997.\n\n13. Harley Davidson perfume\n\nCompany: Harley Davidson\n\nHarley Davidson Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Perfume\n\nHarley Davidson is one of the most iconic and valuable brands in the world. It is also one of the most masculine brands. The company has not deviated considerably from this manly personality, although it has tried. The company released Legendary Harley-Davidson, a cologne for men, among several other varieties, starting in 1994. Another perfume, Black Fire, hit the market as recently as 2005. All are now discontinued. In the 1990s, the company released a number of other products, including wine coolers and aftershave, which after failing miserably have also become classic cases of brand overextension.\n\n14. Persil Power\n\nHolding company: Unilever\n\nUnilever Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Stain remover\n\nUnilever introduced Persil Power detergent to the market in 1994. The product utilized a newly patented stain removal formula called Accelerator. The company was so confident in the Accelerator catalyst that it carried out its $300 million introduction of Persil Power without any formal test marketing. Over time, it became clear the detergent was damaging clothes at high temperatures. After nine months on the shelves, the company replaced Persil Power with Persil New Generation, a detergent without the Accelerator compound.\n\n15. Cosmopolitan yogurt\n\nCompany: Cosmopolitan\n\nCosmopolitan Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Yogurt\n\nCosmopolitan is a popular women’s magazine, full of fashion advice, dating tips, celebrity gossip, and horoscopes. What the magazine’s leadership was thinking when they expanded the brand’s reach from the magazine aisle to the dairy aisle remains a mystery. Few will likely remember the 1999 debut of Cosmopolitan’s yogurt line, as the short-lived product was only available for 18 months. Like many other products on this list, Cosmopolitan yogurt was a case of a brand reaching too far beyond its area of expertise.\n\n16. DH 106 Comet\n\nCompany: De Havilland\n\nDe Havilland Year introduced: 1949\n\n1949 What it was: Airplane\n\nWe now take jet travel for granted, but the development of a commercially viable jetliner involved a great deal of trial, error, and some utter failures. De Havilland, a British aircraft manufacturer, developed the Comet, the first commercial jet airliner. Unfortunately, within a few years of its 1949 debut, the Comet encountered several unexplained fatal crashes, including planes overrunning the runway and one exploding in midair. The Comet's reputation plummeted, and while De Havilland scrambled to redesign the plane, American companies Douglas and Boeing took over the industry.\n\nMore: Which manufacturers are bringing the most jobs back to America?\n\n17. DeLorean DMC-12\n\nCompany: Delorean Motor Company\n\nDelorean Motor Company Year introduced: 1981\n\n1981 What it was: Sports car\n\nIn 1973, auto executive John DeLorean left General Motors to form the DeLorean Motor Company. After years of production delays, the DeLorean DMC-12 was released in January 1981. The car’s unique design was poorly received, however, and by 1982 less than half of the 7,000 DeLorean units produced had been sold. The DeLorean is widely recognized due to its use as a converted time machine in the “Back to the Future” series. However, the first of these films was released in 1985, far too late to save the ill-fated brand. DeLorean filed for bankruptcy in 1982.\n\n18. EZ Squirt\n\nCompany: Heinz\n\nHeinz Year released: 2000\n\n2000 Company revenue when released: Ketchup\n\nBefore EZ Squirt, ketchup was always varying shades of red. To cater to kids, who were -- and still are -- among ketchup’s largest groups of consumers, Heinz began producing purple, green, and blue EZ Squirt ketchup in matching, vibrantly colored squeeze bottles. At first, the colorful ketchup was a huge success. The novelty wore off quickly, however, and not long after its introduction, sales of EZ Squirt began to decline. In January 2006, less than six years after its debut, Heinz halted production of the product.\n\n19. United States Football League\n\nCompany: USFL\n\nUSFL Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Sports league\n\nConceived as a way to satiate America's appetite for football in the spring and summer months, the United States Football League was introduced in 1982. The league originally consisted of 12 teams, one of which, the New Jersey Generals, was owned by President Donald Trump. The league was beset with problems, not the least of which was finding stadiums to play in. Ultimately, over half a dozen teams folded when the league’s brain trust decided to compete directly with the NFL by scheduling games in the fall. By 1985, the league was finished.\n\n20. Home\n\nCompany: Facebook\n\nFacebook Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Mobile phone app\n\nWith rising mobile phone use and social media engagement, Facebook in 2013 decided to launch a family of apps that combine these trends. Facebook Home converts the home screen of a smartphone into the Facebook news feed. While most of Facebook’s over 1 billion users log in to their accounts on a smartphone, the social media giant’s new product never caught on. Early users cited clunky operation, the inability to toggle between Facebook Home and the original phone interface, and lack of options for customization, among other snags.\n\n21. Edsel\n\nCompany: Ford\n\nFord Year introduced: 1957\n\n1957 What it was: Car\n\nFord spent a year aggressively marketing the Edsel -- named after Henry Ford’s son -- ahead of its 1957 release. It was to be the “car of the future,” made available on dealership lots on what Ford dubbed “E-Day.\" Despite the hype, the car was a commercial disaster. It was considerably overpriced, disappointingly not futuristic, and generally ugly. Ford ceased the car's production after only two years, losing an estimated $350 million.\n\n22. Friendster\n\nCompany: Friendster\n\nFriendster Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Social media site\n\nSocial media site Facebook is one of the biggest corporate success stories in recent memory. Unfortunately, when it comes to social media, for every success story there is at least one flop -- as in the case of Friendster. The site’s users suffered through slow page loading times and the company’s developers failed to scale up when the number of subscribers spiked. Ultimately, competitors such as Facebook provided a much better user experience. Introduced in 2002, Friendster discontinued its services in mid-2015.\n\n23. WOW! Chips\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Snack\n\nPepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay introduced its line of WOW! Chips in 1998. The chips, which were made with the fat substitute olestra, were marketed as a healthy snacking alternative. While WOW! Chips were an initial success with $347 million in sales in their first year -- the most of any new product in 1998 -- sales slowed when the unpleasant side effects of olestra, such as diarrhea and cramps, became better known. To add to the product’s problems, the Food and Drug Administration instituted labeling requirements for all products containing olestra to carry warnings of “abdominal cramping and loose stools,\" and by 2000, sales of WOW! Chips were roughly 60% of what they were in the year of their release.\n\nMore: Per capita government spending: How much does your state spend on you?\n\n24. Zune\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: MP3 player\n\nIn an attempt to compete with Apple's dominant iPod MP3 player, Microsoft released the Zune in 2006. As of November 15, 2015, Microsoft discontinued all streaming, downloading, and other music services for the Zune. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Microsoft recorded a 42% decline in revenue in its non-gaming devices segment -- a decline largely attributable to the Zune’s poor performance. While the device might have been a reasonable choice for consumers, a number of reported bugs did not help sales. On December 31, 2008, most if not all 30GB Zunes stopped functioning simply because the underlying code had failed to account for the extra day in leap years.\n\n25. Relenza\n\nCompany: GlaxoSmithKline\n\nGlaxoSmithKline Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Influenza pandemic drug\n\nIn 1999, a flu pandemic fear caused by the spread of avian flu created demand for antiviral medications. The FDA approved two flu drugs during the pandemic -- Tamiflu and Relenza. The former went on to report massive sales, while the latter became one of the worst product flops in the pharmaceutical industry. The powder form of the drug caused respiratory problems in some patients and was only approved as a treatment for influenza rather than a preventative measure. GlaxoSmithKline sold just $13 million worth of the drug in the first quarter of 2006. By comparison, Roche reported $770 million in Tamiflu sales in the first half of the year.\n\n26. Google+\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Social media site\n\nNo all product flops are necessarily discontinued. Sometimes, despite failing to live up to company expectations, they linger. Such is the case with Google+, the social media platform the Silicon Valley giant launched in 2011 to compete with Facebook. However, even with a monumental marketing campaign, Google+ failed to distinguish itself from Facebook and never took off in the same manner. While the site experienced an initial surge in subscribers, by April 2015, Google+ had experienced a 98% decline in user engagement. Today, Google+ has some active user groups and is often used to share photos.\n\n27. HP Touchpad\n\nCompany: Hewlett-Packard\n\nHewlett-Packard Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Tablet computer\n\nThe TouchPad was Hewlett Packard’s attempt to compete with Apple’s wildly successful iPad. Hewlett Packard unveiled the device in the middle of 2011 with an extremely costly advertising campaign. The rollout incorporated numerous celebrity contracts. By late summer, however, box stores such as Best Buy were sitting on excess inventory, and HP began offering steep discounts. Many discounted TouchPads were sold at a loss, and it is estimated the company lost hundreds of millions on the product in all.\n\n28. Kellogg's Breakfast Mates\n\nCompany: Kellogg's\n\nKellogg's Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Breakfast food\n\nIn 1998, Kellogg’s introduced Breakfast Mates, an all-in-one package containing a serving of cereal, a small carton of milk, and a plastic spoon. The product was designed as a time saver that would appeal busy families with two working parents. The stated convenience of the all-in-one packaging did little to save time, largely because traditional cereal is already relatively convenient to consume. In a controlled test reported by The New York Times, preparing a bowl of cereal the traditional way took only one second longer than preparing a bowl of Breakfast Mates. To make matters worse, the product’s $30 million ad campaign sent a mixed message, depicting a family eating the supposedly portable cereal around the kitchen table. In August 1999, Kellogg’s announced Breakfast Mates would be discontinued due to low sales.\n\n29. Maxwell House Brewed Coffee\n\nCompany: Maxwell House\n\nMaxwell House Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Coffee\n\nMaxwell House Brewed Coffee was pre-brewed coffee sold in a carton with a picture of a hot mug of coffee on the packaging, a misleading visual cue for a product meant to be stored in the refrigerator. Adding to the product’s issues, the carton was lined with foil and could not be microwaved. For a product marketed for its convenience, this was an especially problematic feature for consumers. The product was discontinued shortly after it was released.\n\n30. Arch Deluxe\n\nCompany: McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's Year introduced: 1996\n\n1996 What it was: Hamburger\n\nMcDonald’s introduced several failed products throughout its 60-year history, but none so monumental as the Arch Deluxe. Introduced in 1996, the Arch Deluxe was marketed as a more gastronomic hamburger with “a grown-up taste.\" One commercial featured a child unable to enjoy the sophisticated burger, stripping its toppings to satisfy his unrefined palate. The Arch Deluxe’s advertising budget was an estimated $200 million, the most of any fast food product at the time. However, the approach failed and sales of the Arch Deluxe missed the $1 billion expectation set for its first year. The Arch Deluxe was eventually discontinued.\n\nMore: Wage potential: Highest paying jobs you can get without a college degree\n\n31. HD DVD\n\nCompany: Toshiba\n\nToshiba Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nBlu-ray’s succession of the DVD was not preordained. Before Blu-ray was the dominant medium for video playback, it was competing with Toshiba’s HD DVD. Essentially the same product, HD DVD was effectively taken out to pasture when in January 2008, Warner Bros. announced it would only support Sony’s Blu-ray format. Toshiba was not the only loser in the battle against Blu-ray. Millions of Americans found themselves stuck with HD DVD players and laptops after the dust settled.\n\n32. Microsoft Bob\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: User interface\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Bob in March 1995. Intended as a simple, easy-to-use OS interface at the time, Bob presented the desktop as a house, with familiar objects corresponding with different computer applications. Clicking on the stationary lying on a desk, for example, opened the word processor. Despite its simple appearance, Bob required more processing power than most home computers had in 1995. Bob was also considered too expensive and poorly designed, and was overshadowed by the release of Windows 95 later that year. Bob was discontinued roughly a year after its release.\n\n33. 47 Ronin\n\nCompany: Universal Pictures\n\nUniversal Pictures Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Movie\n\nThe 2013 fantasy action film “47 Ronin”, starring Keanu Reeves, is now notorious as one of the biggest box office flops of all time. The movie lost nearly $150 million on a $225 million budget and left Universal Pictures in the red for the fiscal year. Insiders point to multiple rewrites of the screenplay as well as several post-production changes that were made as filmmakers and studio executives attempted to find creative balance while appeasing moviegoers. In the end, the film failed to strike a chord with audiences and critics alike.\n\n34. Qwikster\n\nCompany: Netflix\n\nNetflix Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: DVD rental service\n\nBefore Netflix became the media streaming giant we know today, it was exclusively a deliver-by-mail DVD rental service. In an ill conceived of strategy, CEO Reed Hastings announced in September 2011 the company's plan to spin off its DVD rental service into a separate company, known as Qwikster. The move, which was meant to allow Netflix to focus more on its streaming services, would have cost consumers about 60% more if they wished to continue to have access to both services. Unpopular with customers and widely criticized, Hastings scrapped the plan less than a month after it was announced.\n\n35. Virtual Boy\n\nCompany: Nintendo\n\nNintendo Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Portable game console\n\nVirtual Boy was game console maker Nintendo’s early foray into virtual reality technology. However, the company discontinued the portable console less than a year after its 1995 release, selling just 770,000 units globally. It is known as one of the company’s worst failures. To cut costs and reduce battery drain, Nintendo used only black and red shades in Virtual Boy games, which bothered some users. Using the Virtual Boy also caused eye strain in some users, which led Nintendo to include an automatic shutoff mechanism.\n\n36. MeeGo\n\nCompany: Nokia/Intel\n\nNokia/Intel Year introduced: 2010\n\n2010 What it was: Operating system\n\nUnlike Windows Vista, another operating system on this list, smartphone OS MeeGo was not necessarily a flawed product. By most accounts, the MeeGo operating system just came at the wrong time. Not long after its introduction, the operating system was dropped by then Nokia CEO Stephen Elop in favor of Windows Phone 7 operating system. Though it has not been used in years, MeeGo may find a second life as a tablet operating system.\n\n37. Crystal Pepsi\n\nCompany: Pepsi\n\nPepsi Year introduced: 1992\n\n1992 What it was: Soda\n\nCrystal Pepsi was introduced to soda lovers across the United States in 1992. The product tasted like regular cola but was clear and caffeine free in an attempt to convey purity and heath. Crystal Pepsi was heavily promoted, with the company even buying an ad slot during Super Bowl XXVII. Despite strong initial sales, the public’s interest quickly waned and the soda was discontinued less than two years after its release.\n\n38. Hot Wheels and Barbie computers\n\nCompany: Mattel / Patriot Computers\n\nMattel / Patriot Computers Year released: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Toy computer\n\nIn 1999, Mattel announced that it had entered a licensing agreement to sell Barbie and Hot Wheels computers. The computers would be manufactured and sold by the Patriot Computer Corporation, a privately held company based in Toronto. The move was part of an attempt to reconcile the declining sales of Barbie dolls and growing sales of software and CD-ROMs.\n\nThe computers, however, had many manufacturing flaws, and the resources Patriot devoted to fixing and replacing broken computers drove it out of business. By December the following year, the company had fired its 200 employees and filed for bankruptcy.\n\nMore: How much did a personal computer cost the year you were born?\n\n39. LaserDisc\n\nCompany: Phillips\n\nPhillips Year introduced: 1978\n\n1978 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nLaserDisc was effectively a precursor to the DVD, offering consumers a higher quality picture and sound than VHS tapes. The product’s numerous drawbacks, however, outweighed any benefits. Unlike VHS players, LaserDisc players could not record television shows -- an important feature before the days of TiVo. LaserDisc players, as well as LaserDiscs themselves, were also relatively expensive. Introduced in the 1970s, LaserDisc made a brief comeback in the 90s, but ultimately failed to gain traction.\n\n40. Dreamcast\n\nCompany: Sega\n\nSega Year introduced: 1999 (North America)\n\n1999 (North America) What it was: Game console\n\nIn the 1990s, Sega was a dominant player in the consoles and games business. Sega had such success with its Sonic the Hedgehog games and Genesis console, that at one point the company held 60% of the North American market. The Dreamcast launched in 1999 in North America, within a few years of successful predecessors like the Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation. Many consider the Dreamcast to have been ahead of its time -- it was the first console to introduce worldwide network compatibility -- but the system just never caught on. Dreamcast sold miserably and was discontinued after just over two years, in part due to the success of the PS2, which launched in 2000. While it was not Sega’s only failure, it may have been its most colossal, marking the end of the company’s attempts at game consoles.\n\n41. S&W Mountain Bikes\n\nCompany: Smith & Wesson\n\nSmith & Wesson Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Mountain bike\n\nGun manufacturer Smith & Wesson has been making police bicycles for about 20 years. The company also attempted to sell mountain bikes to the general public in 2002. Like many other products on this list, the company’s consumer bike segment likely failed because bicycles were too far beyond the scope of the Smith & Wesson brand and what most Americans associate with it.\n\n42. Lisa\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1983\n\n1983 What it was: Personal computer\n\nBefore Apple hit its stride in the 2000s and became the most profitable corporation in history, the company was responsible for some of the worst product flops of all time. Designed as a high-end personal computer with a graphical user interface for business customers, the Apple Lisa took three years and $50 million to develop before its release in 1983. However, the computer’s $9,995 price tag, which is equivalent to roughly $25,000 today, was too high for many consumers. After selling just 100,000 units in two years Apple discontinued the Lisa in 1985.\n\n43. Betamax\n\nCompany: Sony\n\nSony Year introduced: 1975\n\n1975 What it was: Video cassette format\n\nIn the early 1970s, videotapes were still a novel technology, and the VHS tape had yet to become the standard video cassette format. Sony introduced the Betamax format in 1975, one year before JVC introduced the VHS tape. While Betamax tapes had superior resolution and sound quality, Sony refrained from licensing its technology to other manufacturers, in turn limiting the variety of movies available on the format. Meanwhile, JVC licensed its VHS technology to any interested manufacturer. The Betamax’s share of the VCR market fell from 100% in 1975 to 10% in 1988, and continued to dwindle in the following years.\n\n44. Too Human\n\nCompany: Silicon Knights\n\nSilicon Knights Year introduced: 2008\n\n2008 What it was: Video game\n\nReleased in 2008 after years of costly development delays, “Too Human” failed to live up to expectation and became one of the worst flops in video game history. A legal ruling eventually removed the game from the marketplace and pushed Silicon Knights, the game’s developer, into bankruptcy. The game’s production budget skyrocketed to an estimated $100 million after the game engine developer, Epic Games, failed to deliver the engine on time, forcing Silicon Knights to build it own game engine. When Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for missing the deadline, the latter counter-sued, which resulted in a court order forcing the developer to destroy all unsold copies of the game.\n\nMore: Are these the worst cities to live in?

Mobile ESPN\n\nCompany: ESPN\n\nESPN Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Mobile phone service\n\nIn 2006, ESPN attempted to capitalize on the desire of sports fan to have access to sports stats, scores, and video on the go. Mobile ESPN required users to buy a specific phone, which would include access to ESPN content as part of the subscription. However, the only phone Mobile ESPN offered, a Sanyo, cost $400, and the service was $40 per month, too rich for many sports fans. The service shut down within a year. Disney, ESPN’s parent company, spent $150 million on the failed venture.\n\n46. Life Savers soda\n\nCompany: Life Savers\n\nLife Savers Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Soft drink\n\nThough Life Savers soda tested well in focus groups, it failed to gain traction with the broader consumer market. Many attribute the soft drink’s failure to the prevailing perception that it was liquid candy. The soda was available in some of the candy’s popular fruit flavors, including pineapple, orange punch, grape punch, and lime punch. Life Savers did not release a mint flavored soda, however.\n\n47. Mars Needs Moms\n\nCompany: Walt Disney Motion\n\nWalt Disney Motion Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Studio film\n\nReleased in March 2011, Disney’s “Mars Needs Moms” grossed just $6.9 million in its opening weekend. Produced with a $150 million budget, “Mars Needs Moms” was one of the worst flops in cinema history. Film critics partially blame animation studio ImageMovers Digital for the film’s box office failure. The movie was animated using an expensive motion-capture process, a technology still in its infancy. According to one viewer, “The movie looked downright creepy.” ImageMovers Digital was closed after the studio wrapped production on the film.\n\n48. EONS\n\nCompany: Eons.com\n\nEons.com Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Social media site\n\nIn July 2006, Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor launched Eons.com -- a social network for baby boomers and other internet users over the age of 50. According to surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, an estimated 32% of seniors over the age of 65 used the internet at the time of the website’s launch compared to 86% of young adults aged 18 to 29. While the share of seniors on the internet has doubled over the past decade, Eons failed to gain traction and was sold to Crew Media in 2011.\n\n49. Supertrain\n\nCompany: NBC\n\nNBC Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: TV show\n\nWhen NBC’s “Supertrain” premiered in 1979, it was the most expensive TV series ever aired. Set aboard a nuclear-powered train that travels between New York City and Los Angeles at speeds nearing 200 miles an hour, the show’s production required a model train set that cost around $3 million in today’s dollars. The model crashed during its first demonstration, and the show as a whole soon followed. Debuting to poor ratings and negative reviews, “Supertrain” was cancelled after just nine episodes.\n\n50. Galaxy Note 7\n\nCompany: Samsung\n\nSamsung Year introduced: 2016\n\n2016 What it was: Tablet phone\n\nSamsung, which has overtaken Apple in the smartphone market last year, also had one of (the larger and--optional) more recent product flops. The Note S7, a phablet that launched in August 2016, was initially well received. However, it had a serious flaw. A problem with the battery software resulted in the phones catching fire on several occasions, including once on a SouthWest Airlines flight, which had to be evacuated. Soon, the Department of Transportation made it illegal to bring a Note 7 on a commercial flight. By October, after an extremely expensive recall, Samsung suspended worldwide production of the Note 7. The company lost what is estimated to be over $3 billion due to the debacle, and Apple once again took the lead in the global smartphone market earlier this year.\n\nMore: Can you afford that new vehicle? 25 most expensive car models to insure\n\nDetailed findings and methodology\n\nHindsight is 20/20, and while many of these gaffes might not have been predictable at the time, the reasons for their failure are often much clearer today. The reasons for the failures often fall into one of a several categories: overpricing, timing, bad advertising, product flaws, and reaching beyond what consumers of a brand are willing to accept.\n\nSometimes products are sold at a premium because they offer features competitors do not, either perceived or actual. When customers do not feel a product is superior to another -- rightly so or not -- they will not pay the premium price. While Apple is able to sell computers at a premium today because of its brand perception, the Lisa, introduced in 1983, failed largely as a result of its nearly $10,000 price tag.\n\nMany of the products on this list could have been perfectly viable, possibly even a hit, if they had been introduced at a different time. Sega’s Dreamcast was the first major console to introduce global network connectivity, but this was before every home had a stable connection fast enough to make the Dreamcast viable at the time.\n\nFor some flops on this list, it appears poor market research doomed these products. McDonald’s Arch Deluxe was marketed as a burger for those with refined palates, turning away kids, as well as many adults, from the ill-fated item. Coca-Cola completely misjudged the desire of its customers when it changed its classic flavor and introduced New Coke.\n\nSometimes, brands overextend their reach, introducing products that clash with their image and target demographics. One does not need to dig too deep to understand why Colgate, a brand associated with toothpaste, failed to make its line of frozen dinner products a success. The same can be said for Cosmopolitan’s brand of yogurt, Smith & Wesson’s mountain bike line, or Harley Davidson’s perfume.\n\nOf course, many of the products on this list were simply poorly designed or faulty -- at times downright dangerous. Such was the case with Mattel’s line of seriously flawed Hot Wheels and Barbie computers, or the Galaxy Note 7, plagued by battery fires that caused the phone to be banned on airplanes, recalled, and eventually discontinued.\n\nDespite their disappointing launches, some of these products still exist today. Google’s Glass and Google+ each became the butt of jokes after failing to live up to lofty promises. One day, we may see one of these flops become the product it was meant to be.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

But there was a time when it could reap a sizeable reward from the exposure.\n\n\"Northern Exposure,\" for one.\n\nThe acclaimed gefilte-fish-out-of-water show, focusing on a young New York-trained doctor forced to serve the first four years of his practice in backwoods Alaska, made its CBS debut 30 years ago, on July 12, 1990. It turned a low-profile eight-week introduction into a six-season Emmy- and Peabody-winning run.\n\nFeaturing an ensemble cast of TV unknowns, and set where few series before it had landed, \"Exposure\" told of fresh-from-residency Dr. Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow), contractually bound to set up shop in the 49th state as repayment for its funding of his medical education. He heads west expecting Anchorage. What he gets is the tiny rural hamlet of Cicely (Population: 215), where moose have the Main Street right-of-way.\n\nThat the arrogant Fleischman doesn’t take to the place – even as the town populace (or most of it) takes to him – is the stuff of which TV shows are made. And \"Exposure\" made it like few at the time, with stories often teetering on the edge of reality and its cast lost somewhere between Grover’s Corners and \"Green Acres.\"\n\nThose who counted Cicely home: an elderly bar owner (John Cullum) and his 40-years-younger new wife (Cynthia Geary); a take-no-prisoners general storekeeper (Peg Phillips); a hunky, ex-con Nietzsche-quoting DJ (John Corbett); a teenaged Spielberg hopeful (Darren E. Burrows); a poker-faced medical-office assistant (Elaine Miles), a Native Alaskan; a beautiful strong-willed bush-pilot (Janine Turner) who serves as Fleischman’s landlord and romantic thorn; and a former-astronaut-turned-self-appointed town boss (Barry Corbin).\n\nExpectations were modest when \"Exposure\" showed up on CBS’s tundra of a schedule in the summer of 1990. The network was coming off a miserable season that saw just one of 17 new scripted series (family sitcom \"Major Dad\") survive. And there was no easy peg on which to hang the show. But its auspices were impressive: creators/producers Joshua Brand and John Falsey had met as writers on the late 1970s hit \"The White Shadow\" and went on to create the Emmy-winning NBC dramas \"St. Elsewhere,\" \"A Year in the Life\" and \"I’ll Fly Away.\" Early reviews were positive, and \"Exposure\" found a warm summer reception.\n\nPicked up for another short season in 1990-1991, it didn’t air again until the following spring. But as fans awaited it, word-of-mouth and appreciation grew. In March 1991, a month before the start of its second season, it was honored at the Museum of Television and Radio’s annual TV Festival ( now known as the PaleyFest).\n\nBoth season made the show Emmy-eligible, and it secured three 1991 nominations, including Best Drama and Best Writing (for the pilot episode).The show found a regular slot on CBS schedule that fall, for a third season, and by the time that ended, it was prime-time’s hottest show, nominated for 16 Emmys in 1992 and winning six, including Best Drama.\n\nIf the early 1990s were about re-inventing comedy with shows like \"Seinfeld,\" \"The Simpsons\" and \"In Living Color,\" \"Exposure\" did its part to rethink the drama. (The top-rated scripted show at the time was CBS's \"Murder, She Wrote.\") It lived in a literary world observed by critics as magical realism. Episodes ranged from breezy (“Aurora Borealis,” the first-season finale and consistent fan favorite) to bold (the Peabody-winning town-origin story “Cicely”) to prosaic (“A Hunting We Will Go,” which ends with young Ed Chigliak (Burrows) presenting elderly shopkeeper Ruth-Anne (Phillips) a mountaintop grave as a birthday gift).\n\nShot on location in Washington state, both on a soundstage outside Seattle and in the Cascade Mountains 80 miles south, which doubled for rural Alaska, the series also celebrated the majestic landscape of The Last Frontier as it incorporated both its indigenous people and traditions indigenous.\n\nAt the core, however, the twin currents of \"Exposure\" were Fleischman’s ill-at-ease existence in his new home and his fractious Will-they-or-won’t-they relationship with pilot Maggie O’Connell (Turner). Both came to lose charge as Fleischman settled into Cicely, and once the romance was consummated midway through the fourth season. \"Exposure\" fervor lessened with viewers, too, likely helped by Morrow’s well-documented discontent tied to his salary demands.\n\nThe actor’s own exposure, thanks to a lead role in Robert Redford’s well-regarded \"Quiz Show\" in 1994 led to his departure from the show. New characters were introduced to compensate. But the series had lost its rooting and CBS’s confidence. and was cancelled in 1995 after 110 episodes.\n\nIn its six seasons, \"Exposure\" shook up the formulaic prime-time world with what might be called TV’s first holistic series, catering to viewers’ emotional and spiritual well-beings. Nominated for 39 Emmys (10 cast members were cited over its run) and praised for its writing, it mined material few other dramas of the time had, from Native American mysticism to lesbian partnerships to Jungian debates. Equal parts philosophical and cartoonish, it was Plato meets Pluto. On the Writer’s Guild of America list of the 101 best written TV series, \"Exposure\" ranks 53rd.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2013/01/20/fox-kevin-bacon-following/1842971/", "title": "'The Following': Can viewers connect with a killer?", "text": "Gary Levin, USA TODAY\n\n%22I like television that grabs me by the throat and shakes me up and down%2C%22 says James Purefoy%2C who plays the serial killer\n\nFox%27s marketing campaign launched around the time of the Sandy Hook shootings\n\nThe midseason drama premieres Monday night %289 ET/PT%29\n\nYONKERS, N.Y. — The Following, Fox's grisly crime thriller premiering Monday (9 p.m. ET/PT), is all about connections.\n\nThere are the connections of mass murderer Joe Carroll (Rome's James Purefoy), a literature professor imprisoned for the 2003 slayings of 14 women, to the macabre works of 19th-century author Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nThere are the connections of Carroll to FBI agent Ryan Hardy (Kevin Bacon), who wrote a best seller about the case he cracked before his affair with Carroll's wife was made public and his life went into a downward spiral. \"He became kind of the walking dead,\" says Bacon. \"Spinning his wheels, drinking too much, living in this pad in Brooklyn, and he has this book (that) in some ways, he's ashamed to have written, trading on this horror.\"\n\nThere are the emotional connections between Carroll and a small army of cult \"followers\" who commit murders on his behalf.\n\nAnd there are the unfortunate but unavoidable connections, in the media and the public's mind, between Fox's much-anticipated midseason drama and the real-life carnage of Sandy Hook. That mass murder occurred about the same time the network started its major publicity push, a linkage that forced it to tone down a marketing campaign featuring a woman wielding an ice pick.\n\nPurefoy, who describes The Following as \"deeply unsettling,\" is unapologetic about the show's startling, graphic violence, which seldom relies on gunplay but instead leans toward blood-soaked stabbings, eye-gouging and, in one scene, setting a man on fire.\n\n\"I'm not a fan of Ambien TV, that drifts through you,\" he says. \"I like television that grabs me by the throat and shakes me up and down.\" And in a cultural climate teeming with vampires and zombies, \"serial killers are one of the scariest of them all, because they're real. He could be the guy in the grocery store who's looking at you funny.\"\n\nCreator Kevin Williamson describes the show as \"emotional horror. It's got a very out-there story line and is very scary, but the twists and turns of genre storytelling allow for love and an emotional component\" tied to two unlikely triangles, including the one between Hardy, Carroll and his ex-wife, Claire Matthews (Natalie Zea).\n\nThough crime and mayhem is among TV's most popular genres, Williamson responded to aggressive questioning by critics this month at the Television Critics Association press tour, saying his writers were \"traumatized\" by the real-world shootings. \"There is a reaction to it, and it sort of finds its way into what I do,\" he says, noting that the 1999 Columbine killings partly inspired him to explore the minds of killers. But \"I'm writing fiction. I'm just a storyteller.\"\n\nFox chairman Kevin Reilly says the show doesn't deserve to become the poster child for televised gore. Ultimately, \"it's a cop chasing a bad guy. I'm not glorifying killers,\" Reilly says.\n\nAnd though it's being promoted with the quote \"You won't believe it's not on cable,\" Williamson certainly does. Unlike cable, programming on local broadcast stations is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, which often turns a blind eye to mayhem but is prudish about sex.\n\n\"The shocking thing is, we do have to challenge broadcast standards,\" he says. \"We killed four people in one episode, but they said no to the three-way.\"\n\nA film without an ending\n\nThe Following kicks into gear when Carroll escapes from prison in Monday's premiere. Hardy is called out of retirement to find him again, only to discover he'd used a prison computer to lure and direct a cult of willing \"followers\" to do his bidding as a sign of their devotion. Who they are, how many there are and where they'll strike next is what propels the show each week.\n\n\"The big story is, how far has this cult gone? How many followers are there? What is its reach?\" Bacon says. \"And also, what's his end game? Is it all about me, making me suffer? Is it about Claire? Your kid? What's the plan? And hopefully the audience is going to be wondering the same thing.\"\n\nWilliamson developed the idea years ago as a feature film but couldn't come up with an ending. So the writer behind such varied projects as the Scream movies, Dawson's Creek and The Vampire Diaries pitched it as a series that would toggle between the present day and flashbacks that develop the characters and fill in gaps in the original crime spree.\n\n\"We're asking you to root for this broken leading man and (ask), 'Will he ever find love?' \" he says. And for Purefoy's Carroll, who \"drips with charisma\" as he seduces — figuratively, at least — his acolytes. \"He's a person who can look at someone, size them up, figure out what they're missing and make them whole,\" Williamson says. \"He's practicing the religion of living life through death. It's a little dark, a little psycho, it's a little twisted. Even our heroes are very dark and damaged.\"\n\nEspecially Hardy, who has \"a strange kind of admiration for this guy,\" Bacon says. \"He's a horrible person, he's a murderer, he's despicable, I want him dead. And yet there are aspects of his personality I kind of admire and wish I was more like. He's great with people, he's charming, he's erudite, he's well-read — all things that I am not.\"\n\nPurefoy says the two main characters \"have a very complicated, symbiotic relationship\" as each has made a celebrity of the other. \"They feed off each other,\" he says. \"It's a very strange love story, in a weird way, with the two of them.\"\n\nFox's Reilly says he was looking for a show with an \"intensity\" that could make it a worthy successor to spy drama 24, which ran for eight seasons, most recently in the same Monday time slot. The network's audience has shrunk 20% this season, with American Idol's return last week down 18%.\n\nIn a season bereft of buzzed-about new hits, AMC's The Walking Dead was TV's top draw among young adults last fall, marginalizing the big networks' long-held dominance. The Following generated early critical heat — not to mention publicity — and is seen as the networks' best chance to break through this winter.\n\n\"There are not that many shows that will grab you and say, 'This must be watched now,' \" Reilly says. \"I feel like it surprises you at every turn, and my palms sweat when I watch it. And I think that's a good thing. It's nice to watch a show where you go, 'I'm not sure I want to keep watching this, but I can't stop.' That's one marker for a good thriller.\"\n\n'More heroic' role on TV\n\nBut not all serial killers are created equal.\n\nCompared with Carroll,The Silence of the Lambs' cannibal Hannibal Lecter (who is also coming to network TV in an upcoming NBC drama) is \"a man of remarkably little vision,\" Purefoy says. \"He can barely see beyond his next meal.\" And Showtime's Dexter is merely \"a man who's doing community service\" by killing off bad guys who escape justice.\n\nProducers are coy about whether Carroll stays on the lam, but Purefoy is less cagey: \"I'm not sure there's an actor alive who would sign a seven-year contract to stay in an orange jumpsuit.\"\n\nThe series marks Bacon's first starring role on TV and his first series since CBS soap Guiding Light in the early 1980s, between roles in Animal House and Diner. The actor, 54, has done so many movies that the well-known trivia game he inspired, Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, is now an easy Google search. (Just type any actor's name followed by \"Bacon number.\")\n\nBut recent roles have left him yearning for meatier fare.\n\n\"I was getting frustrated with the movie scripts I was reading and the opportunities,\" he says in an interview in his trailer, as his rescue dog, Lilly, idles impatiently nearby with a squeak toy. \"I was getting bad-guy stuff,\" including upcoming roles in comics-based R.I.P.D. and a new X-Men film. \"That's fine, I don't have a problem with it. But I've always been someone who doesn't want to keep doing the same thing,\" he says. \"I knew if I went to television that I wanted something more heroic.\"\n\nAnd though he insisted he'd consider only cable series — he wanted raw life-or-death material and fewer episodes — he responded to Williamson's over-the-top script. (\"It seems like he has a brilliant if slightly twisted mind,\" Bacon says.)\n\nComparing notes with his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, who just wrapped up a six-season run on TNT hit The Closer, he also negotiated a 15-episode season (network series traditionally shoot 22 or more) and filming locations near his home in New York City, although the series is set in Virginia.\n\nOn a warm December day along the Hudson River here, Hardy is investigating a crime scene in which the body of another woman named Claire Matthews has been dumped out of a high-rise apartment window by a female follower attempting to draw Carroll's Claire out of hiding.\n\nWhat did Bacon learn from Sedgwick and his time directing four Closer episodes? \"Seeing what her hours were like\" and \"the pace and intensity and exhaustion of getting an hour (drama) done,\" he says. But her character, Brenda Leigh Johnson, \"talks a lot more than Ryan Hardy. I don't know how she did it.\"\n\nAnd Hardy is wondering the same thing about Joe Carroll's murderous spree.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/16/us/five-things-october-16-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know on October 16, 2022: Start your week smart: Snow ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nHow much would you pay for a pair of old and dirty Levi’s jeans?

Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled read", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}]}

Santos has faced questions over his wealth and loans totaling more than $700,000 he made to his successful 2022 campaign.\n\nSantos told Semafor on Wednesday that he made his money through “capital introduction” and “deal making” for “high net worth individuals.”\n\nThe US attorney’s office in the Eastern District of New York declined to comment.\n\nCBS News first reported the federal probe, which comes as the Nassau County district attorney’s office announced Wednesday that it was looking into fabrications from Santos.\n\n“The numerous fabrications and inconsistencies associated with Congressman-Elect Santos are nothing short of stunning,” said Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly.\n\nShe said that residents in New York’s 3rd Congressional District, which covers parts of Nassau County, “must have an honest and accountable representative in Congress. No one is above the law and if a crime was committed in this county, we will prosecute it.”\n\nBrendan Brosh, a spokesperson for the office, added, “We are looking into the matter.”\n\nCNN has reached out to a representative for Santos for comment on the probes.\n\nThe New York Times first revealed last week that Santos’ biography appeared to be partly fictional. CNN confirmed details of that reporting about his college education and employment history.\n\nCNN’s KFile uncovered even more falsehoods from Santos, including claims he was forced to leave a New York City private school when his family’s real estate assets took a downturn and stating he represented Goldman Sachs at a top financial conference.\n\nSantos, in interviews with WABC radio and the New York Post earlier this week, admitted to lying about attending Baruch College and New York University as well as misrepresenting his employment at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup but claimed he hadn’t committed any crimes.\n\nCNN confirmed reporting from the Times that Santos was charged with embezzlement in a Brazilian court in 2011, according to case records from the Rio de Janeiro Court of Justice. However, court records from 2013 state that the charge was archived after court summons went unanswered and they were unable to locate Santos.\n\nIn the interview with the New York Post, Santos denied that he had been charged with any crime in Brazil.\n\n“I am not a criminal here – not here or in Brazil or any jurisdiction in the world.

He was released from custody on a $500,000 bond following his arraignment at a Long Island federal courthouse. If convicted, Santos could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nThe charges mark a significant escalation in the many legal and ethical probes the fabulist Republican lawmaker has faced since taking office. Breon Peace, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement that the charges against Santos aim to hold the freshman lawmaker accountable for numerous alleged \"fraudulent schemes and brazen misrepresentations.\"\n\n\"Taken together, the allegations in the indictment charge Santos with relying on repeated dishonesty and deception to ascend to the halls of Congress and enrich himself,\" Peace said.\n\nIn a news conference following his arraignment, a defiant Santos maintained innocence and called the investigation a \"witch hunt,\" echoing language frequently used by former President Donald Trump to undermine the legal probes he faces.\n\n\"I'm going to fight the witch hunt, I'm going to take care of clearing my name and I look forward to doing that,\" Santos said.\n\nSantos’ lawyer, Joseph Murray, said in court that the Republican lawmaker plans to continue his reelection campaign and asked the judge for permission to travel freely, though he did surrender his passport. Santos said after the arraignment that he trusts his constituents to \"decide what's best.\"\n\nSantos' indictment and arrest are the latest development in the saga of his rise and fall, from his surprise flip of a New York seat to the House of Representatives in the 2022 midterms to the swift unraveling of his supposed life story. Santos' exaggerations and fabrications about his personal and professional life – revealed in large part after his election to the U.S. House – rapidly elevated the freshman lawmaker's national profile, while drawing intense legal and ethical scrutiny.\n\nRead it yourself:Rep. George Santos indicted. Read the charges here\n\nSantos surrendered to authorities in Long Island on Wednesday morning, The New York Times first reported.\n\nThe New York congressman announced his reelection bid last month, despite facing an investigation from the House Ethics Committee on top of several state and federal investigations. A subcommittee of two Republicans and two Democrats established by the ethics committee are examining whether Santos engaged in \"unlawful activity\" during his 2022 campaign and investigating a sexual misconduct allegation involving a staffer.\n\nSantos has repeatedly said he would not step down from Congress despite bipartisan calls for his resignation, though he did resign from his committee assignments in January.\n\nAmong the claims Santos has made about his personal and professional life that have since been refuted: working at Citigroup or Goldman Sachs, losing four employees in the Pulse shooting, owning 13 properties, losing his mother in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, graduating from Baruch College in Manhattan as a volleyball star and studying at New York University.\n\nSantos has also faced allegations of questionable campaign finances reporting and pilfering from a fundraising campaign for a dying dog. The embattled Republican lawmaker acknowledged embellishing his educational background and job history but has denied most of the other allegations.\n\nFraud charges\n\nSantos allegedly transferred money from political donors into personal bank accounts during his campaign, using the funds for personal expenses, according to the Justice Department. He withdrew cash, discharged personal debts, transferred money to his associates and used the funds to make personal purchases, including of designer clothing, the DOJ claims.\n\nUnemployment insurance\n\nThe DOJ also alleged Santos committed unemployment insurance fraud by applying for benefits through the New York State Department of Labor in June 2020, even though he was employed. He allegedly fraudulently received more than $24,000 in unemployment insurance benefits as a result.\n\n\"From that point until April 2021 – when Santos was working and receiving a salary on a near-continuous basis and during his unsuccessful run for Congress – he falsely affirmed each week that he was eligible for unemployment benefits when he was not,\" the department said.\n\nFalse statements to Congress\n\nSantos also made efforts to mislead the U.S. House and the public about his financial condition in connection with his two congressional campaigns, the DOJ claims.\n\nIn March 2020, during his first House campaign, the DOJ alleges Santos falsely claimed in House disclosures that his only earned income – consisting of salary, commission and bonuses – amounted to $55,000 from an unnamed company. He also allegedly said the only compensation exceeding $5,000 was an unspecified commission bonus from that company.\n\nBut the Justice Department claims that in actuality, Santos \"overstated the income he received from Company #2 and altogether failed to disclose the salary he received from Investment Firm #1.\"\n\nDuring the 2022 midterms, the DOJ alleges that Santos made false claims in another disclosure form by including money he did not actually receive and by failing to disclose income and benefits he did receive.\n\nCriticism, calls for expulsion\n\nEd Cox, head of New York's Republican Party, said in a statement to USA TODAY that the \"story of George Santos is over.\"\n\n\"The writing has been on the wall for months: George Santos will not be a member of the next Congress,\" Cox said. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries used Santos' arrest to criticize the Republican Party.\n\n\"The party of George Santos and Marjorie Taylor Greene cannot be trusted to govern,\" Jeffries said, citing the controversial Georgia Rep. Greene. \"Not now. Not ever.\"\n\nRep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, on Wednesday called for Santos' immediate expulsion from Congress.\n\n\"The people of New York’s 3rd district deserve a voice in congress,\" Gonzales said in a tweet. \"George Santos should be immediately expelled from Congress and a special election initiated at the soonest possible date.\"\n\nDuring a press gaggle on Air Force One, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to comment on Santos' case, calling the Justice Department \"independent.\" She also demurred on whether Santos should be expelled from Congress.\n\n\"That's something for the House conference to decide on. ... How they want to show to the American people what they want their conference to look like, that's up to them,\" she said.\n\nSantos responds\n\nFollowing his arraignment, Santos told reporters that he intends to head back to Washington to vote on Republicans' first major border bill Thursday and thanked the party's leadership for being \"patient.\"\n\n\"I appreciate leadership for being patient at this time and for allowing the process to play out,\" he said. \"I think this is about innocent until proven guilty. I have my right to fight to prove my innocence, as the government has the right to fight to try to find me guilty.\"\n\nRead the indictment\n\nRep.

In interviews with WABC radio and the New York Post – the first times Santos has spoken publicly about the controversy – he acknowledged that he had fabricated some facts.\n\n“I am not a criminal. Not here, not abroad, in any jurisdiction in the world have I ever committed any crimes,” Santos said in an interview with WABC radio host John Catsimatidis.\n\n“To get down to the nit and gritty, I’m not a fraud.

I’m embarrassed and sorry for having embellished my resume,” he told the Post, adding that he owns up to that and that “we do stupid things in life.”\n\nHe told WABC, “I want to make sure that if I disappointed anyone by resume embellishment, I am sorry.”\n\nThe New York Times first revealed last week that Santos’ biography appeared to be partly fictional. CNN confirmed details of that reporting, including about his college education and employment history.\n\nCNN’s KFile also reported last week that claims by Santos that his grandparents “survived the Holocaust” as Ukrainian Jewish refugees from Belgium who changed their surname are contradicted by sources including family trees compiled by genealogy websites, records on Jewish refugees and interviews with multiple genealogists. A lawyer for Santos had declined to comment to CNN.\n\n“I never claimed to be Jewish,” Santos told the Post. “I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background I said I was ‘Jew-ish.’”\n\nSantos had said he was “very proud” of his “Jewish heritage” as recently as a late November 2022 appearance with the Jewish News Syndicate.\n\nCNN has reached out to House GOP leadership and the National Republican Congressional Committee in the wake of Santos’ admissions. House GOP leadership was silent amid last week’s revelations. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy would not answer CNN’s questions Thursday when asked if he was concerned about apparent misrepresentations.\n\nSantos defeated Democrat Robert Zimmerman in a newly drawn district covering parts of Queens and some nearby Long Island suburbs, flipping control to Republicans, who dominated the New York suburbs on their way to winning a House majority.\n\nIt was Santos’ second run – he lost to Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi in 2020 – and most of the criticism he faced during his recent campaign centered on his attendance of former President Donald Trump’s rally in Washington on January 6, 2021, and a video in which he claimed to have written a “nice check” to help alleged rioters with their legal fees.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional context.", "authors": ["Kyle Blaine"], "publish_date": "2022/12/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/05/13/week-in-politics-title-42-george-santos-indicted/70209081007/", "title": "This week in politics: Title 42 ends; Rep.

The company’s address is a house on Long Island, and The New York Times, which first published a story on Santos’ campaign finance filings, reported that a neighbor said Santos had been living there for months.\n\nThe expenditures, and particularly the $199.99 payments to Uber, Walgreens, Walmart, Best Buy, Delta Airlines, Il Bacco Restaurante and more, “definitely stood out to me,” said campaign finance expert Paul S. Ryan, the deputy executive director of the Funders’ Committee for Civic Participation.\n\nHe said the payments could reflect an effort to skirt FEC requirements for campaigns to keep receipts for expenditures over $200. The FEC encourages candidates to keep receipts below that threshold, but only mandates them for payments over $200.\n\nHowever, Ryan said, the consistent appearance of $199.99 charges effectively shows that Santos knew about the threshold he was attempting to skirt – potentially inviting Justice Department scrutiny and criminal penalties.\n\n“My view is a bunch of expenditures right below legal requirement for the committee to keep receipts is evidence that he knew what he was doing,” Ryan said. “If in fact he did misuse campaign funds, this was a blatant effort to evade detection.”\n\nDozens more expenditures are close to, but just under, the $200 threshold, FEC records show.\n\n“The only time during which money was being unwisely spent by the campaign was by a firm that was fired approximately one year before Election Day and a new team was brought in,” Joe Murray, a lawyer for Santos, said in a statement to CNN on Saturday.\n\n“Campaign expenditures for staff members including travel, lodging, and meals are normal expenses of any competent campaign. The suggestion that the Santos campaign engaged in any unlawful spending of campaign funds is irresponsible, at best,” he added.\n\nThe biography that Santos touted as a candidate appears to be at least partly fictional. Santos, in interviews with WABC radio and the New York Post earlier this week, admitted to lying about attending Baruch College and New York University as well as misrepresenting his employment at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup but claimed he hadn’t committed any crimes.\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York are investigating Santos’ personal finances, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, amid questions about his sudden wealth and loans of more than $700,000 that he made to his campaign.\n\nCNN confirmed reporting from The New York Times that Santos was charged with embezzlement in a Brazilian court in 2011, according to case records from the Rio de Janeiro Court of Justice. However, court records from 2013 state that the charge was archived after court summons went unanswered and they were unable to locate Santos.\n\nIn the interview with the New York Post, Santos denied that he had been charged with any crime in Brazil.\n\n“I am not a criminal here – not here or in Brazil or any jurisdiction in the world. Absolutely not. That didn’t happen,” Santos said.\n\nStill, Santos flipped a Democratic-held seat, helping Republicans win a narrow House majority. And he is set to take office on January 3.\n\nHouse Republican leaders have not acknowledged the controversy swirling around Santos. House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who has not returned CNN’s requests for comment about Santos, has been focused on trying to secure the votes for the speakership next month. That task became harder after Republicans won a narrower majority than he had hoped, a slim margin that will empower the conference’s most extreme members. Asking Santos to step down could cost him a vote in his already tenuous quest to reach 218.\n\nAmid the avalanche of revelations of ways in which Santos lied about his biography, many of those who voted for him in his Long Island-based New York 3rd Congressional District say they would not support him again.\n\nJack Mandel, a Jewish community leader who voted for Santos after meeting him twice and believing he was a kind, fresh face, said he “couldn’t in good conscience” vote for Santos again if he had to do over.\n\nHe pointed to Santos misrepresenting himself as Jewish and falsely claiming his grandparents were Holocaust survivors.\n\n“Once someone lies to me, I can never trust that individual again,” he said. “The Holocaust is something that touches the heart of every Jew and someone that would use that as a talking point as a vote getter, I think is wrong.”\n\nTeodora Choolfaian, a Nassau County mother, said she voted for Santos in part because of his positions on Covid-19 measures in schools. But this week she attended a rally organized by state Democrats to call on him to resign. She said Santos is a “fraud.”\n\n“The whole person that he created and the ability to deceive us is just so troubling,” she said. “This man should not be allowed to be in office and we all know it. I want to assure you the Republicans know it too.”\n\nHowever, some Republicans in New York said they were not dropping their support for Santos.\n\nTom Zmich, a former congressional candidate in the neighboring 6th District, said Santos is a friend of his and “hasn’t done anything wrong, as far as legality wise.”\n\n“He admitted he lied. And most Christian people believe in forgiveness. Maybe not forget, but move on,” he said. “Let’s see what happens.”\n\nSantos campaign donors also described feeling shocked and betrayed by the revelations in recent days.\n\nOne significant campaign donor, who requested anonymity to speak freely about his experience with Santos, told CNN on Thursday that he had been connected with Santos after GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York introduced them. “She asked me to talk to him when he first ran,” he told CNN.\n\nThis donor plans to speak with both Santos and Stefanik.\n\n“I liked George,” he told CNN, but “I’ve got to confront him – I don’t need any skeletons in my closet.”\n\nStefanik’s office did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nAlthough the donor initially “sensed” that Santos came across as an “embellisher,” the donor believed that Santos’ “heart was in the right place.” Santos allegedly told this donor that he worked at Goldman Sachs and would “always talk about the big deals he’d done.”\n\nAnother person who interacted with Santos at fundraising events told CNN that when he met Santos, he “thought he was a little fake-it-till-you-make it guy. … He was making these claims like he was a financial whiz.”\n\nThis person, who also requested anonymity to speak freely about Santos, told CNN he has been in contact with the representative-elect, and shared text messages from December 22 in which Santos claimed he has been in touch with the Office of Congressional Ethics.\n\n“I’ve been in touch with the office of congressional ethics and anything they want they have,” Santos told the person in a text message shared with CNN.\n\nIt is unclear whether Santos has been in touch with the Office of Congressional Ethics, and if so, who initiated the contact. Santos made the comment in an exchange in which he appeared to be trying to assuage a concerned donor.\n\nCNN has reached out to the OCE requesting confirmation. The office investigates complaints from the public and could refer the matter to the House Ethics Committee – potentially the first step toward a congressional investigation of Santos.\n\nSantos’ office has not responded to CNN’s repeated requests for comment.\n\nAnother campaign donor, who similarly requested anonymity to speak freely, told CNN on Friday that she “of course is shocked” following the news of the congressman-elect’s alleged deception and feels “betrayed and lied to.”\n\nThe donor explained that she had supported Santos because he was the frontrunner in her local race, and, “I had no reason to think that he would have done what he did.”\n\n“I usually have fairly good instincts, but he was just good at this!” she told CNN.\n\nShe said she doesn’t understand why he would make up these claims.\n\n“It is one thing to embellish, and the work experience alone doesn’t disturb me as much,” she said. “But to make up heritage – that is unspeakable.”\n\nThis story has been updated Saturday with a statement from Santos’ attorney.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Eva Mckend Pamela Brown Allison Gordon", "Eric Bradner", "Eva Mckend", "Pamela Brown", "Allison Gordon"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/politics/george-santos-democrats-gop-leadership/index.html", "title": "George Santos faces growing condemnation as House GOP ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGOP Rep.-elect George Santos is facing growing condemnation from House Democrats, some of whom have called on him to step aside, and even from some corners of the GOP, with at least one of his fellow incoming Republicans calling for him to face an ethics investigation.

Joaquin Castro of Texas and Ted Lieu of California were among those calling on Santos – after the congressman-elect gave interviews acknowledging “embellishing” his resume – to resign and if he refuses, for the House to expel him.\n\nReporter who broke the inconsistencies of GOP Rep.-elect Santos' resume says there's more to explore 06:35 - Source: CNN\n\nCastro called for Santos to be investigated by authorities and argued if the New York Republican is allowed to serve in Congress after lying about his resume, “There will be more who seek office up and down the ballot who will believe that they can completely fabricate credentials, personal features and accomplishments to win office.”\n\nDemocratic Rep.-elect Dan Goldman of New York, a former federal prosecutor, called Santos a “total fraud.” He criticized House Republicans, saying, “Congress also has an obligation to hold George Santos accountable, but it is sadly clear that we cannot trust House Republicans to initiate an investigation in the House Ethics Committee.”\n\nAt least one incoming member of the GOP conference called for Santos to face scrutiny from the House Ethics Committee – an investigative panel that is evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats but has limited options for doling out repercussions.\n\n“As a Navy man who campaigned on restoring accountability and integrity to our government, I believe a full investigation by the House Ethics Committee and, if necessary, law enforcement, is required,” GOP Rep.-elect Nick LaLota said in a statement that marks the sharpest rebuke yet from a Republican coming to Congress or currently serving.\n\nHe lost to Santos. Hear him weigh in on his opponent's lies 02:46 - Source: CNN\n\n“New Yorkers deserve the truth and House Republicans deserve an opportunity to govern without this distraction,” LaLota added.\n\nAnother incoming GOP lawmaker from New York, Rep.-elect Anthony D’Esposito, condemned Santos’ false statements and called on him to “pursue a path of honesty,” although he stopped short of calling for an investigation.\n\n“Neighbors across Long Island are deeply hurt and rightly offended by the lies and misstatements made by Congressman-Elect George Santos,” he said in a statement. “While Santos has taken a required first step by ‘coming clean’ with respect to his education, work experience and other issues, he must continue to pursue a path of honesty.”\n\nIt is unlikely House Republican leadership will refuse to seat Santos, who is scheduled to be sworn in with the rest of the new members of Congress next Tuesday. The House has the power under the Constitution to expel any member with a two-thirds vote, but doing so is extremely rare and only five lawmakers have been expelled in US history.\n\nBesides making a referral to the House Ethics Committee, other potential options for dealing with Santos include not giving him any committee assignments, which would be up to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nAnalysis: Why a decades-old federal law could be Santos' undoing 01:40 - Source: CNN\n\nIn the past, the California Republican has shown little appetite for punishing his own members for bad behavior – particularly when it comes to actions from before they were a member of Congress. McCarthy has also declined to weigh in when members are under investigation, arguing he will let the probes play out before determining how to proceed.\n\n“This will not deter me from being an effective member of the United States Congress in the 118th session,” Santos told City & State in an interview posted Monday night.\n\nMcCarthy’s office and the National Republican Congressional Committee did not respond to CNN’s request for comment Monday evening.\n\nRepublican condemnation has, however, come from outside Congress.\n\nNassau County Republican Committee Chairman Joseph G. Cairo, Jr., said Tuesday that Santos “has broken the public trust” and “has a lot of work to do to regain the trust of voters.”\n\n“I am deeply disappointed in Mr. Santos, and I expected more than just a blanket apology,” Cairo said in a statement. “The damage that his lies have caused to many people, especially those who have been impacted by the Holocaust, are profound.”\n\nRecords contradict Santos' claim grandparents fled Holocaust 04:02 - Source: CNN\n\nCNN’s KFile reported that claims by Santos that his grandparents “survived the Holocaust” as Ukrainian Jewish refugees from Belgium who changed their surname are contradicted by sources including family trees compiled by genealogy websites, records on Jewish refugees and interviews with multiple genealogists.\n\n“I never claimed to be Jewish,” Santos told the New York Post on Monday. “I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background I said I was ‘Jew-ish.’”\n\nBut Santos described himself as a “proud American Jew” in a document shared with Jewish groups during the campaign, which was first reported by the Forward and confirmed by CNN.\n\nWhen asked about that statement on Tuesday night by former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who was guest hosting Fox’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” Santos said, “My heritage is Jewish. I’ve always identified as Jewish. I was raised a practicing Catholic.”\n\nThe Republican Jewish Coalition on Tuesday said the incoming congressman had “misrepresented his heritage” and “will not be welcome at any future RJC event.”\n\n“We are very disappointed in Congressman-elect Santos,” RJC CEO Matt Brooks said in a statement. “He deceived us and misrepresented his heritage. In public comments and to us personally he previously claimed to be Jewish. He has begun his tenure in Congress on a very wrong note.”\n\nSantos admitted Monday he didn’t graduate from any college or university, despite previously claiming he had degrees from Baruch College and New York University.\n\nHe also admitted that he never worked directly for the financial firms Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, as he has previously suggested, but claimed that he did do work for them through his company, telling the New York Post it was a “poor choice of words” to say he worked for them.\n\nThe New York Times first revealed last week that Santos’ biography appeared to be partly fictional. CNN confirmed details of that reporting, including about his college education and employment history.", "authors": ["Kate Sullivan Melanie Zanona", "Kate Sullivan", "Melanie Zanona"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/05/10/santos-faces-charges-carlson-announces-new-show-5-things-podcast/70202361007/", "title": "Santos faces charges, Carlson announces new show: 5 Things ...", "text": "On today's episode of the 5 Things podcast: Jury finds Trump liable in civil sex abuse case\n\nA federal jury has found former President Donald Trump liable in the civil sex abuse case of E.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and this is 5 Things you need to know Wednesday, the 10th of May 2023. Today, a jury finds former President Donald Trump liable in the civil sex abuse case of E. Jean Carroll. Plus, charges have been filed against Congressman George Santos, and Tucker Carlson announces a new home.\n\n♦\n\nA federal jury found former President Donald Trump liable in a civil case for sexual abuse of writer E. Jean Carroll in 1996, and the defamation of her in recent years. I spoke with USA TODAY National Political Correspondent David Jackson in the wake of the verdict. David, welcome back to 5 Things.\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nHey, thanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo we have a verdict in E. Jean Carroll's defamation lawsuit against former President Donald Trump. What did the jury decide here?\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nBasically, now it didn't convict him because this wasn't a criminal trial, it was a civil trial. So what they did was they found him liable for sexual abuse that injured E. Jean Carroll during an incident back in 1996. One thing to note is that the jury was also asked whether they thought Trump raped E. Jean Carroll, but they said no. They went with the sexual abuse allegation instead.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd did they go on further on what the distinction between those two things is?\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nIn the jury, the formal jury charge, they did, but that hasn't been publicized yet, but it's a very legalistic definitions as to what constitutes rape and what constitutes sexual abuse. As for why they went that direction, I don't think anyone really knows because we don't even know what the jurors' names are, much less interviewed them about what their decision making process.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDavid, were you surprised by the speed of the verdict?\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nVery much so, yes. It took less than three hours. And in these civil cases, what happens is that jurors are asked as a questionnaire. Do you think that he raped E. Jean Carroll? Do you think he sexually abused E. Jean Carroll? And within those questions, if you agree that he did, how much in damages should he pay Ms. Carroll? So then there were basically four different categories of various allegations. So it was a fairly long questionnaire, so I was a little bit surprised that it took them only three hours to come to a verdict, especially what looks like a compromised verdict because as I say, they didn't find Trump liable for rape, they went for basically a lesser charge.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd do we expect Trump's lawyers to appeal here?\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nOh, yes. Yes, Trump has already gone on with Fox Internet and his lawyers made clear that they will appeal the verdict, and part of the reason is they feel like it's a contradictory verdict that they found Trump innocent, if you will, of rape, but convicted him of sexual abuse and they're not sure they see the difference. So that's one of the issues that they'll be bringing up on appeal.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd this is just the latest legal problem for the former President, as you've outlined many times here on the show for us, David. How much time needs to pass before we can have a reasonable understanding of how this case impacts Trump's 2024 political aspirations?\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nIt'll be an unknown topic until people actually start to vote, which will probably happen in January or February of next year. Right up until the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, we'll be really wondering whether or not this will affect Trump because on the polls as we have them now, he's actually benefiting. More Republican primary voters are coming his way because they feel like he's getting messed over and that it's a plot to try to hurt his reputation. But many pollsters that I deal with suspect that there are a lot of Republicans who, yeah, they say they'll vote for Trump, but when it comes right down to it, they're tired of the drama and they'll go with someone else. So we won't know how many of those people might be in that category until there's actually a balloting.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, David Jackson, I'm sure we'll have you back soon. Thanks so much.\n\nDavid Jackson:\n\nThank you, sir. Bye.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nFederal prosecutors have filed charges against Congressman George Santos. The Republican lawmaker's fabrications about his personal and professional life have raised his national profile and attracted legal scrutiny. It's still not clear exactly what charges the freshman lawmaker faces, but FBI and Justice Department prosecutors have been investigating allegedly false claims in his campaign finance filings, among other things. Santos could appear in federal court as soon as today, according to CNN and NBC. The House Ethics Committee previously voted to establish a subcommittee to look into whether Santos engaged in unlawful activity during his 2022 campaign, and to investigate a sexual misconduct allegation involving a staffer. Santos has admitted to lying about having Jewish ancestry, a Wall Street background, college degrees, and history as a star volleyball player.\n\n♦\n\nPresident Joe Biden met with top congressional leaders yesterday, but they failed to reach a deal on an increasingly stubborn standoff over the debt ceiling. USA TODAY White House Correspondent Joey Garrison has the latest. Welcome back to the show, Joey.\n\nJoey Garrison:\n\nHey, thanks so much for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nPresident Joe Biden met with lawmakers at the Oval Office for this much anticipated meeting about the debt ceiling. Joey, who did he meet with and where do we stand after this meeting?\n\nJoey Garrison:\n\nWell, President Biden met with the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy and the three other congressional leaders representing both parties. So they did so yesterday in a push to get something done to raise the debt ceiling to avert a potential default that is forecast by the end of the month on June 1st. And they went into this meeting, I don't think, from Speaker McCarthy's point of view, with a lot of optimism. He was pretty clear about that. And leaving the meeting, he said he didn't see any \"new movement.\" And so I think after the meeting yesterday, we still see an impasse with a resolution that is still undefined.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd who has more leverage at this point?\n\nJoey Garrison:\n\nRepublicans believe they do, and that's as a result of the Republican-controlled House approving, albeit narrowly, a debt ceiling bill last month that would include $4.5 trillion in cuts. Many of those cuts are still unspecified. The White House, I think, went into this several months ago thinking that once Republicans outlined the sorts of cuts they're looking at, that it would prove so unpopular that maybe they could get five house Republicans in swing districts to say, yeah, I'm not going to go for that, I want to help the President just raise the debt ceiling like we have many times before without conditions. But here we are in a spot where Republicans have stayed united and I think that's put pressure on the President to pull back and ease up on his commitment not to negotiate over the debt ceiling. For now though, he continues to dig in just as McCarthy and Republicans do.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd are there any similar meetings planned on these talks in the coming days?\n\nJoey Garrison:\n\nYeah, that's one thing that did come out of this meeting. They all, the four and the President, planned to meet again on Friday. Their staffs are going to continue to communicate. But again, we did not see any real movement for the sake of their reach of the deal, there really needs to start seeing something sooner than later. Interestingly, the President held an address following the meeting yesterday in The Roosevelt Room, and he described a \"productive meeting about the path forward.\" He seemed to try to put an optimistic, upbeat spin on the events, but he left a lot of reporters there asking what he saw to give him that indication. And really, I don't know if he had a great answer.\n\nAnd the one thing that Biden said is he made clear in our meeting that default is not an option. Biden did say afterward in that same address that he's \"prepared to begin a separate discussion about his budget,\" but not part of the debt ceiling negotiations. And so that's a distinction the White House is trying to make, but it's not really one that Republicans are on board with yet.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBy some counts there are only five days remaining in session for Congress this month when both houses and Biden are in DC. Is it becoming more and more likely that we won't be able to figure something out before June, Joey?\n\nJoey Garrison:\n\nWell, I wouldn't want to ballpark it like I'm looking at a baseball game or something. It's just a little too hard to say, but I mean, the clock is certainly ticking. And we're talking June 1st, we're not talking about even getting into June, in which we could have a government default. That would mean the US has effectively run out of money, that the US can't meet its existing spending obligations from things already approved. For example, payments to Social Security recipients would be in jeopardy. So those are serious repercussions of a default. I think it is starting to set in here.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Joey Garrison, thanks as always.\n\nJoey Garrison:\n\nAll right, thanks for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIt's been just a couple of weeks since Tucker Carlson was fired from Fox News and he's now starting a new show. He announced yesterday that his new program will be similar to his Fox show, but will stream on Twitter. In a video, Carlson said the platform is one of the few remaining that allow free speech. Twitter CEO Elon Musk said the company had not signed a deal with Carlson, but promised future revenue sharing opportunities that would allow him to monetize his appearances. Meanwhile, Fox News has been moving through different hosts as they work to find Carlson's replacement. Next week, Kayleigh McEnany, former press secretary under then President Donald Trump, will get a tryout, according to the Los Angeles Times. Her appearance has come despite a racially offensive crack she made last week on the channel. According to Newsweek and posts across social media, many of Carlson's supporters have called for a boycott of Fox News after his firing, something they appear to be doubling down on ahead of McEnany's week of hosting.\n\n♦\n\nWomen should be screened for breast cancer every other year, beginning at age 40 instead of age 50. That's according to draft headlines released yesterday by the US Preventive Services Task Force, the independent national body of experts that sets standards for tests and screenings. Previous recommendations updated in 2016 said women younger than 50 who are concerned could discuss screening with their doctors. Now, the Task Force says screening at 40 could save 19% more lives.

Kalimuendo was under contract with PSG until 2024 but spent the last two seasons on loan at Lens.\n\nRennes, which had already prevailed in the corresponding fixture in Brittany two months ago, made the most of PSG's passivity and relied on goalkeeper Steve Mandanda's decisive saves to produce a clean sheet. Karl Toko Ekambi scored Rennes' first goal.\n\nPSG looked slow and lethargic, relying in vain on the skills of Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi.\n\nMbappe had two good chances to break the deadlock in the first half but the France star was denied twice.\n\nMandanda stopped Mbappe's chipped effort in the 26th minute. The former France 'keeper then blocked Mbappe's shot from Messi's deep pass with a superb reflex save in the 40th.\n\nRennes waited patiently and took its chance at the stroke of halftime when Benjamin Bourigeaud picked out Toko Ekambi behind the defense. The Cameroon forward controlled the ball with a delicate touch and beat Gianluigi Donnarumma with an angled shot.\n\nPSG players were whistled off the field by some fans, and things got worse when they returned from the locker room.\n\nKalimuendo made it 2-0 in the 48th after PSG clumsily gave the ball away in midfield. He did not celebrate his goal.\n\nPSG pressed harder as it tried to pull one back but made too many technical mistakes and was vulnerable to counterattacks, with Rennes having the best chances after the interval.\n\nMandanda was decisive again 10 minutes from time to firmly parry away Marco Verratti's shot that looked bound for the goal.\n\nPSG is out of the Champions League and the French Cup, meaning it has just the league title left to focus on. Chasing a European spot, Rennes moved up to fifth place in the standings.\n\nMARSEILLE IN THE HUNT\n\nSecond-place Marseille's hard-fought victory in the Champagne town marked its eighth straight away win.\n\nMarseille forward Alexis Sanchez scored twice against Reims, including a superb curled free kick, after Folarin Balogun put the hosts in the driving seat.\n\nReims pushed hard for an equalizer in the second half and Marseille goalkeeper Pau Lopez made several decisive saves to keep his team ahead. Marseille was lucky not to concede again as the hosts hit the woodwork twice.\n\nBEN YEDDER HITS 80 MARK\n\nWissam Ben Yedder scored his 80th career league goal for Monaco in a 2-0 win at 10-man Ajaccio as the Principality side got back to winning ways in the top flight.\n\nIt was Ben Yedder's 17th league goal this season. The France striker put the hosts ahead in the 26th minute before Krepin Diatta sealed Monaco's win with seven minutes left.\n\nAjaccio was forced to play with 10 players for most of the second half after Cyrille Bayala was sent off for a reckless tackle on Caio Henrique in the 51st minute.\n\nFourth-place Monaco had picked up only one point from its previous three matches.\n\nBen Yedder became the third player in Monaco's history to score 80 league goals for the club after Delio Onnis (157) and Lucien Cossou (97).\n\nHe scored from a rebound from close range following a free kick from Henrique. Monaco was then in control against a poor Ajaccio side that was punished by Diatta on the counter and remained in the relegation zone.\n\nWAHI'S DOUBLE\n\nMontpellier's revival under coach Michel Der Zakarian continued as the Mediterranean club came from behind to beat Clermont 2-1 and moved to 11th place.\n\nMontpellier is now unbeaten in six matches, including five wins, since Der Zakarian returned in February.\n\nMontpellier had a chance to take the lead in the 13th minute but Stephy Mavididi hit the post. Saïf-Eddine Khaoui then gave Clermont the lead before the up-and-coming Wahi turned things round, first with a header then a precise shot. Wahi has 12 league goals, his best tally over a single season.\n\nNICE STAYS UNBEATEN\n\nSeventh-place Nice extended its 11-game unbeaten run but was held to a 1-1 draw by Lorient.\n\nBamo Meite scored the first goal of his professional career to give the visitors the lead before Gaetan Laborde put the teams level.\n\nOTHER RESULTS\n\nStrasbourg beat Auxerre 2-0 to end a three-game winless run and Brest drew 2-2 at Troyes.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2014/12/31/best-comic-books-of-2014/21093903/", "title": "2014 in comic books: Snyder, 'Saga' continue greatness", "text": "Brian Truitt\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe year was full of noteworthy comic books, but what 2014 did best was show how the medium is rife with stuff for everybody — not just dudes who dig superheroes.\n\nThere are more comics than ever for new readers, and quality ones, too.

It was a year where Archie died a hero (but still lives on) and Peter Parker came back to web-swing once again.\n\nComics also invaded every part of pop culture — you can't escape nightly prime-time TV without running into the likes of the huge hit The Walking Dead or new shows such as Constantine. (The new year brings even more with the premieres of Agent Carter and iZombie.) Then there's the cinema, pretty much ruled by Marvel. It's a good year when Star-Lord, Rocket Raccoon, Groot and the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy can find themselves at the top of the year-end box office.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, though, the genre is still all about the writers, artists, editors and companies who seemingly create better comics every year. Here, 2014's best of the best:\n\nBest writer: Scott Snyder. Gotham City's main man again impressed with his tales of the Dark Knight, launching the weekly Batman Eternal — one of DC Comics' top titles — while also shocking everybody with the return of the Joker in Batman. That's not all, though: He also brought back the fangtastic American Vampire, finished up the epic miniseries The Wake with Sean Gordon Murphy and Superman Unchained with Jim Lee, and premiered Wytches, one of the scariest books on shelves right now. Snyder may create nightmares, but you can expect a dream book every time his name's on the cover. Honorable mention: Jason Aaron. Next year, he's going to hit a whole new level of mainstream heading up Marvel's new flagship Star Wars series. But Aaron also had an excellent 2014 with the massive murder mystery Original Sin, his family crime drama Men of Wrath, a relaunched Thor with a female Goddess of Thor and, best of all, the debut of the violent masterpiece Southern Bastards with Jason Latour. Pass the sweet tea because that's a whole feast of awesome.\n\nBest cover artist: Francesco Francavilla. He's one of the top talents in all of comics, evident from both the illustrations on his Twitter feed and the work he does as series artist of Afterlife with Archie. He's one guy whose variant covers are always worth checking out and his signature style is second to none. Honorable mention: Jenny Frison. Her covers for the horror comic Revival continue to be things of beauty, and she also brought greatness to titles such as Loki: Agent of Asgard, Vampirella and Harbinger.\n\nBest artist: Fiona Staples. She brings Saga's wondrous sci-fi world of alien races and characters — and Lying Cat, of course — to life, but even better she can make you laugh and break your heart within a matter of a few panels. Honorable mention: Declan Shalvey. With all due respect to Bill Sienkiewicz, Don Perlin and David Finch, no one has ever drawn Moon Knight like Shalvey in his and Warren Ellis' relaunch of the longtime Marvel hero. The vigilante looked like the epitome of cool in their run, as did everything around him — even a mushroom death god.\n\nBest ongoing series:Saga. It's just getting unfair at this point. Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staples have crafted an intergalactic tapestry of bounty hunters, oddball writers and journalists, old loves, new enemies and an adoring mom, dad and kid where pretty much anyone can find at least one connection. It's simply one of the greatest stories you'll find in any genre of entertainment right now. Honorable mention:Deadly Class. Rick Remender's body of work is awe-inspiring in its variety, from Captain America to Low to Black Science, yet it's his 1980s-set action-packed tome with artist Wes Craig, centered on a 1980s kid who finds himself involved in a school for assassins, that stands out and is for anyone who's ever felt like a loner.\n\nBest new series:The Wicked + the Divine. There's electricity involved whenever Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie team on a project (see: Phonogram, Young Avengers) and this pairing deals beautifully with musically influenced gods and adoring humans as well as themes of life and death. Honorable mention:The United States of Murder Inc. Another of comics' most potent duos, Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Avon Oeming, bring the winning chemistry they have with Powers to an America that's run by the Mob and focuses on a young made man and a hitwoman who begin to learn the secrets of their crime-ruled culture.\n\nBest single issue:The Multiversity: Pax Americana. Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely do their own meta-superhero, post-9/11 take on Watchmen with old Charlton Comics characters such as Captain Atom, Blue Beetle and The Question. They end up creating a phenomenal read with a gut punch of an ending.\n\nBest miniseries:Thomas Alsop. Ambitious in scope as well as storytelling, Chris Miskiewicz and Palle Schmidt's book balances the satirical and supernatural while centering on different eras in the history of New York's magical caretakers.\n\nBest digital series:Sensation Comics. DC's digital-first titles are all pretty top notch, but the cream of the crop is the one that features Wonder Woman and an all-star array of talent such as Gail Simone, Cat Staggs, Dean Haspiel and Rob Williams taking their turns with the A-list Amazon princess.\n\nRookie of the year (artist): Tula Lotay. Warren Ellis is one of comics' greatest icons, yet even his writing on Supreme: Blue Rose — a new take on 1990s Image Comics characters — is taken to the next level thanks to Lotay, a British artist who brings cinematic influences from David Lynch to Stanley Kubrick in the visionary sci-fi comic.\n\nRookie of the year (writer): Ollie Masters. The newcomer from Brighton, England, and scribe of The Kitchen made an auspicious debut with three Mob wives who decide to make their own mark in 1970s Hell's Kitchen.\n\nRookie of the year (character): Kamala Khan. The teenage Muslim main character of G. Willow Wilson and Adrian Alphona's Ms. Marvel added diversity to the Marvel Universe but also brought in a hero for everyone to root for, not just young girls.\n\nMost insane read:Transformers vs. G.I. Joe. On the surface, it makes some sense taking two 1980s comic/cartoon/toy franchises and tossing them together for nostalgia's sake. But that's where it gets weird, with tons of colorful kitsch, camp and odd pairings of classic characters visualized by artist Tom Scioli like a kid hopped up on sugary breakfast cereal.\n\nBest horror comic:Nailbiter. While Josh Williamson is a proven scare-meister with Ghosted under his belt, he upped his creepy quotient with a shockingly good thriller that takes a military intelligence officer to a small Oregon town that's spawned the worst serial killers in history, including a murderous new ally.\n\nBest comeback: Jack Burton. The goofy mulleted hero from the '80s cult movie Big Trouble in Little China returned after nearly 30 years as Eric Powell and Brian Churilla picked up where John Carpenter left him off: in the driver's seat of the Pork Chop Express, waiting to get into even bigger trouble.\n\nBest villain: Tony Stark. What's that, Iron Man as a baddie? Yep, Marvel's resident billionaire playboy genius inventor had his personality inverted in Axis, and it looks like his overly self-centered personality — which has always kinda been there — is sticking around and Tom Taylor is making the best of it in the pages of Superior Iron Man.\n\nBest indie book you should be reading:The Life After and The Bunker (tie). If you're not digging into all things Joshua Hale Fialkov, make it a new year's resolution to fix that, stat. Life After is an incredible and emotional journey into the afterlife — with Ernest Hemingway! — while time-travel thriller The Bunker is Lost-level mind-blowing.\n\nBest locale: Gotham City. DC's Batman group editor Mark Doyle heads up the current effort that's made the Dark Knight's hometown the greatest place in comics. Batman Eternal is the best weekly DC series in recent memory, Batman is as fine as ever, a relaunched Batgirl has given the character a new costume and resurgence, and Gotham Academy, Arkham Manor and Gotham by Midnight are some of the company's best debuts of 2014.\n\nMVP: Warren Simons. Creating a universe of superheroes to share comic-shop space with Marvel and DC is tantamount to a new cola company jumping into the fray with Pepsi and Coke. But Valiant Entertainment's editor in chief is the architect of a satisfying array of consistently good titles including Archer & Armstrong and X-O Manowar, plus the crossover events Armor Hunters and The Valiant.\n\nBest comic-book movie:Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The nerdy crowd was wowed by the Hydra reveal in the superhero sequel while mainstream audiences could enjoy its 1970s political-thriller influences. What really sets it apart, though, is Chris Evans, who embodies his square-jawed patriotic hero arguably better than Robert Downey Jr., does with his cinematic Tony Stark.\n\nBest comic-book TV show:Arrow. Stephen Amell's Oliver Queen is one of TV's most engaging main characters, shirtless or otherwise, and the CW show is a template for how a superhero TV show should be done.\n\nBest event:Original Sin. Marvel had two big to-dos in 2014 but this was the highlight. Jason Aaron and Mike Deodato not only created a sense of paranoia among heroes in the aftermath of the Watcher's murder, but presented a landscape where they had to deal with their pasts, as well.\n\nBest comic to save for my daughter:ODY-C. Sure, my 2 year old will read Homer's The Odyssey at some point down the line, but she might dig Matt Fraction and Christian Ward's wildly tweaked, futuristic, female-centric journey more. (I sure do.)\n\nBest comic to look forward to in 2015:Darth Vader. Marvel is throwing as much Star Wars at folks as it can before the new movie hits next December. The gem among them is the Kieron Gillen-written series starring everybody's favorite Sith lord and getting a hold of the Empire in the time between Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back.

Buffalo sits last in the overall NHL standings and is all but mathematically certain to extend its playoff drought to an NHL record-matching 10th consecutive season.\n\nHall signed a one-year, $8 million contract with Buffalo in October and is eligible to become an unrestricted free agent this summer. With most teams tight against the league’s $81.5 million salary cap, which remained flat this season, the Sabres are expected to retain a portion of Hall’s pay to make it easier to trade him.\n\nRather than spurring a Sabres turnaround, Hall’s addition has hardly made a dent in the team’s decade-long woes. The six-time 20-goal-scorer has just two goals with 17 assists in 37 games this season and hasn’t scored in 16 consecutive outings.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NHL Scores and Schedules\n\nGeneral manager Kevyn Adams didn’t rule out trading Hall last month, while the player has publicly stated he’s willing to listen to offers in the event he has to waive the no-trade clause in his contract.\n\nThe Sabres have already been active on the trade front after dealing veteran center Eric Staal to Montreal and third-string goalie Jonas Johansson to Colorado last month.\n\nHall’s drop in production has coincided with the absence of captain and top-line center Jack Eichel, who has been dealing with a series of injuries since the start of the season. Eichel remains out indefinitely and has not played since sustaining an upper-body injury on March 9.\n\nHall, 29, is on his third team in two years. The Devils traded him to the Arizona Coyotes last season.\n\nHall was lured to Buffalo in part because of the presence of Ralph Krueger, who previously coached the player during Hall’s first three NHL seasons with the Edmonton Oilers. Krueger was fired on March 17.\n\nThe Sabres, meanwhile, signed prospect forward Linus Weissbach to a two-year, entry-level contract. Weissbach was selected by Buffalo in the seventh round of the 2017 draft and just completed his four-year college career at Wisconsin.\n\nThe 22-year-old native of Sweden earned second-team Big Ten honors after finishing third in the nation with 41 points (12 goals, 31 assists) in 31 games last season.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/08/20/dax-shepard-needs-surgery-motorcycle-accident/5614242002/", "title": "Dax Shepard needs surgery after breaking bones in motorcycle ...", "text": "Dax Shepard had a rough ride during a recent outing at a California racetrack.\n\nDuring Monday's episode of his \"Armchair Expert\" podcast, Shepard revealed that he broke multiple bones after a motorcycle accident over the weekend.\n\n\"I was passing six guys on Sonoma Raceway on a motorcycle and I was braking very, very hard – hard enough that the back wheel was off the ground for a good 100 yards,\" Shepard, 45, said. \"I was totally at blame, I thought I would be able to slide in between, but someone turned in and I was already under full braking and I couldn't go anywhere.\"\n\nShepard explained that he \"landed pretty hard\" after he \"clipped their bumper\" and \"went over the handlebars,\" an incident he described as a \"little demoralizing.\"\n\n\"First time I've ever been down on the track,\" he said. \"It was a bummer.\"\n\nKristen Bell and Dax Shepard have been 'on each other's last nerve' in quarantine\n\nThe \"Parenthood\" actor said he went to the emergency room the next day with excruciating pain.\n\n\"I've been at the hospital for seven hours today,\" he shared Monday. \"The final tally was four broken ribs, the clavicle's broken in three places, and I need surgery.\"\n\nHe also injured his left hand, which he shattered in an off-road accident earlier this year: \"I broke my hand that I'd broke a couple months ago.

That's the only chance of injury.\"\n\nBell described how Shepard put up his left hand \"just to look out\" from over the cliff, when the shift in weight tipped over his Polaris RZR, a vehicle used for off-roading.\n\nShepard had to wear a cast and get seven pins in his hand due to the injury.

The shipments included in-kind products from Team USA sponsors such as Coca-Cola and Smucker's.\n\nKnutson's team also has enlisted the help of a local chef, Michiko Nakamura, and coordinated with seven vendors in Japan to supply some of the key ingredients for dishes.\n\nKnutson wrote in the email that he already has ordered 2,000 pounds of various proteins from an American-owned company in Japan, and more than 350 pounds of salmon from a local fish vendor. \"And we have only just started ordering,\" he added.\n\nKnutson said his staff will primarily feed athletes from 11 teams at the Setagaya City hub — the only one of its kind for U.S. athletes at the Games — including those from swimming and track and field.

The panel's leading Democrat then vowed to work with leadership to advance her nomination, but it did not move forward.\n\nNow, five months later, as the classified documents controversy widens, the agency that maintains the nation's most sensitive and cherished documents lacks permanent leadership. That's left it running in maintenance mode under an acting leader who won’t be in the position long enough to fix long-term challenges, according to several archivists, historians, and government operations experts who spoke with USA TODAY.\n\nExperts told USA TODAY the lack of a permanent director isn't just hurting the agency's ability to manage the presidential records fiasco but also its authority to clear a backlog of documents that need to go through a declassification process and lengthy waiting periods for veterans to get copies of documents proving their service.\n\nAlthough Biden in January re-nominated Shogan, 47, to the post, senators tasked with confirming her expressed little urgency – and some struggled to remember her nomination at all.\n\n“Not familiar with that nomination, sorry,\" said Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who voted against Shogan in September as a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which must first approve Shogan before she goes to a full Senate vote.\n\n\"I don't have anything for you,\" fellow GOP committee member Rand Paul, R-Ky., told a USA TODAY reporter when asked about Shogan.\n\n“I don’t know anything about her,” said the Senate's second-ranked Democrat, Illinois' Dick Durbin, when asked if he would vote to confirm Shogan in the full Senate.\n\n“We’re going to assess what the next steps are for her,” committee chair Gary Peters, D-Mich., told USA TODAY. “We’re in the process right now of looking at nominations and figuring out how we move forward with nominations – there are a number of pending ones.”\n\nPeters has not yet scheduled a hearing on her nomination.\n\nClassified documents everywhere:Whose home had the most — Pence, Biden or Trump's?\n\nBiden records:Questions about Joe Biden documents escalate as second batch of records is found\n\nMar-a-Lago search:Trump home in Florida searched by FBI in probe into handling of classified documents\n\nClassified document troubles overshadowed Shogan's nomination from the outset\n\nShogan's nomination hit snags early even though she had the advantage of a Democrat-majority Senate, and professional experience steeped in U.S. history and policy.\n\nShe's currently a manager for the White House Historical Association, a private nonprofit organization that works with White House staff on historical preservation. She started the job while Trump was president and worked with then-first lady Melania Trump.\n\nA political science Ph.D, she’s held leadership roles at the Library of Congress and its nonpartisan research arm, led various government historical commissions and taught at Georgetown University and the University of Pennsylvania. She declined to comment for this story.\n\nShogan’s Aug. 3 nomination came just five days before the Mar-a-Lago search, which fueled a tense September confirmation hearing that ended with all seven Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee voting against confirming her. The vote prevented her from advancing to the full Senate with a committee recommendation. Most of their criticism centered on a 2007 academic article she authored on \"anti-intellectualism\" among Republican presidents.\n\n“Is the point that Republicans are stupid and Democrats are intellectual?” asked Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo.\n\nShogan said anti-intellectualism is “the ability to speak in very plain, common-sense terms to Americans.” She defended the article as scholarly, and pointed to her employment record in nonpartisan government agencies.\n\nShogan repeatedly thanked Hawley for his questions and defended her work experience, inviting \"anybody to talk to the people I have worked with for years in my nonpartisan government service.\"\n\n“You’re an extreme partisan, and your record shows that,” Hawley told her. He said Americans have seen the consequences of partisans serving as top archivists because they are “living through the political weaponization of the National Archives.”\n\nThen-Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, the committee's top Republican at the time, also pressed her on tweets about Trump, including one in 2020 asking: “Isn’t the next move a self-pardon?”\n\n“Self-pardon would imply criminality,” he said. “If confirmed you would have to work with the president’s staff, and how can you be confident that you’d be able to work effectively with President Trump’s staff?”\n\nShogan pointed to her work with Trump and his staff on the centennial celebration of women’s suffrage in 2020. Archived tweets show her with a crowd in the White House thanking Trump for his work on the event.\n\nA week later during the confirmation vote, Portman said Shogan’s writings “go beyond mere partisanship” and criticized her for refusing to provide her previous tweets to the committee.\n\nDemocrats held only 50 seats in the Senate in September (with Vice President Kamala Harris able to break ties in her dual role as Senate president). That meant committees like Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs were evenly split, giving Republicans leverage to sink her nomination.\n\nBecause of November’s election results, the Democratic Caucus now has a 51-seat majority in the Senate, including a majority on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\nA party-line vote now would get Shogan’s nomination to the full Senate, where she also has the support of West Virginia Republican Sen.

The FBI later found documents at Biden’s and Pence’s homes.\n\nPeters, who said he will vote for Shogan’s confirmation, said he does not think the discovery of Biden’s classified documents will complicate the nomination process.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Emilie Simons pointed to Biden’s nomination of Shogan when asked whether her confirmation as National Archives head is a priority. “We urge swift confirmation of all our nominees,” she said.\n\nThough it's common for members of a rival party to oppose presidential nominations, David S. Ferriero, the Archivist who retired in April, sailed through a full Senate vote roughly 100 days after being nominated by former President Barack Obama in 2009. Shogan has waited nearly twice that time. Her wait is also two months longer than the average 144 days for presidential appointees seeking confirmation, according to the Center for Presidential Transition.\n\nCapito said the discovery of Biden’s classified documents could lead to more questions for Shogan on accountability and transparency, but that she plans to vote for her. “I think she would be a good archivist,” she told USA TODAY.\n\nClare Lattanze, a spokesperson for Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., a member of the committee, said in a statement: \"If a permanent leader for NARA is a priority for Joe Biden, he should choose a new nominee.\"\n\nHawley had trouble remembering who Shogan was when asked last week but said he wouldn’t imagine he would change his vote in the second round. He said the discovery of classified documents at Biden’s office and homes “probably will” raise the stakes “because now we’ve got a very wide-ranging scandal.”\n\nLeaders of three groups that supported her nomination last year – the Society of American Archivists, the Council of State Archivists, and the American Historical Association – all spoke highly of Shogan’s qualifications and continue to support her confirmation.\n\n“She’s a problem solver,” said James Grossman, executive director of the American Historians Association. “If you look at that resume, what you’ll see are jobs which required someone to be able to look at a situation and say, ‘Here are the challenges, and here is how I’m going to figure out how to address them in collaboration with other people.’”\n\nLiz Hempowicz, vice president of policy and government affairs at the Project on Government Oversight, said the Senate in general does not move fast enough to confirm nominees. “It would be fine if they were taking a long time because they were doing careful consideration, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. It seems to be more an issue that this is not a priority.”\n\nCongressional committee in 2022:National Archives still not certain it has all Trump records\n\nScribbled notes, classified materials:Here's how the millions of White House documents and artifacts should be archived\n\nJanuary 2023 Poll::Americans equally concerned with Biden, Trump classified documents despite differences\n\nMeanwhile, problems at the National Archives persist\n\nThe most recent classified document revelations are an offshoot of a longstanding problem: Classified documents going missing is not uncommon – so much so that the National Archives developed a formal written process for retrieving them, USA TODAY reporting shows.\n\nPeters, the committee chairman, convened a hearing last March in which he acknowledged challenges facing the Archives.\n\n“Officials in previous administrations of both parties have failed to adhere to current federal record-keeping requirements, and in some cases, blatantly disregarded them,” Peters said, pointing to Trump.\n\nOther problems at the National Archives include a budget that has been stagnant for years while electronic records pile up, a backlog of documents that need to go through a declassification process, and lengthy waiting periods for veterans to get copies of documents proving their service, experts told USA TODAY.\n\n“There’s just lots of stuff that doesn’t need to be classified that should be accessible,” Grossman said. “Much of this comes down to the agency’s budget, and I can’t emphasize too much that this agency has been starved for resources.”\n\nIn the September hearing, Peters asked Shogan how she would improve the federal records preservation process, whether the National Archives has enough resources, and how she would improve the veterans records backlog.\n\n“These records are not just essential to keeping an accurate account of government activities or holding the executive branch accountable; they are critical to ensuring that our nation’s history is fully and accurately preserved for future generations,” he said in his opening statement.\n\nSen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., asked her to commit to solving the problem with veterans records, and to submit an assessment of the problem with her plan to fix the backlog. She agreed to both.\n\n“They need these records for their VA health care benefits,” Ossoff said. “They need these records for their employment and educational benefits.”\n\nFrom office to beach house:A timeline of the investigation into Joe Biden classified documents\n\nThe scandal widens:Classified documents found at former VP Mike Pence's Indiana home\n\nThe National Archives needs a permanent leader, experts agree\n\nThere is unanimous agreement among experts that the National Archives needs a permanent leader, from providing general management stability to solving longstanding problems unique to the agency.\n\nThe acting head is Debra Steidel Wall, a civil servant who took over when Ferriero retired. The National Archives said Wall was unavailable for an interview and declined to comment for this story.\n\n“NARA has really been in maintenance mode for the last year, managing the tasks at hand and fulfilling its core mandates,” said Joy Banks, the executive director of the Council of State Archivists. “While significant progress has been made to recover disrupted operations from pandemic-related closures, there's been little room for strategic action and implementation that could happen under permanent leadership.”\n\nHempowicz, from the Project on Government Oversight, said Wall is in an especially tough spot because of the classified documents controversies.\n\n“When it’s somebody in an acting role, and they’re now being asked to make very high-profile decisions that are politicized in a way that I think most people don’t expect to be politicized, it adds a whole new layer to the calculation that goes into every decision to exercise their authority or not,” Hempowicz said.\n\nGrossman,of the American Historical Association, said the solution to the classified documents is quite simple: strengthen the Presidential Records Act, which he said has “no teeth” and “no sanction” to enforce against anyone who challenges the National Archives’ authority to retrieve records.\n\n“A crisis comes when someone says, ‘No you can’t have them. I’m not going to give them to you. They belong to me,’” Grossman said. “That’s a crisis because that’s when you have a struggle over authority, and that’s true with any property.\"\n\nThe FBI used a warrant to search Mar-a-Lago and found classified and top-secret documents after the Department of Justice became concerned Trump’s lawyers had not turned over everything to the National Archives.\n\nPence and Biden both worked cooperatively with the National Archives and voluntarily submitted to FBI searches of their properties. The revelations prompted the Archives to send letters to other former presidents and vice presidents to look for any more sensitive documents.\n\n“Regardless of party affiliation, we can all agree that we need strong leadership at a time when national attention is focused on appropriate handling of records by outgoing officials,” said Valerie Smith Boyd, the director for the Center for Presidential Transition at the Partnership for Public Service.\n\nMike Pence:FBI search of Indiana home yields 1 more classified document\n\nBiden, Trump, Pence classified documents – dig deeper\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/28/republicans-archives-documents-nih-covid-senate/11365308002/", "title": "GOP frustration bubbles over on federal COVID pandemic documents", "text": "WASHINGTON — Republican lawmakers are demanding federal documents from government officials that could shed light on the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic that swept the globe in 2020 and killed millions.\n\nAt a hearing Tuesday, GOP senators aired their frustration that the National Institutes of Health has been slow to provide key documents related to the outbreak amid recent revelations that COVID-19 may have leaked from a lab.\n\nThe COVID origin concerns stem from reporting that the Department of Energy found there is \"low confidence\" to believe the virus was unintentionally leaked from a lab in China.

Experts on the panel said they were confident they could, and the benefits of making the pill more widely available far outweigh any risks.\n\nThe advisers' decision is not binding, but the 17-0 vote paves the way for the likely approval of the pill's over-the-counter availability. The FDA is expected to make a final decision this summer.\n\nIf the application is approved, Opill will be the first contraceptive pill to be sold over the counter in the United States. It would join emergency contraceptives like Plan B on pharmacy shelves.\n\nKathryn Curtis, a scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was part of the panel, said selling Opill over the counter has the \"potential to have a huge public health impact,\" adding that \"the large body of evidence on the safety and effectiveness is very reassuring.\"\n\n\"The evidence demonstrates that the benefits clearly exceed the risks,\" Curtis said. \"The benefits of moving Opill over the counter include increased access to contraception ... reduction in unintended pregnancy and associated risks, and improved reproductive autonomy and improved equitable access to contraception.\"\n\nFDA raised concerns in initial review\n\nThe decision comes after the FDA raised numerous concerns in an initial review over the drugmaker Perrigo's application to sell Opill over the counter.\n\nTheir main concerns included if people would be able to correctly follow the labeling directions, and if they may not realize when Opill isn't appropriate for them without counseling from a doctor.\n\nFor example, people with a history of breast cancer should not take the pill, and those with abnormal vaginal bleeding should talk to a doctor first. But some participants in these categories incorrectly said Opill would be appropriate for them in preliminary research.\n\nThe panel largely set aside initial concerns Wednesday when given the opportunity to ask questions about Perrigo's research.\n\n\"The history of women’s contraception is a struggle for women’s control over their reproduction, and we need to trust women,\" said Dr. Katalin Roth, a professor of medicine at George Washington University and a member of the advisory panel.\n\nMurray S. Kessler, CEO and president of Perrigo, said the vote is the start of a \"new, groundbreaking chapter in reproductive health.\"\n\nMedical organizations react to birth control pill vote\n\nFor years, medical organizations and advocates for increasing access to birth control have pushed to have over-the-counter birth control pills available in the United States.\n\nMedical organizations, including the American Medical Association, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support selling the birth control pill over the counter.\n\nFree the Pill and other advocacy groups that support improving access to contraceptives rallied outside the White House on Monday in support of making Opill available over the counter.\n\nVictoria Nichols, project director of Free the Pill, called the Wednesday vote \"a historic step forward for reproductive health.\"\n\n\"Decades of coalition-driven advocacy and research efforts that have centered the voices of those most impacted by barriers to contraception caused by systemic inequities have made this possible,\" Nichols said in a Wednesday statement. \"It is past time for an over-the-counter birth control pill, which has the potential to advance reproductive justice and expand health equity.\n\nA 2015 study in the Journal of Women's Health found that nearly one-third of adult women who have tried to get birth control pills have faced problems obtaining a prescription or refills. They faced challenges including scheduling an appointment in time, getting to a clinic, paying for pills or accessing insurance. Uninsured and Spanish-speaking women were more likely to report difficulties, according to the study.\n\n\"For too long, barriers to birth control, including the prescription requirement, have prevented people from getting the contraceptive care they need, with the barriers falling hardest on Black, Indigenous, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders, Latinx folks and other people of color,\" said Monica Simpson, executive director of the reproductive justice organization SisterSong.\n\nHow does birth control pill Opill work?\n\nOpill uses the synthetic hormone progestin to block sperm from the cervix, preventing pregnancy. Most other birth control pills use progestin and estrogen, and progestin-only pills like Opill are often recommended for people who can't take combination pills because of health reasons.\n\nHormone-based pills, like Opill, have long been among the most common forms of birth control nationwide and have been used by tens of millions of people since the 1960s.\n\nOpill was first approved in the U.S. in 1973. The pill is currently sold without a prescription in the United Kingdom. Other contraceptive pills are available without prescription across much of the globe, including in South America, Asia and Africa.\n\nDig deeper: Reproductive rights\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/10"}]}

The poll ended Monday morning with 57% of voters in favor of Musk handing off the top job.\n\nMusk has not commented on the results of the poll. In fact, Musk went an uncharacteristically long time on Monday without tweeting at all. But even if Musk doesn’t immediately honor his own poll, the Tesla CEO will likely only continue to face pressure from the carmaker’s investors to hand the reins to someone else sooner than later. Tesla stock is down 34% since his deal to buy Twitter closed and more than 63% since the start of this year, as investors worry about his many competing priorities. (Musk has also for years mused about finding a successor to run Tesla, with no obvious progress.)\n\nMusk, for his part, said in a tweet Sunday before the poll had closed: “No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.”\n\nIf Musk were to look for a new Twitter CEO, he’d likely have many willing takers. Already, the list of people who have offered to run the platform includes former T-Mobile CEO John Legere, MIT artificial intelligence researcher Lex Fridman and rapper Snoop Dogg (who could perhaps run Twitter with the help of his friend and entertainment personality Martha Stewart). Tom Anderson, a founder of MySpace, also commented on Musk’s poll about stepping down from CEO, saying, “depends on who you get to run it,” with a thinking-face emoji.\n\nThere are also some highly qualified candidates out there — such as former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and CTO Mike Schroepfer, who both left their roles at the social media giant earlier this year — although convincing them to take on the chaos machine that is Twitter could be difficult. Jack Dorsey, Twitter founder, CEO of Block and friend to Musk, has previously said he would not return to run the social network.\n\nThe most obvious potential candidates for a new Twitter CEO are the Musk lieutenants who have been helping to run the company since his takeover. The short list likely includes investor Jason Calacanis, Craft Ventures partner David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan, an Andreessen Horowitz general partner focused on crypto and Twitter’s former consumer teams lead.\n\nIf Musk does pick someone else, it might allow him to hand over some of the day-to-day responsibility, and accountability, of running Twitter. But one thing would almost certainly not change: Musk remains very much in charge. Musk pushed out the company’s former leadership and board of directors, and as the company’s owner and sole board director, he will ultimately have the power to hire and fire whoever he wants at the company’s helm.\n\nAmong the likely candidates if Elon Musk were to choose a new CEO are the members of his current Twitter leadership team, Sriram Krishnan, David Sacks and Jason Calacanis. Philip Pacheco/AFP/Noam Galai/Alex Flynn/Bloomberg/Getty Images/Frank May/DPA/ZumaPress\n\nJason Calacanis\n\nCalacanis, who emerged in the tech world as a reporter during the dot com boom, is an early-stage investor who has backed well-known companies such as Uber and Robinhood. He has also launched several media properties and hosts two podcasts (one in partnership with Sacks).\n\nCalacanis tweeted on Sunday night asking, “Who would like the most miserable job in tech AND media?! Who is insane enough to run twitter?!?!” Calacanis also ran his own Twitter poll asking followers whether he or Sacks should run the company, separately or together, or whether someone else should take over. The majority of respondents voted for “other.”\n\nIn April, shortly after Musk offered to buy Twitter, Calacanis told the billionaire in a text message that “Twitter CEO is my dream job.”\n\nDavid Sacks\n\nSacks, who along with Musk was among the original founding team at PayPal, has at least some experience managing a social network. He founded and ran enterprise communications platform Yammer, before selling it to Microsoft in 2012 for $1.2 billion.\n\nSacks has been particularly unflinching in echoing Musks’ talking points, whether it’s justifying a feud with Apple or attempting to stir up outrage about a Twitter account that posted publicly available information about the whereabouts of Musk’s private jet. A Twitter user asked Sacks last month what he and Musk disagree about, and Sacks responded with just one thing: “Chess.”\n\nSriram Krishnan\n\nOn paper, Krishnan may be the most obvious choice of the group. He has direct experience working on the Twitter product, having previously helped manage the teams responsible for features of the platform such as search and the home timeline. He also previously worked on mobile ad products for Snap and Facebook.\n\nMore recently, he has invested in crypto startups at Andreessen Horowitz, which could give him experience helpful to fulfill Musk’s goal of building payment capabilities for Twitter and making it more than just a social media app.\n\nKrishnan is arguably the least well-known — and therefore perhaps the least controversial — of Musk’s current Twitter leadership team, which could help deflect some of the recent negative attention the company has received.\n\nWild cards\n\nSome Twitter users have speculated about other possible leaders for the social media company, including Donald Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was spotted watching the World Cup with Musk over the weekend.\n\nKushner is friendly with the Saudi Royal Family, one of Twitter’s largest investors. Prior to working as an advisor in Trump’s White House, Kushner worked for his family’s real estate development company, and last year he said he would leave politics and start an investment firm.

A stunning $44 billion takeover offer with uncertain financing. And a surprise early morning tweet putting the deal on hold, temporarily.\n\nEven by the standards of Twitter, a company that has known plenty of chaos and dysfunction in its history, the weeks-long effort by billionaire Elon Musk to buy the company has proven to be uniquely tumultuous – and there’s no clear end in sight.\n\nShould the deal go through, it would place the world’s richest man in charge of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms. The acquisition has the potential to upend not just Twitter itself but politics, media and the tech industry. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has repeatedly stressed that his goal is to bolster what he calls “free speech” on the platform, by which he means all legal speech that complies with local laws in the markets where Twitter operates. He has also said he would reverse Twitter’s ban of former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut the attempt by Musk, a wildly successful entrepreneur with a history of erratic behavior, to buy Twitter has been viewed with some skepticism from the start. On the day he made his offer, Musk said: “I’m not sure I’ll actually be able to acquire it.” Some have questioned how he would finance the deal, especially as shares of Tesla (TSLA), which he’s partially using to back his financing of the Twitter deal, and the broader tech sector have declined in the weeks since.\n\nAfter Musk recently said he was temporarily pausing the deal so he could assess the amount of spam and fake accounts, it prompted speculation that the billionaire might be looking to renegotiate the deal – or back out of it entirely. His actions in the days that followed only reinforced that thinking.\n\nHere is a look back at the many twists and turns in one of the most high-profile tech deals in recent memory.\n\nJanuary 31: Musk begins building up his Twitter stake\n\nMusk starts quietly buying up Twitter shares, building his stake in the company. But it would be months before he disclosed this fact to the public.\n\nMarch 14: Musk’s Twitter stake tops 5%\n\nMusk’s stake in Twitter tops 5%, but that fact is not disclosed until the following month. Musk was obligated to disclose his stake within 10 days of crossing the 5% threshold, but waited 21 days to do so. During that time, he continued building up his stake.\n\nMarch 24: Asking whether Twitter should change\n\nThe billionaire begins to make pointed statements about the platform from his account. “Twitter algorithm should be open source,” he wrote, with a poll for users to vote “yes” or “no.”\n\nThe following day, Musk tweets out another poll to his followers: “Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?”\n\nA sign is posted on the exterior of Twitter headquarters on April 27, 2022 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nMarch 26: Musk reaches out to Jack Dorsey\n\nMusk reaches out to Twitter cofounder and former CEO Jack Dorsey to “discuss the future direction of social media,” according to a company filing later put out by the company. The two tech founders are known to have a bit of a billionaire bromance on and off Twitter.\n\nApril 3: Twitter leadership meets to discuss Musk\n\nTwitter’s board and some of its leadership team meet with representatives from Wilson Sonsini, a law firm, and J.P. Morgan to discuss the possibility of Musk joining the company’s board, according a later securities filing. Dorsey is said to have told the board that “he and Mr. Musk were friends,” according to the filing.\n\nIn the meeting, the Twitter board discussed wanting Musk to agree to “‘standstill’ provisions”,” according to the filing. This would effectively “limit his public statements regarding Twitter, including the making of unsolicited public proposals to acquire Twitter (but not private proposals) without the prior consent of the Twitter Board.”\n\nApril 4: Surprise! Musk becomes Twitter’s largest shareholder\n\nMusk is revealed to be Twitter’s largest individual shareholder, with a more than 9% stake in the company.\n\nNews of the purchase sends shares of the social media company soaring more than 20% in early trading and kicks off a wave of speculation about how Musk might push for changes on the platform.\n\nApril 5: Musk agrees to join the board\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal announces Musk will join Twitter’s board of directors. “Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board,” Agrawal says in a post on Twitter.\n\nAs part of the appointment, Musk agrees not to acquire more than 14.9% of the company’s shares while he remains on the board. His term on the board is set to go through 2024, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nTwitter CEO Parag Agrawal (left) and former CEO Jack Dorsey in an undated photo. From Twitter\n\nApril 10: Just kidding. Musk ditches the board\n\nAgrawal announces that Musk has decided not to join the board after all. “I believe this is for the best,” Agrawal writes in a letter to the Twitter team.\n\nThe reversal opens the door for Musk to pursue a greater stake in the company – and frees him to tweet his many thoughts about the company.\n\nApril 14: Musk offers to buy Twitter and ‘unlock’ its potential\n\nMusk stuns the industry by making an offer to acquire all the shares in Twitter he does not own at a valuation of $41.4 billion. The cash offer represents a 38% premium over the company’s closing price on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed that he had become the company’s biggest shareholder.\n\n“I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy. However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company,” Musk writes in his offer letter. “Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.”\n\nApril 15: The poison pill\n\nTwitter’s board of directors adopts a “poison pill” provision, a limited-term shareholder rights plan that potentially makes it harder for Musk to acquire the company.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk speaks during the official opening of the new Tesla electric car manufacturing plant on March 22, 2022 near Gruenheide, Germany. Christian Marquardt/Getty Images\n\nApril 21: Musk lines up $46.5 billion in financing\n\nMusk lines up $46.5 billion in financing for the deal, including two debt commitment letters from Morgan Stanley and other unnamed financial institutions and one equity commitment letter from himself, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nThe billionaire also reveals that he has not received a formal response from Twitter a week after his acquisition offer. He said he is “seeking to negotiate” a definite acquisition agreement and “is prepared to begin such negotiations immediately” — an apparent reversal from his statement in his acquisition offer letter that it would be his “best and final” offer.\n\nAlthough he is the richest person in the world, much of Musk’s wealth is tied up in Tesla stock, and some followers of the company speculate that it could be challenging for Musk to raise debt against the historically volatile stock.\n\nApril 25: Twitter agrees to sell itself to Elon Musk\n\nTwitter announces that it has agreed to sell itself to Musk in a deal valued at around $44 billion. At a conference later in the day, Musk describes his offer to buy Twitter in characteristically sweeping terms as being about “the future of civilization,” not just making money.\n\nAt an all-hands meeting that afternoon, Twitter employees raise questions about everything from what the deal would mean for their compensation to whether former US President Donald Trump would be let back on the platform.\n\nApril 29: Musk cashes out billions in Tesla stock\n\nFilings reveal Musk sold $8.5 billion of his Tesla stock in the three days after Twitter board agreed to the sale for an average of $883.09 per share. The filings did not disclose the reason for the sale, but Musk appeared to be raising funds to buy Twitter.\n\nTesla cars sit in a dealership lot on March 28, 2022 in Chicago, Illinois.

The new investors include Oracle founder Larry Ellison, cryptocurrency platform Binance and venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, according to a filing.\n\nMay 6: Musk’s lofty goals for Twitter, revealed\n\nMusk aims to increase Twitter’s annual revenue to $26.4 billion by 2028, up from $5 billion last year, according to a New York Times report, citing Musk’s pitch deck presented to investors. To achieve that lofty goal, Musk intends to bolster Twitter’s subscription revenue and build up a payments business while decreasing the company’s reliance on advertising sales, according to the report.\n\nMay 10: Musk says he would reinstate Trump’s account\n\nMusk confirms what many have assumed for weeks: he would reverse Twitter’s Trump ban if his deal to buy the company is completed.\n\n“I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump, I think that was a mistake,” Musk said. “I would reverse the perma-ban. … Banning Trump from Twitter didn’t end Trump’s voice, it will amplify it among the right and this is why it’s morally wrong and flat out stupid.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump looks at his phone during a roundtable with governors on the reopening of America's small businesses, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, June 18, 2020. Alex Brandon/AP\n\nMay 12: A partial hiring freeze and executive departures\n\nTwitter confirms to CNN Business that the platform is pausing most hiring and backfills, except for “business critical” roles, and pulling back on other non-labor costs ahead of the acquisition. In addition, Twitter says general manager of consumer, Kayvon Beykpour, and revenue product lead, Bruce Falck, are leaving the company.\n\nMay 13: Twitter deal ‘temporarily on hold’\n\nMusk tweets that the deal is on hold, linking to a Reuters report from nearly two weeks earlier, about Twitter’s most recent disclosure about its amount of spam and fake accounts. The figure cited in the report, however, is in line with prior quarterly disclosures.\n\n“Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,” Musk tweeted.\n\nShares of the social media site plummet after Musk’s announcement, dropping more than 10% at market open. Two hours after announcing the hold, Musk says he remains set on purchasing Twitter. “Still committed to acquisition,” he wrote.\n\nLater in the day, Musk says his team is testing Twitter’s numbers and “picked 100 as the sample size number, because that is what Twitter uses to calculate <5% fake/spam/duplicate.”\n\nMay 14: Oops. NDA problems?\n\nMusk tweets out that Twitter’s legal team accused him of breaking a nondisclosure agreement when the billionaire revealed the platform’s sample size for automated user checks is allegedly just 100 users.\n\n“Twitter legal just called to complain that I violated their NDA by revealing the bot check sample size is 100! This actually happened,” wrote Musk.\n\nMay 16: Poop emoji\n\nThe standoff over bot accounts continues as Musk exchanges a series of tweets with Agrawal over the issue. After Agrawal carefully explains how Twitter attempts to combat and measure spam accounts, Musk responds with a poop emoji.\n\nMusk follows up with a somewhat more thoughtful question. “So how do advertisers know what they’re getting for their money?” Musk asked. “This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,” he added.\n\nMay 17: Musk says Twitter deal ‘cannot move forward.’ Twitter disagrees\n\nMusk announces that his acquisition of Twitter “cannot move forward” until he sees more information about the prevalence of spam accounts, claiming that the social media platform falsified numbers in filings. Without citing a source, he claims in a tweet that Twitter is “20% fake/spam accounts” and suggests Twitter’s previous filings with the SEC were misleading.\n\nLater in the day, Musk posts a poll to his Twitter followers: “Twitter claims that >95% of daily active users are real, unique humans. Does anyone have that experience?” before calling on the SEC to evaluate the platform’s numbers. “Hello @SECGov, anyone home?” Musk tweets, in an apparent attempt to get the regulator to look into the matter.\n\nIn a statement, Twitter says it remains “committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable.” Later, the company says it intends to “enforce the merger agreement.”\n\nJune 6: A threat to walk away\n\nIn a letter to Twitter’s head of legal, Musk threatens to walk away from his purchase of the platform, alleging that Twitter is “actively resisting and thwarting his information rights” as outlined by the deal.\n\nIn the letter, an attorney for Musk accuses the social media company of breaching the merger agreement by not providing the data he has requested on Twitter spam bots, stating that the lack of information gives him a right “not to consummate the transaction” and “to terminate the merger agreement.”\n\nJuly 8: Actually trying to walk away\n\nMusk moved to terminate the acquisition agreement. A lawyer representing him claimed in a letter to Twitter’s top lawyer that the company is “in material breach of multiple provisions” of the deal over its alleged failure to provide all the data Musk says he needs to evaluate the number of spam and fake accounts on the platform.\n\n“For nearly two months, Mr. Musk has sought the data and information necessary to ‘make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on Twitter’s platform,’” the letter reads. “This information is fundamental to Twitter’s business and financial performance and is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. … Twitter has failed or refused to provide this information.”\n\nTwitter was not having it.\n\n“The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement,” Twitter board chair Bret Taylor said in a tweet Friday, echoing earlier statements by the company that it planned to follow through with the deal. “We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery.”\n\nJuly 12: Twitter sues Musk\n\nTwitter sued the Tesla billionaire in Delaware court in an attempt to force him to complete the deal.\n\nThe 62-page lawsuit, sprinkled with memes, tweets and a poop emoji, effectively highlighted the bizarre spectacle of the deal from the start. The company paints Musk as a non-serious potential owner — alleging at one point that he has “disdain” for the company, and at another saying, “Musk’s strategy is … a model of bad faith” — while seeking to compel him to become its owner. (Twitter’s board has an obligation to its shareholders to try to see the deal through if they believe it is in their best interest. The dispute could also end in a settlement.)\n\nJuly 29: Save the date\n\nTwitter’s lawsuit against Musk over his move to terminate their $44 billion acquisition agreement will go to trial on Oct. 17 and run for five days, a Delaware judge ruled.\n\nThe decision came after Judge Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, who is overseeing the case, previously ruled in Twitter’s favor that the proceedings could be expedited and take place in October. Twitter initially pushed for an October 10th start.\n\nMusk’s legal team had asked for the trial to take place in 2023. Twitter’s legal team argued it was necessary to expedite the case in order to limit the “harm” to its business and to ensure the deal can be completed before Oct. 24, the “drop dead” date by which the two sides had previously agreed to close the deal.\n\nPeiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former head of security at Twitter, is sworn-in as he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on data security at Twitter, on Capitol Hill, September 13, 2022 in Washington, DC.

Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nSeptember 13: Whistleblower testifies before Congress\n\nTwitter whistleblower Peiter “Mudge” Zatko testifies before Congress in his first public appearance after his bombshell allegations against the social media company were reported in August by CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nIn a whistleblower disclosure sent to multiple lawmakers and government agencies in July, Zatko accused Twitter of failing to safeguard users’ personal information and of exposing the most sensitive parts of its operation to too many people, including potentially to foreign spies. Zatko — who was Twitter’s head of security from November 2020 until he was fired in January — also alleged company executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal, have deliberately misled regulators and the company’s own board about its shortcomings.\n\nZatko claimed in his testimony that Twitter is extremely vulnerable to being penetrated and exploited by agents of foreign governments, as well as detailed some of the personal information Twitter collects on users and alleged that the company does not know where the majority of its collected data goes.\n\nDays earlier, a judge allowed Musk’s legal team to add arguments based on the whistleblower disclosure to its case.\n\nOctober 3: Musk wants Twitter at the full price?\n\nMusk sends a letter to Twitter proposing to complete the deal as originally signed for $54.20 per share, citing people familiar with the negotiations. News of the letter, revealed in a security filing the next day, sends Twitter stock surging more than 20%, approaching the deal price for the first time in months.\n\nSuch an agreement could bring to an end a contentious, months-long back and forth between Musk and Twitter that has caused massive uncertainty for employees, investors and users of one of the world’s most influential social media platforms.\n\nOctober 6: The clock is officially ticking\n\nMusk has until October 28 to close his acquisition of Twitter or face a trial that was previously delayed to allow both parties to close the deal, Judge McCormick rules.\n\n“If the transaction does not close by 5 p.m. on October 28, 2022, the parties are instructed to contact me by email that evening to obtain November 2022 trial dates,” the judge said in the order.\n\nOctober 27: Elon now owns Twitter\n\nMusk completes his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Critics have chided Bezos for not signing the Giving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\nExclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now 01:50 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”\n\nAsked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”\n\nBezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.\n\nThe 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and a possible economic recession to Sánchez’s plan to visit outer space with an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nThat working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a $100 million grant to Parton as part of her Courage and Civility Award. It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate and CNN contributor Van Jones.\n\n“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right? She is just beaming with light. And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds. And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”\n\nThe throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.\n\n“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.\n\nUnity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.\n\nHow to give it away\n\nBut the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune. Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.\n\nDespite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.\n\nBezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs. Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.\n\nThough Bezos is now Amazon’s (AMZN) executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company. Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s (AMZN) footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom. Amazon’s (AMZN) reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.\n\nBezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.\n\n“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”\n\n“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added. “So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”\n\nBezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently gave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizations in the span of less than a year.\n\nThe economic downturn\n\nWhile Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.\n\nLast month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”\n\nThe advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.\n\n“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Keep some dry powder on hand…. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”\n\nMany may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.\n\nBezos and Sánchez’s partnership\n\nSánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said. Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”\n\nSánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot. She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.\n\nBezos has credited his own journey to space for helping to inspire his push to fight climate change. Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.\n\nSánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023. And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”\n\nWashington’s NFL team\n\nBezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume. CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potential joint bid on the Washington Commanders.\n\nIt is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.\n\nBut during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.\n\n“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.\n\nSánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football. I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”\n\nBezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”\n\n– CNN’s Chloe Melas contributed to this report", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/politics/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-ukraine/index.html", "title": "Exclusive: Musk's SpaceX says it can no longer pay for critical ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nSince they first started arriving in Ukraine last spring, the Starlink satellite internet terminals made by Elon Musk’s SpaceX have been a vital source of communication for Ukraine’s military, allowing it to fight and stay connected even as cellular phone and internet networks have been destroyed in its war with Russia.\n\nSo far roughly 20,000 Starlink satellite units have been donated to Ukraine, with Musk tweeting on Friday the “operation has cost SpaceX $80 million and will exceed $100 million by the end of the year.”\n\nBut those charitable contributions could be coming to an end, as SpaceX has warned the Pentagon that it may stop funding the service in Ukraine unless the US military kicks in tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nDocuments obtained by CNN show that last month Musk’s SpaceX sent a letter to the Pentagon saying it can no longer continue to fund the Starlink service as it has. The letter also requested that the Pentagon take over funding for Ukraine’s government and military use of Starlink, which SpaceX claims would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year and could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months.\n\n“We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,” SpaceX’s director of government sales wrote to the Pentagon in the September letter.\n\nAmong the SpaceX documents sent to the Pentagon and seen by CNN is a previously unreported direct request made to Musk in July by the Ukrainian military’s commanding general, General Valerii Zaluzhniy, for almost 8,000 more Starlink terminals.\n\nIn a separate cover letter to the Pentagon, an outside consultant working for SpaceX wrote, “SpaceX faces terribly difficult decisions here. I do not think they have the financial ability to provide any additional terminals or service as requested by General Zaluzhniy.”\n\nThe documents, which have not been previously reported, provide a rare breakdown of SpaceX’s own internal numbers on Starlink, detailing the costs and payments associated with the thousands of terminals in Ukraine. They also shed new light on behind-the-scenes negotiations that have provided millions of dollars in communications hardware and services to Ukraine at little cost to Kyiv.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed they received correspondence from SpaceX about the funding of the Starlink satellite communications product in Ukraine, a statement from Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Friday.\n\nEarlier in the day, Singh confirmed the Pentagon had been in communication with SpaceX but did not say whether it was over the funding of the Starlink satellite communication product.\n\nMusk on Friday said that in asking the Pentagon to pick up the bill for Starlink in Ukraine, he was following the advice of a Ukrainian diplomat who responded to Musk’s Ukraine peace plan earlier this month, before the letter was sent to the Pentagon, with: “F*** off.”\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, responded earlier this month to Musk’s claimed peace plan for Russia’s Ukraine war by saying: “F*** off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk.”\n\n“We’re just following his recommendation,” Musk said on Friday, responding to a tweet that referenced CNN’s reporting and Melnyk’s comments, even though the letter SpaceX sent to the Pentagon was sent before the Twitter exchange.\n\nReports of outages\n\nThe letters come amid recent reports of wide-ranging Starlink outages as Ukrainian troops attempt to retake ground occupied by Russia in the eastern and southern parts of the country.\n\nSources familiar with the outages said they suddenly affected the entire frontline as it stood on September 30. “That has affected every effort of the Ukrainians to push past that front,” said one person familiar with the outages who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. “Starlink is the main way units on the battlefield have to communicate.”\n\nThis photograph taken on September 25 shows an antenna of the Starlink satellite-based broadband system donated by US tech billionaire Elon Musk in Izyum, Kharkiv region, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere was no warning to Ukrainian forces, a second person said, adding that now when Ukraine liberates an area a request has to be made for Starlink services to be turned on.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported the outages which resulted in a “catastrophic” loss of communication, a senior Ukrainian official said. In a tweet responding to the article, Musk didn’t dispute the outage, saying that what is happening on the battlefield is classified.\n\nSpaceX’s suggestion it will stop funding Starlink also comes amid rising concern in Ukraine over Musk’s allegiance. Musk recently tweeted a controversial peace plan that would have Ukraine give up Crimea and control over the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\n\nAfter Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the question of who Musk sides with, he responded that he “still very much support[s] Ukraine” but fears “massive escalation.”\n\nMusk also argued privately last month that Ukraine doesn’t want peace negotiations right now and that if they went along with his plan, “Russia would accept those terms,” according to a person who heard them.\n\n“Ukraine knows that its current government and wartime efforts are totally dependent on Starlink,” the person familiar with the discussions said. “The decision to keep Starlink running or not rests entirely in the hands of one man. That’s Elon Musk. He hasn’t been elected, no one decided to give him that power. He has it because of the technology and the company he built.”\n\nOn Tuesday Musk denied a report he has spoken to Putin directly about Ukraine. On Thursday, when a Ukrainian minister tweeted that Starlink is essential to Ukraine’s infrastructure, Musk replied: “You’re most welcome. Glad to support Ukraine.”\n\n“The gall to look like heroes”\n\nMore than seven months into the war, it’s hard to overstate the impact Starlink has had in Ukraine. The government in Kyiv, Ukrainian troops as well and NGOs and civilians have relied on the nimble, compact and easy-to-use units created by SpaceX. It’s not only used for voice and electronic communication but to help fly drones and send back video to correct artillery fire.\n\nCNN has seen it used at numerous Ukrainian bases.\n\nElon Musk pauses and looks down as he speaks during a press conference at SpaceX's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Village in South Texas on February 10, 2022. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Starlink has been absolutely essential because the Russians have targeted the Ukrainian communications infrastructure,” said Dimitri Alperovitch, co-founder of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a think tank. “Without that they’d be really operating in the blind in many cases.”\n\nThough Musk has received widespread acclaim and thanks for responding to requests for Starlink service to Ukraine right as the war was starting, in reality, the vast majority of the 20,000 terminals have received full or partial funding from outside sources, including the US government, the UK and Poland, according to the SpaceX letter to the Pentagon.\n\nSpaceX’s request that the US military foot the bill has rankled top brass at the Pentagon, with one senior defense official telling CNN that SpaceX has “the gall to look like heroes” while having others pay so much and now presenting them with a bill for tens of millions per month.\n\nAccording to the SpaceX figures shared with the Pentagon, about 85% of the 20,000 terminals in Ukraine were paid – or partially paid – for by countries like the US and Poland or other entities. Those entities also paid for about 30% of the internet connectivity, which SpaceX says costs $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. (Over the weekend, Musk tweeted there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine.)\n\nIn his July letter to Musk, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Gen. Zaluzhniy, praised the Starlink units’ “exceptional utility” and said some 4,000 terminals had been deployed by the military. However, around 500 terminals per month are destroyed in the fighting, Zaluzhniy said, before asking for 6,200 more terminals for the Ukrainian military and intelligence services and 500 per month going forward to offset the losses.\n\nSpaceX said they responded by asking Zaluzhniy to instead take up his request to the Department of Defense.\n\nOn September 8, the senior director of government sales for SpaceX wrote the Pentagon saying the costs have gotten too high, approaching $100 million. The official asked the Department of Defense to pick up Ukraine’s new request as well as ongoing service costs, totaling $124 million for the remainder of 2022.\n\nThose costs, according to the senior defense official, would reach almost $380 million for a full year.\n\nSpaceX declined repeated requests for comment on both the outages and their recent request to the Pentagon. A lawyer for Musk did not reply to a request for comment. Defense Department spokesman Bob Ditchey told CNN, “The Department continues to work with industry to explore solutions for Ukraine’s armed forces as they repel Russia’s brutal and unprovoked aggression. We do not have anything else to add at this time.”\n\nBreaking down the costs\n\nEarly US support for Starlink came via the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which according to the Washington Post spent roughly $3 million on hardware and services in Ukraine. The largest single contributor of terminals, according to the newly obtained documents, is Poland with payment for almost 9,000 individual terminals.\n\nUS Pentagon in Washington DC building looking down aerial view from above Ivan Cholakov/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe US has provided almost 1,700 terminals. Other contributors include the UK, NGOs and crowdfunding.\n\nThe far more expensive part, however, is the ongoing connectivity. SpaceX says it has paid for about 70% of the service provided to Ukraine and claims to have offered that highest level – $4,500 a month – to all terminals in Ukraine despite the majority only having signed on for the cheaper $500 per month service.\n\nThe terminals themselves cost $1500 and $2500 for the two models sent to Ukraine, the documents say, while consumer models on Starlink’s website are far cheaper and service in Ukraine is just $60 per month.\n\nThat’s just 1.3% of the service rate SpaceX says it needs the Pentagon to start paying.\n\n“You could say he’s trying to get money from the government or just trying to say ‘I don’t want to be part of this anymore,’” said the person familiar with Ukraine’s requests for Starlink. Given the recent outages and Musk’s reputation for being unpredictable, “Feelings are running really high on the Ukrainian side,” this person said.\n\nMusk is the biggest shareholder of the privately-held SpaceX. In May, SpaceX disclosed that its valuation had risen to $127 billion and it has raised $2 billion this year, CNBC reported.\n\nLast week, Musk faced a barrage of criticism on Twitter – including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – after presenting in a series of tweets his peace plan to end the war. It would include giving Crimea to Russia and re-do referenda, supervised by the United Nations this time, in the four regions Russia recently illegally annexed.\n\nIt echoed comments he’d made last month at an exclusive closed-door conference in Aspen, Colorado called “The Weekend,” at which Musk told a room full of attendees that Ukraine should seek peace now because they’ve had recent victories.\n\n“This is the time to do it. They don’t want to do it, that’s for sure. But this is the time to do it,” he said, according to a person in the room. “Everyone wants to seek peace when they’re losing but they don’t want to seek peace when they’re winning. For now.”", "authors": ["Alex Marquardt"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/23/investing/elon-musk-tesla-twitter/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk's Twitter obsession isn't the core reason for Tesla stock's ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nA popular misconception has emerged about Elon Musk and Tesla: The megabillionaire’s love affair with Twitter is the main reason Tesla shares have lost so much value this year. But Tesla’s steep stock selloff this week proved that the problems at Musk’s car company go well beyond Twitter.\n\nEven as Musk signals he may give up his CEO title at Twitter, investors became concerned that the outlook for Tesla’s sales and profit is taking a turn for the worse. A sign of the weakening demand: Tesla has announced a rare sale. The company offered two rebates for buyers who take delivery of a vehicle before the end of the year, initially offering a $3,750 discount earlier this month. Tesla then doubled that rebate to $7,500 Thursday.\n\n“Tesla clearly is starting to see demand cracks in China and in the US at a time that EV competition is increasing across the board,” said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and a Tesla bull who cut his price target for the stock Friday from $250 to $175. “The price cuts that Tesla enacted was the straw that broke the camel’s back on the stock.”\n\nAnother reason Tesla’s stock is sinking: The US economy could tip into recession next year, hurting car sales. Musk said on an Twitter Spaces call Thursday he foresees the economy will be in a “serious recession” in 2023.\n\n“I think there is going to be some macro drama that’s higher than people currently think,” he said, according to Reuters, adding that homes and cars will get “disproportionately impacted” by economic conditions.\n\nTesla’s questionable valuation\n\nPart of the problem with Tesla’s stock price is that critics question whether it was ever worth the trillion-dollar valuation it had at the start of the year. At its peak, Tesla was worth more than the 12 largest automakers on the planet combined, despite having a fraction of the sales of any of them. Today it is worth $399 billion.\n\n“It got ahead of itself in the near-term,” said Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, another Tesla fan. “I still believe this can be a much bigger company. I think it will see those kinds of numbers again. But it could take a long, long time to get there.”\n\nTesla’s growth prospects - a target of 50% sales growth annually, helped drive that valuation. It conceded in October that it will miss that sales target for this year.\n\nThe stock’s climb to dizzying heights – rising 743% in 2020 alone – was driven by Musk’s reputation as a genius who would disrupt the massive global auto industry.\n\n“Tesla was viewed as a disruptive technology company, not as an automaker, and a large part of that premium is related to Musk,” said Ives.\n\nOverpromising and underdelivering\n\nCritics of Tesla said much of its sky-high valuation was based on promises that Musk made about future products, many of which came years after they were originally promised.\n\nA prime example is the Cybertruck, the Tesla pickup truck, first unveiled three years ago with promises that production would start in 2021. Now it is slated to start production next year, with a ramp-up in production in 2024, putting it years behind other electric pickup offerings from Ford and upstart EV maker Rivian, both of which have electric pickups available for purchase today. It could also trail planned electric pickup offerings from General Motors.\n\n“Elon Musk has a pathological problem with the truth,” said Gordon Johnson, one of the largest critics of Tesla among analysts. “When people say he’s a genius and innovator, it’s based on all his promises he never lives up to.”\n\nJohnson said Tesla shares will have a much steeper fall ahead, once it starts being priced like other automakers rather than on its promises. He said that for Tesla to hit its growth targets it needs to be building new plants almost every year, but that new factories in Germany and Texas that opened in spring are still not operating at full capacity. And he said that its plant in China has had to scale back production due to weak sales in the market in the face of the Covid restrictions.\n\n“Demand in the US has collapsed,” he said. “Two months ago, your wait time was two or three months. Now you can get one immediately. They’re going to build more cars than they sell for a third straight quarter. It’s the definition of excess capacity.”\n\nTesla is still by far the largest EV maker worldwide, although that title is being challenged in some key markets, by Volkswagen in Europe and by BYD in China. And more competition is coming from established automakers such as Ford and GM.\n\nThe Twitter factor\n\nThat’s not to say Twitter has played no role in Tesla’s stock price demise this year: Tesla shares have lost 66% of their value since Musk’s interest in Twitter was first disclosed in April, with a 45% decline since he closed on the deal in late October.\n\nInvestors have been disappointed that Musk appears to be paying for so much of his $44 billion purchase of Twitter by selling Tesla stock. Musk, Tesla’s largest shareholder, has sold $23 billion worth of Tesla shares since his interest in Twitter became public in April.\n\nOn Thursday’s Twitter Spaces call, Musk promised he was done selling shares of Tesla stock until at least 2024, if not beyond. But he hasn’t lived up to a previous promise in April that he was done selling Tesla shares, selling $14.4 billion of that stock since that time.\n\n“It’s been a Pinocchio situation for Musk saying he is done selling stock. Investors want to see him walk the walk and not just talk the talk,” said Ives.\n\nAnother Twitter factor: Musk named himself CEO of Twitter, the third major company he leads, along with Tesla and SpaceX. So, many people assumed that Musk’s loss of focus on Tesla has spooked its former fans on Wall Street.\n\nBut this week began with Musk running a poll - on Twitter of course - asking if he should give up the CEO title at his social media plaything. He promised he would comply with the result, and 57.5% of those who voted said they want him gone.\n\nThat departure may take a while - Musk tweeted he will resign “as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!” And the same tweet he cautioned that even if he gives up the CEO title at Twitter, he’s not walking away totally, saying that he plans to “just run the software & servers teams” after finding a new “fool” to be CEO.\n\nThe poll results late Sunday were enough to lift Tesla shares in early trading Monday, but the shares ended the day slightly lower, and have lost significantly more ground every day since. Tesla shares fell 9% Thursday, and it ended the week down 18% after another 2% drop on Friday.\n\nAnd then there’s the question of how much damage the debacle at Twitter has done to the Tesla brand. Musk has fired thousands of employees, banned journalists while allowing Donald Trump and other previously banned accounts back online, called for the prosecution of Dr. Anthony Fauci, embraced conspiracy theories and made anti-trans statements in his short tenure as CEO.\n\nIt may have endeared him to some but angered other potential buyers, including liberals who might be willing to pay a premium for a more environmentally friendly vehicle.\n\n“I think it was measurable damage,” said Munster, who believes the publicity over his time at Twitter cost Tesla 5% of its sales.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/tech/elon-musk-twitter-subscription-business/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk has upended Twitter's business. Here's how he could fix it", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nMuch of Twitter’s ad sales team has been fired or pushed out. Large companies from General Mills to Macy’s have paused advertising on the platform, with more potentially following suit after new owner Elon Musk’s decision to restore the account of former President Donald Trump and other controversial figures. And any cursory scroll of the platform will likely show you fewer big brand ads.\n\nThat would all seem like horrible news for a business that generates the lion’s share of its revenue from advertising. But Musk may not care.\n\nThe Tesla CEO has previously said he “hates advertising” and, as Twitter’s owner, professed a desire to make the company more reliant on subscription revenue than advertising dollars. Twitter has always struggled to turn its outsized influence in media, politics, and culture into a highly successful advertising business. And without needing to please advertisers, the billionaire would be freer to implement his “free speech” vision for Twitter.\n\n“I’ve always thought that a move to a subscription business would make sense for Twitter … it’s never been a great advertising platform,” said Larry Vincent, associate professor of marketing at USC’s Marshall School of Business. Twitter’s advertising business has long been smaller than that of rivals like Facebook, in part because it didn’t offer the same level of user targeting.\n\nTo successfully overhaul Twitter into a thriving subscription business would be to buck the trend of many other media properties that have struggled with the model. And Musk’s attempts right out of the gate have faltered. An updated, $8-per-month version of the Twitter Blue subscription service that allowed users to buy a verification checkmark had to be halted after just two days when it was abused to impersonate prominent people (notably Musk himself), businesses, and government agencies. Musk initially said he would relaunch the service on November 29, but on Monday suggested he might further delay it “until there is high confidence of stopping impersonation.”\n\nSome industry watchers have also questioned whether, given Twitter’s somewhat niche status as a relatively small platform used largely by members of the media, politicians and academics, such a subscription service could be widely adopted. Even if all 217 million daily users Twitter reported having at the end of 2021 signed up for Musk’s $8 per month subscription, the annual revenue would still be less than a quarter of the size of rival Meta’s.\n\nStill, some industry insiders have reason to think he can pull it off. “Twitter over the last month has been far more entertaining than Netflix and easily worth $8,” Roy Price, the founder of Amazon Studios, said in a tweet Saturday. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a tweet, “don’t underestimate” Musk. And Twitch co-founder Justin Kan tweeted that he thinks Twitter is “likely to survive just fine (and potentially thrive!)” in part because, unlike some high-profile users who have announced their departure from the platform, most regular users likely don’t care about who’s leading the platform and how.\n\nIndeed, Musk’s shift away from advertising and toward a subscription model could work if Twitter can survive having its entire revenue decimated beforehand, keep its systems up and running, avoid violating laws around copyright infringement and hate speech, and also remain in good standing with Apple and Google, which control the app stores on which Twitter depends.\n\nThe stakes to pull it off are significant for Musk. After borrowing billions of dollars to finance the Twitter takeover, Musk is up against the clock to turn what was already a struggling business into a company that can generate enough cash flow to pay back his debt. He may also risk his reputation as “a gifted and audacious entrepreneur who made Tesla work against widespread doubts and naysaying,” said Robert Bruner, professor of business administration at University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business.\n\nTwitter’s ad woes\n\nWhether he likes advertising or not, the business made up 90% of Twitter’s revenue prior to Musk’s takeover and replacing it won’t be an immediate shift.\n\nIn the wake of the chaos at Twitter in recent weeks, there has been talk of brands quitting the platform out of concern that their ads could end up next to objectionable content. But that may not be the only or even primary reason advertisers have walked away — or why attracting new ones could be tricky. Advertisers are also likely on edge about Twitter’s stability, as users and former employees raise concerns that the mass exodus of staff could leave the platform vulnerable to glitches and outages.\n\nBrands may also be miffed that many of Twitter’s ad sales employees who managed their campaigns have been fired or pushed out, including after another round of layoffs and exits Monday.\n\nLarge digital platforms “have experienced professionals out there who develop relationships with these advertisers,” Vincent said. “When you let go of a staff that was as veteran as Twitter’s and there’s no one there to respond to those [brands], you basically reduce the value of the ad platform.”\n\nBy bringing Trump and other controversial figures back to the platform, Twitter may have greater appeal to the right-leaning advertisers that do business on alternative platforms like Trump’s Truth Social. While there is a market to advertise to “people buying gold, people buying survivalist home kits, guns and weapons,” Twitter has long been known as a more politically neutral, if not somewhat left-leaning, platform and may struggle to attract such companies, said Michael Serazio, a communications professor at Boston College.\n\nLife beyond ads\n\nMusk is also going to have to contend with potential pressure from regulators, as well as the app store operators at Apple and Google, if he wants to succeed in turning Twitter’s business around. A group of US senators has already called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Musk’s Twitter over potential violations of the company’s 2011 consent decree. And Europe’s Digital Services Act may impose limits on just how free Musk’s “free speech” Twitter can be.\n\nIn an op-ed published in the New York Times last week, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety, Yoel Roth, who left the company earlier this month, said the company’s failure to adhere to Google and Apple’s app store rules could be “catastrophic.” The app stores have previously removed social media apps for failing to protect their users from harmful content, and Roth suggested that Twitter had already begun to receive calls from app store operators following Musk’s takeover. Over the weekend, the head of Apple’s app store, Phil Schiller, deleted his Twitter account.\n\nMost importantly, Twitter will have to keep users invested in the platform if Musk’s subscription strategy is going to work. And it’s not just existing users — Musk will also need to attract new people to the platform, which has long struggled to break out of its niche status and grow its user base, by ensuring it’s filled with must-read content.\n\nIn the weeks since Musk took over Twitter — which was immediately followed by an uptick in hateful content — there has been much hand-waving from users about moving to other platforms, and several high-profile accounts have announced their exits, including director Shonda Rimes and model Gigi Hadid. But it’s not clear that there has been a broad drop-off in the user base; instead, Musk has claimed in tweets that platform usage is at an all-time high.\n\nSo long as Musk can keep Twitter functioning properly despite having fewer employees, many users will likely stick around, perhaps even more so following the return of controversial accounts that tend to make news with incendiary comments on the platform. Musk himself has pointed out that even as people fret about the demise of Twitter, they’re doing it on the platform itself. And the billionaire has proposed making it easier for creators to earn money on the platform, which could also drive usage.\n\nEven still, there is no guarantee that continuing to capture the online world’s attention will translate into subscription payments or other revenue growth.\n\n“Even as both Musk and Trump are driven by the gravity of the attention economy, it doesn’t mean that they’ll be able to cash in on it,” Serazio said. He said Musk likely made the decision to restore Trump’s account because “it was going to cause headlines, it was going to cause attention,” adding that “the attention won’t save Twitter … but I don’t know that [Musk] has any other strategy other than the attention economy, even if he doesn’t know how to profit from it.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/02/politics/peter-thiel-senate-republicans-blake-masters-jd-vance/index.html", "title": "Peter Thiel: Republicans frustrated with tech mogul's refusal to fund ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs Republicans try to salvage their troubled quest to win the Senate majority this fall, party operatives are pointing their fingers at the fundraising failures of two GOP nominees and their idiosyncratic tech mogul backer, Peter Thiel.\n\nThiel’s $15 million super PAC investments helped boost Ohio’s J.D. Vance and Arizona’s Blake Masters in their competitive primaries earlier this year, with the California billionaire even influencing former President Donald Trump’s decision to endorse both candidates.\n\nBut since the two candidates won their respective nominations, Thiel has not stepped up with additional investments as Vance and Masters have struggled to raise money on their own – while both have been massively outraised by their Democratic rivals. The disparity has prompted Republican observers to question why Thiel has so far refused to help his chosen candidates in the general election through a big donation to a super PAC.\n\n“This is a Thiel problem that has a Thiel solution,” said Liam Donovan, a Republican lobbyist and strategist. “Anybody that emerged from these primaries with 30% was going to need help. The difference here is there’s a patron that has the capacity to help.”\n\nWashington Republicans tell CNN the particular problems in Ohio and Arizona reflect larger issues that are hurting the GOP’s Senate hopes. President Joe Biden’s slightly improving approval rating, a Democratic base energized by the recent Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade and lower gas prices have limited an already narrow window for Republicans to take back the majority after losing it in 2021. High-risk candidates and a Senate map with plenty of GOP seats to defend complicate the situation, as does Trump’s own unwillingness to use his hefty war chest to help the Republican effort.\n\nPoor fundraising from Thiel’s twin champions, meanwhile, does not mean the campaigns are doomed. Every Republican who spoke to CNN expressed confidence Vance would defeat Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan in Ohio and that Masters remains competitive against Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in a sharply divided Arizona. But their money deficits further limit where Republicans can make crucial decisions about where to spend finite dollars in the final months of the midterms.\n\n“Candidates need to understand that winning the majority is a team sport, and when you aren’t getting the job done in your race, it affects candidates in other races,” said one Republican operative who requested anonymity to speak candidly. “Republicans aren’t playing with monopoly money here. … Outside groups will never be able to equalize the playing field. It really makes it difficult.”\n\nRepublican J.D. Vance is running for Senate in Ohio. Dustin Franz/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWithout a new infusion of cash, the poor fundraising from Vance and Masters has prompted a shift in Republican outside spending. The leadership-aligned Senate Leadership Fund announced last week it would cancel $8 million in ad reservations in Arizona in September and instead spend an additional $28 million in Ohio to shore up Vance. The super PAC still has ad time reserved in Arizona throughout the month of October.\n\n“We’re leaving the door wide open in Arizona but we want to move additional resources to other offensive opportunities that have become increasingly competitive, as well as an unexpected expense in Ohio,” Steven Law, the president of SLF, said in a statement last Friday.\n\nStill, the thinly veiled message to Thiel was clear: Without a dramatic shift in fundraising or the races themselves, Republican super PACs would be investing in one of his chosen horses, but not both. That message follows weeks of periodic conversations between Thiel and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, beginning shortly after Vance won his primary in May. In some of those conversations, which were first reported by Puck, McConnell urged Thiel to donate to SLF, a request Thiel has flatly rejected, according to a person familiar with knowledge of the talks. Another Republican familiar says the donation request did not come directly from McConnell but instead from an ally of the Kentucky Republican.\n\nRecent back-channeling between Thiel and McConnell allies has also proved fruitless, this person said, noting that the conservative tech mogul has been closely monitoring Masters’ performance and wants to see his campaign improve before making any decisions. Thiel’s thinking is that SLF could be compelled to make a new investment if Masters becomes more competitive, this person said.\n\nMcConnell himself has not given up on Masters. The Republican leader is hosting a fundraiser in Washington on September 6 with Masters, according to an invitation obtained by CNN.\n\nBut the spending shift from SLF last week also reflects a sense throughout the GOP establishment in Washington that Thiel’s deep-pocketed play to shape the party has been inconsistent and problematic.\n\n“If you want to be a kingmaker, you have to elect your kings,” said the Republican operative.\n\nAn unsettled map\n\nThe frustration with Thiel comes at an unsettled time for Republican hopes of taking back the Senate – and money concerns are at the fore.\n\nIn addition to questions about Ohio and Arizona, Republican Mehmet Oz is being outraised and outspent by Democrat John Fetterman in Pennsylvania; a contentious primary in New Hampshire has allowed Don Bolduc, a Trump-aligned candidate that many establishment Republicans believe can’t win a general election, to lead in recent public polls; and a series of questionable comments and shaky campaign appearances has raised Republican fears about football star Herschel Walker’s campaign in Georgia.\n\nThe uncertainty has led McConnell to temper expectations that his party could take back the legislative body in 2022.\n\n“It’s a 50/50 proposition,” McConnell said recently. “We’ve got a 50/50 Senate right now, we’ve got a 50/50 nation and I think the outcome is likely to be very, very close either way.”\n\nHe added: “Senate races are statewide. They’re just different in nature from individual congressional districts. Twenty of my members up and only 14 of the Democrats, so that’s to their advantage. Many of these states are purple states and could go either way. I think it’s just going to be a really close race.”\n\nRepublican Blake Masters is running for Senate in Arizona. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nThat uncertainty has only heightened frustration with Thiel, amid a growing sense that the tech mogul – who according to Forbes is worth nearly $4 billion – effectively abandoned his top recruits at their most critical moment.\n\n“What’s another 10 million to Peter Thiel?” said a second Republican operative working on Senate races. “That puts Arizona in play.”\n\n“You got these guys through Peter,” said another operative, paraphrasing the general feeling about Thiel right now. “You get them out.”\n\nEven still, the same operative believes Thiel is done spending on campaigns for the midterms, echoing what people close to the billionaire have suggested for months: “He has been pretty clear from what I have heard that he felt like he shouldn’t have to spend any more money in the general.”\n\nFrustrated Republicans are not limiting their criticism to Thiel. A third Republican operative said the candidates themselves have thus far failed to meet their fundraising responsibilities as Senate hopefuls in major races, criticizing both Vance and Masters for raising less than some Republican House members in relatively noncompetitive races.\n\nThrough the end of June, for instance, Vance had raised a total of $3.5 million, while Ryan had raised nearly $22 million. Masters had raised nearly $5 million, while Kelly had raised $54 million.\n\n“These guys got to get to work,” said the operative, who also questioned why the National Republican Senatorial Committee has not done more to help Vance and Masters to raise more money. “They should have been training these guys.”\n\nA source familiar with the Vance campaign told CNN that Vance “has seen a significant increase in his fundraising since last quarter’s numbers were released.” A spokesman for the Masters campaign declined to comment for this story.\n\nA spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee declined to comment on whether they have put pressure on Vance or Masters to prioritize fundraising.\n\nAnother Republican strategist pointed to the other missing factor in boosting troubled Republican Senate candidates: Trump.\n\nA spokesman for the former President did not respond to a request for comment. While he has used his endorsement to power candidates to primary wins, he has been stingy in doling out money from his own coffers. Republican operatives worry that Trump’s behemoth war chest is also making it harder for Senate candidates to raise money, noting that top donors are less likely to give to candidates when they feel like they have already given to Trump.\n\n“The Trump mothership is hoovering up everything that’s out there in terms of small-dollar donations,” said the strategist. “Trump’s not going to spend it on winning elections. This is a scenario where he should be called out.”", "authors": ["Michael Warren Dan Merica Gaborr", "Michael Warren", "Dan Merica"], "publish_date": "2022/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/tech/twitter-whistleblower-peiter-zatko-security/index.html", "title": "Twitter whistleblower Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko raises concerns over ...", "text": "Twitter has major security problems that pose a threat to its own users’ personal information, to company shareholders, to national security, and to democracy, according to an explosive whistleblower disclosure obtained exclusively by CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nThe disclosure, sent last month to Congress and federal agencies, paints a picture of a chaotic and reckless environment at a mismanaged company that allows too many of its staff access to the platform’s central controls and most sensitive information without adequate oversight. It also alleges that some of the company’s senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter’s serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, who was previously the company’s head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter’s leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users’ data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don’t have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk’s attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk’s claims).\n\nZatko was fired by Twitter (TWTR) in January for what the company claims was poor performance. According to Zatko, his public whistleblowing comes after he attempted to flag the security lapses to Twitter (TWTR)’s board and to help Twitter (TWTR) fix years of technical shortcomings and alleged non-compliance with an earlier privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. Zatko is being represented by Whistleblower Aid, the same group that represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.\n\nJohn Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid and Zatko’s lawyer, told CNN that Zatko has not been in contact with Musk, and said Zatko began the whistleblower process before there was any indication of Musk’s involvement with Twitter.\n\nAfter this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, “We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.”\n\nCNN sought comment from Twitter on more than 50 specific questions regarding the disclosure.\n\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN that security and privacy are both longtime priorities for the company. Twitter also said the company provides clear tools for users to control privacy, ad targeting and data sharing, and added that it has created internal workflows to ensure users know that when they cancel their accounts, Twitter will deactivate the accounts and start a deletion process. Twitter declined to say whether it typically completes the process.\n\n“Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance,” the Twitter spokesperson said. “What we’ve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. Mr. Zatko’s allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.”\n\nSome of Zatko’s most damning claims spring from his apparently tense relationship with Parag Agrawal, the company’s former chief technology officer who was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. According to the disclosure, Agrawal and his lieutenants repeatedly discouraged Zatko from providing a full accounting of Twitter’s security problems to the company’s board of directors. The company’s executive team allegedly instructed Zatko to provide an oral report of his initial findings on the company’s security condition to the board rather than a detailed written account, ordered Zatko to knowingly present cherry-picked and misrepresented data to create the false perception of progress on urgent cybersecurity issues, and went behind Zatko’s back to have a third-party consulting firm’s report scrubbed to hide the true extent of the company’s problems.\n\nThe disclosure is generally much kinder to Dorsey, who hired Zatko and whom Zatko believes wanted to see the problems within the company fixed. But it does depict him as extremely disengaged in his final months leading Twitter – so much so that some senior staff even considered the possibility he was sick.\n\nCNN has reached out to Dorsey for comment. A person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at Twitter told CNN the company investigated several claims he brought forward around the time he was fired, and ultimately found them unpersuasive; the person added that Zatko at times lacked understanding of Twitter’s FTC obligations.\n\nZatko believes his firing was in retaliation for his sounding the alarm about the company’s security problems.\n\nThe scathing disclosure, which totals around 200 pages, including supporting exhibits – was sent last month to a number of US government agencies and congressional committees, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The existence and details of the disclosure have not previously been reported. CNN obtained a copy of the disclosure from a senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill. The SEC, DOJ and FTC declined to comment; the Senate Intelligence Committee, which received a copy of the report, is taking the disclosure seriously and is setting a meeting to discuss the allegations, according to Rachel Cohen, a committee spokesperson.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and also received the report, vowed to investigate “and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations.”\n\nThe claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the same panel’s top Republican and an avid Twitter user, also expressed deep concerns about the allegations in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Take a tech platform that collects massive amounts of user data, combine it with what appears to be an incredibly weak security infrastructure and infuse it with foreign state actors with an agenda, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster,” Grassley said. “The claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns as well as privacy issues, and they must be investigated further.”\n\nThe FTC should investigate the claims, and impose fines and individual liability on specific Twitter executives if a probe finds they were responsible for security lapses, Sen. Richard Blumenthal wrote to the agency in a letter on Tuesday obtained by CNN.\n\nThe letter by Blumenthal — who chairs the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection — highlights the pressure Twitter now faces from Washington as a result of the disclosure.\n\n“If the Commission does not vigorously oversee and enforce its orders, they will not be taken seriously and these dangerous breaches will continue,” Blumenthal wrote.\n\nZatko may be eligible for a monetary award from the US government as a result of his whistleblower activities. “Original, timely and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action” by the SEC can earn whistleblowers up to a 30% cut of agency fines related to the action if the penalties amount to more than $1 million, the SEC has said. The SEC has awarded more than $1 billion to nearly 300 whistleblowers since 2012.\n\nTye told CNN that Zatko filed his disclosure to the SEC “to help the agency enforce the laws,” and to gain federal whistleblower protections. “The prospect of a reward was not a factor in Mudge’s decision, and in fact he didn’t even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower.”\n\nThe Whistleblower\n\nZatko first came to national attention in 1998 when he took part in the first congressional hearings on cybersecurity.\n\n“All my life, I’ve been about finding places where I can go and make a difference. I’ve done that through the security field. That’s my main lever,” he told CNN in an interview earlier this month.\n\nTwitter whistleblower was on CNN 22 years ago. Here's what he had to say 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\nThe events leading to his decision to become a whistleblower began before he worked at Twitter, with a devastating hack in 2020 in which the Twitter accounts of some of the world’s most famous people, including then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian and Musk, were compromised. Twitter told CNN that in response to the incident, the company began compartmentalizing access to customer support tools.\n\nAfter the attack, Dorsey recruited Zatko, a well-known “ethical hacker” turned cybersecurity insider and executive who previously held senior roles at Google, Stripe and the US Department of Defense, and who told CNN that he’d been offered a senior, day-one cyber position in the Biden administration.\n\nZatko, center, was among a group of hackers who testified before Congress on cybersecurity in 1998. Douglas Graham/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images\n\nWhat Zatko says he found was a company with extraordinarily poor security practices, including giving thousands of the company’s employees — amounting to roughly half the company’s workforce — access to some of the platform’s critical controls. His disclosure describes his overall findings as “egregious deficiencies, negligence, willful ignorance, and threats to national security and democracy.”\n\nAfter the January 6 insurrection, Zatko was concerned about the possibility someone within Twitter who sympathized with the insurrectionists could try to manipulate the company’s platform, according to his disclosure. He sought to clamp down on internal access that allows Twitter engineers to make changes to the platform, known as the “production environment.”\n\nBut, the disclosure says, Zatko soon learned “it was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did…. Nobody knew where data lived or whether it was critical, and all engineers had some form of critical access to the production environment.” Twitter also lacked the ability to hold workers accountable for information security lapses because it has little control or visibility into employees’ individual work computers, Zatko claims, citing internal cybersecurity reports estimating that 4 in 10 devices do not meet basic security standards.\n\nTwitter’s flimsy server infrastructure is a separate yet equally serious vulnerability, the disclosure claims. About half of the company’s 500,000 servers run on outdated software that does not support basic security features such as encryption for stored data or regular security updates by vendors, according to the letter to regulators and a February email Zatko wrote to Patrick Pichette, a Twitter board member, that is included in the disclosure.\n\n[I]t was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did. From Zatko's disclosure\n\nThe company also lacks sufficient redundancies and procedures to restart or recover from data center crashes, Zatko’s disclosure says, meaning that even minor outages of several data centers at the same time could knock the entire Twitter service offline, perhaps for good.\n\nTwitter did not respond to questions about the risk of data center outages, but told CNN that people on Twitter’s engineering and product teams are authorized to access the production environment if they have a specific business justification for doing so. Twitter’s employees use devices overseen by other IT and security teams with the power to prevent a device from connecting to sensitive internal systems if it is running outdated software, Twitter added.\n\nThe company also said it uses automated checks to ensure laptops running outdated software cannot access the production environment, and that employees may only make changes to Twitter’s live product after the code meets certain record-keeping and review requirements.\n\nTwitter has internal security tools that are tested by the company regularly, and every two years by external auditors, according to the person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at the company. The person added that some of Zatko’s statistics surrounding device security lacked credibility and were derived by a small team that did not properly account for Twitter’s existing security procedures.\n\nBut Twitter’s security concerns had come to light prior to 2020. In 2010, the FTC filed a complaint against Twitter for its mishandling of users’ private information and the issue of too many employees having access to Twitter’s central controls. The complaint resulted in an FTC consent order finalized the following year in which Twitter vowed to clean up its act, including by creating and maintaining “a comprehensive information security program.”\n\nZatko alleges that despite the company’s claims to the contrary, it had “never been in compliance” with what the FTC demanded more than 10 years ago. As a result of its alleged failures to address vulnerabilities raised by the FTC as well as other deficiencies, he says, Twitter suffers an “anomalously high rate of security incidents,” approximately one per week serious enough to require disclosure to government agencies. “Based on my professional experience, peer companies do not have this magnitude or volume of incidents,” Zatko wrote in a February letter to Twitter’s board after he was fired by Twitter in January.\n\nThe stakes of Zatko’s disclosure are enormous. It could lead to billions of dollars in new fines for Twitter if it’s found to have violated its legal obligations, according to Jon Leibowitz, who was chair of the FTC at the time of Twitter’s original 2011 consent order.\n\nThe agency now has another opportunity to show the tech industry it is serious about holding platforms accountable, Leibowitz added, after officials opted not to name top Facebook execs including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg in the FTC’s $5 billion privacy settlement with that company in 2019.\n\n[I]f there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order. Jon Leibowitz, former chair of the FTC\n\n“One of the big disappointments in the Facebook order violation case was that the FTC let executives off the hook; they should’ve been named,” Leibowitz told CNN in an interview. “And if there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order.”\n\nTwitter told CNN its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, citing third-party audits filed to the agency under the 2011 consent order in which it said Zatko did not participate. Twitter also said it is in compliance with relevant privacy rules and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems.\n\nZatko’s allegations are based in part on a failure to grasp how Twitter’s existing programs and processes work to fulfill Twitter’s FTC obligations, the person familiar with his tenure told CNN, saying that misunderstanding has prompted him to make inaccurate claims about the company’s level of compliance.\n\nForeign threats\n\nTwitter is exceptionally vulnerable to foreign government exploitation in ways that undermine US national security, and the company may even have foreign spies currently on its payroll, the disclosure alleges.\n\nThe whistleblower report says the US government provided specific evidence to Twitter shortly before Zatko’s firing that at least one of its employees, perhaps more, were working for another government’s intelligence service. The report does not say whether Twitter was already aware or if it subsequently acted on the tip.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter's former chief technology officer, was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nLast year, prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Agrawal — then Twitter’s chief technology officer — proposed to Zatko that Twitter comply with Russian demands that could result in broad-based censorship or surveillance of the platform, Zatko alleges.\n\nThe disclosure does not provide details of Agrawal’s suggestion. Last summer, however, Russia passed a law pressuring tech platforms to open local offices in the country or face potential advertising bans, a move western security experts said was intended to give Russia greater leverage over US tech companies.\n\nWhile Agrawal’s suggestion was ultimately discarded, it was still an alarming sign of how far Twitter was willing to go in pursuit of growth, according to Zatko.\n\n“The fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on U.S. national security,” Zatko’s disclosure says.\n\nThe fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on US national security, From Zatko's disclosure\n\nZatko’s report is becoming public just two weeks after a former Twitter manager was convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi case underscores the gravity of the allegations Zatko now levels at Twitter. His report could further inflame bipartisan concerns in Washington about foreign adversaries and the cybersecurity threats they pose to Americans, ranging from the theft of US citizens’ data to manipulating US voters or stealing technology and trade secrets.\n\nTwitter did not respond to specific questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Musk element\n\nZatko’s disclosure comes at a particularly fortuitous moment for Musk, who is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Musk has accused Twitter of lying about the number of spam bots on its platform, an issue that he claims should let him terminate the deal.\n\nWhile the binding acquisition agreement that Musk signed with Twitter in April did not include any bot-related exemptions, the billionaire claims that the number of bots on the platform affect the user experience and that having more bots than previously known could therefore impact the company’s long-term value. After Musk moved to terminate the purchase, Twitter responded with a lawsuit alleging that he is using bots as a pretext to get out of a deal over which he now has buyers’ remorse following the recent market downturn, and asking a court to force him to close the deal. The case is set to go to trial in Delaware Chancery Court in October.\n\nTwitter employees walk by the company's headquarters in San Francisco.

But figures about how many users a service has, or how many people actually view a given ad on a site, are notoriously unreliable throughout the tech and media industries due to manipulation and error.\n\nAlone among social media companies, Twitter reports its user numbers to investors and advertisers using a measurement it calls monetizable daily active users, or mDAUs. Its rivals simply count and report all active users; until 2019, Twitter had worked that way as well. But that meant Twitter’s figures were subject to significant swings in certain situations, including takedowns of major bot networks. So Twitter switched to mDAUs, which it says counts all users that could be shown an advertisement on Twitter – leaving all accounts that for some reason can’t, for instance because they’re known to be bots, in a separate bucket, according to Zatko’s disclosure.\n\nThe company has repeatedly reported that less than 5% of its mDAUs are fake or spam accounts, and a person familiar with the matter both affirmed that assessment to CNN this week and pointed to other investor disclosures saying the figure relies on significant judgement that may not accurately reflect reality. But Zatko’s disclosure argues that by reporting bots only as a percentage of mDAU, rather than as a percentage of the total number of accounts on the platform, Twitter obscures the true scale of fake and spam accounts on the service, a move Zatko alleges is deliberately misleading.\n\nZatko says he began asking about the prevalence of bot accounts on Twitter in early 2021, and was told by Twitter’s head of site integrity that the company didn’t know how many total bots are on its platform. He alleges that he came away from conversations with the integrity team with the understanding that the company “had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots,” in part because if the true number became public, it could harm the company’s value and image.\n\nJack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I’m still performing that mission. Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former Twitter head of security\n\nExperts on inauthentic behavior online say it can be difficult to quantify “bots” because there isn’t a widely agreed upon definition of the term, and because bad actors constantly change their tactics. There are also many harmless bots on Twitter (and across the internet), such as automated news accounts, and Twitter offers an opt-in feature to allow such accounts to transparently label themselves as automated. Twitter told CNN that the claim it doesn’t know how many bots are on its platform lacks context, reiterating that not all bots are bad and adding that to focus on the total number of bots on Twitter would include those the company may have already identified and taken action against. The company also does not believe it can catch every spam account on the platform, Twitter said, which is why it reports its less-than-5% figure, which reflects a manual estimate, in its financial filings.\n\nBut Zatko told CNN he thinks there would still be value in attempting to measure the total number of spam, false or otherwise potentially harmful automated accounts on the platform. “The executive team, the board, the shareholders and the users all deserve an honest answer as to what it is that they are consuming as far as data and information and content [on the platform … At least from my point of view, I want to invest in a company where I know what’s actually going on because I want to invest strategically in the long-term value of an organization,” he said.\n\nTwitter says that it allows bots on its platform, but its rules prohibit those that engage in spam or platform manipulation. But, as with all social media platforms’ rules, the challenge often lies in enforcing its policies.\n\nElon Musk is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe company says it regularly challenges, suspends and removes accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation, including typically removing more than one million spam accounts each day. Twitter said the total number of bots on the platform is not a useful number. The company declined to answer questions about the total number of accounts on the platform or the average number of new accounts added on the platform daily as context around its daily bot deletion figure.\n\nBut in casting doubt on Twitter’s ability to estimate the true number of fake and spam accounts, Zatko’s allegations could provide ammunition to Musk’s central claim that the figure is much higher than Twitter has publicly reported.\n\nBy going public, Zatko says, he believes he is doing the job he was hired to do for a platform he says is critical to democracy. “Jack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter.

On Thursday afternoon, Twitter staffers began posting the salute emoji, which has become a signal that someone is exiting the company. One Twitter employee said in a tweet that deciding to join the company was “one of the easiest decisions ever made. Deciding to leave today was 100% the opposite.”\n\nMeanwhile, an internal Slack channel at the company was filled with employees posting the salute emoji after the 5pm ET deadline, indicating they had chosen not to sign Musk’s pledge and depart the company, employees told CNN.\n\nTwitter’s remaining workforce had until 5 p.m. ET on Thursday to decide whether they wanted to be a part of the culture Musk wants to implement at the social media company, or else effectively resign, according to an email he sent to staff Wednesday.\n\nA former Twitter executive who recently exited the company described Thursday’s employee exits as a “mass exodus.”\n\nOn Thursday evening following the exits, employees remaining at the company received an email alerting them that the company’s offices will be temporarily closed and badge access will be restricted through Monday, according to a copy of the email obtained by CNN from a current Twitter employee. Musk’s team similarly shuttered offices during the mass layoffs earlier this month out of a concern for safety and an apparent fear that exiting employees could attempt to sabotage the company on their way out.\n\nTwo Twitter employees told CNN ahead of the deadline on Thursday that they planned to reject the ultimatum, citing a toxic work environment they say the billionaire has introduced. Another Twitter employee told CNN Wednesday they were still weighing the decision, saying the email from Musk “felt like a punch in the gut because no matter how you felt about wanting to stay or wanting to go, you were forced to make a decision and feel like you’re up against the time clock to make the best decision for you and your family.”\n\nThe employee added: “Those decisions are more than just 24 hours.”\n\nMusk told employees on Wednesday that his goal is to build “Twitter 2.0” and that employees who choose to stay will be required to commit to working “long hours at high intensity” and presumably agreeing to Musk’s demand for Twitter employees, who have been largely working remotely, to return to in-office work. As of midday Thursday, employees still did not have clarity on which remote-work exceptions would be granted if they decide to stay, one employee said.\n\nLater on Thursday, amid an apparent scramble by management to avoid losing too many workers to the ultimatum, Musk sent an email to staff attempting to clarify his position on remote work, according to text of the email obtained by CNN from a Twitter employee who asked not to be identified.\n\n“Regarding remote work, all that is required for approval is that your manager takes responsibility for ensuring that you are making an excellent contribution,” Musk said in the email, adding that workers would be expected to attend in-person meetings no less than once a month.\n\nTwenty minutes later, Musk sent a follow up email saying: “At risk of stating the obvious, any manager who falsely claims that someone reporting to them is doing excellent work or that a given role is essential, whether remote or not, will be exited from the company.”\n\nThe decision to issue an ultimatum came after Musk earlier this month fired half of Twitter’s staff, reducing its workforce to around 3,700 employees, and also reportedly cut many of Twitter’s contract workers. He also pushed out its top leadership and dissolved the board of directors. Musk also recently fired some employees for criticizing him in tweets or on internal Slack channels.\n\n“I don’t want to stick around to build a product that’s being poisoned from the inside and out,” said one of the employees who plans to reject the ultimatum, but requested anonymity to avoid putting the severance at risk. “Everyone has a price to a certain degree and this severance gives me some comfort into looking for a better environment in the time frame despite the economy.”\n\nThat employee said management now appears to have grown concerned about the number of people planning to depart and are “scrambling” to convince talent to stay. Twitter, which has reportedly eliminated most of its public relations team, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAnother Twitter employee, who asked not to be quoted, shared similar concerns and said they planned to also exit the company.\n\nA recently laid off employee who remains in touch with former coworkers told CNN that everyone they had spoken to plans to reject Musk’s ultimatum and exit the company. “People can’t overlook the public mockery and firing of other employees,” the former employee told CNN. “In the same vein, they can’t overlook or feel comfortable working for someone who has handled the last few weeks in the way Elon has.”\n\n“People don’t want to sacrifice their mental health and family lives to make the richest man in the world richer,” the former employee added.\n\nBut the decision may not be so easy for others. The ultimatum comes during a difficult period for the tech industry, following mass layoffs and hiring freeze announcements at many major firms including Meta, Amazon, Lyft and others. Employees working in the United States from other countries could also risk losing their work visas if they leave the company.\n\nA fourth employee told CNN Thursday they plan to stay at the company “because change is rarely influenced from the outside.”\n\nThe shakeup likely to come as a result of the ultimatum will be the last element of the “fundamental organizational restructuring” following Musk’s takeover, he told a Delaware court Wednesday during a trial over his Tesla pay package.\n\nMusk said in the Wednesday email that the “new Twitter” will be “much more engineering-driven,” leaving some non-engineering workers questioning whether their jobs could be at risk even if they opt to stay.\n\n“There’s no assurance in this, you’re just like, ‘I might be able to advocate for myself, I might not,’” the employee who expressed uncertainty about the decision said. “What’s behind this door? You don’t know. The only door you know that’s certain is the exit door.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy Oliver Darcy", "Clare Duffy", "Oliver Darcy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/30/business/musk-tweet-pelosi-conspiracy/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk tweets a conspiracy theory about attack on Paul Pelosi ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nElon Musk on Sunday gave credence to a fringe conspiracy theory about the violent attack on Paul Pelosi.\n\nThe new Twitter owner tweeted a link to an article full of baseless claims about Pelosi.

Daily case rates, though vastly undercounted, are the highest they’ve been in months, as are Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nData published this week by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that more than half of the country’s population lives in a county with a “high Covid-19 Community Level,” where the health care system is at risk of becoming overburdened and universal indoor masking is recommended.\n\n“The Public Health Emergency declaration continues to provide us with tools and authorities needed to respond to the highly transmissible COVID-19 subvariants that are currently circulating around the country,” a Biden administration official told CNN. “The PHE provides essential capabilities and flexibilities to hospitals to better care for patients, particularly if we were to see a significant increase in hospitalizations in the coming weeks.”\n\nIndeed, ensemble forecasts from the CDC published this week do predict that hospitalizations in the US will rise over the next month. It’s the first time in weeks that the forecasts have predicted an increase in hospitalizations, instead of a stable outlook.\n\n“Without the PHE in place, we would be limited in our ability to provide broad and equitable access to lifesaving treatments through our Test to Treat initiative, for example, which relies on flexibility for telehealth and operations,” the official said. “Not renewing the PHE would leave us with fewer tools to respond and mean more Americans would get severely ill and end up in the hospital.”\n\nThe public health emergency declaration allows many Americans to obtain free Covid-19 testing, therapeutic treatment and vaccines. Once it ends, people could face out-of-pocket costs depending on whether they are covered by Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance. But vaccinations would generally continue to be free for those covered by Medicare and private insurance, while state Medicaid programs would determine whether to continue covering vaccinations for their enrollees.\n\nAlso, Medicare has relaxed the rules governing telehealth so that many more beneficiaries can access such services during the declaration. Telehealth services are no longer limited just to those living in rural areas, and enrollees can conduct visits at home, rather than having to travel to a health care facility, and they receive a wider array of services via telehealth. These flexibilities will end for most beneficiaries after the emergency expires.\n\nAnd states are not involuntarily disenrolling residents from Medicaid during the declaration, in exchange for receiving more generous federal matching funds. As many as 14 million people could lose Medicaid coverage after the emergency ends, according to separate projections by Kaiser and the Urban Institute.\n\nPlus, many low-income families are receiving enhanced food stamp benefits thanks to the declaration, though some states have ended their own public health emergencies and stopped the beefed-up allotments.\n\nA separate emergency declaration allows for the emergency use authorization of testing, treatments and vaccines.

The cumulative hospitalization rate hasn’t been this high at this point in the season in more than a decade, according to the CDC.\n\nThe RSV hospitalization rate is 10 times higher than usual for this point in the season, too. Children are especially at risk: More than 8 out of every 1,000 infants under 6 months old and 4 out of every 1,000 infants between 6 months and 1 year have been hospitalized with RSV this season, CDC data shows.\n\nThis week, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association requested a formal emergency declaration from the federal government to support hospitals and communities amid an “alarming surge of pediatric respiratory illnesses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza, along with the continuing children’s mental health emergency.”\n\n“These unprecedented levels of RSV happening with growing flu rates, ongoing high numbers of children in mental health crisis and serious workforce shortages are combining to stretch pediatric care capacity at the hospital and community level to the breaking point. Due to these challenges, pediatric hospitals and pediatricians are being asked to support more care and higher levels of care than ever before,” the leaders of the organizations wrote in a letter to President Joe Biden and US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. “We need emergency funding support and flexibilities along the same lines of what was provided to respond to COVID surges.”\n\nPediatric hospitals have been more full than usual in recent months, HHS data shows. More than three-quarters of pediatric hospital beds are in use nationwide, up from an average of about two-thirds over the past two years.\n\n“Hospital systems, medical care facilities, STAT clinics, pediatricians’ offices, adult doctors’ offices are all feeling the stress of these respiratory viruses right now,” Dr. William Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said at a briefing held by the Infectious Diseases Society of America on Friday.\n\nIn the state of Washington, emergency rooms are in “crisis mode” and are “bordering, if not already in, disaster mode,” Dr. Tony Woodward, medical director of emergency medicine at Seattle Children’s Hospital, said this week.\n\n“Our ER is at 100 percent capacity at almost 24 hours a day and in the evening is up to 300 percent capacity, and what that means is, for patients who come for emergencies, [they] aren’t treated immediately,” Woodward said.\n\nDr. Rustin Morse, chief medical officer at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Ohio, said Tuesday that it has had to be “judicious” about patients to accept as transfers.\n\n“We are all seeing and being asked to accept patients far away, and we’ve had requests as far away as Virginia and Missouri,” Morse said. “And we’ve had to say no to those other hospitals in faraway states so that we can optimize our ability to care for patients inside the state of Ohio.”\n\nWhile RSV activity shows signs of slowing in the South, it’s still spreading nationwide, with nearly 1 in 5 PCR tests coming back positive. And flu activity continues to be highest in the South. Data from Walgreens tracking prescriptions for antivirals such as Tamiflu suggests hotspots centered in Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana, spreading from Houston and the Gulf Coast area up to Knoxville.\n\n“It’s one after the other after the other,” Dr. Tina Tan, a pediatrics professor at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine and vice president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said at Friday’s briefing. “RSV has already strained the hospital systems to capacity or over capacity. Now you have flu that is starting to surge in other areas where they’re trying to deal with the RSV surge, and you also have Covid that’s starting to increase. So it really is putting a major strain on hospital systems all across the United States.”\n\nThe US is in a different place this holiday season than it was in previous pandemic years, Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, told CNN on Thursday.\n\n“I’m hoping we’re not to see anything like the spike we saw in January, but we may very well still see a lot more infections in the weeks and months ahead,” Jha said. “The good news, though, is that we can gather safely, we can do all of these things, if people go ahead and get that updated bivalent vaccine that’s available, get treated if you have infection. We’re just in a very different place.”\n\nCDC data shows that less than 5% of the US population lives in a county that’s considered to have a “high” Covid-19 community level, a measure that captures community transmission and hospital capacity. But for the first time in weeks, CDC forecasts suggest that trends in new Covid-19 hospitalizations will rise in the coming weeks.\n\nWhile the Covid-19 emergency declaration remains in place, the federal government has not made a formal emergency declaration around children’s health care. HHS and the CDC are in regular contact with health care leaders and providers, actively monitoring situational needs and ready to provide assistance on a case-by-case basis, an HHS spokesperson told CNN.\n\nExperts encourage taking preventative measures to stay healthy during this unusual respiratory virus season.\n\n“We’ve learned some things from Covid. Masks work. Dust them off, bring them back out,” Schaffner said.\n\nThey also urge all those eligible to get their flu and Covid-19 vaccines, along with other routine vaccinations.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nRoutine vaccination rates fell during the Covid-19 pandemic and have not improved much. The situation is “pretty bad in the pediatric population, because vaccination rates in some age groups are still 50% less than what they were pre pandemic,” Tan said. So there are a lot of unprotected children out there that are at risk for coming down with vaccine preventable diseases.”\n\nChildren also lag in Covid-19 vaccination rates.

Cases have been identified in every state except Montana and Wyoming.\n\nThe declaration follows the World Health Organization announcement last month that monkeypox is a public health emergency of international concern. WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, as “an extraordinary event” that constitutes a “public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease” and “to potentially require a coordinated international response.”\n\nSome cities and states, including New York City, San Francisco, California, Illinois and New York, have already declared monkeypox an emergency, allowing them to free up funding and resources for their responses to the outbreak.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Joe Biden named Robert Fenton as the White House’s national monkeypox response coordinator. Fenton – a regional Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator who oversees Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada – will coordinate the federal government’s response to the outbreak.

The delay was in part out of concern that once those vaccines were taken out of bulk storage, they would lose years of shelf life.\n\nMonkeypox can infect anyone, but the majority of cases in the US outbreak have been among men who have sex with men, including gay and bisexual men and people who identify as transgender. Close contact with an infected individual is required for the spread of the monkeypox virus, experts say.\n\nThe CDC initially announced vaccines for monkeypox were being released from the Strategic National Stockpile and offered to the “high-risk” contacts of monkeypox patients, as well as the health care workers treating them. Federal health officials have since expanded vaccination efforts to focus on the broader community of men who have sex with men, the demographic that makes up most US monkeypox cases.\n\nIn addition to providing vaccines, the CDC has said since June it has made a concerted effort to do extensive education and outreach to the LGBTQ community.\n\nPossible change to how vaccine is administered\n\nHealth officials are considering changing the way monkeypox vaccine doses are administered because the country is “at a critical inflection point” with the virus’ spread, US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf told reporters on Thursday.\n\n“In recent days, it’s become clear to all of us that given the continued spread of the virus, we’re at a critical inflection point, dictating the need for additional solutions to address the rise in infection rates,” Califf said. “The goal has always been to vaccinate as many people as possible.”\n\nThe commissioner said officials are considering allowing health care providers to be able to use a dose-sharing method where one vial of Jynneos vaccine – previously used as one dose – will be used to administer up to five separate doses.\n\nThis approach would change the way Jynneos is administered, Califf said.

These flexibilities – while critical in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic – can also help address many of the challenges you face during the spread of non-COVID-19 illnesses, including RSV and flu,” the letter says. “They remain available to you and health care providers as you all make care available in response to flu, RSV, COVID-19, and other illnesses.”\n\nFor example, if a hospital has staffing shortages that have been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, it may use a waiver that would allow increased surge capacity or easier patient transfers – even if the patients need treatment for something other than Covid-19, such as flu or RSV.\n\nThe letter also highlights available funding, including $400 million from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prepare for and respond to public health threats each year, including flu and other respiratory diseases such as RSV, along with data, analysis and other planning resources put together by the federal government. It also notes that the federal government is monitoring the supply chain for critical drugs and devices and that federal health officials over the past month have been engaging with the nation’s governors through a meeting hosted by the National Governors Association.\n\n“As your federal partner, we stand ready to evaluate any request for federal medical assistance and support – including requests for medical personnel and equipment – working in close coordination with you and local jurisdictions to determine the needs and availability of matching resources,” Becerra wrote.\n\nFlu activity has been highest in the South, with hot spots spreading from El Paso to southwest Virginia. All but six states are experiencing “high” or “very high” respiratory virus levels, and seasonal flu activity remains “high and continues to increase,” according to the CDC.\n\nThere have been nearly 17 flu hospitalizations for every 100,000 people this season, rates typically seen in December or January. The cumulative hospitalization rate hasn’t been this high at this point in the season in more than a decade.\n\nThe latest surveillance data probably does not reflect the full effects of holiday gatherings, as it only captures through November 26, two days past Thanksgiving.\n\nWhile flu continues to ramp up, RSV has shown signs of slowing nationwide, but test positivity rates are still higher than they’ve been in years, and cumulative hospitalization rates are about 10 times higher than typical for this point in the season. Less than two months in, the RSV hospitalization rate this season is already nearing the total RSV hospitalization rate from the entire 2018-19 season.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThere is no vaccine for RSV, but health officials have urged people to get their flu shots and updated Covid-19 boosters heading into winter.

How do we know? Who gets to decide?\n\nPandemics don’t have hard edges. Knowing where they start or stop is a judgment call, and there isn’t a clear authority that gets to make that decision.\n\nEpidemiologists recognize a pandemic as a disease outbreak that happens in many countries at the same time and affects more people than an epidemic. Pandemics are often caused by new viruses or a strain of a virus that hasn’t circulated among humans in a long time. These events are impactful, often leading to large numbers of deaths, social disruptions and economic hardship.\n\n“I think we were all a little bit shocked when President Biden said what he said on ’60 Minutes,’ but I also think that in many ways, he was reflecting what many Americans already think and feel,” said J. Alex Navarro, assistant director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School.\n\nBut because a pandemic is a global event, no single country or leader can decide it’s over, he said.\n\n“Declaring a pandemic over is a little different than declaring a local epidemic over,” Navarro said. “To declare a pandemic over, you need to have various regions of the world having their epidemics over. So it looks a little bit different, I think.”\n\nThe world will probably have to reach an consensus, and that’s something that may come as a kind of acknowledgment from the World Health Organization – or it might not.\n\n“There’s not an official designation-holder,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Global Health Security. “WHO will acknowledge that we’re in a pandemic, but it’s not as if somebody calls it a pandemic and then says the pandemic is over.”\n\nPandemics vs. public health emergencies\n\nBiden’s comment doesn’t change how the US or other countries are responding to Covid-19. For now, it remains a public health emergency in the United States, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services, and it’s still a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, according to WHO.\n\nA PHEIC creates an agreement between countries to abide by WHO’s recommendations for managing the emergency. Each country, in turn, declares its own public health emergency – declarations that carry legal weight. Countries use them to marshal resources and waive rules in order to ease a crisis.\n\nWhen these designations are lifted, there will be changes that reverberate through governments and that reach individuals and families. In the United States, for example, the end of the public health emergency will have ramifications for health care coverage and cost-sharing of Covid-19 tests and treatments.\n\nSaying the pandemic is over might influence public perception, but it doesn’t materially change how the federal government or states are responding.\n\n“It’s separating out what is the formal legal definition versus what is just a popular discussion of saying, ‘hey, we kind of think this is over now, and hey, let’s move on,’ and there are implications for both,” said Rebecca Katz, who directs the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University.\n\nThe term “pandemic” carries a lot of weight. After they recognized the new coronavirus as a PHEIC in January 2020, it took WHO leaders more than a month to begin calling the situation a pandemic.\n\nIn March 2020, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was finally using the term because of the severity of the disease, how fast it was spreading and “alarming levels of inaction.”\n\n“WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock,” Tedros said. “We have therefore made the assessment that Covid-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.”\n\nIt was a shift in language that put the world on alert, but it came long after many public health experts had reached the same conclusion, and it didn’t change what WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or other international health agencies were doing to respond.\n\nAt this point, WHO is not saying whether it will recognize an end to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“WHO does not have a mechanism for declaring or ending a “pandemic,’ ” spokesman Tarik Jasarevik said in an email to CNN. Instead, he said, WHO will continue to assess the need for the public health emergency, and an expert committee meets every three months to do that.\n\nLast week, Tedros said the end of the pandemic “is in sight,” but he added that “we are not there yet.”\n\nAnd it’s not clear what “there” will look like.\n\n“That’s one of the challenges we have is, we don’t have a good definition of when the pandemic begins or when it ends,” said Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\nHow an earlier pandemic ended\n\nIn the modern era, there’s no real precedent for closing the curtains on a pandemic.\n\n“We’re really in some new territory here,” University of Michigan’s Navarro said.\n\nThe last pandemic that approached this scale was the 1918 influenza pandemic. Back then, there was no federal response. President Woodrow Wilson “really didn’t say anything on influenza as far as we know,” Navarro said, nor was he expected to.\n\n“The pandemic response was then much more state and local, and so, citizens residents looked to state and local health officers for their guidance,” Navarro said. That guidance was typically communicated through local newspapers, which were widely read.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDuring that pandemic, life mostly got back to normal after the devastating wave of fall illnesses in 1918.\n\nWith some exceptions, most mask orders, closures and social distancing orders were lifted by the beginning of 1919.\n\nBut waves of influenza continued until 1920, Navarro said. The United States continued to see cases and deaths, but “they did not consider that to be sort of an epidemic level.”\n\nPandemics can end when viruses mutate to become less deadly and people build up some immunity against them, Navarro said.\n\n“Eventually, we reach an equilibrium where we just sort of live with these microbes,” he said.\n\nWhether the world is there with Covid-19 still remains to be seen. Vaccines and treatments now offer some protection from severe disease and death, and cases are declining in most parts of the world.\n\nBut in the United States alone, there are still about 65,000 new cases reported daily, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, and an average of about 400 people die from Covid-19 every day.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/09/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/17/politics/covid-19-public-health-emergency/index.html", "title": "Covid-19 remains a public health emergency in US, administration ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Biden administration is continuing the Covid-19 public health emergency declaration beyond July 15, two administration officials told CNN, as coronavirus cases are rising again across the US.\n\nThe administration has repeatedly said it would give states 60 days’ notice if it were ending the declaration, which would have been Monday. But the deadline passed without notification.\n\nThe declaration is now expected to be renewed for up to another 90 days.\n\nReported cases of Covid-19 have more than doubled over the past month in the US overall and they’re technically trending up in all states, though three states are considered to be “steady.”\n\nThe public health emergency declaration allows many Americans to obtain free Covid-19 testing, therapeutic treatment and vaccines. Once it ends, people could face out-of-pocket costs depending on whether they are covered by Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance. But vaccinations would generally continue to be free for those covered by Medicare and private insurance, while state Medicaid programs would determine whether to continue covering vaccinations for their enrollees.\n\nAlso, Medicare has relaxed the rules governing telehealth so that many more beneficiaries can access such services during the declaration. Telehealth services are no longer limited just to those living in rural areas, and enrollees can conduct visits at home, rather than having to travel to a health care facility, and they receive a wider array of services via telehealth. These flexibilities will end for most beneficiaries after the emergency expires.\n\nAnd states are not involuntarily disenrolling residents from Medicaid during the declaration, in exchange for receiving more generous federal matching funds. As many as 14 million people could lose Medicaid coverage after the emergency ends, according to separate projections by Kaiser and the Urban Institute.\n\nPlus, many low-income families are receiving enhanced food stamp benefits thanks to the declaration, though some states have ended their own public health emergencies and stopped the beefed-up allotments.\n\nA separate emergency declaration allows for the emergency use authorization of testing, treatments and vaccines. Its end date will be determined by the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe administration is continuing the public health emergency as it seeks new funding from Congress for treatments and vaccines. The Senate reached a tentative bipartisan deal in early April to provide an additional $10 billion in Covid-19 assistance, less than half of what the White House originally had requested. It would allow the Biden administration to purchase more vaccines and therapeutics, as well as maintain testing capacity and research. But it does not include $5 billion in funding for global Covid-19 aid, nor would it replenish the program that pays for testing, treating and vaccinating the uninsured.\n\nHowever, the package has not moved forward amid divisions within Senate Democrats over whether to allow a vote on a contentious Trump-era pandemic restriction on the border.\n\nOn Tuesday, the administration announced that people can order a third round of free home Covid-19 tests from the federal government.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Kaitlan Collins Tami Luhby", "Kaitlan Collins", "Tami Luhby"], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/health/monkeypox-vaccination-strategy/index.html", "title": "Initial US monkeypox vaccination strategy was 'doomed to failure ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThere is growing concern that the United States may have lost its chance to contain the monkeypox virus, as the nation has been slow to vaccinate those most at risk on a broader scale.\n\n“I think we’re going to have to live with it until they vaccinate every high-risk person,” Dr. Robert Murphy, executive director of the Havey Institute for Global Health at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said this week.\n\nVaccinating against monkeypox has been a part of the Biden administration’s response to the global outbreak since the nation identified its first case of the disease in May, but supplies have been limited, even as demand for protection from the virus surges.\n\nAt first, officials at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that vaccines for monkeypox were being released from the Strategic National Stockpile and offered to the “high-risk” contacts of monkeypox patients, as well as the health-care workers treating them.\n\nVaccinating someone already exposed to monkeypox to help prevent illness is called post-exposure prophylaxis or a ring vaccination strategy. Vaccinating a patient’s close circle of contacts is like vaccinating a “ring” around them.\n\nThis approach has been used in response to sexually transmitted infections and prior monkeypox outbreaks.\n\n“We can have a really effective strategy of containment and elimination by identifying all the cases and then providing the cases with treatment and the close contacts of those cases with post-exposure prophylaxis,” said a federal health adviser who requested anonymity because they’re not a government employee and don’t speak for any federal agency.\n\n“We know that this works,” the adviser said. “We have data from other outbreaks to say that it is effective. And so in the beginning, when cases were low – in the tens, the dozens of cases – we were able to effectively work with jurisdictions to identify those cases and, through consultation, figure out how many doses of vaccines would they need to vaccinate as many contacts as they think existed.”\n\nBut toward late June, the monkeypox outbreak had spread.\n\nThe CDC’s initial strategy “was just doomed to failure,” Murphy said, referencing how a “ring” strategy requires swift and robust outreach to all known contacts of a monkeypox patient – which was becoming increasingly difficult to do as cases were growing, and in more places.\n\n“A ring vaccination strategy was never going to work, frankly,” Murphy said. “I mean, look how fast this virus has spread.”\n\nFederal health officials expanded vaccination efforts to focus on the broader community of men who have sex with men, the demographic that makes up most US monkeypox cases.\n\n“We recognized that a traditional post-exposure prophylaxis strategy was no longer the best strategy for that current moment of the outbreak – and so we shifted, along with the nation,” the federal health adviser said.\n\nAfter initial orders for 72,000 vaccines, 300,000 additional doses were made available. Another nearly 800,000 doses were OK’d this week, and will be available in the coming weeks. But the CDC estimates 1.5 million people are eligible for the two-dose vaccine.\n\nThe CDC’s strategy still directs shots toward people who might have had a monkeypox exposure – not preventing cases among those who might be exposed in the future.\n\nAs of Friday, the US has tallied nearly 5,200 confirmed or probable monkeypox cases. With limited supply and growing awareness of the virus and its painful effects, vaccination appointments are still going fast.\n\nLimitations of the ring strategy\n\nEven though the US response to the monkeypox outbreak has evolved, there are clear reasons why federal health officials would immediately consider a ring vaccination strategy early on.\n\n“That’s the way that we eradicated smallpox from the planet, and it was the way that prior monkeypox outbreaks have been controlled,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nBut Adalja and many other public health experts argue that a broader vaccination response against monkeypox should have been implemented from the beginning, as the ring strategy comes with a limitation: It hinges on robust contact tracing.\n\n“Because of the unique characteristics of this outbreak – the fact that it’s spreading mostly amongst men who have sex with men and has been kind of exploiting anonymous sex parties, raves and the like – it became quickly clear that contact tracing was going to miss a lot of contacts, especially if individual case patients didn’t even know the names of their contacts,” Adalja said.\n\n“It’s not that we don’t have the contact tracers. It’s that the individuals don’t know their contacts,” he said. “The contact trace data was not complete enough to be able to rely solely on ring vaccination.”\n\nFor ring vaccination to work, “there has to be enough vaccine, those in the ring need to be identified and vaccinated, and this has to be done quickly,” Dr. Tom Frieden, former CDC director and president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\n“Because many contacts of cases were from anonymous encounters, this makes ring vaccination much more challenging,” he wrote. “And because monkeypox is spread by intimate contact, identifying those who were close to the patients is much harder than for smallpox, both because of the sensitivity of this information, and because some of the contacts may have been anonymous.”\n\nCDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund told CNN that “ring vaccination can only be effective if all contacts of a case are identified and vaccinated.”\n\n“As the outbreak went on, it became clear that some of the cases were having anonymous close encounters, which fueled transmission. CDC then expanded our vaccination strategy,” she wrote in an email.\n\nThe federal health adviser said this is not unique to monkeypox.\n\n“Ring vaccination requires identification of cases and identification of contacts, and that is challenging no matter what disease it is. It’s challenging for Covid; it’s challenging for HIV; it’s challenging for syphilis,” the adviser said. “And so just because it’s challenging doesn’t mean we didn’t want to pursue this strategy.”\n\n‘We went against CDC’\n\nSome local health officials saw the writing on the wall early in the outbreak and never implemented a ring vaccination of just close contacts. Instead, vaccines have been offered to a broader group of higher-risk people from the beginning.\n\nIn the nation’s capital, the DC Department of Health has been closely tracking the spread of monkeypox virus since the spring, watching anxiously as cases emerged in regions of the world where the virus typically is not seen.\n\nWhen the first US case was reported in Massachusetts, DC health officials organized a team that was trained in identifying monkeypox and how it spreads. Around that time, the city also ordered vaccines.\n\n“I was one of the first to order vaccines from CDC, before we had a case,” said Anil Mangla, state epidemiologist for the DC Department of Health. The first potential monkeypox case in DC was reported in early June.\n\nAfter DC’s vaccine order arrived, shots were offered in late June in two rings. Ring one included the close contacts of cases identified by the epidemiology team. Ring two included any adult resident who was gay or bisexual with multiple anonymous partners in the previous two weeks or who was a transgender woman or nonbinary who has sex with men or sex workers or staff at establishments where sexual activity occurs.\n\nAmong the close contacts, “we actually have vaccinated 246 people in that first ring,” Mangla said Wednesday. “When I broaden that net, we have vaccinated – as of last night – 6,628.”\n\nHe added that if DC just focused on vaccinating the close contacts in ring one, those thousands of people who voluntarily got immunized in ring two would have received the vaccine much later during the outbreak.\n\n“We went against CDC,” Mangla said of the district’s broad two-ring vaccination approach, adding that the CDC is now working on projects with the DC Department of Health to better understand this outbreak response model.\n\nHowever, the monkeypox vaccine supply has not met the growing demand in DC – or in most regions across the country.\n\n“It’s very clear with the spread of this that there now has to be a balance between vaccines available for those who clearly have been exposed, as well as those at risk,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN this week. “What you want to do is a balance between vaccinating those who clearly have had an exposure, but go well beyond that.”\n\nThe public health community “is recognizing the tension between our desires and limited supply,” the federal health adviser said.\n\nWith limited supply, cities prioritize first doses\n\nOn Monday, the DC Department of Health announced that due to the “very limited” supply of vaccines, only first doses will be provided to high-risk residents, even though Jynneos is a two-dose vaccine. Second doses will be provided at a later time.\n\n“This decision is based on the available scientific evidence, the acceleration of the outbreak, the demand for vaccine from the high number of eligible people, and extreme shortages of the JYNNEOS Monkeypox vaccine nationally,” the announcement said. “DC Health is confident that additional vaccine doses will be available when needed for those who have received their first dose.”\n\nIn New York City, which also expanded eligibility for the monkeypox vaccine to any adult in a high-risk group, first doses have been prioritized.\n\n“New York City is the epicenter of the monkeypox outbreak in the U.S. and yet does not have sufficient vaccine supply,” the city announced in mid-July. “Given the rapid increase in cases, the Health Department has decided that providing first doses to offer protection to more at-risk New Yorkers is the best strategy until we receive adequate vaccine supply. This single dose strategy is consistent with the monkeypox vaccine distribution strategy taken in the UK and Canada.”\n\nChicago also is prioritizing first doses of vaccine.\n\nThe city announced that it is prioritizing doses for all known close contacts of monkeypox cases as part of a ring strategy, while offering vaccine to those who are gay, bisexual or trans men who have sex men and have had sexual contact with multiple partners, in a social or sexual venue or by giving or receiving money in exchange for sex.\n\nThese vaccines are being offered through doctors’ offices and clinics as well as pop-up events at venues, such as bathhouses and Pride events, according to the city’s announcement.\n\n“The goal is address equity along with maximizing doses administered,” Massimo Pacilli, the Chicago Public Health Department’s deputy commissioner of disease control, wrote in an email.\n\nMeanwhile, in a state that does not have many monkeypox cases or vaccines, the Connecticut Department of Public Health announced Thursday that it will launch a program to administer doses of vaccine starting Monday to any adult resident who is gay, bisexual, a man who has sex with men, transgender, gender nonconforming, or gender nonbinary and has had multiple or anonymous sex partners in the past 14 days. Connecticut has 28 probable or confirmed monkeypox cases.\n\n“This is a national model that has been developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and it is consistent with our neighboring jurisdictions,” Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Manisha Juthani said. “DPH is partnering with 15 community-based clinics to expand the availability and efficient delivery of the vaccine to those who need it the most.”\n\nA ‘rapidly closing’ window\n\nStill, questions remain around where the nation’s fight against monkeypox is heading.\n\n“It’s not clear that monkeypox can be contained at this point, but it’s certainly worth trying,” said Frieden, the former CDC director.\n\nFederal health officials remain optimistic that the nation can end the outbreak.\n\n“To the question, can we not only stay ahead of this virus but end this outbreak? Absolutely,” Becerra said Thursday.\n\n“We believe that we have done everything we can at the federal level to work with our state and local partners and communities affected to make sure we can stay ahead of this and end this outbreak, but everybody’s got to take the oar and row. Everybody’s got to do their part.”\n\nLawrence Gostin, faculty director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, said “the window for containing monkeypox is rapidly closing.”\n\n“I do think it’s still possible to contain, but it’s also equally possible that this may become endemic in the United States,” he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nEndemic means a disease has a constant presence in a population but is not affecting an alarmingly large number of people, as typically seen in a pandemic. As part of the current outbreak, the United States now has the highest case count of monkeypox among nonendemic countries.\n\nTo contain the monkeypox virus, Gostin called for the United States to declare a national public health emergency, raise awareness about the virus in non-stigmatizing ways and, of course, make more vaccine doses available.\n\nThe World Health Organization declared the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern last week. On the national level, HHS has yet to make such a determination.\n\n“We continue to monitor the response throughout the country on monkeypox,” Becerra said Thursday. “We will weigh the decision on declaring a public health emergency based on the response we’re seeing throughout the country.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/13/coronavirus-bill-house-nears-approval-free-tests-paid-sick-leave/5039259002/", "title": "Coronavirus: Trump backs economic relief deal reached with ...", "text": "Corrections and clarifications: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that one Democrat did not vote in favor of the bill.\n\nWASHINGTON — The House overwhelmingly passed legislation to provide economic relief to Americans affected by coronavirus after President Donald Trump said Friday he would support the sweeping measure.\n\nThe Families First Coronavirus Response Act was adopted 363-40 with every Democrat and most Republicans voting in favor of the measure.

Forster will extend his self-quarantine, which he had already placed himself into as a precautionary measure, for another two weeks,” the embassy said.\n\nThis makes Forster the third person who has tested positive that visited Trump's Florida resort.\n\nFabio Wajngarten, a senior adviser to Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro, tested positive for the novel coronavirus five days after he was among a group of officials who met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAdditionally, Trump Victory, a super PAC that supports the president, sent an email to supporters about a donor who was at Mar-A-Lago on Sunday who tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nWhen asked if he would be tested for coronavirus by reporters after these potential exposures, Trump said he \"most likely\" will be tested, despite not having symptoms.\n\n– Savannah Behrmann\n\nMnuchin signals deal on economic package\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin appeared to signal Friday that the White House is on board with a coronavirus response legislation announced earlier by House Democrats, despite some pushback from President Donald Trump.\n\n\"We have an agreement that reflects what the president talked about in his speech the other night,\" Mnuchin told Fox Business Network.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who spent days negotiating with Mnuchin, announced an agreement had been reached on an economic package to help Americans cope with the impact of the coronavirus.\n\nStocks soar after wild week:In rebound, Dow up 1,900 points as Trump frees up aid to fight coronavirus\n\nResponse to Trump Oval Office address:Airport chaos, anxious lawmakers, market plunge\n\nBut at a news conference earlier Friday where Trump announced a national emergency over the virus, the president suggested he had concerns about the progress of the talks with Democrats, and White House aides have so far declined to say whether they agree with Pelosi's assessment that a deal has been reached.\n\n\"We just don't think they’re giving enough,\" Trump said in his Rose Garden news conference. \"We don't think the Democrats are giving enough.\"\n\n– John Fritze\n\nTrump announces cruise lines suspending operations\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced that several major cruise lines – Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian and MSC – would suspend operations for 30 days beginning at midnight Friday at his request.\n\n“It is a great and important industry – it will be kept that way!” Trump said in a tweet.\n\nTrump’s request came after two companies – Princess Cruises and Viking Cruises – suspended operations Thursday for 60 days.\n\nPassengers of two Princess Cruises ships, Diamond Princess and Grand Princess, have been quarantined abroad. In the U.S., nearly 700 people contracted coronavirus after being quarantined on board the Diamond Princess and at least 21 people have tested positive after being on Grand Princess.\n\nThe leading trade group, Cruise Lines International Association, had proposed greater screening for passengers and to deny boarding for people at higher risk from the virus. But Vice President Mike Pence said during a news conference announcing federal efforts to corral the outbreak that more steps were expected from the industry.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTrump, lawmakers reach deal on coronavirus economic relief\n\nDemocratic congressional leaders and the Trump administration have reached a deal on an economic package to help Americans cope with the impact of the coronavirus, according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who spent days negotiating it with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.\n\nThe legislation would ensure sick leave for affected workers and include money for testing for Americans, including the uninsured. Trump and lawmakers have been under pressure to ease fears over the spread of the deadly coronavirus, which has halted many parts of public life, forced the closure of schools and pummeled financial markets.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has declared a national emergency, is expected to sign off on the deal shortly. And a vote in the House on the Families First Coronavirus Response Act could come within hours.\n\nThe legislation would:\n\nProvide two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave.\n\nExtend unemployment insurance to furloughed workers.\n\nBeef up food assistance for needy families, including seniors, students and food banks.\n\nIncrease Medicaid funding for local, state, tribal and territorial governments and health systems, to help cover response to the emergency which has claimed dozens of lives and infected hundreds across the country.\n\n“This legislation is about testing, testing, testing,” Pelosi, D-CA, said in a news release announcing the deal. “To stop the spread of the virus, we have secured free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured. We cannot fight coronavirus effectively unless everyone in our country who needs to be tested can get their test free of charge.”\n\n– Ledyard King and Christal Hayes\n\nTrump: I 'most likely' will be tested for coronavirus\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he would most likely be tested for coronavirus, though he said he had no symptoms of infection and offered no timeline for being tested.\n\nSpeaking at a Rose Garden news conference, Trump was pressed about his interactions with officials who have tested positive, including an official from Brazil who met with Trump recently at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago. At one point a reporter asked if Trump was being “selfish” for not taking a test and self-isolating himself. “I think I’ll do it anyway,” Trump responded. “We’re working on a schedule.”\n\n– John Fritze\n\nHelp for cruise companies and airlines\n\nPresident Trump said Friday he has waived all interest on federal student loans. He said the suspension would be in effect “until further notice.” Such a move could provide financial aid to workers experiencing reduced hours or layoffs.\n\nTrump also said that with oil historically inexpensive after a recent plunge in prices, he has ordered the Energy Department to buy “large quantities of crude oil” for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Such a move can help support prices for the beleaguered oil industry and ensure the nation has sufficient reserve stockpiles in the event of an international crisis. The strategic reserve has about 645 million barrels of oil.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude prices have fallen more than 30% the past 10 days on shrinking global demand.\n\nAnd Trump suggested the government could provide financial assistance to the ailing cruise line industry.\n\n“It’s an industry that’s very badly impacted because of what’s going on with the virus,” he said, adding that the administration would probably help the cruise industry and the airlines if they ask.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nTrump: 'I don't take responsibility at all' for testing shortages\n\nWhen asked if he is responsible for the delay in availability of coronavirus tests, President Donald Trump said: \"I don't take any responsibility at all.\"\n\n\"We were given a set of circumstances, given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time. It wasn't meant for this kind of an event, with the kind of numbers that we are talking about,\" Trump said.\n\n\"What we've done is redesign it very quickly,\" he added.\n\nThe president has repeatedly blamed the Obama administration for a rule that limited third-party laboratories from developing and running tests, but the rule was actually put in place under the Trump administration, according to an Associated Press fact check this month.\n\nNew coronavirus website:Trump announces that Google will launch site\n\nThe Trump administration reversed one of its own Food and Drug Administration policies that previously only authorized tests made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new regulation allows labs to develop coronavirus tests before the FDA reviews them.\n\nDraft FDA guidance considered during the Obama administration called for tighter regulation of lab tests, but that guidance, which didn't pertain to public health emergencies, never went into effect, according to the Associated Press.\n\n– Courtney Subramanian and John Fritze\n\nNo deal on economic relief package\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Friday there is no deal yet on an emergency package to respond to the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic and accused Democrats of reneging on negotiations.\n\n“We just don’t think they’re giving enough,” he said, but did not give specifics. “We thought we had something. All of a sudden, they didn’t agree to certain things they agreed to. … They’re not doing what’s right for the country.”\n\nTrump’s remarks in the Rose Garden came about an hour after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-CA, announced the House would move forward with a vote Friday on a sweeping package to confront the coronavirus.\n\nThe bill would include free testing for all Americans, including those uninsured, as well as two weeks of paid sick leave for those who have to skip work due to the virus. It would also included expanded food assistance, such as seniors’ meals, student lunches and food banks.\n\nNational emergency:What does Trump's emergency declaration for coronavirus mean?\n\nPelosi has spoken numerous times with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in an effort to reach a deal. One of the sticking points has been on the paid sick leave provisions.\n\nDrew Hamill, Pelosi's spokesman, tweeted that the House speaker and Mnuchin had their latest conversation during the news conference.\n\n– Ledyard King\n\nStocks welcome Trump's emergency declaration\n\nStocks recovered Friday following a brutal week of selling after President Donald Trump declared a national emergency to free up about $50 billion in federal aid to fight the fast-spreading coronavirus. The Dow Jones industrial average finished the day up 1,985 points, or 9.4%, a day after plunging 2,352 points, for its worst loss since its nearly 23% drop on Oct. 19, 1987.\n\n– David Brinkerhoff\n\nTrump shakes hands with executives\n\nPresident Donald Trump shook hands with an array of company executive who were invited to join him at his Rose Garden news conference to discuss the coronavirus response – despite repeated advice from his own public health experts against such contact.\n\nOnly one company official, Bruce Greenstein of the home healthcare provider LHC Group, moved his hand away from Trump’s outstretched hand and offered an elbow instead.\n\n“I like that. That's good,\" Trump said a bit awkwardly after elbow-bumping Greenstein.\n\n'I’m not concerned at all':Trump says he's not worried as coronavirus arrives in DC area\n\nTrump himself may have been exposed to the virus; he had contact with Fabio Wajngarten, the communications secretary for Brazil's president, who has tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nWajngarten was in Florida last weekend at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, and he posted a photo of himself standing next to the American leader.\n\nTrump has said publicly that he's \"not concerned\" about the potential exposure, and the White House has said there's no reason for him to be tested.\n\n\"I don't have any of the symptoms,\" Trump said.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nAzar given broad authority to waive hospital regulations\n\nPresident Donald Trump said the emergency declaration would give broad authority for Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to waive provisions of laws and regulations to give doctors and hospital \"maximum flexibility to respond to the virus.\"\n\nUnder the declaration, Azar can:\n\nWaive laws to enable telehealth services\n\nAllow remote doctor visits and hospital check-ins\n\nWaive certain federal licensing requirements so doctors from other states can provide services\n\nWaive requirements limiting hospitals to 25 beds or a stay of 96 hours\n\nAllowing hospitals to bring additional physicians on board and obtain additional office space\n\nWaive rules that restrict hospital care of patients within the hospital itself\n\n-- Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump: 'This will pass'\n\nPresident Donald Trump, whose administration has been criticized heavily over a shortage of tests for coronavirus, promised to increase the number of tests but said administering them to everyone was not necessary.\n\n\"Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and to help all Americans who have been impacted by this,\" Trump said. \"Again, we don't want everybody taking this test. It's totally unnecessary. And this will pass. This will pass through and we're going to be stronger for it.\"\n\n– Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump’s emergency declaration will come with more than just money\n\nThe most significant element of President Donald Trump’s emergency declaration will be federal disaster aid. Trump said up to $50 billion would be made available. Democrats and the Federal Emergency Management Agency had earlier estimated the number to be closer to $40 billion.\n\nBut it’s not just money. Trump said his order would waive several key regulations. Among them:\n\nThe order would waive rules so that telehealth can be more easily accessed, providing care in ways that will not require patients to come into a doctor’s office.\n\nThe order would waive rules limiting the number of beds and length of stays in hospitals.\n\nThe the order would waive rules about which parts of a hospital can treat patients, a move designed to deal with capacity and space if a large number of patients show up seeking care.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nTrump announces drive-through testing\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced plans to partner with pharmaceutical and retail companies to set up drive-through test sites for coronavirus in an effort to catch up to a nationwide demand and deliver on the administration's promise for wider access to testing.\n\nHe met with company executives Friday to discuss expanding access to testing through drive-through testing.\n\n\"The goal is for individuals to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car,\" he said in a Rose Garden news conference.\n\nBy allowing people to remain in their car, health officials say it limits the chance for exposure. Trump said the administration is working with Google to create a web portal to direct people to those locations.\n\nThe administration has faced mounting pressure from lawmakers to increase testing access as the coronavirus pandemic continues to intensify, prompting travel restrictions, school closures, suspension of professional sports leagues and market turmoil. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, admitted to lawmakers on Capitol Hill Wednesday that limited access to testing was \"a failing.\"\n\nNew Rochelle, a New York City suburb, became the first on the East Coast to open a drive-through testing facility Friday after it was designated a coronavirus containment zone following a recent outbreak.\n\n– Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump announces emergency declaration\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared a national emergency Friday to free up billions of dollars to combat the coronavirus as he sought to persuade anxious Americans and battered financial markets that he was responding forcefully to the crisis.\n\n\"I am officially declaring a national emergency. Two very big words,\" Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden. As the outbreak has shuttered schools, sporting events and even Broadway, Trump has come under intense criticism for his handling of the pandemic, including an Oval Office address he delivered Wednesday that was marred by factual errors. Medical experts say there’s an acute shortage of coronavirus testing kits, the number of infections has soared and Wall Street suffered its worst day Thursday since the financial crash of 1987.\n\n”The action I’m taking will open access up to $50 billion for states in our shared fight against his disease,” Trump said, adding that he was ordering every state to open emergency operation centers.\n\n\"This will pass,\" Trump said of the outbreak. \"We’ll be even stronger for it We’ve learned a lot.”\n\nThe emergency declaration comes as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been negotiating with Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill on legislation to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus. About an hour before the president delivered his remarks, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House would move forward with a vote Friday on a sweeping package to confront the coronavirus.\n\nThe bill would include free testing for all Americans, including those uninsured, as well as two weeks of paid sick leave who have to skip work due to the virus. It would also include expanded food assistance, such as seniors’ meals, student lunches and food banks.\n\n– John Fritze, Ledyard King and Nicholas Wu\n\nPelosi: House to vote on relief package\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would move forward with a vote Friday on a sweeping package to confront the coronavirus.\n\nThe bill would include free virus testing for all Americans, including the uninsured, as well as two weeks of paid sick leave for those who have to skip work due to the virus. It would also included expanded federal food assistance, such as seniors’ meals, student lunches and food banks.\n\n\"The three most important parts of this bill are: testing, testing, testing,” she said in her televised remarks at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nPelosi has been in constant communication with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who is leading negotiations for the Trump administration.\n\nHer remarks came amid reports that President Donald Trump is expected to declare a national emergency Friday over the coronavirus outbreak, a move that would enable federal officials to direct billions of dollars in federal disaster money to responders fighting the virus.\n\nThe pandemic has killed dozens in the U.S., canceled major sporting events, limited commercial travel, roiled stock markets and transformed everyday life around the globe.\n\n– Ledyard King and Nicholas Wu\n\nTrump to declare national emergency\n\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to declare a national emergency Friday over the coronavirus outbreak, a move that would enable federal officials to direct billions of dollars in disaster money to responders fighting the virus, according to a senior administration official.\n\nThe declaration would be among a series of steps the administration is taking to try to boost the confidence of the American public and the financial markets in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTrump, who is scheduled to hold a news conference at 3 p.m. EDT, has been heavily criticized for the administration's response, including problems rolling out test kits for the virus and an Oval Office speech he delivered Wednesday that exacerbated huge losses on Wall Street. Investors were shaken by misstatements in the speech and what many saw as the lack of a broader strategy to address the crisis.\n\nAt the 3 p.m. news conference, Trump is also expected to weigh in on a relief package negotiated between Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that would provide paid sick leave to workers, among other steps to blunt the impact on the economy of virus-related disruptions.\n\nThe national emergency is expected to be declared under the 1988 Stafford Act, which authorizes federal assistance to local governments, usually for natural disasters. The Stafford Act is one several laws in a president's extensive emergency powers toolkit. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency over the virus in late January. That step made it easier for states to redirect staff responding to the virus.\n\nThe nation's Disaster Relief Fund has a balance of about $42 billion, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nDebt relief, airline help under consideration, Mnuchin says\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said debt relief for student loans and help for the hard-hit airline industry are under consideration for the next coronavirus rescue package. Speaking to CNBC as a deal was imminent on a separate, near-term package that includes paid emergency leave, Mnuchin said President Donald Trump has no intention of closing financial markets.\n\nMnuchin also said:\n\nCongress and the administration have \"100 things on our list” for the next possible package, and added “The president wants a stimulus package.\"\n\nFinancial authorities are ready to provide liquidity to parts of the economy taking a hit from shutdowns.\n\nA “big rebound” in economic activity could come by the end of the year, drawing a contrast with the Great Recession that began after the 2008 market meltdown.\n\n\"This is not like financial crisis where people don't know when this will end. ... By the end of the year, we're going to expect we're going to have a big rebound in economic activity,\" he said.\n\nAsked about suspending student debt of three months, Mnuchin said: \"That's on our list of 50 different items we're bringing to the president for a decision.\" He added: “We're like in the second inning of getting things done. We'll be passing more legislation.\"\n\nHe’s spoken to the airlines: \"That is the next priority on my list,\" Mnuchin said while also mentioning hotels, the cruise industry and small businesses.\n\nTariff rollbacks are not under consideration by Trump.\n\nLouisiana will delay presidential primary\n\nLouisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin announced Friday he has requested to delay the state's presidential primary for two months due to concerns over the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe presidential primary was slated for April 4, but will be moved to June 20.\n\n2020 race::How coronavirus is changing the 2020 presidential campaign for Trump, Biden and Sanders\n\nArdoin, during a press conference, said there are provisions in place that allow for the delay of primaries and early voting in “declared states of emergency\" as a way to \"protect the integrity of the electoral process”\n\n“Today I have certified that the state of emergency exists and requested that the government issue an executive order postponing the elections this spring,” he said.\n\nAccording to the Monroe, La., News Star, Gov. John Bel Edwards will grant the delay.\n\nLouisiana is the only state that has announced it will delay its primaries due to coronavirus.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign released a statement in response to Louisiana’s primary delay, saying that “our elections can be conducted safely in consultation with public health officials.”\n\n“Voting is at the very heart of who we are as a democracy,” Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said in a statement. “If voters are feeling healthy, not exhibiting symptoms, and don’t believe they've been exposed to COVID-19, please vote on Tuesday.”\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nG-7 leaders will hold virtual summit to discuss coronavirus\n\nPresident Donald Trump and six other world leaders will hold a virtual summit Monday to coordinate a global response to the coronavirus, French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday.\n\nThe videoconference of G-7 leaders will focus on research efforts to find a vaccine, as well as an economic response to the crisis, which has rocked global markets and sparked fears of a recession.\n\nFollowing a call with Trump, “we agreed to organize an extraordinary Leaders Summit by video conference on Monday on Covid-19,” Macron announced on Twitter.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nTrump to hold press conference on coronavirus\n\nPresident Donald Trump will speak on the coronavirus on Friday, he announced on Twitter.\n\nTrump said he would hold a press conference at 3 p.m. EDT. It comes as the White House is negotiating with House Democrats on a bill intended to limit the economic impact of the virus, and as the administration is scrambling to increase the number of coronavirus tests available to the public.\n\nTrump has significantly ramped up the number of times he has taken questions in a press conference setting since the coronavirus spread to the U.S. He has twice appeared in the briefing room to take questions on his administration’s response. He appeared in the briefing room again earlier this week but did not take questions.\n\nThe president otherwise has a relatively light public schedule, though the White House official schedule rarely reflects the totality of the president’s activities. Other than the press conference, Trump is expected to meet with “industry executives” on the virus at 1:30 p.m. EDT.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nMnuchin: coronavirus response deal ‘very close’\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin sounded a positive note Friday morning, saying a deal on a coronavirus response package with Congress was imminent.\n\n“We’re very close to getting this done,” he told CNBC.\n\nMnuchin has been the lead negotiator for the White House on the deal, speaking frequently with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., over the past 24 hours.\n\nPelosi said the deal, which is expected to provide free coronavirus testing, paid emergency leave and increased unemployment coverage, is expected to come to the House floor for a vote Friday.\n\nDespite Mnuchin’s optimism about a sweeping deal, he also echoed health officials’ warnings of a worsening situation.\n\n“People should understand the numbers (of infections) are going to go up before they go down,” he said\n\nMnuchin said after this deal is reached, he expects the administration will come back to Congress in the coming weeks for a package of economic stimulus measures (Trump has been pushing for a payroll tax cut) which he predicted would lift the country.\n\n“We will get through this and the economy will be stronger than ever when we get through this,” he said. “By the end of the year, we’re going to have a big rebound in economic activity.”\n\n– Ledyard King\n\nTrump knocks Fed, repeats call for payroll tax cuts\n\nPresident Donald Trump lashed out at Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell to lower rates after repeating his call for Congress to include a payroll tax cut in a sweeping, multibillion-dollar package in response to the growing coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve must FINALLY lower the Fed Rate to something comparable to their competitor Central Banks.\" Trump wrote Friday. \"Jay Powell and group are putting us at a decided economic & physiological disadvantage. Should never have been this way. Also, STIMULATE!\"\n\nTrump also renewed calls for a payroll tax cut holiday on Friday as House Democrats and administration officials signaled they were close to reaching a deal.\n\n\"If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly & efficiently, let them have the full money that they earned, APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year, December 31,\" Trump tweeted. \"Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!\"\n\nDemocrats dismissed the proposal of payroll tax cuts, which are taken from workers' paychecks to fund Social Security and Medicare. The president has particularly failed to shore up support among Senate Republicans.\n\nHe first pitched the idea to Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill Monday and again proposed it during an Oval Office address to the nation Wednesday\n\n– Courtney Subramanian\n\nHouse may vote on coronavirus response Friday\n\nThe House appears close to approving a massive federal response to confront the intensifying coronavirus pandemic that has killed dozens across the U.S., roiled financial markets and disrupted the lives of millions of Americans.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi late Thursday said congressional leaders and the White House were close to finalizing a deal on a sweeping, multibillion-dollar package that would guarantee free testing for all Americans – including the uninsured – and expand worker protections such as sick leave and unemployment insurance.\n\nFinal details of the sweeping package could be unveiled by late Friday morning, with a vote by the full House possibly later in the day, Pelosi said.\n\nCoronavirus questions:You asked us tons of questions about the coronavirus. We're answering them.\n\n“Time is of the essence, and this bill must be passed and sent to the Senate,” she said in a statement issued late Thursday. “The House will then get to work on a third emergency response package that will take further effective action that protects the health, economic security and well-being of the American people.”\n\nAccording to a press release from Pelosi, the measure would:\n\nMandate free testing “for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured.\"\n\nSet aside up to 14 days of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave for workers affected by the coronavirus contamination.\n\nExpand unemployment benefits to workers sent home due to the crisis.\n\nEnsure availability of food assistance such as SNAP, student meals, seniors’ nutrition and food banks. Democrats were able to place a temporary hold on work requirements under SNAP during the public health crisis.\n\nProvide federal Medicaid funds to help states defray costs associated with the crisis.\n\nEven if it passes Friday and gets taken up by the Senate early next week, enacting all the measures will take time.\n\nMarch sadness:NCAA cancels men's and women's basketball tournament due to coronavirus concerns\n\nThe tremendous shortage of fully complete test kits, for example, means access remains a major hurdle even if the cost of the procedure is covered by private insurers or the government.\n\nStill, the deal would represent a major breakthrough and a shot of confidence intended to calm rattled markets and anxious Americans.\n\nPelosi, who had several conversations throughout Thursday with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, told reporters outside her office Thursday night that both sides have “resolved most of our differences” and the remaining issues can be settled in future bills.\n\nPelosi said she was particularly stunned by the sudden cratering of the financial markets, which have nosedived in recent weeks and deepened worries about a possible recession due to the rapidly spreading virus.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 entered a bear market for the first time since the financial crisis, and the Dow endured its biggest one-day percentage drop since the 1987 crash.\n\n“That was very shocking,” Pelosi said of the markets. “I'm not going to go into that because what we're trying to do is be a positive.\"\n\nPositive test:Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's wife, tests positive for coronavirus\n\nThe aggressive approach comes a day after Trump announced a suspension of all air travel from the European Union to the U.S. for 30 days, starting midnight Friday.\n\nThe bill is being considered a week after Congress passed an $8.3 billion package that includes more than $3 billion for research and the development of vaccines and $2.2 billion that will help in prevention, preparedness and response. It also allocates $1 billion for state and local response, about half of which would go to specific cities. Each state would receive no less than $4 million.\n\nTrump signed the bill last Friday.\n\nTed Cruz extends his self-quarantine\n\nPhoning into \"CBS This Morning\" from a self-imposed quarantine, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he would extend his self-quarantine after learning he came into contact with another individual who tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nCruz, who self-quarantined earlier this month after interacting with a person at the Conservative Political Action Conference who later tested positive, told CBS he would self-quarantine until March 17. The Texas Republican said he had \"no symptoms\" but had interacted with a \"second individual who has tested positive – a Spanish government official who came to my office in D.C.\"\n\n\"On March 3 I had a meeting in the conference room with him for about 20 minutes,\" Cruz said, noting he had not been tested for the virus because he had no symptoms.\n\nCruz and two other Republican lawmakers quarantined themselves after coming into contact with an infected individual at CPAC in National Harbor, Maryland. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz, Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have also self-quarantined.\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nTrump attacks CDC amid coronavirus\n\nFacing pressure for his own administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump is increasingly slamming the efforts under his predecessor to prepare for an outbreak – often with dubious claims.\n\nTrump started his latest attack on President Barack Obama with a tweet late Thursday that repeated a narrative that has increasingly cropped among his supporters: That Obama “took 6 months” to declare a national emergency to respond to the 2009 Swine Flu outbreak.\n\nThe claim overlooks the fact that Obama, just like Trump, declared a public health emergency early in the swine flu outbreak. That designation from Obama came in April 2009, before the H1N1 virus was declared a pandemic and at a time when there were only 20 cases in the U.S.\n\nFor the coronavirus, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency in January.\n\nA public health emergency is different – and less significant – than a national emergency. Obama declared a national emergency about six months into the swine flu outbreak. Trump has yet to declare a national emergency for coronavirus.\n\nTrump continued the attack on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a tweet early Friday morning.\n\n“For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied, its testing system, but did nothing about it,” Trump claimed. “President Obama made changes that only complicated things further.”\n\nThe Trump administration has been under enormous pressure, including from governors and members of his own party, to speed up the distribution of coronavirus tests. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged Thursday that the testing system is “failing.”\n\nBut it’s not accurate that an Obama-era rule limited third-party laboratories from developing and running tests for the coronavirus during an emergency, according to an Associated Press fact check this month.\n\nThe Trump administration reversed a policy that its own Food and Drug Administration put in place, the Associated Press said. That new regulation allows labs to develop coronavirus tests before the agency reviews them. Previously, the FDA only authorized tests made by the CDC.\n\nDraft FDA guidance considered during the Obama administration called for tighter regulation of laboratory tests but that guidance, which did not pertain to public health emergencies, never went into effect, the Associated Press said.\n\n– John Fritze and Christal Hayes", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/28/health/holidays-bad-flu-season-worse/index.html", "title": "Flu season continues to intensify in the US, and holiday gatherings ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAmericans gathered for Thanksgiving last week amid a flu season that’s worse than any has been in more than a decade, and experts continue to urge caution as multiple respiratory viruses circulate at high levels nationwide.\n\nA growing number of US states – now 33 – are experiencing “high” or “very high” respiratory virus activity, and seasonal flu activity continues to be “elevated across the country,” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn the week ending November 19, nearly 1 in 10 deaths nationwide (9.4%) was due to pneumonia, influenza or Covid-19 – well above the seasonal baseline of about 6%. And the CDC estimates that there have been at least 6.2 million illnesses, 53,000 hospitalizations and 2,900 deaths from influenza this season.\n\nFlu and RSV, another respiratory virus that especially affects children, have hit harder and earlier than usual this season after the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the past two seasons and as the nation eases back on prevention measures.\n\nWhile flu continues to ramp up, RSV has shown signs of slowing nationwide, but test positivity rates are still higher than they’ve been in years, and cumulative hospitalization rates are about 10 times higher than typical for this point in the season. Less than two months in, the RSV hospitalization rate this season is already nearing the total RSV hospitalization rate from the entire 2018-19 season.\n\nThousands of people are still dying from Covid-19 each week, too.\n\nThe latest surveillance data does not capture Thanksgiving week or the effects of holiday gatherings. Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths reached record high levels during last year’s holiday season – and this holiday season could also bring a rise in spread.\n\nAlthough experts expect this year to be better than the last, they stressed the importance of preventive measures in the days leading up to Thanksgiving to help prevent the spread of all respiratory illnesses.\n\n“We have seen, in some regions, RSV numbers starting to trend downward. Flu numbers are still on the rise. And we are concerned that after holiday gathering, lots of people coming together, that we may see increases in Covid-19 cases as well,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said last week on CNN. “It’s all in a summary to say do everything you can to prevent it by getting your vaccines.”\n\nCDC data shows that just 12% of eligible people in the US have gotten their updated Covid-19 booster, and about 1 in 5 people nationwide is still completely unvaccinated. Flu shots are lagging, too, with millions fewer vaccinations at this point in the season than in the past two years.\n\nThere is no vaccine to protect against RSV, however, and children’s hospitals remain more full than usual despite improving trends in virus spread.\n\nPediatric hospital beds have been more full than usual for months. Children’s health leaders called this month for a formal emergency declaration from the federal government to support hospitals and communities amid an “alarming surge of pediatric respiratory illnesses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza, along with the continuing children’s mental health emergency.”\n\nWith the holiday season – and flu season – underway, Dr. Anthony Fauci warned of the potential for an emergency situation.\n\n“When you have very little wiggle room of intensive care beds, when you have like almost all the intensive care beds that are occupied, it’s bad for the children who have RSV and need intensive care. But it also occupies all the beds, and children who have a number of other diseases that require intensive care or ICU, they don’t have the bed for it,” Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “So if you get to that situation, that’s approaching an emergency.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nStill, Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said he is confident that the US will get through the surge of respiratory viruses.\n\n“In terms of hospital capacity, we have been in touch with every jurisdiction around the country. We have been very clear, if you need extra help, the federal government is ready to help, ready to send in support staff, ready to support, send in additional supplies,” Jha said on CNN last week. “I am confident we’re going to get through this, particularly if people step up and protect their families by getting the Covid and flu vaccine.”", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/30/us/jackson-water-system-failing-tuesday/index.html", "title": "Jackson, Mississippi, water: The water crisis has gotten so bad, the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRecent torrential rain coupled with years of water system issues have resulted in a crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, where the city doesn’t have enough water to fight fires, flush toilets or even hand out to residents in need.\n\nJackson’s main water treatment facility began failing Monday, according to Gov. Tate Reeves. The National Guard was called up to help distribute bottled water as crews work to get the water treatment plant back online, state officials said.\n\nBut the distribution itself proved unsustainable. Residents of all ages were seen waiting in lines more than a mile long at Hawkins Field Airport for at least two hours Tuesday for just one case of bottled water. The event was supposed to span three hours, but barely ran two as people were eventually turned away when the 700 cases of water ran out.\n\n“I keep saying we’re going to be the next Michigan,” said Jeraldine Watts, 86, who was able to get water at a grocery store Monday night. “And it looks like that’s exactly what we’re headed for.”\n\nWatts was referring to the water crisis in the city of Flint, which has battled water issues since a 2014 water crisis in which lead-contaminated water fed to residents’ faucets.\n\nPeople line up for water in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 30, 2022. CNN\n\nJackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba told CNN’s Pamela Brown the city is working on more water distribution events. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency will provide nearly 30 water trucks to help supplement the city events, the mayor said.\n\n“I have been assured by MEMA that they will supplement those locations with about 28 tanker trucks distributed at various points across the city,” Lumumba told CNN.\n\nExplanations for Jackson’s failing system are complicated: Damage this summer to pumps at the main water treatment facility made failure increasingly likely as the summer progressed, the governor said; and flooding of the Pearl River after heavy rains last week affected treatment processes and therefore the amount of running water the system can provide, Lumumba said.\n\nThis week’s troubles come as the water system has been plagued with problems for years and with the city already under a boil water notice since late July for what the state called a water-quality issue.\n\nThe state is “surging our resources to the city’s water treatment facility and beginning emergency maintenance, repairs and improvements,” Gov. Reeves said. “We will do everything in our power to restore water pressure and get water flowing back to the people of Jackson.”\n\nWater for those in the state’s most populous city would have to be provided “for an unknown period of time,” Reeves said.\n\nThe water shortage is expected to last “the next couple of days,” according to the mayor’s office.\n\nLumumba also announced Monday the city’s public works director – a role that oversees the water treatment facilities – has been reassigned. Marlin King will instead serve as deputy director and Jordan Hillman, the city’s planning and development director, will be the interim public works director, according to Melissa Payne, the mayor’s spokesperson.\n\nKing did not respond to CNN requests for comment. Payne said King’s reassignment “is part of restructuring” and is not a result of the current water crisis.\n\nResidents say faucet water is discolored\n\nState Rep. Ronnie Crudup Jr. said he didn’t have running water Monday, but on Tuesday, discolored water came out of his faucet that he used to flush the toilet. He and his family used bottled water Tuesday morning to brush their teeth, Crudup told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota.\n\nCrudup said that although the city has experienced water issues in the past, rain played a part in the current water emergency.\n\n“It’s been building up for years, but we have had an unprecedented amount of rain in the last two to three weeks, and it just kind of created this havoc, what we are dealing with right now,” he said.\n\nJackson resident Daryl Page told CNN he’s been searching for clean, bottled water since the city’s been under a boil water notice “for a whole month.” He was driving to a distribution site, but as he arrived, he noticed there was nothing there.\n\nFirefighters and recruits for the Jackson Fire Department carry cases of bottled water to residents vehicles, August 18, 2022, as part of the city's response to longstanding water system problems. Rogelio V. Solis/AP\n\n“Everyone is turning around because there is nothing here,” Page said, adding that his next plan of action was to drive to another site in hopes that he could find cases of water there.\n\nBecause of Monday’s failure, officials announced all Jackson public schools will shift to virtual learning Tuesday.\n\nHospitals are also feeling the strain. Jackson’s University of Mississippi Medical Center released a statement Tuesday saying the Jackson Medical Mall air conditioning is not functioning properly “because the water pressure feeding its chillers is too low.” Portable restrooms are being used in locations experiencing low water pressure, the statement said.\n\nThe university medical center statement also said a fire watch was declared for its Jackson-based facilities, “because fire suppression systems are fed by the city water system. Low pressure in the systems may cause them to be less effective.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on the water crisis in Jackson and the White House has been “in regular contact with state and local officials, including Mayor Lumumba, and made clear that the Federal Government stands ready to offer assistance,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“(The Federal Emergency Management Agency) is working closely with the state officials to identify needs, and the EPA is coordinating with industry partners to expedite delivery of critical treatment equipment for emergency repairs at the City of Jackson water treatment facilities,” she said.\n\nIn an emailed statement Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency said “ensuring all people have access to healthy and safe water is a top priority.”\n\n“We are in communication with officials in Mississippi and stand ready to provide support should the State request federal assistance,” the EPA statement read. “In the interim, we are available to provide technical support and information to Mississippi officials as they navigate their plan to address the immediate concerns at the O.B. Curtis Water Plant.”\n\nLater Tuesday, the governor said FEMA has received the state’s declaration asking the federal government to declare the water shortage a federal emergency.\n\nWater system issues go back decades, mayor says\n\nThe problem this week stems from one of two water treatment facilities in the city: the O.B. Curtis plant, which is run by the city of Jackson, according to the governor.\n\nThe main pumps at O.B. Curtis were severely damaged recently, and the facility began operating on smaller backup pumps about a month ago, around the time the latest boil water notice began in July, the governor said, without elaborating about the damage.\n\nThe governor said he was told Friday that “it was a near-certainty that Jackson would fail to produce running water sometime in the next several weeks or months if something did not materially improve,” the governor said.\n\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant in Jackson, Mississippi, seen on March 24, 2022. Mark Felix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut Lumumba said during a Monday news conference that it was only a matter time before the water system failed because Jackson’s water system has been faced serious issues for years.\n\n“I have said on multiple occasions that it’s not a matter of ‘if’ our system would fail, but a matter of ‘when’ our system would fail,” the mayor said, adding that the city has been “going at it alone for the better part of two years” when it comes to the water crisis.\n\nIn early 2020, the water system failed an Environmental Protection Agency inspection. The agency wrote the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites, based on observations of the water’s turbidity, or cloudiness, as well as “disinfection treatment concerns, and/or the condition of the distribution system.”\n\nIn March 2020, the EPA issued an order requiring the city to develop a plan to replace and repair monitoring and treatment equipment, to “address dosing processes for disinfection and pH control” and to take more coliform bacteria samples, among other things.\n\nThe city also has endured weather-related shutdowns.\n\nIn February 2021, a winter storm shut down Jackson’s entire water system, leaving tens of thousands of residents without water for a month amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Residents have been under some sort of boil water notice or advisory several times since that storm, including the state-ordered notice posted in July.\n\n“We were here two Februarys ago when we had system failures, and the world was watching us and the world is watching us again,” Lumumba said during Monday’s news conference.\n\nThe mayor also pointed to recent flooding from the Pearl River as an event that triggered the latest water pressure issues.\n\nBecause O.B. Curtis received additional water from the reservoir during the flooding from last week to this week, the facility had to change the way it treats the water, which has led to the reduction of water being put out into the system and reduced tank levels. This is affecting the water pressure at residents’ homes, he said.\n\n“As one crisis may be diverted, another one rears its head,” Lumumba said Monday during a news conference after addressing the flooding in the city.\n\nO.B. Curtis is meant to provide about 50 million gallons for the city daily. The other plant, which usually provides about 20 million gallons daily, has been approved to ramp up its output amid the shortage, authorities said.\n\nIn July 2021, the EPA and the city entered into an agreement to address “long-term challenges and make needed improvements to the drinking water system.” The EPA recently announced $74.9 million in federal water and sewer infrastructure funds for Mississippi, mentioning Jackson without naming specific projects.\n\nHowever, Lumumba has said it would take $2 billion to fully repair and replace the dated system, which city, state and federal officials say also has too much lead in its water in some places.\n\nLumumba declared a water system emergency Monday. The proclamation noted not only the flooding but also numerous previous “unsuccessful attempts to rectify water system issues.”\n\nCNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\nAs for restoring water pressure and flow and performing emergency maintenance and repairs, the state would split the cost with the city, Reeves said Tuesday.\n\n“We will cash flow the operation, and the city will be responsible for half the cost of the emergency improvements that we make,” the governor said in a statement released on Twitter.\n\nAt a Tuesday news conference at the plant, Reeves said he is “encouraged” and at the same time “discouraged” by some of the news coming out of the facility.\n\n“We do have a plan in place to potentially bring in an additional rented pump that will allow us to put at least 4 million gallons of water additionally, hopefully, which will be installed by tomorrow morning. That is progress and will help,” he said.\n\nReeves added there is no time frame as of now for safe drinking water, but that over the next 24 to 36 hours residents will see significant truckloads of clean water start to be delivered to Jackson.\n\nOver the next few days, more than 108 semi-trucks of water are coming into Jackson and seven mega distribution sites will have 36 truckloads of water a day for the public to be able to retrieve, according to Lt. Col. Stephen McCraney, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency director.\n\nSystemic issues also contributed to water crisis\n\nLumumba previously told CNN a lack of political will and years of neglect on a national level has prevented Jackson from getting the help it needs to fix its water and sewer crisis. Besides the infrastructure issues, the plant has also been faced with staffing issues, according to the mayor and governor.\n\n“A far too small number of heroic frontline workers were trying their hardest to hold the system together, but that it was a near impossibility,” the governor said Monday.\n\nJackson’s ongoing water system problems already had some residents reporting low to no water pressure and raw sewage flowing in city streets and neighborhoods before this month.\n\nNow, some residents are taking to Twitter – where #jxnwatercrisis and #jacksonwatercrisis were trending – to post pictures of buckets and even tubs full of brown water coming out of their drains.\n\nSome on social media also pointed to systemic and environmental racism as among the causes of the city’s ongoing water issues and lack of resources, given that 82.5% of Jackson’s population identifies as Black or African American, according to census data, while the state’s legislature is majority White.\n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson called out the Mississippi governor on Twitter Tuesday.\n\n”.@tatereeves, what are you waiting for!? We demand on behalf of the Jackson communities that you request federal aid from @FEMA and other agencies to ensure people have access to a basic human right: WATER,” Johnson’s tweet read. “Make the damn call. This is personal.”\n\nJackson has undergone drastic changes in the past half century. Its economic decline has occurred rapidly over the past two decades, fueled by population decline and demographic shifts.\n\nThe city’s population shrank from almost 200,000 in 1990 to about 160,000 in 2020. Its decline in population in these three decades was driven almost entirely by White flight. The city was 56% Black in 1990. By 2020, 82% of the city’s residents were Black.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Jason Hanna Nouran Salahieh", "Amir Vera", "Jason Hanna", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}]}

He will also be suspended for the first three games of the 2023-24 season and undergo sensitivity training.\n\nHuggins' contract will be amended from a multi-year agreement to a year-by-year agreement, effective Wednesday.

I am sorry for the hurt and distress I have caused our students and our student-athletes. I represent more than just our university and our basketball program, and it pains me to know that I have let so many people down,\" he said. \"I have no excuse for the language I used, and I take full responsibility.\"\n\nHuggins, 69, apologized for his language, which aired on News Radio 700 WLW’s \"Bill Cunningham Show\" after the hosts asked him about Xavier, the coach's longtime rival when he led Cincinnati for 16 seasons (1989-2005). He referred to Xavier fans as \"Catholic (expletive)\" twice.\n\n\"During the conversation, I used a completely insensitive and abhorrent phrase that there is simply no excuse for — and I won’t try to make one here,\" Huggins said in a statement released through the university Monday. \"As I have shared with my players over my 40 years of coaching, there are consequences for our words and actions, and I will fully accept any coming my way. I am ashamed and embarrassed and heartbroken for those I have hurt. I must do better, and I will.”\n\nA West Virginia native, Huggins finished his collegiate playing days and began his coaching career at West Virginia. His first head coaching job was from 1980-1983 at Division II Walsh, followed by stints at Akron (1984-1989), Cincinnati, Kansas State (2006-07) and with the Mountaineers since then.\n\nThe school condemned Huggins' words shortly after his radio appearance. School officials deliberated on Huggins' punishment for two days, ESPN said.\n\nHuggins went to the Final Four twice – once with Cincinnati (1992) and again with West Virginia (2010). Huggins is the active wins leader among all Division I coaches (935), and his career record is 935-414 (.693 winning percentage).\n\nBob Huggins' contract\n\nThe university's contract with Huggins appeared to give school officials the latitude to fire him without cause if they so chose.\n\nAccording to Huggins’ contract at the time of the radio interview, he was required to, “conduct himself at all times in a manner which is consistent with being an instructor of students and which presents a positive representation of West Virginia University.”\n\nIt also stated he could be fired for cause for reasons including “Conduct by Coach that is clearly contrary to the character and responsibilities of a person occupying Coach’s position, offends the traditions of the University, brings discredit to the University; or harms the University’s reputation.” The contract did not state who makes the determination of whether the coach engaged in such conduct.\n\nIf Huggins was terminated for cause, the school was only required to pay him his current compensation through the termination date.\n\nHowever, the termination date of his employment as head coach was not totally clear.\n\nThe contract said that subject to his “satisfactory compliance” with the agreement, the term was scheduled to extend automatically by one year to June 30, 2025, unless on or before May 1, 2023, the athletics director provided written notice of the AD’s desire not to grant the one-year extension.\n\nA WVU athletics department spokesman could not be immediately reached to determine whether the extension has occurred.\n\nHuggins was being paid $4.15 million annually in total basic compensation. So, a firing for cause would have cost him more than $8.6 million, plus at least another $100,000 he had been scheduled to receive for serving as “emeritus head coach” for a minimum of two years at a rate of $50,000 annually.\n\nIf Huggins had been fired without cause, he would have been owed half of the remaining basic annual compensation left on the deal.\n\nThe university's statement released Wednesday says his current contract \"will be amended from a multi-year agreement to a year-by-year agreement that will begin on May 10, 2023, and end on April 30, 2024.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2023/05/10/west-virginia-s-huggins-agrees-to-1m-pay-cut-3-game-suspension-for-homophobic-slur/70204486007/", "title": "West Virginia's Huggins agrees to $1M pay cut, 3-game suspension ...", "text": "JOHN RABY\n\nAP\n\nBob Huggins has agreed to a three-game suspension, a $1 million salary reduction and sensitivity training for using a homophobic slur during a radio interview, the university announced Wednesday.\n\nThe agreement allows Huggins to keep his job as the school's basketball coach, but the blunder will leave a lasting mark on his Hall of Fame career.\n\nWest Virginia University President Gordon Gee and athletic director Wren Baker said in a joint statement that the university has “made it explicitly clear to Coach Huggins that any incidents of similar derogatory and offensive language will result in immediate termination.”\n\nUnder the agreement, Huggins and all current and future athletics coaching staff will be required to undergo training that will be developed by the university's LGBTQ+ Center to address all aspects of inequality, including homophobia, transphobia and sexism. Huggins also will be required to meet with LGBTQ+ leaders from across the state.\n\n“We will never truly know the damage that has been done by the words said in those 90 seconds,” Gee and Baker said. “Words matter and they can leave scars that can never be seen.

And by taking this moment to learn more about another’s perspective, speak respectfully and lead with understanding, perhaps the words ‘do better’ will lead to meaningful change for all.”\n\nUnder the agreement, Huggins’ salary of $4.15 million will be reduced by $1 million. That reduction will be used to directly support WVU’s LGBTQ+ Center, as well as a mental health center at the university and other groups that support marginalized communities.\n\nHuggins will be suspended for the first three games of the 2023-24 season.

I love this University and know first-hand that the education and experiences students receive here make a difference. I am truly sorry for the damage I have done. And I am grateful for the chance to move forward in a way that positively represents this University and our state.”\n\nHuggins used the slur to refer to Xavier fans on Monday while also denigrating Catholics during an appearance on Cincinnati radio station WLW. The West Virginia athletic department called the comments “offensive” and said it was reviewing the matter.\n\nDuring the radio show, Huggins was asked about the transfer portal and whether he had a chance of landing a player at West Virginia from Xavier, a Jesuit school.\n\n“Catholics don’t do that,” Huggins said. “I tell you what, any school that can throw rubber penises on the floor and then say they didn’t do it, by God they can get away with anything.\n\n“It was the Crosstown Shootout. What it was, was all those (expletive), those Catholic (expletive), I think.”\n\nIn a speech on Wednesday, Xavier President Colleen Hanycz called Huggins’ comments “repulsive and offensive.”\n\n“The deplorable mischaracterizations and homophobic slurs directed towards our LGBTQ+ and our Catholic communities were repulsive and offensive,” Hanycz said before a press event detailing plans for a new medical school. “To those in our Xavier family who were directly targeted and harmed by these hateful words, be assured that you are invaluable members of our Xavier family and you belong here,\" Hanycz said. \"Your presence makes us better.”\n\nUnder the agreement, Huggins also will make a “substantial” donation to Xavier to support its Center for Faith and Justice and Center for Diversity and Inclusion.\n\nHuggins entered the Basketball Hall of Fame last September. In 41 seasons, his teams have gone to 25 NCAA tournaments, finished ranked in the top 10 of The Associated Press poll seven times and had finished under .500 five times. The Mountaineers have 11 NCAA Tournament appearances under Huggins.\n\nHuggins spent 16 seasons at Cincinnati before being fired in 2005 in a power struggle with the school’s president as well as the aftermath of a 2004 drunken driving arrest.

And by taking this moment to learn more about another’s perspective, speak respectfully and lead with understanding, perhaps the words ‘do better’ will lead to meaningful change for all.”\n\nHuggins' comments were part of a busy week for offensive words.\n\nOakland Athletics broadcaster Glen Kuiper has been suspended indefinitely while his employer conducts a review of him using a racial epithet while describing a visit to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City before a game against the Royals.\n\nKuiper apologized and claimed he inadvertently mangled the word — a explanation that was met with plenty of skepticism, especially from people of color who've been subjected to it far too many times.\n\nThen there's ESPN anchor John Anderson, who thought it would be funny to say — right in the middle of “SportsCenter,” mind you — the last name of Vegas Golden Knights defenseman Zach Whitecloud sounded like toilet paper.\n\nWhitecloud is the first member of Canada's Sioux Valley Dakota Nation to play in the NHL.\n\n“This is totally on me and I sincerely apologize to Zach, the Golden Knights, their fans and everyone else for what I said,” Anderson said in a statement. “It’s my job to be prepared and know the backgrounds of the players and I blew it.”\n\nSadly, there's a bigger issue at play here.\n\nAfter years of showing more sensitivity toward the pain caused by offensive verbiage, our entire society seems to be falling back into some bad, old habits.\n\nSorry, it's not sending the right message to reduce Huggins' annual salary from $4.5 million to $3.5 million and have him miss three largely meaningless games.\n\nWe're certainly not optimistic that sensitivity training — another of the sanctions ordered by his employer — will suddenly transform the 69-year-old Huggins into a warm, caring figure.\n\nAfter West Virginia's most recent season ended at the NCAA Tournament with a first-round loss to Maryland, I got a chance to ask Huggins how long he intended to coach.\n\n“You probably got people who enjoy reading what you write, and there’s people who say I wouldn’t read a damn thing he writes. I got the same situation going on,” Huggins said. “I got people who think I should stay on for quite a while, and there’s people probably thinking I ought to pack it in and let some young kid come in and screw it up.”\n\nTurns out, it was Huggins who screwed up.\n\nBut he's still got a job.\n\nWhat a disgrace.\n\n___\n\nPaul Newberry is the national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

You see the patented death glare when he stands still, preparing to rip into a player, and you think, well, this coach is perhaps a bit too intense.\n\nBut those public glimpses of Frank Martin, the South Carolina men’s basketball coach, tell only part of his remarkable story — and personality.\n\n“Everybody thinks he’s tough,” said Lourdes Martin, Frank’s mother. “He is tough; you’ve got to be tough to coach. But at the same time, he’s got to take care of his players. At home, he’s a great husband, a great father, a great son. He cooks for them, takes care of them. He’s just a big teddy bear. Frank is very, very humble. He will always be the same man no matter where he goes.”\n\nLourdes is the reason her son is the way he is, fueled by a fiery passion but softened by a deep capacity for unconditional love, part basketball instructor, part life coach. She’s the most important woman in his life, Martin gushed Sunday, the strongest woman he’s ever met.\n\n“Husband runs out, leaves her, never gives her a penny, she never takes him to court — doesn't make excuses,” said Martin, 51, an hour after his No. 7-seeded Gamecocks beat Florida to advance to the program’s first-ever Final Four. “Worked on a salary as a secretary. Raised my sister and me. We'd go to Wendy's or Burger King every two Fridays — that was our family meal.\n\nMarch Madness: Four bold projections for the Final Four\n\nNo. 7 South Carolina edges No. 4 Florida for trip to the Final Four\n\n'Burden' lifted: Gonzaga's Mark Few reaches the Final Four at last\n\nNo. 3 Oregon powers past No. 1 Kansas to reach the Final Four\n\n“She gave me the courage to try and do this for a living. Every time I'm in a difficult moment and I got to make a choice and do right or do wrong … I made her cry one time when I was a teenager because I made the wrong choice. I'm never making her cry again for making the wrong choice. And I’m watching her cry tears of joy because all her sacrifices have allowed me and my sister to move forward in life. Those are the tears that are important to me. That's extending her life. When you make your mother cry for joy, it gives her more life, and she's a special lady. Special lady.”\n\nAnd those are the tears that were shed Sunday evening, as Lourdes watched her son do something he’d never done before, with a program that had never come close to a Final Four berth before. Confetti then covered the court; bits and pieces of the nets were being cut and stuffed in pockets and hats as mementos. Martin walked around and around until he found her.\n\n“I was out of breath, and then when I hugged my son, it was just ‘Please, God, give me some peace,'” Lourdes said. “He told me, he said, ‘Mommy I’m so happy but please don’t cry.' But he was crying, too. I’ve been crying for a while now.”\n\nMartin was the first American-born child in his Cuban family, and he grew up alongside classmates at Miami High School who came over to the house to swim and eat tuna steaks and have never left Martin’s side in the decades since.\n\nHe worked myriad jobs as he grew older in Miami, at one point moonlighting as a bouncer at a local nightclub while coaching junior varsity basketball at Miami High School. He has said that one incident in 1992 — a group of men he had kicked out of the club for fighting returned with a gun and fired several shots at him — convinced him to pursue coaching full time.\n\nMartin’s first gig coaching varsity came in 1993, at North Miami High School, and then came big success at Miami High — three consecutive state championships — but ended in his firing amid scandal, and the 1998 title being vacated because of recruiting violations. That situation is something Martin has not shied away from addressing, even during the most successful month of his coaching career, because it prompted him to shoot for college basketball jobs. He wrote more than 100 letters to college coaches all around the country; only Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski wrote back.\n\n“When we sit around and start judging people and their difficult moments, it says a lot about the people that criticize, not the people that make the mistakes,” Martin said. “I was a part of an unfortunate situation coaching high school basketball. It was under my watch. I still to this day say we were not guilty, but I was responsible for that situation, and I lost my job. And that was the first time I ever said, you know what, I'm going to try this college thing.”\n\nA year later, he landed a job at Booker T. Washington High School. One year after that, he was hired as an assistant coach at Northeastern. From there, he joined Bob Huggins and Andy Kennedy at Cincinnati, then followed Huggins to Kansas State.\n\nWhen Huggins left for West Virginia, Martin became the head coach of the Wildcats, taking them to four NCAA tournaments in five years, including an Elite Eight run in 2010. Then, of course, he headed to South Carolina — where, in his fifth season, he’s taken the program to levels it had never been close to reaching, led by players such as Sindarius Thornwell and P.J. Dozier, homegrown stars who trusted Martin’s vision for what he could build if they stayed home and stayed with the Gamecocks.\n\n“If you ever lose your dream or your desire to fight for your dream, then don't get mad when you don't get it,” Martin said. “But adversity and how we handle that determines what comes forward.”\n\nThese are lessons Martin teaches his players daily; he considers himself an educator. Yes, sometimes they’re lessons that are imparted with screaming and yelling — which brought a one-game suspension from the school at the end of 2014 regular season for \"an inappropriate verbal communication.\"\n\nBut the players see the teaching on the bench, the love in his embraces.\n\n“A lot of times you see the yelling while we’re on the court, but people don’t pay attention when we’re on the bench and he’s teaching,” senior Justin McKie told The (Bergen County, N.J.) Record. “They just see he’s loud. And he is loud; coach is loud. That’s his intensity.”\n\nMartin told players to trust him, hang on to him and “not let go of the rope,” a tug-of-war analogy he’s used for a few months now with his guys. He doesn’t give up on people, and they don’t give up on him. Martin’s wife, Anya, said current and former players visit her house so frequently it never feels like she only has three children. She said she sees how much he cares about his players, his kids, on a daily basis. She admitted her husband has been calmer than she thought he’d be as he’s worked toward reaching the pinnacle of the coaching profession — and that it must be because of those around him.\n\nUnexpected Final Four features favored North Carolina and three tough outs\n\nFinal Four: North Carolina gets to act like it has been there before\n\nAdd Luke Maye's name to the list of March Madness heroes\n\nAnd how he treats them, too.\n\n“Passion,” Martin said. “When I go back to my high school, which I do all the time, I never go see the teachers that made it easy on me, the ones that just kind of let me get by, I got no time for. I liked it when I was 17 years old. But I’ve got no time for them as a grown man now. I go back and I hug and kiss every single one that held me accountable here and would never let me off the hook. So, when I go in kids' homes and I recruit, what I tell their parents is, you guys might be mad at me sometimes, I'm OK with that, but the one thing you never have to worry about me is that I'm going to lie or I'm going to cheat your child. Neither one of those two things are ever happening. And that's who I am. That's who I am.\n\n“See I’ve got four core values I live my life by and I run my teams by and I run my family with: Honesty, loyalty, trust and love. And the only way you get to love is if you experience the other three. When you get to love, that gets strong. I don't care what storm comes through, you're not breaking love. But if you get to love without the other three, you let that thing go right away. So, you’ve got to go through the first three and that's the only way you get to love. And that's what I live by, I run my family by that, and I try to coach our guys that way. To get them to that place in life.”\n\nContributing: Tara Sullivan of the The (Bergen County, N.J.)

(Roethlisberger’s lawyer denied the sexual assault allegation, and the quarterback apologized in a statement to the team and fans for letting them down). Later, the suspension was reduced to four games for good behavior.\n\n“You have told me and the Steelers that you are committed to making better decisions,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell wrote in a letter to Roethlisberger at the time. “Your actions over the past several months have been consistent with that promise and you must continue to honor that commitment.”\n\nRoethlisberger’s was the first case of alleged violence against women that sports reporter Melissa Jacobs, now managing editor of The Football Girl and a contributor to The Guardian, remembers hearing about as a reporter covering the league. The NFL, she said, seemed completely incompetent at the time. When the league reduced Roethlisberger’s suspension, she was stunned.\n\n“The NFL had no blueprint in place for how to handle this,” Jacobs told CNN.\n\nOnce again, the league is under scrutiny for its handling of sexual misconduct accusations. This time, that scrutiny is centered on Deshaun Watson.\n\nWatson, quarterback for the Cleveland Browns, has faced allegations from more than two dozen women who say the football star sexually harassed or assaulted them during private massage appointments during his time with the Houston Texans. Twenty-four women filed civil lawsuits against Watson. Twenty-three of those civil suits have been settled confidentially; two grand juries in Texas declined to charge Watson criminally.\n\nInitially, Watson, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing, was hit with a six-game suspension, just like Roethlisberger. But unlike in the past, Goodell and the NFL pushed for more – appealing the decision and seeking a full-season suspension.\n\nBen Roethlisberger looks on after an incomplete play against the New England Patriots on November 14, 2010 at Heinz Field. Roethlisberger missed four games that season due to suspension. Chris McGrath/Getty Images\n\nLast week, the NFL and the NFL Players Association reached a settlement: Watson received an 11-game suspension and was fined $5 million. It’s the NFL’s harshest punishment for someone accused of sexual assault – in the past, the NFL has issued longer suspensions for violations including alleged drug use and gambling.\n\nThe situation is still thorny. There are, for example, questions surrounding what the Texans knew about Watson’s massage sessions.\n\nAnd under his latest contract with the Browns, Watson’s current team, he will not lose much of his guaranteed money, according to ESPN. If the six-game suspension had held, he would have only lost $345,000. (Watson’s contract is one of the richest deals in NFL history, at five years with $230 million guaranteed).\n\nBut just days after the league announced Watson’s updated suspension and fine, a new civil lawsuit against a newly drafted and since-released NFL player came to light.\n\nThus, questions from critics still linger: Is Watson’s penalty enough?\n\nA history of alleged violence against women\n\nDomestic violence cases and accusations of sexual misconduct in football aren’t limited to the professional level – colleges and universities have a history of such accusations as well.\n\nIn 1974, an 18-year-old girl accused six football players at the University of Notre Dame of gang-raping her. Those players were suspended for a year, but she alleged that up to 20 players were aware of the incident, with some even watching as it happened. Charges were filed, then dropped according to published reports; the university suspended the six students accused of being involved for a year.\n\nFifteen years later, at the University of Oklahoma, two players were convicted of raping a 20-year-old woman in a dorm room. The incident was one of many controversies that prompted the resignation of coach Barry Switzer (who, five years later, took a head coaching job with the Dallas Cowboys).\n\nNigel Clay, one of the Oklahoma players convicted, spoke about the incident in an interview with the Los Angeles Times in 1992. He, and many other players on campus, felt almost bulletproof, he said according to the Times report.\n\n“We felt like we were above the law,” Clay said. “Like OU would protect us from anything.”\n\nThat sentiment, to some degree, remains a concern. Between 2010 and 2015, officials at Baylor University failed to report sexual assault claims against football players, creating what the NCAA called in a 2021 report a “campus-wide culture of sexual violence.” Still, the NCAA did not penalize the university for its handling of sexual assault claims, stating in its report that Baylor did not actually violate NCAA legislation. (In a responding statement, the university said it “sincerely regret(s) the actions of a few individuals that caused harm to so many.”)\n\nTwo players at the University of Oklahoma were convicted of raping a 20-year-old woman back in 1989. Larry W Smith/EPA/Shutterstock\n\nAnd on Thursday, a civil lawsuit was filed against Matt Araiza, a punter recently drafted by the Buffalo Bills, and two of his former college teammates for allegedly gang-raping a 17-year-old girl in 2021 while attending San Diego State University.\n\n“I’m disappointed that she filed this civil lawsuit against my client because he didn’t rape her, he never used any force against her, she was not visibly intoxicated, he did not hand her a drink with anything in it,” Kerry Armstrong, Araiza’s lawyer, told CNN on a call.\n\nThe university is investigating the matter, SDSU officials said in a statement, as is the San Diego Police Department. Both the Bills and the NFL initially stated they were aware of the lawsuit but declined to comment due to the ongoing investigation. No criminal charges have been filed.\n\nOn Saturday, the Bills released Araiza from the team.\n\n“This afternoon, we decided that releasing Matt Araiza was the best thing to do. Our culture in Buffalo is more important than winning football games,” team general manager Brandon Beane announced.\n\nDeborah Epstein is the co-director of the Georgetown University Law Center’s Domestic Violence Clinic, and she previously served on the NFL Players Association’s commission on domestic violence. She resigned from the commission in 2018, claiming the NFLPA wasn’t actually committed to preventing violence against women. (The NFLPA, in response, said it had implemented “many of the commission’s recommendations” and “will continue to provide resources and services” to members.)\n\nMany athletes are identified as stars relatively young, Epstein explained, even before they go to college. People treat them like gods who don’t have to follow the rules, she said. And that can be detrimental.\n\n“For someone that young, it’s incredibly hard to avoid internalizing those messages and developing into a person that acts impulsively (and) doesn’t really have to think through the consequences of his actions,” Epstein said. “And that pattern, that kind of life, is one that can easily lead to violence against women, feeling like everything’s your property.”\n\nCases of athletes accused of committing violence against women aren’t limited to football – they are found across sports in boxing, basketball, and soccer, among others. In April, Major League Baseball suspended Trevor Bauer of the Los Angeles Dodgers for two years following allegations of sexual assault, which he has denied. (Bauer will not face criminal charges, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office said.)\n\nAnd in 2015 while with the Cincinnati Reds, Aroldis Chapman was suspended for 30 games out of the 162-game season, after his girlfriend accused him of choking and pushing her, before firing his gun multiple times in the garage. His girlfriend called 911 from the bushes near his home, according to a police report.\n\nChapman wasn’t charged for the incident and claimed he never hurt his girlfriend – though he apologized for his use of a gun.\n\nTwo years later, when Chapman signed with the New York Yankees, owner Hal Steinbrenner defended the move in spite of the allegations.\n\n“Look, he admitted he messed up. He paid the penalty. Sooner or later, we forget, right?” Steinbrenner said at the time. “That’s the way we’re supposed to be in life.”\n\nEven when the NFL penalizes alleged misconduct, experts say it can do more to prevent it\n\nThe NFL does now have policies in place to punish those accused of sexual misconduct or violence against women, following an investigation. But the data shows those policies haven’t always been strictly followed.\n\nJacquelyn Wiersma-Mosley, a professor at the University of Arkansas, completed an empirical investigation into violence against women in the NFL, pulling data from a public list of the 176 known players who violated any league policy between 2010 and 2019.\n\nOnly 10% of victims actually report incidents of domestic violence, Wiersma-Mosley said, so the data may not reflect the actual scope of the issue. Still, offenses pertaining to allegations of violence against women received an average of a four-game suspension – even though NFL policy states the minimum as six.\n\nAnd the majority of infractions were for general violent behaviors, things like assault and battery or allegations of such, which Wiersma-Mosley found received an average suspension time of just two games – suggesting that the league doesn’t only have an issue with violence against women, but violence in general.\n\nThe NFL logo is pictured during the game between the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers at Ford Field on January 9 in Detroit. Nic Antaya/Getty Images\n\nBrian McCarthy, a spokesperson for the NFL, disagreed with that suggestion, telling CNN that less than 1% of players are involved in a matter that leads to an arrest, and that the league works to hold those who violate NFL policies accountable even when there are no legal ramifications.\n\nStill, the narrow view of masculinity in football, and in other sports, can breed misogyny and sexism, Wiersma-Mosley said, referencing points made by former NFL quarterback Don McPherson. Until that issue is addressed, the problem of domestic violence will fester, Wiersma-Mosley believes.\n\n“The silence by players and the league allow violence to continue, particularly in high risk all-male groups where group loyalty is engrained,” she said. “Instead the league should empower players to speak out as active bystanders and allies in the prevention of violence.”\n\nIt bears noting that the NFL has made some improvements since Roethlisberger or, slightly more recently, Ray Rice. Before, in the absence of a criminal conviction, the NFL would frequently claim it could not investigate allegations of a player’s violence against women, Epstein said. In the Watson case, though, it hired investigators who wrote a 200-page report, as well as a retired federal judge to make a ruling. The NFL has also investigated other incidents of alleged domestic violence in recent years, including allegations against Ezekiel Elliott in 2017. Though he was never arrested or charged, the league suspended Elliott for six games. (Elliott had previously denied the accusations and said he strongly disagreed with his suspension.)\n\nIn Watson’s case, the NFL has also set his $5 million fine, plus an extra $1 million each from both the league and the Browns, to go toward nonprofit organizations working to prevent sexual assault, support survivors and educate youth on healthy relationships.\n\nBut in Epstein’s view, the league has yet to discover how to actually penalize claims of misconduct or violence against women in a way that is both a deterrent and an act of justice.\n\nEpstein used Calvin Ridley of the Atlanta Falcons as an example. After placing three multi-legged parlay bets on NFL games in 2021 while injured, Ridley has been suspended at least for the entire 2022 season.\n\n“It’s really hard to argue that that’s the same level as sexual assault,” Epstein said.\n\nIn response, Anna Isaacson, the NFL’s senior vice president of social responsibility, told CNN the league relies on experts and advisers whenever there is a case of domestic or sexual violence. Those experts, she said, have advised the league to take a “multifaceted, comprehensive approach” to addressing these cases, rather than relying solely on punishment.\n\n“Discipline alone – so just the number of games one gets suspended – is not enough to curb behavior or deter future action,” Isaacson said.\n\nStill, no one wants to think about assault while the game is happening, Jacobs said. Fans want an escape, owners want a profit.\n\n“The marketing for the NFL is just phenomenal,” she said. “They know they have millions of suckers who are just into their product and maybe care about an issue on Tuesday or Wednesday, but once the games start on Sunday that’s not what fans are thinking about.”\n\nIsaacson said the NFL has “done a lot of education for fans,” including several public service campaigns about domestic violence and airing Super Bowl ads from domestic violence organizations.\n\nTo actually address domestic violence and sexual misconduct, the NFL should also focus on promoting anti-violence messages early on, Epstein said, while athletes are still in elementary and middle school. By the time players get to the NFL, it might actually be too late, she said.\n\nThe NFL did create Character Playbook in 2014 – the same year Rice was suspended indefinitely from the league – an educational program for middle schoolers focused on building healthy relationships. The program is accessible to any middle school that wants it, Isaacson said, and is currently in more than 12,000 schools.\n\nThe league also began the InSideOut Initiative, which works with coaches to reduce the “win at all costs mentality” in sports, Isaacson said.\n\nBut there also need to be punitive damages, Epstein said. The message athletes receive, she argued, is that they can commit violence against women without significant reprimand.\n\nIn the settlement announcement, Goodell claimed Watson is “committed to doing the hard work on himself that is necessary for his return to the NFL.”\n\nWatson walks on the fields before an NFL preseason football game against the Philadelphia Eagles in Cleveland, Sunday, August 21. Ron Schwane/AP\n\nAlthough Watson apologized for “any pain this situation has caused” in a statement, he also told the media last week that he plans to “continue to stand on my innocence.”\n\n“Just because settlements and things like that happen, doesn’t mean that person is guilty for anything,” Watson said.\n\nTo Epstein, if Watson can’t even admit to the sexual assaults that a judge brought on by the NFL and the NFLPA determined he more likely than not committed, how can the NFL’s evaluation and treatment plan have any impact?\n\n“Professional football cannot realistically address its violence against women problem with empty claims that it will require players to reflect and improve their behavior, while the players persist in asserting blanket denials of wrongdoing,” she said.\n\nThe league has shown it may be more prepared to handle accusations of violence against women than it was in the past. And yet the same question remains: Will it make a difference?", "authors": ["Leah Asmelash"], "publish_date": "2022/08/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/06/pipeline-protest-victory-fireworks-fallout-worlds-tallest-horse-dies-news-around-states/117382554/", "title": "Pipeline protest victory, fireworks fallout: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: About one-third of the state’s counties, including most of its heavily populated areas, are at very high risk for COVID-19 as vaccination rates continue to lag, state statistics showed Monday. While overall caseloads and hospitalizations remain far below levels when the pandemic was at its worst early this year, the potential for infection remains elevated in areas including Birmingham, Huntsville, Montgomery and much of two regions, the Wiregrass of southeast Alabama and the Tennessee Valley in the north. Of the state’s most populated areas, only Mobile County on the coast is considered as being at low risk for the illness caused by the coronavirus, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health. Nearly three dozen rural counties with sparse populations also are at low risk. The statistics don’t include the July 4 holiday period, so health officials will look to see whether holiday gatherings contribute to a rise in infections later this month. With only about 30% of residents fully vaccinated, Alabama trails every state but Mississippi. Statistics from the Alabama Hospital Association show 94% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 haven’t been vaccinated. The illness has killed more than 11,350 people statewide.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state marijuana education program manager has been added to the board that regulates Alaska’s legal cannabis industry. Eliza Muse’s appointment to the Marijuana Control Board’s public health seat was effective June 25, said Corey Allen Young, a spokesperson for Gov. Mike Dunleavy. Muse replaces Loren Jones, who had held the seat since the board’s inception in 2015. The move allows Muse to serve until the Legislature next considers appointments, which will likely be sometime next year. In her public health work, Muse “has been extensively involved in marijuana education and addressing public health challenges associated with legalization,” Young said by email. Muse said she sees herself as “trying to ensure that we can find sort of a sweet spot as it pertains to ensuring that public health is preserved, safety is preserved, in this new space of a marijuana marketplace and just ensure that our regulations are always considerate of public health.” Muse, who runs a marijuana education program within the state health department, said she isn’t stepping into her role as a board member “with any sort of preconceived notion or bias” toward existing rules. She said she wants to ensure policy stays in line with research and science, “which we know to date has been lagging due to federal regulations.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state is moving to ban the use of trail cameras to take video or photos to aid hunting, with regulators saying the widespread practice runs counter to a doctrine that prey animals should have a chance to get away and that hunters should rely on their skills, not technology. The state Game and Fish Commission unanimously approved the ban during a June 11 meeting in Payson and plans to start implementing it as early as next January. Achieving the Jan. 1 target date depends on education and training, commission Chairman Kurt Davis said. Under the prohibition, cameras could no longer be placed at or near watering holes or other locations to help hunters by locating wildlife. The cameras are often triggered by motion and store pictures or videos to be viewed later. The ban wouldn’t affect cameras used for non-hunting purposes, such as viewing wildlife or protecting property. Trying to balance the use of technology while respecting wildlife is “the million-dollar responsibility of this commission,” Davis said. “That balance is the essential part of being on the commission and setting the rules that govern how we pursue wildlife.” The ban will “ensure that we protect the quality of the experience, that we protect the wildlife itself and that they are being pursued under Fair Chase Doctrine,” Davis said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state ended the fiscal year with a surplus of nearly $1 billion, more than double its previous record, finance officials said Friday. The Department of Finance and Administration said the state ended the fiscal year June 30 with a surplus of $945.7 million. Arkansas’ net available revenue for the fiscal year totaled more than $6.8 billion. The state’s previous record was the $409.3 million surplus accumulated in the 2007 fiscal year, the department said. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said this year’s surplus allowed Arkansas to grow its reserves to more than $1.2 billion and add to its Medicaid trust fund. The Republican governor noted that the state’s individual income tax collections increased over the previous year and beat the state forecast despite a tax cut that took effect this year. Hutchinson has said he plans to call a special session to take up additional tax cuts this fall. The state’s sales and corporate income tax collections also came in above the previous year and state forecasts. “This showcases the fact that a growing economy along with conservative management of our resources allows us to fund education at a high level and other state services and to cut taxes at the same time,” Hutchinson said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Air quality advisories were in effect Monday across a swath of Southern California due to hours of fireworks blasts and a wildfire north of the city. The South Coast Air Quality District said poor air quality was likely through the afternoon because fireworks emit high levels of particulate matter. The smell of smoke infused the overnight intrusion of damp marine air over the region. “June Gloom continues its tight grip on Southern California early this morning despite the turn of the calendar,” the National Weather Service said. July 4 and 5 are typically the worst days of the year for levels of fine particulate matter in the South Coast Air Basin. Breathing particulates can lead to a wide variety of cardiovascular and respiratory health effects. A smoke advisory was also in effect due to the Tumbleweed Fire burning in mountains near Interstate 5 and the community of Gorman about 60 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Areas adjacent to the fire were expected to experience the highest concentrations of pollutants.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis has signed off on the creation of a new taxing district to coordinate the creation of a Front Range passenger railway up and down the Interstate 25 corridor. But while the state may have a powerful likely partner in Amtrak, the first trains won’t be ready to roll for at least a couple of years, The Denver Post reports. And the regional rail line faces potential political and cost hurdles. The new Front Range Passenger Rail District will take shape early next year and cover all or parts of 13 counties near I-25 between the Wyoming and New Mexico state lines, including all of metro Denver. The district and its appointed board will begin formalizing plans for the first stretches of the railway. It’s likely to include a route north of Denver that goes through Boulder. Money will be scarce at first, however, since the district will need to seek approval from voters within its boundaries to collect any new sales tax. Still, Polis’ signing of the legislation into law Wednesday marked a big milestone. “A dedicated railroad connecting communities from New Mexico to Colorado to Wyoming isn’t just great for our environment but, as our history shows, it will spur innovation and move people, ideas and businesses,” the Democratic governor said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Representatives of home care, hospice and home health agencies called on state officials Thursday to provide them with more funding, including a share of the state’s remaining federal COVID-19 relief money, warning they’re facing dire financial and staffing challenges. The Connecticut Association for Healthcare at Home, whose member agencies provide services to nearly 20,000 state-funded residents, including the elderly and medically fragile children and adults, contends the home-based sector of the health care industry has been forgotten as state policymakers focused more attention on the nursing homes and group homes. Unionized workers at those facilities had threatened to strike unless they received greater wages, benefits and protections. “We made our strong case to the Legislature,” said Tracy Wodatch, president and CEO of the association. “Yet the (state) budget fell sorely short, failing to support us through additional Medicaid funding while choosing to invest significant dollars in nursing homes and group homes.” In a statement, Wodatch said the two-year, $46.3 billion budget “sent a strong negative message that home care is not a priority” even though the sector saved the state $508.4 million in fiscal year 2019 by helping people stay out of costly institutional settings.\n\nDelaware\n\nSmyrna: Officials are set to conduct a routine quarterly test of the Salem/Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Stations emergency notification system. Delaware Emergency Management Agency and Delaware State Police will run the test Tuesday, with the sirens sounding about 7:20 p.m., Delaware State News reports. The 37 sirens located within 10 miles of the plants just over the Delaware border in New Jersey will be activated for three to five minutes, the newspaper reports. The siren tests will be followed by a test message of the Emergency Alert System on local radio stations.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A man has been charged with assault with a deadly weapon and destruction of government property after crashing a vehicle on the Washington Monument grounds Saturday evening, WUSA-TV reports. Jack Joseph Dessin, 38, of New Jersey, faces the charges, U.S. Park Police said. Multiple police units and D.C. Fire and EMS responded after an SUV hit the barrier wall that surrounds a hill atop which the Washington Monument sits at the National Mall. A man was taken to George Washington University hospital for treatment of minor injuries suffered in the crash that happened about 8 p.m., according to U.S. Park Police. The crash came only hours before the Fourth of July and in a popular place for tourists visiting the National Mall for the patriotic holiday. Photos appeared to show an American flag hanging from the vehicle, among other signs that had been placed onto it. A woman on the scene said she was almost hit by the vehicle but did not want to answer any further questions or provide additional information about what had happened. The crash is under investigation.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: About $99 million in unspent rental aid meant to help Floridians living in affordable housing was returned to the state after the agency overseeing the program struggled to disburse the money. The Florida Housing Finance Corporation, established by the Legislature to help develop and support affordable housing, received $120 million in federal funding for rental assistance last year as part of the CARES Act. Florida used the money to set up a Coronavirus Relief Fund, intended to help tenants who lost jobs or income due to the pandemic catch up on rent at the properties that FHFC finances. Taylore Maxey, press secretary for the nonprofit, said it handed out about $13.2 million to help tenants at 373 multifamily developments across the state. In total, FHFC said it received 786 applications for assistance, but only 521 were approved. And about $99 million was returned to the Department of Economic Opportunity to be repurposed for other pandemic-response programs. “There’s no way to sugarcoat it: That strategy was underutilized,” said Trey Price, the FHFC’s executive director. “But all this considered, I think we did a good job with the time constraints we were under and the resources we were given.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Some 13,000 runners took to the streets Saturday to welcome the return of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Peachtree Road Race, a Fourth of July holiday tradition. Previous years saw about 60,000 runners cross the starting line in front of Lenox Mall in the Buckhead neighborhood. This year, the race was broken into two days to help with social distancing. About 18,000 runners were expected Sunday, including four of the six marathon runners who will represent the U.S. at the upcoming Tokyo Olympics. Race Director Rich Kenah said officials split the event primarily as a safety precaution to limit any potential COVID-19 exposure, WSB-TV reports. To participate, runners either had to show proof they had been vaccinated or go through a screening process for COVID-19. The race was held virtually last year. The fastest woman on the course Saturday morning, Jessica Smith, said she could not have been more excited to compete again. “We have a beautiful day, and we could not get more lucky with the weather,” Smith said. Another big change for the race was that spectators weren’t allowed at the finish line near Piedmont Park. Dan Kolber said he had been running the race for years and had no problem with the safety measures. “It was gone last year. This is the most fulfilling thing since this pandemic hit,” Kolber said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: As the state slowly approaches vaccination benchmarks that will trigger loosened coronavirus restrictions, officials are extending an incentive program to get more COVID-19 shots in arms. A second round of vaccine incentives will be launched this month, Hawaii Public Radio reports. The Hawaii Department of Health said the state’s current incentive program contributed to a 30% increase in vaccinations over what was expected in June. Nearly 58% of the Hawaii’s population is fully vaccinated. Travel testing and quarantine rules will be suspended when the state reaches 60%; the governor expects that will happen by Thursday and has promised to drop those rules that day. When the state reaches 70%, all COVID-19 restrictions will be lifted. People can register for the second round of incentives – which include cars, cash and furniture – beginning July 12. The program has been funded by local businesses. “There’s been no expense to the state for the higotvaccinated.com campaign,” said Patrick Bullard of H&B Marketing, who is coordinating incentives for the state vaccination program. “It’s all been made possible through the generosity of businesses that have come forward – who recognize the importance to the community to get us to the finish line sooner rather than later.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Anti-government activist and agitator Ammon Bundy has been found guilty of misdemeanor trespassing and misdemeanor resisting or obstructing officers. Bundy was found guilty Thursday evening after a four-day jury trial and brief jury deliberations, the Idaho Statesman reports. He was sentenced to three days in jail. But with credit for time served, he will serve no additional jail time. Magistrate Judge David Manweiler also imposed 48 hours of community service and a $750 fine for Bundy. A co-defendant, Aaron Von Schmidt, was found guilty of misdemeanor trespassing. He was sentenced to three days in jail as well but also got credit for time served and a $500 fine. Both men were arrested Aug. 25, 2020, and charged with trespassing when they refused to leave a Statehouse auditorium after officials ordered it to be cleared. Officers ultimately wheeled Bundy out of the Capitol on a swivel chair. Bundy, best known for leading a group of armed activists in the occupation of an Oregon wildlife refuge in 2016 to protest the federal control of public lands, has tried to frame his arrest as oppression from political opponents. Bundy filed documents to run for Idaho governor in May, though he acknowledged during the trial that he isn’t registered to vote in the state. Bundy moved to Idaho several years ago.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: State courthouses may end social distancing measures, and starting Oct. 1 criminal defendants may again invoke their right to a speedy trial, under new Illinois Supreme Court rules. The court issued two orders last week that essentially undo rules put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those rules included suspending speedy trial deadlines, or the number of days after which defendants may demand prosecutors bring them to trial or drop charges. Those deadlines will again come into play effective Oct. 1, a date Chief Justice Anne Burke said was chosen to give chief circuit court judges time to prepare. Decisions on whether or how to relax social distancing rules will be left up to local courts, according to the order. “It is important to note that our courts remained open during the COVID-19 pandemic, and thousands of court proceedings have taken place via both in-person and virtual hearings,” Burke said. “However, conducting criminal jury trials has been very difficult. These two orders will help our courts prepare for a return to a full slate of jury trials.” The Chicago Tribune reports some defense attorneys at the criminal courthouse in Chicago have tried to formally demand trial on behalf of their clients during the pandemic. But judges have ruled the demands have no teeth.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Marion County prosecutor has begun a pilot program that refers certain juvenile offenders to the Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis. Prosecutor Ryan Mears said instead of entering into the criminal justice system, juveniles with low-level, nonviolent offenses will get a one-year standard club membership, at the prosecutor’s expense. Mears said it’s “a second chance that connects juveniles with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis, a safe place where they experience positive interactions with adults.” Mears said that “once children are introduced into the criminal justice system, it typically sets up a cycle of challenges and expectations that can impact their entire life.” Instead, he wants to help change behavior and give them opportunities to make better choices. Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis CEO and Executive Director Maggie A. Lewis said her organization’s top focus is “providing a safe and positive environment to help our city’s youth build great futures.” The Boys & Girls Clubs provide homework assistance, mentoring, sports and other programs.\n\nIowa\n\nDavenport: Local animal shelters are bursting with cats and dogs, and workers are pleading with the public to volunteer as foster families until the animals can be adopted. It’s a stark reversal from one year ago, when COVID-19 lockdowns and quarantines drove people to adopt pets in droves, emptying animal shelters in the Quad Cities. Elizabeth Corn, director of King’s Harvest Pet Rescue, said the shelter has had to stop accepting animals altogether. “We have not been able to take any pets for at least a couple weeks,” Corn told the Quad-City Times. “We are working on getting them fixed and adopted as fast as we can. I’ve had at least eight phone calls today from people trying to surrender pets. We are referring them to other shelters.” Corn said King’s Harvest had 25 adoptable dogs and more than 120 adoptable cats. But dozens more are waiting until they meet adoption criteria. “Everybody’s in the same situation right now. It seems lately that we have an influx of people needing to re-home their pets,” she said. “On top of that, it’s also kitten and puppy season. We’re stuffed.” Bob Citrullo, director of the Humane Society of Scott County, said the shelter had a total of 235 animals, 80 of which are dogs, and 155 are cats.\n\nKansas\n\nGoddard: Visitors to a splash park near Wichita may have been exposed to two additional types of bacteria, according to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. The department on Friday added coliform and E. coli to the list of bacteria possibly encountered by patrons of Tanganyika Wildlife Park’s splash park, The Wichita Eagle reports. The state health department had previously reported three people who attended the park tested positive for Shigella. That number has risen to six. People who visited the splash park also have tested positive for the norovirus, sapovirus and a type of E. coli called enteropathogenic E. coli, the state health department said. The splash park has been closed since June 19. Also Friday, more customers joined a lawsuit against the park, alleging they became “violently ill and suffered repeated bouts of vomiting, diarrhea, headaches and fever and other symptoms due to the negligence and/or carelessness” of the park. On June 19, the park wrote on Facebook that the splash park was being closed due to a filtration system problem and that officials were “working diligently to remedy the issue.” A park official did not respond to requests for comment from the Eagle.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Almost exactly a year after his bid for U.S. Senate came up just short in the Democratic primary, Charles Booker formally launched a new campaign Thursday, this time hoping to unseat incumbent Republican Sen. Rand Paul in 2022. Booker kicked off his candidacy at a rally before a few hundred energetic supporters in Louisville’s majority-Black West End, just a block from the district he represented for one term in the state House. “We’re ready to prove the doubters wrong and make history,” he said to applause at the end of a 35-minute speech. “We’re going to win this race, and we’re going to transform Kentucky, and it starts right now.” Booker formed an exploratory committee for a potential run in April, saying he’d travel the state and listen to Kentuckians to gauge if there was enough support for him to win a race against Paul, who has said he’ll seek a third term. In an interview, Booker said his campaign will build on the themes and issues of his 2020 run and the Hood to the Holler nonprofit advocacy group he formed in its wake. The progressive was a massive underdog last year in the primary against Amy McGrath, who greatly outspent him and had the backing of the national party establishment, yet fell just 3 percentage points shy of an upset. Despite also outspending Sen. Mitch McConnell in the general election, McGrath went on to be blown out by the Republican Senate leader in November – a common outcome for Democratic statewide candidates over the past decade.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Fireworks returned to the city on Independence Day thanks to actor Will Smith. Smith offered to pick up the roughly $100,000 tab for the pyrotechnics over the Mississippi River after learning New Orleans didn’t plan a 2021 show, city officials told news outlets. New Orleans canceled last year’s fireworks because of the coronavirus pandemic. Smith is in New Orleans working on his latest film, “Emancipation,” which will tell the story of a slave, Peter, who escaped a Louisiana plantation and whose photo of scars on his back from being whipped exposed the brutality of slavery. He would also fight for the Union in the Civil War. Smith moved production of the film from Georgia to Louisiana in early April after Georgia passed a new voting law that prompted a federal lawsuit saying the overhaul was intended to deny Black voters equal access to the ballot.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Former two-term Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who liked to compare himself to former President Donald Trump, formally announced Monday that he’s launching a campaign for a third term. LePage has not been shy about criticizing his successor, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, over fiscal policies and her actions during the coronavirus pandemic. “Maine faces several challenges and we must work toward building a better future based on individual liberty, fiscal responsibility, and an economy which empowers everyone including our rural communities,” he said in a statement. There will be a fall campaign kickoff, he said. The Mills campaign responded by pointing to her successes in expanding Medicaid, investing in education, providing property tax relief and promoting clean energy jobs, “all while leading Maine through a global pandemic with near best-in-the nation results.” LePage’s announcement came four days after paperwork was filed with the state ethics commission. Under the Maine Constitution, he was limited to two consecutive terms but could run again after sitting out a term. He’d have to submit additional paperwork with the secretary of state’s office next year.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Fireworks were unintentionally detonated as they were being set up for an Independence Day show in the beach town, leaving employees of the fireworks company with minor injuries, authorities said Sunday. A few hours after the blast, the city announced that the day’s fireworks shows in multiple locations had been canceled out of an abundance of caution. The Ocean City Fire Department said in a news release that they were alerted to a vehicle fire Sunday morning and responded to find the fireworks that had gone off on the beach. An undisclosed number of employees had minor injuries but declined transport to a hospital, according to the news release. Numerous videos of the explosion posted to social media showed the fireworks popping and crackling near a crowded beach. A safe zone around the fireworks area prevented any beach or boardwalk patrons from being injured, the fire department said. The city said in a news release Sunday afternoon announcing the fireworks show cancellations that the cause of the discharge was unknown. “A perimeter around the fireworks site has been established and will remain in place until the safety inspections are complete, which could take several days,” the news release said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWakefield: The Massachusetts State Police have identified eight of 11 male suspects who were arrested following an hours­long armed standoff that partially shut down Interstate 95. They were charged with a variety of offenses, including unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition and the use of body armor in commission of a crime, police said in a news release late Saturday. Troopers recovered three AR-15 rifles, two pistols, a bolt-action rifle, a shotgun and a short-barrel rifle. The group refers to itself as a militia and said its members adhere to “Moorish Sovereign Ideology,” police said. One of the people arrested was a male juvenile, and two others refused to give their names. The standoff began early Saturday when a Massachusetts State Police trooper stopped to offer assistance to the vehicles he found on the side of the highway in Wakefield. Police later said they were refueling. The trooper called for backup, and most of the group went into the nearby woods until they surrendered to a police tactical team just after 10 a.m. The standoff closed Interstate 95 in the area during the busy holiday weekend, and some residents were told to shelter in place. During the standoff, a member broadcast on a social media account of the group “Rise of the Moors” that they were not anti-government or anti-police.\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: President Joe Biden stayed mum on policy during a Saturday trip to the state, focusing instead on cherries – and cherry pie and cherry ice cream – and voters who were mask-free as coronavirus restrictions have eased. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer greeted Biden when he arrived midday in Traverse City, which is hosting the National Cherry Festival. They skipped the festival, however, in favor of a cherry farm in nearby Antrim County, where Biden pitched his immigration plans when chatting with two couples from Guatemala who were picking fruit. He then greeted a long line of enthusiastic supporters stretched out behind a rope. His trip was billed as part of a broader campaign by the administration to drum up public support for his bipartisan infrastructure package and other policies geared toward families and education. But the president was out for direct contact with voters and refrained from delivering remarks about his policy proposals. Whitmer told reporters she spoke to Biden about infrastructure. In recent flooding, she said the state saw “under-invested infrastructure collide with climate change,” and the freeways were underwater. “That’s why this infrastructure package is so important. That’s also why I got the president rocky road fudge from Mackinac Island for his trip here,” she said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nGlen: A family of three bald eagles that were rescued and treated for injuries in a suspected raccoon attack have been released into the wild in eastern Minnesota. Lt. Robert Gorecki, a conservation officer with the state Department of Natural Resources, released the birds Friday in the town of Glen, with help from members of the family who found the injured eagles June 21 at their Clear Lake cabin. Leslie and Ryan Donohue’s four children, ranging in age from 4 to 12, spotted two adult eagles on the ground below their nest on the family’s property. They were adults, unable to fly, suffering from wounds that Gorecki speculated may have been inflicted by a raccoon. They were taken to an animal hospital, the Star Tribune reports. An eaglet, not yet able to fly, was stranded in the nest 55 feet above. It was not injured but would have starved to death the next day or the day after, Gorecki said. The following day, an employee from Bollig Tree Service climbed the white pine and retrieved the young eagle. When he approached, another young bird, apparently a sibling, flew out of the nest and disappeared. Experts are hoping it could find roadkill or something else to eat. The nest also contained an unhatched egg, which may have attracted a hungry carnivore.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: A heritage center focused on sharing the history and culture of the Chickasaw Nation is coming to the city. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports the Chickasaw Heritage Center’s mission will be to interpret and explain the story of the Chickasaw Nation from the perspective of its people. The story of the Chickasaw has often been told through the lens of non-native people, said Brady Davis, the CEO of the Chickasaw Inkana Foundation. “When I refer to the Chickasaw perspective, I want to reinforce that this facility will be unique in that it tells the Chickasaw story from their perspective,” Davis said. The Chickasaw lived across millions of acres of land in northeast Mississippi, northwest Alabama, west Tennessee and southwest Kentucky. They were forcibly removed from their homeland, the heart of which is modern-day Tupelo, by the U.S. government following the Indian Removal Act in the 1830s. The facility planned will house an exhibit hall, a theater, a gift shop, a cafe, a reconstructed village area and other attractions. The center is estimated to generate $6 million annually. The foundation is seeking $16 million in state support to complete the project. The state has provided $6 million so far, according to Davis. The Chickasaw Nation will match the funds dollar-for-dollar.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson’s administration floated the idea of a statewide COVID-19 vaccination incentive program and the possibility of a “substantial grand prize” during a meeting of health officials, a newspaper reports. The Kansas City Star said it obtained notes from a June 25 Zoom meeting of the Missouri Center for Public Health Excellence during which a senior state Department of Health and Senior Services official shared the concept. The notes from the meeting compiled by the center’s secretary said of a potential program: “Will likely start in July. Working with MO state lottery. 3 separate drawing structures.” Consideration of incentives comes as the fast-spreading delta variant of the coronavirus ravages rural Missouri. The state has one of the nation’s highest rates of COVID-19 transmission and, according to the CDC, has recently led the nation in the proportion of delta variant cases. Less than 40% of Missouri’s population has been fully vaccinated, and the figure is less than 20% in some rural counties. Asked about incentives this past week, Parson said: “Everything is on the table.” A Parson spokesperson said Friday only that work is continuing on potential incentive options. According to the notes from the June 25 meeting, educational scholarships for adolescents are also contemplated.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Federal officials have given preliminary approval to a conservation group’s contentious proposal to expand bison grazing on public lands in north-central Montana. The Bureau of Land Management said there would be no significant environmental impacts from the proposal covering about 108 square miles south of Malta. That sets the stage for possible final approval of the American Prairie Reserve’s plan following a two-month comment period that began July 1. The Bozeman-based group in 2019 had scaled back its original request to graze bison across more than 450 square miles following opposition from ranchers who worry about being pushed out of the area. The group’s long-term goal remains unchanged: a 5,000-square-mile expanse of public and private lands with at least 10,000 bison. Gov. Greg Gianforte criticized federal officials for scheduling a single virtual meeting, on July 21, before a final decision could be made. The meeting coincides with harvest season and as ranchers are dealing with severe drought, Gianforte said. He called for hold in-person meetings in each of the affected counties: Phillips, Choteau, Fergus, Petroleum and Valley. Massive herds of bison once migrated through the area before the animals were hunted to near-extinction in the 19th century.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Thirty state senators urged local school boards in a joint public statement Thursday to reject proposed state health standards that include lessons for young children on gender identity and gender expression. The standards under consideration by the Nebraska Department of Education would be optional if approved, so school districts would be free to accept or ignore them. Under the proposed standards, kindergartners would learn about different kinds of family structures, including same-gender families. First graders would be taught about gender identity and gender stereotypes. Students in fourth grade would be taught the difference between sex assigned at birth and gender identity. Sixth graders would learn about a range of identities related to sexual orientation, including heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian, gay, queer, two-spirit, asexual and pansexual. They would be taught the differences among cisgender, transgender, gender nonbinary, gender expansive and gender identity. The proposal has drawn huge crowds to education board meetings and faced strong opposition from Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts, who has no direct influence over the state board. Supporters have said it’s important to give children scientifically accurate information. All but one of the 30 senators who signed the statement are Republicans.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The title of Miss Nevada USA has gone to a transgender woman for the first time in the pageant’s history. Kataluna Enriquez was crowned the winner late last month and will go on to represent the state in the Miss USA competition in November. “It’s a huge honor to win, especially during Pride Month,” Enriquez said. “I wasn’t nervous. I knew that I had worked really hard, and I had my one shot at making history.” Enriquez, 27, took part in transgender pageants beginning in 2016 when she was working as a model. She began competing in cisgender pageants last year. In March, Enriquez earned the title of Miss Silver State USA. “I wanted to share my story and present that I was more than just a body,” Enriquez said following her March win. She spent two months designing and sewing the gowns she wore to register and compete in the Miss Nevada USA pageant June 27, including a pastel blue and pink gown evocative of the transgender pride flag and a shimmering floor-length halter with ombre rainbow sequins. “It wasn’t even in my head that the day I won was the anniversary of Stonewall,” Enriquez said, referencing the 1969 police raid and subsequent demonstrations that catalyzed the LGBTQ+ rights movement. “I felt like everything lined up. I’m thankful. We won. We made history.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNorth Conway: A cat has made it to the summit of the state’s 48 tallest mountains, spending parts of the journey peering out from the comfort of her owner’s backpack. Floki has grown from kitten to cat in the nine months since she and owner Mel Elam, of North Conway, started their journey to the top of the state’s 4,000-footers. Last on their list was Mount Washington, the highest summit in the Northeast at 6,288 feet, which they reached late last month. “We did it!” Elam posted on social media, where she chronicled her “Adventures with Floki,” accompanied by photos and video. Elam adopted Floki from a shelter last year after losing another beloved hiking companion, her dog. A harness is attached to Floki when she’s in the backpack, and she’s on a leash when she walks along a trail. In colder weather, she wore a vest. “There’s a lot of people that are like, ‘Oh, my gosh. Please tell me that is not it. What are you going to do next? Pease keep posting. We love following your adventures.’ And I’m like, ‘Oh no, we’re still going to be out there,’ ” Elam told WMUR-TV. Elam said she and Floki are considering the “52 With a View,” mountains in New Hampshire with elevations under 4,000 feet and great views.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPort Republic: A casino and two other restaurants in Atlantic City are saving the oyster shells left over from their diners. The state Department of Environmental Protection collects the shells, and workers and volunteers with Rutgers and Stockton universities and the Jetty Rock Foundation load them on barges and dump them into the Mullica River. That waterway is home to one of the last self-sustaining oyster populations on the Atlantic coast, according to Shawn LaTourette, the state’s environmental commissioner. The clam, oyster and other shells form the basis of new or expanded oyster colonies when free-floating baby oysters, known as spat, attach to the shells and begin to grow on them. “You have the benefit not only of ecological restoration, but it has kept 65 tons of shells out of landfills,” said Scott Stueber, a fisheries biologist with the DEP. That helps the eateries save on waste disposal costs. The program began in 2019 and currently collects oysters from the Hard Rock casino, the Knife & Fork restaurant and Dock’s Oyster House. Several other casinos have expressed interest in joining. Oysters are nature’s filters: A single adult oyster can can strain particles and contaminants from 50 gallons of water a day. In addition to improving water quality, oyster colonies also are being planted along coastlines as a shore stabilization and storm mitigation strategy.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Federal relief funds will be used to offer back-to-work bonuses of up to $1,000 for residents who find a job in the coming weeks and stop receiving unemployment insurance benefits, state labor officials announced Friday. The program from Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is aimed at encouraging a return to work before federal unemployment supplements expire in early September. The new support payments decline gradually from $1,000 to $400 by late July, providing a bigger payout the sooner a job is secured. The federal supplement provides an extra $300 a week on top of state unemployment benefits. “If we can make it even just one degree easier for someone to get back to work, helping offset transition costs, then we’ve got to do that,” the governor said in a news release. Some businesses have complained that expanded federal aid to the unemployed – especially the $300-a-week supplemental benefit, intended to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic – has discouraged people from looking for a job. But other factors also are believed to have contributed to the shortage of people seeking work again, from difficulty arranging or affording child care to lingering fears of COVID-19.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: After a year lost to the coronavirus, the city’s most well-known Fourth of July traditions were back Sunday. The traditional Macy’s Fourth of July fireworks show returned in full form with a display over the East River, as shells were shot from five barges in a televised, choreographed spectacle. This year, crowds were welcome to gather. The show was broadcast live on NBC as part of a two-hour special featuring prerecorded performances from artists including the Black Pumas, Coldplay, OneRepublic and Reba McEntire. Last year, because of pandemic restrictions, there were a series of shorter fireworks shows in the days leading up to the holiday, with the locations kept secret in advance to keep people from congregating. “It’s hugely significant because we’re all back together again. We were apart for so long,” said Mike Marrone, who took in the fireworks among a throng of onlookers along the Franklin D. Roosevelt parkway. The annual spectacle of gluttony that is the Nathan’s Famous July Fourth hot dog eating contest also once again welcomed live audiences to watch the epic chowdown in Brooklyn. Joey “Jaws” Chestnut topped his own record by downing 76 franks and buns in 10 minutes in the men’s competition, while Michelle Lesco took the women’s title by eating 30 3/ 4 wieners and buns.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: Predictions of a baby boom during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown have gone bust in the state, according to a team of researchers. Data compiled by Carolina Demography showed that birth rates in North Carolina fell by 3.1% from 2019 to 2020, in line with a national decline of 3.8% over the same period, the News & Observer reports. Carolina Demography is located within the Carolina Population Center at University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Boone Turchi, an associate professor of economics at UNC, said the skyrocketing unemployment rates during the COVID-19 pandemic likely prompted many people to wait to have children. Birth rates were falling before the pandemic. In North Carolina, birth rates decreased by 0.96% each year on average between 2015 and 2020.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Firefighters spent the Fourth of July racing from one blaze to another as residents launched a barrage of illegal fireworks. The Fargo Fire Department issued a news release early Monday morning saying firefighters responded to 15 fires Sunday, 12 of which were fireworks-related. There were two grass fires, three dumpster fires, one wood chip fire and nine structure fires. Only one fire resulted in significant damage. That blazed burned out an apartment garage. Other attached garages saw smoke damage. The fire department also helped a person who lost a thumb and finger in a fireworks explosion. Fireworks are illegal anywhere in the city. Police responded to more than 80 fireworks complaints, the fire department said. Things were much quieter in Bismarck, North Dakota’s second-biggest city, where fireworks also were banned. Police Sgt. Loren Grensteiner said no blazes caused by fireworks were reported. “It was pretty normal for the Fourth,” he said. “We had your normal fireworks calls, but we weren’t inundated with them.” Private use of fireworks during the July Fourth holiday season was banned across the state due to widespread drought. North Dakota has experienced some of the driest winter and spring months this year.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Refunding fines to businesses cited for violating public health orders during the coronavirus pandemic would send a “horrible” message to the vast majority of companies that followed the rules, GOP Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday as he explained why he vetoed the budget provision. The measure included in the budget by fellow Republican lawmakers would have stopped disciplinary actions against companies and refunded payment of any fines. Total fines were only estimated at about $100,000. DeWine also vetoed a Republican measure that would have allowed the House speaker and Senate president to intervene in legal challenges to the upcoming process of creating new, more representative legislative districts. DeWine called this an unprecedented violation of the separation of powers. Disappointing abortion rights advocates, the governor left in place new mandates that physicians who provide backup coverage at local hospitals as part of required patient-transfer agreements with abortion clinics must practice within 25 miles of the clinics. DeWine also left in place language allowing doctors and other medical practitioners, hospitals and insurance companies to refuse to perform or pay for procedures that violate the individuals’ or institutions’ conscience on moral, ethical or religious grounds.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: COVID-19 vaccination rates for the state’s youth have fallen below health officials’ expectations. With a little over a month left before the next school year, the Oklahoma State Department of Health is “not satisfied” with the number of vaccinated adolescents and teenagers, said Keith Reed, deputy health commissioner. “It’s definitely been lower than our expectations,” he said. “We need many more vaccinated in order to stop transmission among this group, especially when they gather back together in school settings.” The Pfizer vaccine has been available since May to children as young as 12. Only 20.1% of Oklahomans ages 12-17 have had at least one vaccine dose, and 14% are fully vaccinated, according to the state health department. Nationally, 32% of the 12-17 age group has had at least one dose, Washington Post data shows. State health officials thought vaccinations of children might mirror the rate of the adult population, Reed said, because minors need permission from a parent or guardian to get a COVID-19 vaccination. About 57% of Oklahoma adults have had their first dose, and 49% are fully vaccinated. The rate of doses administered is falling in the state, both for adults and children. But Reed said minors never showed the same surge in demand for vaccines that adults did.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state on Friday reached the milestone of 70% of adults having received at least their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, according to officials from the state health authority. “The 70% adult vaccination goal means we have a better chance to sustain a safe reopening,” said Patrick Allen, director of the Oregon Health Authority. “But COVID-19 hasn’t gone away. It’s our goal to vaccinate 8 in 10 people across Oregon, particularly adults in communities of color and other under-vaccinated groups.” Health officials say the state reached the vaccination goal through the efforts of more than 660 vaccination sites, operated by health care providers, community-based organizations, tribal partners, health authorities, pharmacies, volunteers, the Oregon National Guard and retired health care workers. Last week, after more than 15 months of restrictions, Oregon fully reopened, lifting mask requirements and limits on physical distancing and capacity. There are some exceptions, including federal rules; masks will still be required at airports, on public transportation and in health care settings. In addition, businesses can still require customers to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination to forgo wearing them.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Police say scores of members of a group described by the Anti-Defamation League as white supremacist marched in the city over the weekend, clashing with pedestrians and setting off what were believed to be smoke bombs at one point. The group of Patriot Front members, estimated at 150 to 200 people, marched for several blocks in Center City wearing tan pants and black shirts with face coverings and carrying shields and flags. Police said they were chanting slogans such as “Reclaim America” and “the election was stolen.” Police said pedestrians “engaged members of the group verbally,” and there were several physical encounters. Finally, someone from the group used what police believe were smoke bombs “to cover their retreat as they fled,” police said. Police didn’t announce any arrests and said there were no reports of any damage or injuries during the march, which came on the eve of first lady Jill Biden’s visit to the city for Independence Day festivities. The Anti-Defamation League calls the Texas-based group “a white supremacist group” that “espouses racism, anti-Semitism and intolerance under the guise of preserving the ‘ethnic and cultural origins’ of their European ancestors.” It also says the group “participates in localized ‘flash mobs’ and torch marches/demonstrations.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The Preservation Society of Newport County is holding a series of lectures this summer entitled “Gilded Age Games” about how people amused themselves with games and sports at the turn of the 20th century. It is the first time since February 2020 that in-person lectures will be held at the Newport mansions. Each of the five presentations also will be viewable via Zoom. “Gilded Age Games” examines the games and amusements enjoyed by Americans around the turn of the 20th century, whether played around a table, outside on the field, or on the ocean. The series will also include presentations by the Preservation Society’s four Research Fellows about the projects on which they are working. The first lecture was held Thursday. The next one is scheduled for July 15 at Rosecliff. Lectures are also scheduled for July 29, Aug. 5 and Aug. 12. Attendance is free, but preregistration is required at newportmansions.org/learn/adult-programs.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The state’s lone Democratic U.S. House member is joining with the other six Republican members to create a trail to help link and preserve Revolutionary War sites in the Carolinas. South Carolina leaders have tried for more than a decade to create the trail that would begin near Charleston, then wind into the Midlands and Upstate, into the North Carolina mountains and Piedmont, then back toward Wilmington. Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn testified last month before a House subcommittee in favor of the Southern Campaign of the Revolution National Heritage Corridor Act, The Post and Courier of Charleston reports. “It is a personal mission of mine to increase public awareness of and appreciation for natural, historical, scenic and cultural resources associated with the Southern Campaign,” Clyburn said June 15. “It is my hope that the creation of this Heritage Corridor will also draw visitors to battlefields and historical landmarks located in communities across the Carolinas that are rich in history.” Among the South Carolina sites on the trail would be Charleston Harbor, Marion’s guerrilla warfare in the Pee Dee, the Cowpens National Battlefield and the Battle of Kings Mountain.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The leader of an Indigenous-led advocacy organization has gone to court to seek dismissal of charges against him related to a protest during President Donald Trump’s visit to Mount Rushmore last July. NDN Collective President Nick Tilsen claims prosecutorial misconduct and violations of his rights to a speedy trial and free speech. Tilsen was among protesters arrested during Trump’s visit and agreed to participate in a diversion program rather than face time in prison if convicted of charges against him. Tilsen claims the Pennington County State’s Attorney’s Office backed out of the agreement after he spoke to the media about it in March. In his motions for dismissal, Tilsen claims his remarks to the media were protected by the First Amendment. The documents claim the state’s decision to reinstate Tilsen’s charges were directly connected to his protected speech and were reinstated as punishment for it, the Rapid City Journal reports. Tilsen’s attorneys also claim the delay in executing the agreement and then reinstating the charges violated Tilsen’s right to a speedy trial. “The prosecutor has abused their position of power and privilege to try to silence myself. These are all grounds for dismissal,” Tilsen said. “Here we are, another lie made to our people by another white man in power. And we’re tired of that.”\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Environmentalists and activists claimed victory Saturday after a company canceled plans to build an oil pipeline over an aquifer that provides drinking water to 1million people. Byhalia Connection said it will no longer pursue plans to build a 49-mile underground artery that would have linked two major U.S. oil pipelines while running through wetlands and under poor, predominantly Black neighborhoods in south Memphis. A joint venture between Valero and Plains All American Pipeline, Byhalia Connection had said the pipeline would bring jobs and tax revenue to the region, and it had given to Memphis-area charities and tried to build goodwill in the community. But in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday, Byhalia Connection said it was canceling the project “due to lower U.S. oil production resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.” Environmentalists, activist groups, lawyers, property owners, national and local elected officials, and even former Vice President Al Gore opposed the project. The pipeline would have run under neighborhoods such as White Chapel, Westwood and Boxtown, which began as a community of freed slaves in the 1860s and where homes had no running water or electricity as recently as the 1970s. Justin J. Pearson, a leader of the Memphis Community Against the Pipeline activist group, called the decision “an extraordinary testament to what Memphis and Shelby County can do when citizens build power toward justice.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Republican Allen West, the former Florida congressman and firebrand who rode into office on the tea party wave a decade ago, said Sunday that he will run for governor of Texas in a bid to again seize on restless anger from the right. His odds are far longer this time around: Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who is up for a third term and may also be eyeing a 2024 presidential bid, has already locked up the endorsement of Donald Trump, whose voters West would need to have any shot at winning a GOP primary in Texas. The hurdles don’t stop there. Abbott is the most prodigious fundraiser of any governor in America, having started the year with nearly $40 million already socked away, and West is shunned by power brokers in his own party. Last month, he stepped down as chairman of the Texas GOP after spending a year using the platform to antagonize Abbott and other Republicans whom he deemed insufficiently conservative. Still, West’s celebrity in the grassroots that lingers from a combative one term in the U.S. House makes him the most prominent primary challenge Abbott has faced since becoming governor in 2015. Already there have been signs of Abbott moving to protect his right flank, passing ever-looser gun laws that he never previously endorsed and picking up Trump’s immigration mantle along the border.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Stymied by restrictions on the student newspaper at Brigham Young University, some former staffers have launched their own underground, independent publication not controlled by the school that’s owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Students writing for The Daily Universe aren’t allowed to report anything that’s critical of the school or the church, including any mention of the faith’s past support for polygamy or segregation that “could cause embarrassment” now, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Reporters should also avoid the topics of drugs, sex education, birth control, evolution and other “claims of science,” according to rules established for the publication in the 1970s that largely remain in place today. The students’ new paper, Prodigal Press, covers what happens on campus without the limitations that come with the university’s sanction. Martha Harris, a senior in the school’s journalism program who was frustrated by the “minefield of censorship, both spoken and unspoken” at the official newspaper, reported the cover story for the second issue of Prodigal Press, a piece on discrimination LGBTQ students describe encountering at the conservative Provo school. The story included Harris’ personal experiences, as someone who is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns, choosing a restroom on campus and being called derogatory names. The same pitch was rejected at the campus paper. The private university has a rich legacy of independent publications that started as early as 1906. The first, titled The Radical, printed one 32-page edition that called for a cafeteria on campus and more resources at the library. The requests were granted.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The tax-free purchase of feminine hygiene products, the legal requirement for sexual consent, and prison reforms protecting inmates are among new laws that took effect at the start of July. Vermont became the 22nd state to make the purchase of feminine hygiene products tax-free as of Thursday, mynbc5.com reports. “It’s taken a long time and probably a lot of federal money for other purposes to build up the courage to remove a tax on a basic necessary product for women and people who menstruate,” state Sen. Kesha Ram, a Democrat, said Thursday. The Legislature also passed a law saying a person who is asleep, unconscious or significantly under the influence is now legally unable to provide consent to a sexual act. Prison measures include the prohibition of sexual relations with prison staff and the creation of a review board to improve prison conditions. “What this does is create some mechanisms for corrections to investigate itself with a kind of internal affairs unit and also for oversight by an external board,” Defender General Matt Valerio said. Also, the maximum weekly unemployment benefit in the state rose to $583, an increase of $52.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Data shows deaths in car crashes rose statewide last year, even as Virginians drove less due to the coronavirus pandemic. Crash fatalities increased by 2% from 827 in 2019 to 847 in 2020, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports, citing data from the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles. “Because there was less traffic on the roadways, that seemed to, for whatever reason, encourage folks to think that they could drive faster because there was less congestion on the highways,” John Saunders, Virginia Highway Safety office director for the Department of Motor Vehicles, told the newspaper. “And when you get increased speeds, even though you may have fewer crashes, the crashes you do have are much more severe crashes because of the increase in speed.” With the July Fourth weekend expected to be busy with travelers, Virginia State Police increased patrolling through Monday at midnight. The Virginia Department of Transportation was also halting highway lane closures and many highway work zones on major roads and interstates until Tuesday to help alleviate traffic.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A 72-foot-tall totem pole that was erected more than a century ago as a tourist attraction in western Washington but has no connection with local tribes will be removed. The News Tribune reports the totem pole at Firefighter’s Park in Tacoma will be removed in about a month following a decision by the City Council on Tuesday. The totem pole erected in 1903 by local businessmen was meant to compete for tourists with a totem pole in Seattle. Two anonymous artists carved the totem pole in Tacoma at a Vashon Island lumberyard. The city’s Arts Commission in March decided to remove the totem pole from Tacoma’s municipal art collection. The City Council on Tuesday then voted unanimously to take the totem pole off the city’s historic register, where it had been listed since the 1970s. That cleared the way for its removal. The Puyallup Tribe had sought the removal. “There has been a lot of trauma, and we have to tell the true story in order to be able to heal,” said Puyallup Tribal Councilwoman Annette Bryan. Tacoma Arts Administrator Amy McBride said the totem pole will likely be cut into pieces, with a possibility a portion might go to the Tacoma Historical Society, where a display would include its full history. McBride said officials hope to commission new tribal artwork for the park.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Elementary school students across the state will receive an array of free books this summer. The state Department of Education is entering the second year of the West Virginia Blue Ribbon Book Club, distributing 258,000 books to public school children entering grades one through three. Books will be shipped by the end of this month. Teachers also will receive books in order to create lesson plans for the upcoming school year, the department said in a news release. “This year, we were able to expand the program to include our third graders, which means more books in the hands of our youngest learners,” state schools Superintendent Clayton Burch said. The book club is a partnership among the department, the Marshall University June Harless Center and the Dollywood Foundation. The department also has included a lineup of celebrity readers on its website, including West Virginia men’s basketball coach Bob Huggins and men’s soccer coach Chris Grassie of national champion Marshall.\n\nWisconsin\n\nPoynette: The world’s tallest horse has died. The 20-year-old Belgian named Big Jake lived on Smokey Hollow Farm in Poynette. Valicia Gilbert, wife of the farm’s owner, Jerry Gilbert, said Big Jake died about two weeks ago. “We would rather not remember him by a date – it’s been a traumatic event for our family,” she said. Big Jake was 6-foot-10 and weighed 2,500 pounds. The Guinness Book of World Records certified him as the world’s tallest living horse in 2010. Jerry Gilbert told WMTV that Big Jake was a “superstar” and a “truly magnificent animal.” He said Big Jake was born in Nebraska and weighed 240 pounds at birth, about 100 pounds more than a typical Belgian foal. He said he plans to memorialize Big Jake by keeping his stall empty and inserting a brick on the outside of it with his picture and name. “It’s very quiet (at the farm),” Jerry Gilbert said. “The other horses know. I think they have their own grieving time because Jake was the center of attention around here. There is a huge void. It feels like he’s still here, but he’s not.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state is making a bid to land the headquarters of the National Rifle Association. Gov. Mark Gordon and Secretary of State Ed Buchanan asked the firearms advocacy and lobbying organization in a letter released to the public last week to relocate to Wyoming from Fairfax, Virginia. The two Republicans sent the letter June 18 and as of Tuesday hadn’t heard back from the group, state officials told the Casper Star-Tribune. The letter cited Wyoming’s lack of taxes and gun regulations as reasons it would be a good home for the NRA. “We have permitless carry, the castle doctrine, anti-financial discrimination laws, permitless purchase and possession for rifles, shotguns and handguns, no registration requirements and several other pro-Second Amendment laws on the books,” the letter said. Guns are popular in GOP-dominated Wyoming, and the Legislature has sought to ease gun rules further. Wyoming is home to several firearms manufacturers including Magpul and Weatherby. The NRA already has indicated it plans to move to Texas. The group attempted to file for bankruptcy in January, but a judge dismissed the request, finding it was not filed in good faith.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/06"}]}

She passed away peacefully at hospital this morning, Wednesday, November 30th 2022, following a short illness,” the statement reads. “She was in the company of her family.”\n\nThe statement went on to read: “We kindly ask that you respect the family’s privacy at this extremely painful time, and we would like everyone to keep Christine in their hearts and remember the life of an incredible human being, and revered musician who was loved universally.”\n\nFleetwood Mac paid tribute to McVie in a statement, which was also posted on her account.\n\n“There are no words to describe our sadness at the passing of Christine McVie,” the band’s statement read. “She was truly one-of-a-kind, special and talented beyond measure. She was the best musician anyone could have in their band and the best friend anyone could have in their life.”\n\nBorn in Greenodd in the United Kingdom to a father who was a music teacher, McVie was a classically trained musician who performed under the name Christine Perfect with the British band Chicken Shack in the late 1960s.\n\nShe linked up with Fleetwood Mac after marrying its bass guitarist, John McVie, at a time when the band was being led by guitarist and founder Peter Green.\n\n“Chicken Shack used to open for [Fleetwood Mac],” she told The Guardian in June 2022. “I got to know John, fell in love with him and it was just sensational and exciting. Fleetwood Mac were fantastic and really funny.”\n\nThe group underwent several member changes before Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined in 1974 and the band shot to super stardom.\n\nMcVie wrote and/or sang several of their hits including “Don’t Stop,” “Over My Head,” “You Make Loving Fun” and “Say You Love Me.”\n\nFleetwood Mac underwent some instability with both the ending of the McVies’ marriage, as well as Buckingham and Nicks’ personal relationship.\n\nBuckingham opted to leave the band and go solo in 1987, followed by Nicks who went solo in 1990.\n\nMcVie also went solo and earlier this year released a compilation of her solo work titled “Songbird (A Solo Collection).”\n\nBut despite the band’s interpersonal struggles, their musical chemistry was undeniable and they did eventually reunite.\n\n“I just wanted to embrace being in the English countryside and not have to troop around on the road. I moved to Kent, and I loved being able to walk around the streets, nobody knowing who I was. Then of course I started to miss it,” McVie told The Guardian about her 16 year hiatus from Fleetwood Mac. “I called Mick and asked: ‘How would you feel about me coming back to the band?’ He got in touch with everybody and we had a band meeting over the phone and they all went: ‘Come baaaack!!’ I felt regenerated and I felt like writing again.”\n\nFleetwood Mac was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nHonoring a ‘sweet soul’\n\nTributes for McVie poured in to social media on Wednesday.\n\n“We were so lucky to have a life with her,” Fleetwood Mac said in their statement. “Individually and together, we cherished Christine deeply and are thankful for the amazing memories we have. She will be so very missed.”\n\nNicks, meanwhile, shared a handwritten letter to her bandmate on Instagram, along with a photo of herself with McVie. “A few hours ago I was told that my best friend in the whole world since the first day of 1975, had passed away. I didn’t even know she was ill… until late Saturday night.”\n\nNicks said since learning of McVie’s illness, the song “Hallelujah” by Haim, a folksy ballad about friendship and loss, has been “swirling around” in her head. “I thought I might possibly get to sing it to her, and so, I’m singing it to her now.”\n\nAnn Wilson, of the band Heart, told CNN in a statement: “Christine was a gem.

She is the first member of the most commercially successful incarnation of the group – including her ex-husband John McVie (they were married from 1968 to 1976, but remained friendly as bandmates), Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham and band founder Mick Fleetwood – to die.\n\n'Best friend in the whole world':Stevie Nicks mourns Fleetwood Mac's Christine McVie\n\nNicks posted a tender note and song lyrics from the Haim song \"Hallelujah\" on social media, calling McVie \"my best friend in the whole world since the first day of 1975.\" Nicks said she only learned of McVie's illness on Saturday and was told to wait before heading to London to see her ailing musical partner.\n\nIn June, McVie told Rolling Stone that she suffered from scoliosis and was trying to “get my back better and get myself into decent shape again.”\n\nAs an integral part of Fleetwood Mac's lush sound, her mellifluous vocals painted many of their biggest hits, including “Don’t Stop,” “You Make Loving Fun,” “Hold Me,” “Everywhere,” “Little Lies” and the song that closed many of the band’s concerts, “Songbird.”\n\nIn addition to her decades of success with Fleetwood Mac, McVie fostered a thriving solo career.\n\nHer eponymous second solo album, released in 1984, lifted her into the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 with “Got a Hold on Me,” another of her sweet-yet-sophisticated pop songs.\n\nIn 2017, McVie paired with Buckingham for the album “Lindsey Buckingham/Christine McVie,” and the pair embarked on a 38-date tour that summer.\n\n'Beautiful genius':Irene Cara, Oscar-winning 'Flashdance' singer and actress, dies at 63\n\nBut being on stage was never McVie’s calling. Following Fleetwood Mac’s 1990 Behind the Mask tour, McVie decided to stop touring with Fleetwood Mac, even though she remained a member of the band and continued to write songs for their records.\n\nAlong with Fleetwood Mac, McVie was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nShortly after their induction, the musician/singer took a lengthy reprieve from Fleetwood Mac – which she attributed to her fear of flying and panic attacks about performing – to live in the English countryside. She rejoined the band in 2014 for its On With the Show tour and returned to the stage with the Buckingham-less group in 2018 and 2019 for a worldwide run on the band’s most recent tour, An Evening With Fleetwood Mac.\n\nMcVie told Rolling Stone that during her time away from the band, she “enjoyed having my dogs, living in the country, going for long walks. I just wasn’t interested in playing music at that point.” She added that after she decided to return to Fleetwood Mac, she “never regretted it.”\n\nBorn Christine Perfect in Lancashire, England, on July 12, 1943, McVie was introduced to music at an early age, as her father, Cyril, was a concert violinist and college music teacher. Her grandfather was an organist at Westminster Abbey.\n\nThough McVie’s musical journey was initially steeped in classical music, hearing the songs of Fats Domino and The Everly Brothers shifted her focus to rock ’n’ roll.\n\nHer early band, the blues-based Chicken Shack, had a hit in the U.K. in 1969 with the blues staple “I’d Rather Go Blind.” That same year, she married John McVie, already the bassist for the similarly blues-rooted Fleetwood Mac.\n\n'Guess I'm a rock star now':Dolly Parton joins Eminem, Duran Duran in Rock & Roll Hall of Fame\n\nLong a fan of the Peter Green-era of Fleetwood Mac – Christine played piano on the band’s second album, “Mr. Wonderful” – she officially joined the group in 1970 during a transitional period.\n\nAfter a few years of a rotating cast of musicians, the arrival of Buckingham and Nicks in 1975 kickstarted the commercial success of Fleetwood Mac, spearheaded by Christine-penned songs, “Over My Head” and “Say You Love Me,” on which she also sang lead vocals.\n\nThe intra-band drama of Fleetwood Mac has become legendary in the annals of pop music and much of it is documented in the band’s landmark 1977 album, “Rumours.” By then, a combination of drugs and fractured relationships – Buckingham and Nicks’ romantic tumult, the McVies' divorce – threatened to unravel the group. But instead, “Rumours” became its greatest success (it won the 1978 album of the year Grammy) thanks to tart pop songs such as “Go Your Own Way” and Nicks’ ethereal “Dreams.”\n\nAdele begins Las Vegas residency with emotion, tells fans:'Thank you for coming back to me'\n\nThe ensuing decades would bring McVie and Fleetwood Mac a more visual profile with the advent of MTV, as videos from 1982’s “Mirage” album (“Hold Me,” “Gypsy”) and 1987’s “Tango in the Night” (“Seven Wonders,” “Little Lies,” “Everywhere”) introduced the band to a younger generation.\n\nBut McVie, despite her vocal and songwriting prowess, never sought the spotlight, always content to stay perched behind her keyboards on stage.\n\nShe told Rolling Stone that one of the hardest parts about fame was “being noticed if you don’t want to be noticed.” But, she added, while not an extrovert, “I try to really be kind to people when they talk to me.

Shields defends her mother's artistic taste in this case, and says it all seems mild compared to what's \"permissible\" today. \"I was such a naïve, innocent child. I wasn't Lolita. I didn't have that precocious understanding of my sexuality.\"\n\nWith a laugh, she says her mother made other choices that were more detrimental to her career. \"I have more of a problem with her deciding it was a good idea for me to have a Brooke doll or the fashion head where you could design the hair,\" says Shields, who dismissed her mother as her manager when she married tennis star Andre Agassi in the 1990s.\n\nShields, who wrote frankly about her postpartum depression in 2005's Down Came the Rain, is just as revealing in her new memoir. She writes that she waited until she was 22 to lose her virginity (to college boyfriend and future Superman Dean Cain); she describes her shock when Agassi told her he had been addicted to crystal meth.\n\nShields has carved out a happy family life with second husband Chris Henchy, with whom she has two \"self-confident\" young daughters. Writing about her mother was more sad than cathartic, says Shields, who was with her mother when she died of dementia-related causes. \"I think catharsis usually comes from having anger, and being able to release the anger. I didn't harbor anger. It's just a shame to me,\" she says of her mother's life.\n\nShields, who has been in the public eye for so many years, acknowledges that getting older in Hollywood is a challenge. \"You're supposed to look 28 and the thing is, I don't want to be 28 again. I want to look the best I can from where I am now.\" But she also believes \"women are being more embraced for who they are and the experience they've had.\"\n\nShields currently provides the voice of buxom airhead Mrs. Goodman in the racy Adult Swim animated series Mr. Pickles, about a murderous dog. \"It's very interesting they asked me of all people,\" she says of the show's writers.\n\nAs for her next career move, Shields, who starred in the NBC sitcom Suddenly Susan from 1996-2000, says she'd like to get back in the TV game.\n\n\"I'm ready for comedy again,'' she says. \"I need a little jolt of comedy in my life.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/sport/mike-leach-death-mississippi-state-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Mike Leach: Mississippi State head football coach has died at 61 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMississippi State head football coach Mike Leach died Monday night from heart condition complications, the university announced on Tuesday.

Gallop\n\nFLORIDA TODAY\n\nAKRON, Ohio — Frank Freshwaters was a baby-faced 21-year-old newlywed — with no criminal record and a job in the booming rubber industry — when his speeding car slammed into a father of three who was walking home in the pre-midnight darkness on July 3, 1957.\n\nThat crash on South Arlington Street in southeast Akron ended one man's life and — for Freshwaters — set into motion a sequence of events seemingly lifted straight from a Hollywood screenplay.\n\nA story whose twists and turns — incarceration at the infamous prison featured in \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" an escape from a prison farm, life on the run using a fake identity, a new shot at freedom personally granted by West Virginia's governor — culminated in a simple knock on a trailer home door in Melbourne, 56 years later.\n\nFreshwaters answered the knock. Through the opened door, a Brevard County Sheriff's deputy held up a black-and-white picture of Freshwaters as a young man. He asked if Freshwaters, now 79 years old with a white beard, glasses and thinning white hair scooped into a ponytail, recognized that man.\n\n\"I haven't seen him in a long while,\" Freshwaters replied.\n\nThe deputy then asked the question, though they both knew the answer.\n\n\"It's you, isn't it?\"\n\nIt was.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service Northern Ohio Violent Fugitive Task Force in downtown Cleveland had created a new Cold Case Unit, which spent months unraveling Freshwaters' convoluted past. That unit tracked him down in Florida and directed his arrest.\n\n\"Freshwaters is the longest capture in the history of the U.S. Marshals, which dates to 1789,\" said Pete Elliott, U.S. Marshal for the Northern District of Ohio.\n\n\"Nobody in that time frame has ever been on the run for that long a time, 56 years, and later been captured by the U.S. Marshals. All over the nation,\" Elliott said.\n\n[Related: More about this series]\n\nThe year was 1957, and Akron — \"The Rubber Capital of the World\" — was a place of tire factories belching smoke. The industrial city fueled America's fast-growing love of the automobile and the post-war American dream of suburbia.\n\nGoodyear, Firestone, B.F. Goodrich and General Tire were headquartered in Akron. During the 1950s, the Buckeye State produced more than one-third of all tires and about 30 percent of all rubber products used in the United States, employing more than 85,000 workers, according to the Ohio History Connection.\n\nThe culture was also changing. It was the beginning of the Space Age, and baby boomers were coming of age to the raw sounds of Elvis and Johnny Cash. For many, it was an era of potential, even for someone with a ninth-grade education like Freshwaters.\n\nBut that July 3 night changed everything.\n\nThe man Freshwaters struck with his car was 24-year-old Eugene Flynt, an Army veteran and a Goodyear worker who had just parked his truck after his shift at the factory. He was crossing the road to return home to his wife and three young sons.\n\n\"His wife, Garnet, saw him park the truck and turned to put on coffee for him. She heard the crash and turned to the window to see him flying through the air,\" the Akron Beacon Journal reported in a front-page story.\n\nFreshwaters' vehicle had been traveling 50 mph in a 35 mph zone, according to his grand jury indictment, when it slammed into Flynt, killing him.\n\nFreshwaters was convicted of second-degree manslaughter. In 1959, he escaped from an Ohio State Reformatory prison farm, headed south and spent more than a half-century keeping his past secret and living under a new name: William Cox.\n\nFreshwaters' May arrest at the hands of the U.S. Marshals Service generated worldwide \"Shawshank\"-fueled media attention. The news came as a startling shock to Richard Flynt, Eugene's son. He was only 3 years old, the middle child among three young brothers, when his father was killed.\n\nToday, inside his North Canton brick home, he keeps a \"box of treasures\" — faded photographs, yellowed newspaper clippings, a laminated copy of his dad's obituary — that he received from relatives when he was 17 or 18. Relatives stored the box in a garage until Richard Flynt was \"old enough.\"\n\nOne cherished photo shows Eugene Flynt wearing a tilted cap and holding baby Richard next to a cement-block wall at a home construction site in Fayetteville, Tennessee.\n\nRichard Flynt's eyes look wistful behind his glasses when he thinks about his long-lost father.\n\n\"He was a hard-working man. He was in the military. Had a wife, three kids, living a normal life, trying to make it. I know nothing else about him other than what I've heard from his sisters. Almost all his relatives are dead, so the family's kind of fizzled down,\" he said.\n\nEugene Flynt grew up in Fayetteville, Tennessee. After serving as an Army paratrooper, he moved to Akron and worked at a Goodyear truck wheel plant on Seiberling Street.\n\nToday, Eugene Flynt is buried on a gentle grassy slope at Hillside Memorial Park near Ellet, Ohio. Richard Flynt keeps the U.S. flag that was draped on his father's casket, along with a box containing his military clothing.\n\nEnvision an enormous gray castle containing hundreds of prison cells — stacked six stories high, like human birdcages — housing a motley crew of murderers, rapists, thieves and other violent felons.\n\nThe dankness. The smells. The sounds.\n\nWelcome to the notorious Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio. Opened in 1896, home of the world's largest freestanding steel cell block, this towering penitentiary is where Freshwaters served six months for violating his probation for second-degree manslaughter.\n\n\"Guys were essentially being warehoused there 23 hours a day with no constructive activity. In addition, it was built in the 19th century. It was unhygienic: There were various vermin and rodents and everything else,\" said Niki Schwartz, a prominent Cleveland defense lawyer and prison reform advocate.\n\n\"So it was just a nightmare,\" Schwartz said.\n\nPrison life must have been a culture shock to Freshwaters, who was born and raised more than 60 miles away in economically vibrant Akron.\n\nWhen he was admitted at the Ohio State Reformatory, Freshwaters stood 5 feet, 10 inches and weighed a slender 151 pounds. He was 22 years old with a 17-year-old wife, Patricia, and a 1-year-old son, Jeff.\n\nUp to 1,200 prisoners lived in the East Cell Block, where steel cells measured 7 feet by 9 feet.\n\n\"They housed two inmates at any given time. They had a sink, a toilet, a writing desk and the two beds, usually a stool was in here,\" said Paul Smith, executive director of the Mansfield Reformatory Preservation Society, chatting outside a rusty ground-level East Cell Block cell.\n\n\"You spent most of your day in here, unless you were learning a trade out back in one of the woodshops, metal shops or getting a high school diploma,\" Smith said.\n\nFreshwaters was incarcerated in medium-level custody, and he worked at the prison hospital.\n\n\"The Hole,\" where Tim Robbins' \"Shawshank\" character Andy Dufresne was confined in isolation as punishment, was a reality at the Mansfield prison. Temperatures in The Hole averaged about 90 degrees; inmates were kept in total darkness or constant light 24 hours per day, and the men were only issued coveralls and cotton booties.\n\nPrison tore Freshwater's family apart. His son from a later relationship, Jim Cox, said his father's first wife left him. Freshwaters rarely spoke about that part of his life, Cox added.\n\nWhat's worse, Freshwaters had only been imprisoned because he screwed up.\n\nAfter Freshwaters pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter in April 1958 in connection with Flynt's death, a Summit County judge sentenced him to one to 20 years in prison. The judge suspended the sentence in lieu of five years of probation.\n\nOf note, say his attorneys today, is the fact that the laborer did not have an attorney. It wasn't until 1963 that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that all defendants have the right to legal counsel.\n\nRecords show that Freshwaters violated multiple terms of his probation. Specifically, he drove a car, obtained a driver's license, failed to report to the probation department, and failed to make weekly $5 payments to the clerk's office — money that would have gone to Flynt's widow and children.\n\nSo in February 1959, Summit County Common Pleas Judge Frank Harvey revoked Freshwaters' probation and ordered him to serve hard time at the Ohio State Reformatory.\n\nIn the classic 1994 film \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" set in that monolithic prison, Andy Dufresne spent years secretly chipping away at his concrete cell wall. He escaped through a hole hidden behind a Raquel Welch poster and fled to Zihuatanejo, Mexico.\n\nFreshwaters chose a faster, simpler route. Rather than laboring for years with a rock hammer, his good behavior — and what investigators later described as \"charm\" — got him out of prison within months.\n\nFreshwaters received a \"Bond of Faithful Service and Trust\" on Sept. 1, 1959, after a personal interview with the Ohio State Reformatory superintendent. This document stated that Freshwaters had been \"duly recommended as being worthy of trust and qualified for employment without the restraint of armed guard.\"\n\nHe was transported from the prison 50 miles up State Route 13 past Mennonite churches, clotheslines, cows and crops to the Sandusky Honor Camp. Trees, grain silos, barns and farmhouses dominated this pastoral skyline in north-central Ohio.\n\nOn Sept. 30, 1959, Freshwaters escaped. About 5 p.m., an officer made a routine check of inmates assigned to work at the main mess hall at the Ohio Soldiers and Sailors Home — and Freshwaters was missing.\n\nAccording to a story in the Sandusky Register, Freshwaters walked away from the camp with an inmate who was convicted of burglary in Cuyahoga County.\n\n\"Both were wearing white trousers, greyish jackets and possibly baseball caps,\" the newspaper reported.\n\nFreshwaters headed south where he lived under the William Cox alias.\n\nFor the next 56 years.\n\nMore than twice as long as Eugene Flynt was alive.\n\nDuring a conversation in his office in downtown Cleveland, U.S. Marshal Pete Elliot — who oversaw the investigation that led to Freshwaters' arrest — and Deputy U.S. Marshal David Siler, the agent who tracked down the fugitive, speculated that Freshwaters viewed good prison behavior as his ticket to freedom.\n\n\"He was a young guy that didn't want to serve hard time, and serve with men that he probably didn't feel he should be in there with. His fastest way was good behavior — and straight to the honor camp, hoping maybe he would see sunshine and be able to run to that sun,\" Siler said.\n\n\"And he did. He ran to that sun. I don't know why he'd want to leave Northeast Ohio. You get 50 degree weather in June. C'mon,\" Elliott joked.\n\nFreshwaters' Melbourne friends knew him as \"Grandpa Bill,\" a happy-go-lucky guy who enjoyed fishing on the marshland surrounding his trailer, working on old cars and calling up his favorite restaurant to spend a few dollars for cold, leftover fried chicken.\n\n[Related: U.S. Marshals' new unit cracks Freshwaters case]\n\n[Interactive: Path of 'Shawshank Fugitive' Frank Freshwaters]\n\nToday, Freshwaters sits behind bars at a Southeastern Correctional Complex annex for older inmates in Nelsonville, Ohio. A Tuesday parole hearing may ultimately determine whether he is released — or ordered to remain in a prison cell.\n\nHis run of freedom almost ended 40 years ago. In 1975, Freshwaters was arrested in West Virginia. When authorities ran his fingerprints, they discovered his real identity.\n\nHowever, then-West Virginia Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr. — a charismatic politician whose own history included run-ins with federal investigators — refused to send Freshwaters back to Ohio to face escape charges. Freshwaters took advantage of the reprieve and resumed his life as a fugitive under his false name — until authorities came calling again this spring.\n\nRichard Flynt said he never thought he would hear about his father's killer's whereabouts again \"in a million years,\" but his phone started ringing off the hook after the arrest — he was even cold-called by the National Enquirer. He stopped answering his phone the next day.\n\n\"It's been very, very weird. After all these years, I start getting all these phone calls. I've got a 15-year-old. All his teachers wanted him to make reports about it. I don't know how it's that big a story, really. You know what I mean? I really don't,\" he said.\n\nRichard Flynt is disabled with a degenerative bone disease, and he fidgets and has to walk around his house every few minutes. He praised the U.S. Marshals Service for capturing his father's killer.\n\n\"I wonder how they even caught this guy? I wonder how this guy got the identity to fool Social Security?\" he asked.\n\nEugene Flynt's widow, Garnet, later remarried. She lives in southern Ohio, and the topic remains painful today, more than a half-century after Eugene was killed crossing South Arlington Street.\n\n\"She didn't really want to discuss it. That's old wounds for her,\" Richard Flynt said of Freshwaters' arrest.\n\nDuring a June interview, Richard Flynt said he thought Freshwaters should \"pay a little bit, but not very severe\" for his crimes.\n\n\"I mean, he's 79 years old in a wheelchair. If he gets any time, he's going to sit in a low-security place and watch TV and eat free meals and get free medical benefits,\" he said, leafing through photos spread across his kitchen table.\n\nHowever, his opinion has changed since then. During a July 16 phone interview with Ohio Adult Parole Division officials, he said he wants Freshwaters to remain imprisoned.\n\n\"He should be locked down for the rest of his life. No slack. Without a doubt,\" Richard Flynt said.\n\nABOUT THE THREE-PART SERIES\n\nIn this special investigative report, FLORIDA TODAY sought to answer the question: Who is Frank Freshwaters and what was life like on the run for 56 years?

Our seven-part guide up will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nPut on your walking shoes and don’t forget your step counter: You can reduce your risk for cancer, heart disease and early death by getting up to 10,000 steps a day, but any amount of walking helps, according to a new study.\n\nHealth benefits rose with every step, the study found, but peaked at 10,000 steps – after that the effects faded. Counting steps may be especially important for people who do unstructured, unplanned physical activity such as house work, gardening and dog walks.\n\n“Notably, we detected an association between incidental steps (steps taken to go about daily life) and a lower risk of both cancer and heart disease,” noted study coauthor Borja del Pozo Cruz, an adjunct associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, Denmark, and senior researcher in health sciences for the University of Cadiz in Spain.\n\n“By and large, I think the study is well done and it certainly continues to add to the foundation of knowledge that tells us exercise is good stuff,” said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado. He was not involved in the research.\n\n“Physical activity is just absolutely magnificent,” Freeman said. “And when if you blend that with eating a more plant-based diet, de-stressing, sleeping enough and connecting with others – that’s your magic recipe. It’s the fountain of youth, if you will.”\n\nWalking helps dementia too\n\nDel Pozo Cruz and his team recently published a similar study that found walking 10,000 steps a day lowered risk for dementia by 50%. Risk decreased by 25% with as few as 3,800 steps a day, according to the previous study.\n\nHowever, if walking occurred at a brisk pace of 112 steps a minute for 30 minutes, it maximized risk reduction, leading to a 62% reduction in dementia risk. The 30 minutes of fast-paced walking didn’t have to occur all at once, either – it could be spread out over the day.\n\n“Our take is that intensity of stepping matters – over and above volume,” said del Pozo Cruz via email.\n\nThe new study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, followed 78,500 people between the ages of 40 and 79 from England, Scotland and Wales who wore wrist step counters for 24 hours a day over a seven day stretch.\n\nAfter counting each person’s total number of steps each day, researchers placed them into two categories: Fewer than 40 steps per minute – which is more of an amble, like when you’re walking from room to room – and more than 40 steps per minute, or so-called “purposeful” walking.\n\nA third category was created for peak performers – those who took the most steps per minute within 30 minutes over the course of a day (although, again, those 30 minutes did not have to occur in sequence).\n\nAbout seven years later, researchers compared that data to medical records and found people who took the most steps per minute – in this case, approximately 80 steps per minute – showed the biggest reduction in risk for cancer, heart disease and early death from any cause.\n\nResearchers found the association between peak 30-minute steps and risk reduction to be dependent on the disease studied.\n\n“We observed a 62% reduction for dementia: This figure was almost 80% for CVD mortality and incidence and much less (approx. 20%) for cancer,” del Pozo Cruz said via email.\n\n“This may be related with specific pathways by which physical activity is beneficial,” he said. “It pushes the body in general: can generate more muscle, a bigger heart and a better fitness, all of which are known protective factors for cardiovascular disease and cancer, and other health issues too.”\n\nGet breathless\n\nWhat’s the takeaway? You don’t have to fixate on the numbers of steps (unless you really want to), Freeman said.\n\n“Does every step count? Absolutely. And we know that brisk walking each day brings on extra benefits in terms of blood pressure reduction and cardiovascular training and so forth,” said Freeman, who was the founding chair of the American College of Cardiology’s Nutrition & Lifestyle workgroup.\n\n“But the truth is, the same goal has always applied: Challenge yourself at whatever fitness level you’re at. Obviously check with your doctor first, but your goal is to become breathless for 30 minutes each day.”\n\nWhat is breathlessness as it applies to exercise? It’s not gasping and panting so hard you can barely breathe. Instead, breathlessness is when you are walking with someone, they talk to you, and you have a bit of trouble talking back, Freeman said.\n\n“Spend 30 minutes being breathless at whatever pace you’re at, and then keep challenging yourself to be slightly unsatisfied at your current level so you can get better and better,” Freeman said.\n\nBeing more physically active often jumpstarts other healthy habits, such as an improved diet, and discourages unhealthy ones, such as smoking, he added.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/uk/king-charles-iii-england-profile-intl/index.html", "title": "What can the world expect from King Charles III? | CNN", "text": "London CNN —\n\nFollowing the death of his mother, Elizabeth II, Charles has ascended to the British throne after more than 70 years as the heir apparent.\n\nIn a statement released shortly after the official announcement of her passing, Charles described the death of his “beloved” mother as “a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family.” The days since the Queen’s death have been a time during which Charles has both assumed his new duties and mourned a great personal loss.\n\nAfter a lifetime in the public eye, he is a familiar figure to many in Britain and around the globe. But no one yet knows what kind of monarch King Charles III – the title he has taken, ending years of speculation – will become.\n\nAs CNN’s royal correspondent, I’ve reported on Britain’s new King for many years and traveled around the world with him.\n\nOne of the best insights I had was when I was invited with a group of other journalists to Dumfries House, his stately home near Glasgow in Scotland, in 2018 ahead of his 70th birthday. I spent two days there and was given unusual access to Charles and many of those closest to him. I was treated to tours of the estate, high tea, dinners and a spectacular bagpiping performance beside a roaring open fire.\n\nThis is the place that brings it all together for the new King, all his greatest passions and causes – from music to rare breeds protection, apprenticeships for disadvantaged youth and organic farming. The whole estate is buzzing with activity, and I could see what a thrill it gave him to walk around and ask questions of his staff.\n\nEvery Friday night, wherever he is in the world, Charles is sent a hefty report updating him on the estate’s work and he has it back to them first thing Saturday morning with notes. His wife Camilla will tell you he’s up late every night reading, writing and responding to requests for support and advice.\n\nWhere many of his predecessors saw his former role of Prince of Wales as a ticket to a playboy lifestyle and a guaranteed income, Charles professionalized it and made it his own. He wanted a legacy, but he didn’t want to wait until he was King. In my experience, he’s impatient and driven, and gets incredibly frustrated if one of his projects isn’t working or bearing fruit.\n\n“The signs were there from young adulthood,” Kenneth Dunsmuir told me during the visit to Dumfries House. Dunsmuir runs The Prince’s Foundation, an educational charity set up by Charles to help teach traditional arts and skills. “His concerns about social issues in the community and ecological issues were all there and all that’s happened is that he has got more and more involved and has had the time to do that.”\n\nDumfries House is Charles' stately home near Glasgow in Scotland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nDunsmuir’s comment points to the other reason Charles achieved so much during his tenure: he was the longest-serving Prince of Wales ever due to the longevity of his mother’s reign. Dunsmuir thinks of Dumfries House, he said, as a “fantastic physical legacy to that work that will always be here and always remain.”\n\nCharles has often struggled to contain his passion for his work, expressing his hopes and fears during speeches over the years and often sounding more like a campaigner than a constitutional monarch-in-waiting. That prompted accusations that he was threatening the independence and impartiality of the monarchy. Take climate change, on which he has been speaking out since 1968. It’s since become a mainstream issue and, for some, a political one. Charles was a prominent backer of the 2015 Paris Climate Accord and discussed the subject with Donald Trump over tea in December 2019, as the then-president prepared to pull the United States out of the pact.\n\nCharles, the Prince of Wales, poses for an official portrait in November 2008.

Whitby/Getty Images In pictures: Britain's King Charles III Prev Next\n\nThe following month, at the 2020 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Charles gave a powerful speech, asking: “Do we want to go down in history as the people who did nothing to bring the world back from the brink in time to restore the balance when we could have done? I don’t want to.”\n\nI sat down with Charles for an interview that day and he insisted the Paris Accord was still achievable. “We can’t go on like this, with every month another record in temperatures being broken. If we leave it too long, and we have done, just growing things is going to become difficult,” he said.\n\nDespite criticism – and at times ridicule – over his fight to be the royals’ ecowarrior, Charles has continued to be a pioneer in green issues in recent years.\n\nCharles was in his element at the COP26 Summit in Glasgow in November 2021, where he implored countries to work with industries to create solutions to climate change.\n\nCharles has spent his whole life preparing to be sovereign and has proved beyond doubt that he isn't work-shy. Victoria Jones/Pool/Getty Images\n\n“We know this will take trillions, not billions, of dollars,” he said at the time. Climate change and loss of biodiversity pose a great threat and the world must go on a “war-like footing” to combat them, he added.\n\nUS President Joe Biden commented on Charles’ decades-long efforts at the event, paying him the ultimate compliment by saying he’d got “the whole thing going” and “that’s how it all started.”\n\nCharles has been outspoken on a whole range of sensitive issues from genetically modified crops to homeopathic medicines and architecture. It’s made him a more divisive figure than his mother, who barely cracked an expression during her reign, let alone expressed an opinion. Elizabeth’s legendary ability not to offend and alienate was more strategic than many realize, but Charles has always insisted he intends to follow her lead and stop meddling when he takes the throne.\n\nCharles, pictured with Camilla, professionalized the role of Prince of Wales and made it his own. Hugo Burnand/Getty Images\n\nCharles walks in Cambridge in 1967 when he began his term at Trinity College. Peter Dunne/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nIn 2018, Charles said to the BBC: “The idea, somehow, that I’m going to go on in exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense because the two – the two situations – are completely different.” When specifically asked if his campaigning would continue, he said: “No, it won’t. I’m not that stupid.”\n\nIn all the conversations I have had with members of the family and their aides, there has never been talk of the more popular Prince William leapfrogging his father to the throne either.\n\nCharles has spent his whole life preparing to be sovereign and has proved beyond doubt that he isn’t work-shy. William has never been in a rush to take the crown meanwhile, preferring to build his royal portfolio steadily whilst focusing on his young family and developing his own set of interests and causes.\n\nCharles and William came together personally and professionally when Prince Harry dispensed with his royal duties in 2020, leaving the remaining senior royals a much more compact group. The relationship between the new King and his heir will now be key to the future stability of the monarchy, as will the dynamic between the new King and his wife.\n\nI’ve seen what a tower of support Camilla has always been to Charles. I’ve seen how fractious and frustrated he can become when he faces an obstacle in his work, and she has a unique talent for dissipating any tension with a sense of humor and charisma that doesn’t come across on camera.\n\nCharles and William, pictured with Prince Harry in 1997, came together personally and professionally when Harry stepped back from his royal duties in 2020. Tim Graham Photo Library/Getty Images\n\nIn 2015 I sat down with Charles at another of his residences in Scotland – Birkhall, in the Highlands. It was to mark the couple’s 10th wedding anniversary ahead of a US tour.\n\nHe told me, “It’s always marvelous to have somebody who, you know, you feel understands and wants to encourage. Although she certainly pokes fun if I get too serious about things. And all that helps.”\n\nAfter the interview, I went with him to a drawing room where we were joined by Camilla as we waited for the cameras to get ready for some set-up shots. Camilla was asking how it went and joking about our outfits, and he was immediately more relaxed in her company. Her ability to steady a room has now become a national asset, as the wife of the country’s head of state – and symbol of stability.\n\nWith Camilla standing firmly by his side, Charles will now set his stamp on the monarchy. After decades in waiting, he is not only head of state for the United Kingdom but also for 14 other nations including Canada and Australia. The eyes of the world are on him as he assumes the mantle of King.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/world/royal-family-line-of-succession/index.html", "title": "The British royal family line of succession explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nCharles has become Britain’s new King following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, at the age of 96.\n\nThe Queen became the sixth female to ascend to the British throne in February 1952, after the death of her father, King George VI.

The opportunities since then to enjoy the sport had been few and far between.\n\nExcuses were sitting there ready-made then, for not finishing in the money at the Celebrity Walleye Classic on Saturday at Lake Poinsett.\n\nInstead the 12-year-old, in company with adult friends Justin Welch, Matt McDowell and Jarrod Fredericks, took seventh place out of more than 55 boats in the competition. There was no need for excuses.\n\n“I thought it was pretty cool that I was able to do that,” Miller said. “The tournament started at around 7 a.m. and we were out there until about 4. We caught a bunch of fish.”\n\nUnlike most fish stories, there is no need for embellishment in tracing the young Miller’s connection to the sport. His mother Sarah says he was out with his dad learning to fish about the same time he had the capacity to grab onto a fishing pole. The secrets of the pastime were spoon-fed in steady doses from then on.\n\n“His dad took him out on the boat in a baby carrier,” Sarah said. “I worked weekends so Nolan and Jeremy were on their own. Nolan would be out there holding a fishing pole right alongside his dad.”\n\nThere are adventures Nolan remembers. He was in about first grade and had to reel-in a big carp, for instance, and a few years later, there was the 33-inch Northern he wrestled into the boat. He was also there the day both his dad and his grandmother brought in a pair of giant walleyes.\n\n“He taught me the fishing basics,” Nolan said of his father. “He taught me to cast, staying out of the weeds – I caught the big Northern at one of our favorite spots. There were two sticks poking out the water and we just kind of kept circling around them. I didn’t even know what I’d caught was at first.”\n\nJeremy, who worked at Scott’s Lumber, died of stomach cancer in 2014 at age 38. He left behind Sarah, Nolan and daughter Kaiah. Nolan’s opportunities to fish slowed down considerably thereafter, but he continued to talk about wanting to get back on the lake.\n\nSarah’s friend Amanda Welch knew this. When the Celebrity Walleye Classic, hosted by the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Sioux Empire, offered the opportunity to nominate candidates to be part of the competition free of cost, she submitted Nolan’s name.\n\nCelebrities Riley Reiff, the Parkston native who is now playing for the Minnesota Vikings, was a part of the event as was Bryan Witzmann, a former SDSU lineman now with the Kansas City Chiefs. Preston Evans, a former standout linebacker for national champion North Dakota State, and MMA fighter Devin Clark were also giving time to the event.\n\nPer Welch’s nomination, the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Sioux Empire agreed Nolan should get his shot. Kevin Kroger of Country Apple Orchard, a sponsor for the event, would cover Nolan’s team’s entry fee.\n\nOn Wednesday night Nolan was headed toward dinner time when family and friends surprised him with the news that he’d be fishing in a walleye tournament on Saturday. Showing up to share the moment was Clark, the MMA fighter from Sioux Falls who spent a lot of his own youth fishing with his father Dave.\n\nClark stayed for dinner at the Miller home on Wednesday and hung out with Nolan that night.\n\n“Nolan’s a little shy – a lot like his dad was,” Sarah said. “But after everyone left, he had a lot to say about it.”\n\nClark and Nolan talked again on Saturday and are going out fishing this week.\n\n“It can be a tough situation – a father dying would be pretty hard to deal with for someone Nolan’s age,” Clark said. “Being able to help out a little bit – I’m just grateful for the opportunity. My fiancé lost her father so I’ve seen it up close; it’s something you never forget. You have to try to stay positive and stay active.”\n\nFishing would qualify as a positive activity, something the younger Miller is now fully equipped to take on after Kroger set him up with a fishing pole, tackle and a tackle box. This is in addition to winning another pole at the event as a door prize.\n\nHe’s since passed along some of the equipment to his sister Kaiah.\n\n“He was a little quiet at first on Saturday, but once we started talking about fishing he had a lot of questions,” said Amanda Welch’s husband Justin Welch, who was also involved in a walleye tournament for the first time. “It started a little slow for him but he was hammering them in the afternoon. His arms had to be tired. It was just a great day.”\n\nMiller was introduced to the crowd at the rules meeting and spent a long day a little overwhelmed with the attention. It was worth it, though; he has since received open invitations from several anglers offering to bring him along the next time they’re going out to the lake.\n\n“I love catching fish,” Nolan said. “I like the excitement and the challenge and I love being outdoors. It felt pretty good that all those people cared about me.”\n\nYou can bet it felt pretty good, too, for the people who care about Nolan.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/02/05/kirk-douglas-dies-at-103/974365001/", "title": "Hollywood icon and 'Spartacus' star Kirk Douglas dies at 103, son ...", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nLittle stopped Spartacus, right to the end.\n\nLegendary actor Kirk Douglas died at age 103, his son, actor Michael Douglas, confirmed Wednesday. The actor died peacefully at home early Wednesday afternoon surrounded by his children, grandchildren and his wife of 65 years, Anne Buydens Douglas, according to the actor's longtime publicist Marcia Newberger.\n\n\"It is with tremendous sadness that my brothers and I announce that Kirk Douglas left us today at the age of 103,\" Michael wrote on Instagram. \"To the world he was a legend, an actor from the golden age of movies who lived well into his golden years, a humanitarian whose commitment to justice and the causes he believed in set a standard for all of us to aspire to.\n\n\"But to me and my brothers Joel and Peter he was simply Dad, to Catherine (Zeta-Jones), a wonderful father-in-law, to his grandchildren and great grandchild their loving grandfather, and to his wife Anne, a wonderful husband.\"\n\nDouglas liked to refer to himself as “the ragman’s son,” but to most people, the chiseled, cleft-chinned actor with the winning smile was the epitome of an old-fashioned movie star. He left a legacy of dignity, grace and talent.\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2020\n\nKirk Douglas tributes: Michael Douglas 'so proud to be your son,' more celebs mourn\n\nUSA TODAY's final interview with Kirk Douglas:The star celebrates his love for wife Anne\n\nDouglas thrived despite a severe stroke in 1996, which severely affected his ability to speak. He continued to be a vibrant Hollywood voice – flirting with Anne Hathaway during the 2011 Oscars as well as writing books.\n\nHe was married to his second wife, Anne, for more than 65 years. “She was the most difficult woman I ever met,” Douglas told USA TODAY in April 2017, with Anne chuckling by his side. (She famously turned the A-lister down for dinner when they first met, preferring to go home and make herself scrambled eggs.)\n\nIt was Anne who inspired a lifetime of art collecting, and who also helped clean up Douglas’ messy finances after they met in 1953.\n\n“I think romance begins at 80,” he told USA TODAY. “And I ought to know, because I live with a girl who would tell you so! ... I send her a note, and put it on her pillow. She likes that.\"\n\nIn August 2012, the rugged star of 1960’s \"Spartacus\" was able to see a restored version of the classic film, decades after it was originally released in theaters. But he was alone on the stage to talk about it, having outlived his Hollywood contemporaries.\n\n“If you die young, you have a chance to be a hero,” he told USA TODAY at the time. “If you die of old age, most of us are forgotten.\"\n\nFive essential Kirk Douglas movies:From 'Paths of Glory' to (obviously) 'Spartacus'\n\nMore: Kirk Douglas was forever changed after surviving a tragic 1991 helicopter crash\n\nHe was wrong on that point. The acting legend was never forgotten. During a photo shoot for Paramount studio’s 100th anniversary, Douglas was one of the most sought-after stars in a galaxy that included everyone from George Clooney to Justin Bieber.\n\n“Everybody came by to pay respects,” Douglas said. “I felt like a king.”\n\nClooney would go on to write the foreword to Douglas’ 2012 book \"I Am Spartacus! Making a Film, Breaking the Blacklist,\" in which he described his role in overcoming the dreaded communist blacklist of his era.\n\n“Kirk Douglas is many things. A movie star. An actor. A producer,” Clooney wrote. “But he is, first and foremost, a man of extraordinary character … the kind we always look for at our darkest hour.”\n\nDouglas’ 1988 autobiography, \"The Ragman’s Son\" (referring to his Russian-Jewish ancestry) attests to his early years growing up poor in Amsterdam, N.Y., the son of illiterate Russian immigrants. Born Issur Danielovitch Demsky in 1916, he nearly drowned at 5. It was one of a few close calls the actor had over the years; in 1991, a helicopter he was riding in crashed into a small plane. He suffered a compressed spine.\n\nBut Douglas laughed easily when he spoke of death, attributing his easy sense of humor to his mother, whom he quoted on the subject of dying: “Don’t be afraid. It happens to everyone.”\n\nThe star wrote 12 books, including 2002's \"My Stroke of Luck,\" in which he chronicled how he beat depression after suffering a stroke and found salvation in his wife, his family, and in returning to work.\n\nHe said he wrote it hoping to help other stroke survivors. “Maybe it will help others to deal with depression,” he said. After his stroke, with his characteristic trademark self-deprecating humor, he wrote: “All I could do was babble like a baby, but I worked hard with my speech therapist and in a few months I could talk as well as my 3-year-old granddaughter, Kelsey.”\n\nWriting the book clearly had a cathartic effect on Douglas. The following year he starred in one of his final films, \"It Runs in the Family,\" a story of a dysfunctional family living in New York. The title might also have referred to the acting bug. The movie starred Douglas, his son Michael, his grandson Cameron and his ex-wife, Diana Dill Douglas.\n\nIn \"My Stroke of Luck,\" Douglas writes “I have been so lucky to be an actor. It has given me fame, money and satisfaction.”\n\nHis ascension up the Hollywood ranks came after his athletic college years at St. Lawrence University, where he was a wrestling champion. Following his graduation, Douglas won an acting scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. His first stop was Broadway, followed by a stint in the Navy during World War II. After the war, he returned to the theater and also performed in radio plays. He married Dill in 1943, with whom he had two sons, Michael and Joel.\n\nThey were divorced in 1951 and he married Buydens in 1954, with whom he had two more sons, Peter and Eric. Eric died in 2004.\n\nDouglas’ movie career began after his classmate Lauren Bacall urged producer Hal Wallis to give Douglas a screen test. The test went so well that he was cast in the lead role of 1946's \"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers.\" After receiving a host of kudos for that performance, he went on to make \"I Walk Alone\" with another future screen legend, Burt Lancaster. Their chemistry was so potent that they made seven films together, including the Western \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\" (1957) and the political thriller \"Seven Days in May\" (1964). Their last collaboration was in the gangster comedy \"Tough Guys\" in 1986.\n\nThough they were good pals, Douglas joked at one point: “I’ve finally gotten away from Burt Lancaster. My luck has changed for the better. I’ve got nice-looking girls in my films now.”\n\nHis busiest decades were the ’50s and ’60s. Douglas was nominated for an Oscar in 1953 for \"The Bad and the Beautiful\" and again in 1957 for his portrayal of Vincent Van Gogh in \"Lust for Life.\" In the following few years, he would take on his pivotal roles as Colonel Dax in the anti-war epic \"Paths of Glory\" (1957) and as the leader of the Roman slave revolt in \"Spartacus\" (1960).\n\nDouglas executive-produced \"Spartacus\" and described in \"I Am Spartacus!\" how he was instrumental in breaking the Hollywood blacklist by insisting blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo be given the proper credit for his screenplay. It was an experience detailed in the 2015 film \"Trumbo,\" starring Bryan Cranston.\n\n\"When I hired Dalton Trumbo to write 'Spartacus' under the pseudonym Sam Jackson, we all had been employing the blacklisted writers,” Douglas wrote in \"I Am Spartacus!\" “It was an open secret and an act of hypocrisy, as well as a way to get the best talent at bargain prices. I hated being part of such a system.\"\n\nHe remained busy in the 1960s, starring in a host of films including \"Lonely Are the Brave\" (1962) in which he played an outlaw cowboy in a contemporary setting, a part he said he considers his best performance, and co-starred with John Wayne in the World War II drama \"In Harm’s Way\" (1965) and in the comedy/Western \"The War Wagon\" (1967).\n\nDouglas had his share of missteps. He starred in a couple of bombs, including the loopy western \"The Villain\" (1979) with Arnold Schwarzenegger and \"Saturn 3\" (1980) with Farrah Fawcett.\n\n\"I have made almost 90 pictures,\" Douglas said. \"Lots of them are bad. Fortunately, I forget the bad pictures.\"\n\nHe remained a staunch Luddite as he got older. “Technology frightens me. I don't have a cellphone. I don't even have a watch,\" Douglas told USA TODAY in 2015. \"My wife insisted on buying me a computer. I know nothing about computers. But one thing: I love having a place to play solitaire. I play all the time.\"\n\nOn his 100th birthday, Anne gifted him his first iPad, and the milestone was celebrated with a starry bash in Beverly Hills, with Steven Spielberg and Don Rickles among the guests present.\n\nDouglas was also known for his humanitarian work and had been a goodwill ambassador for the U.S. State Department since 1963. Nearly two decades later, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the French bestowed him with the Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. He dedicated a Tel Aviv playground in honor of Yitzhak Rabin, then prime minister of Israel.\n\nBut he didn’t play favorites. Douglas was also a friend of King Hussein of Jordan.\n\nCloser to home, he rehabilitated dilapidated playgrounds in inner-city Los Angeles and raised $2 million for the Alzheimer’s wing at the hospital for retired Motion Picture Academy workers. It was named Harry’s Haven, after Douglas’ father. “Somebody complained that that made it sound like a saloon,” he said. “That would have made my father very happy, because he used to spend a lot of time in saloons.”\n\nAt 99, he and Anne donated an additional $15 million toward an Alzheimer’s care center, bringing their total donations to the Motion Picture & Television Fund to $40 million.\n\nAt 100, he reflected on his charitable efforts. “I have given most of my money away because that pleases me,” he told Variety. “I was born a poor boy. My mother and father came from Russia; I don’t think they could have gotten into the country today. So I have a lot to be thankful for.”\n\nPerhaps it was this sensitivity to those in need that informed his nuanced performances. He once said: “When I play a strong character in a movie, I search for some weakness, and when I play a weak character, I search for some strength.” Whether playing good guys or bad, he was always convincing and his portrayals consistently powerful.\n\nA devout Jew, Douglas studied the Bible and began to read in depth about Judaism after his stroke. Though he had celebrated his bar mitzvah at the traditional age of 13, he decided to celebrate it again at 83.\n\nHe had learned to read Hebrew as a child. “But I never understood what I was saying,” said Douglas, who also spoke German and French.\n\nIn \"My Stroke of Luck,\" Douglas urged readers to seek out prayer.\n\n“Pray, however you perceive that higher power to be. Pray, it will help you,” he wrote, adding that on the Sabbath he prayed over candles in antique candlesticks his mother brought over from Russia. “In doing that, I am reminded of my mother, I feel closer to God, to my family and I have increased The Light, even if only for a moment.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Michael wrote in his tribute that his father's \"life was well lived, and he leaves a legacy in film that will endure for generations to come, and a history as a renowned philanthropist who worked to aid the public and bring peace to the planet.\"\n\nMichael closed his post \"with the words I told him on his last birthday and which will always remain true. Dad – I love you so much and I am so proud to be your son.\"\n\nContributing: Andrea Mandell", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/05"}]}

The promise has been that if you endure the awkwardness and invasiveness of having a camera travel the length of your large intestine once every decade after age 45, you have the best chance of catching – and perhaps preventing – colorectal cancer. It’s the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Some 15 million colonoscopies are performed in the US each year.\n\nNow, a landmark study suggests the benefits of colonoscopies for cancer screening may be overestimated.\n\nThe study marks the first time colonoscopies have been compared head-to-head to no cancer screening in a randomized trial. The study found only meager benefits for the group of people invited to get the procedure: an 18% lower risk of getting colorectal cancer, and no significant reduction in the risk of cancer death. It was published Sunday in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nStudy researcher Dr. Michael Bretthauer, a gastroenterologist who leads the clinical effectiveness group at the University of Oslo in Norway, said he found the results disappointing.\n\nBut as a researcher, he has to follow the science, “so I think we have to embrace it,” he said. “And we may have oversold the message for the last 10 years or so, and we have to wind it back a little.”\n\nOther experts say that as good as this study was, it has important limitations, and these results shouldn’t deter people from getting colonoscopies.\n\n“I think it’s just hard to know the value of a screening test when the majority of people in the screening didn’t get it done,” said Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the study.\n\nLess than half of people invited to get a colonoscopy in the study – just 42% – actually got one.\n\nWhen the study authors restricted the results to the people who actually received colonoscopies – about 12,000 out of the more than 28,000 who were invited to do so – the procedure was found to be more effective. It reduced the risk of colorectal cancer by 31% and cut the risk of dying of that cancer by 50%.\n\nBretthauer said the true benefits of colonoscopy probably lie somewhere in the middle. He said he thinks of the results of the full study – including people who did and didn’t get colonoscopies after they were invited – as the minimum amount of benefit colonoscopies provide to a screened population. He thinks of the results from the subset of people who actually got the test as the maximum benefit people could expect from the procedure.\n\nBased on his results, then, he expects that screening colonoscopy probably reduces a person’s chances of colorectal cancer by 18% to 31%, and their risk of death from 0% to as much as 50%.\n\nBut, he said, even 50% is “on the low end of what I think everybody thought it would be.”\n\nOther studies have estimated larger benefits for colonoscopies, reporting that these procedures could reduce the risk of dying of colorectal cancer by as much as 68%.\n\nThe first randomized trial of colonoscopy\n\nThe NordICC study, which stands for Northern-European Initiative on Colon Cancer, included more 84,000 men and women ages 55 to 64 from Poland, Norway and Sweden. None had gotten a colonoscopy before. The participants were randomly invited to have a screening colonoscopy between June 2009 and June 2014, or they were followed for the study without getting screened.\n\nIn the 10 years after enrollment, the group invited to get colonoscopies had an 18% lower risk of colorectal cancers than the group that wasn’t screened. Overall, the group invited to screening also had a small reduction in their risk of death from colorectal cancer, but that difference was not statistically significant – meaning it could simply be due to chance.\n\nBefore the NordiCC trial, the benefits of colonoscopies had been measured by observational studies that looked back in time to compare how often colorectal cancer is diagnosed in people who received colonoscopies versus those who did not.\n\nThese studies can be subject to bias, however, so scientists look to randomized trials that blindly sort people into two groups: those who are assigned to get an intervention and those who are not. These studies then follow both groups forward in time to see if there are differences. Those studies have been difficult to do for colon cancer, which can be slow-growing and may take years to be diagnosed.\n\nThe researchers say they’re going to continue to follow participants for another five years. It could be that because colon cancers can be slow-growing, more time will help refine their results and may show bigger benefits for colonoscopy screening.\n\nResults need careful interpretation\n\nNormally, those kinds of disappointing results from such a large, strong study would be considered definitive enough to change medical practice.\n\nBut this study has some limitations that experts say need to be sorted out before doctors and patients give up on colonoscopies for cancer screening.\n\n“I don’t think anyone should be canceling their colonoscopy,” said Dr. Jason Dominitz, the national director of gastroenterology for the Veterans Health Administration.\n\n“We know that colon cancer screening works,” said Dominitiz, who also co-authored an editorial that ran alongside the study.\n\nThere are several options for colorectal cancer screening. Those include stool tests that check for blood or cancer cells and a test called sigmoidoscopy, which looks only at the lower part of the colon. Both have been shown to reduce both cancer incidence and colorectal cancer deaths.\n\n“Those other tests work through colonoscopy,” Dominitz said. “They identify people at high risk who would benefit from colonoscopy, then the colonoscopy is done and removes polyps, for example, that prevents the individual from getting colon cancer in the first place, or it identifies colon cancer at a treatable stage.”\n\nPolyps are benign growths that can turn into cancers. They are typically removed when identified during a screening colonoscopy, which can lower a person’s risk of colorectal cancer in the future.\n\nStudies are underway in Spain and the US testing colonoscopy head-to-head against stool tests to see which is most effective.\n\nThe best way to screen for colorectal cancer\n\nDominitz said this randomized controlled trial was a test of advice as much as it was a test of the value of colonoscopy.\n\n“If you ask the population to do something, how much of an impact will it have?” he said.\n\nOverall, the study found that just inviting people to get a colonoscopy didn’t have a large beneficial impact across these countries, partly because so many people didn’t do it.\n\nDominitz thinks the low participation can be partly explained by the study’s setting. Colonoscopies are not as common in the countries involved in the study as they are in the United States. In Norway, he said, official colorectal cancer screening recommendations didn’t come until this past year.\n\n“They don’t see the public service announcements. They don’t hear Katie Couric talking about getting screened for colon cancer. They don’t see the billboards in the airport and whatnot,” he said. “So an invitation to be screened in Europe is, I think, likely to be somewhat different than an invitation to be screened in the US.”\n\nIn the US, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 adults between the ages of 50 and 75 have never been screened for colorectal cancer.\n\nIf you feel squeamish about getting a colonoscopy, the US Preventive Services Task Force says a variety of methods and regimens work to detect colorectal cancer. It recommends screening with tests that check for blood and/or cancer cells in stool every one to three years, a CT scan of the colon every five years, a flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years, a flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years paired with stool tests to check for blood annually, or a colonoscopy every 10 years.\n\nIn 2021, the task force lowered the recommended age to start routine screening for colorectal cancer from 50 to 45 because the cancer is becoming more common in younger adults.\n\nWhen it comes to colorectal cancer, Dominitz said, tests can only be effective if people are willing to do them.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAs proof, he points to early results from a large randomized trial from Sweden that’s testing colonoscopy, FIT testing and no screening at all.\n\nResults collected from more than 278,000 people enrolled between March 2014 and the end of 2020 found that 35% of the group assigned to get a colonoscopy actually got one, compared with 55% who were assigned to the stool test group.\n\nTo date, slightly more cancers have been detected in the group assigned to stool testing than in the group assigned to get a colonoscopy – “so participation with screening really is key!” Dominitz said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/health/psilocybin-magic-mushroom-depression-wellness/index.html", "title": "Severe depression eased by synthetic 'magic mushroom' | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nA single dose of a synthetic version of the mind-altering component of magic mushrooms, psilocybin, improved depression in people with a treatment-resistant form of the disease, a new study found.\n\nThe randomized, double-blind clinical trial, which authors called “the largest of its kind,” compared results of a 25-milligram dose to a 10-milligram and 1-milligram dose of a synthetic psilocybin, COMP360, that was administered in the presence of trained therapists.\n\nResults of the study, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, found “an immediate, fast, rapid-acting, sustained response to 25 milligrams (of COMP360),” said study coauthor Dr. Guy Goodwin, a professor emeritus of psychiatry at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.\n\n“This drug can be extracted from magic mushrooms, but that is not the way our compound is generated. It’s synthesized in a purely chemical process to produce a crystalline form,” said Goodwin, who is the chief medical officer of COMPASS Pathways, the company that manufactures COMP360 and conducted the study.\n\nExperts in the field found the study findings promising.\n\n“They clearly found a dose effect and clinically meaningful improvement in just three weeks,” said Dr. Matthew Johnson, a professor in psychedelics and consciousness at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. He was not involved in the new study.\n\n“If you were in the 25-milligram group, you were nearly three times as likely to respond than if you were in the 1-milligram group,” said Johnson, who coauthored safety guidelines for psychedelic research in 2008.\n\nThe rapid response to treatment was notable as well.\n\n“The maximum effect (was) seen the day after receiving the treatment. This contrasts with standard antidepressants, which take several weeks to reach maximum effect,” said Dr. Anthony Cleare, a professor of psychopharmacology and affective disorders at King’s College London, in a statement. He was not involved in the study.\n\nHowever, there are a number of issues that need further study before this drug would be available for clinical use, experts said.\n\n“The effects did start to wear off by three months, and we need to know how best to prevent the depression returning,” Cleare said, adding that not enough is yet known about potential side effects.\n\n“While the safety profile seems encouraging overall, great care is obviously needed when using psychoactive substances such as psilocybin. Larger studies are on the way that we hope will help answer these issues,” he said.\n\nBenefits faded\n\nThe clinical trial occurred at 22 sites in the United States, Canada, the UK and seven countries in Europe. The study was designed to test the safety of different dosages of the proprietary version of psilocybin.\n\nThe 233 study participants had treatment-resistant depression, which can only be diagnosed after a person fails to respond to two courses of antidepressants. Of the 9 million people in the US with medically treated depression, 3 million patients are resistant to treatment, studies have estimated. Globally, some 100 million people have treatment-resistant depression, Goodwin said.\n\nPeople with the condition are at a high risk of physical illness, disability, hospitalization and suicide, the study said.\n\nAny study participants on antidepressants were required to wean themselves from those medications prior to the start of the trial. Psychedelic treatment doesn’t work on people who are actively taking antidepressants — the receptors where psychedelics attach in the brain are already flooded with serotonin from their current mood-altering drugs.\n\n“Participants were requested to remain off antidepressant treatment during the first 3 weeks after the trial-drug administration; however, these medications could be started at any time during the trial if deemed clinically necessary by a physician investigator,” the study said.\n\nDepression severity for each person was assessed the day before treatment using a psychological scale widely used by clinicians. Counselors trained to offer psychological support were present during the psychedelic trips, which lasted between six and eight hours. Participants were also given two more therapy sessions in the first week, the study said.\n\nDepression levels were documented the day after the “trip” and another five times over a 12-week period. About 37% of people who took the 25-milligram dose showed improvement. In fact, 29% were considered to be in remission at week three, the study found.\n\nBy week 12, however, the positive impact on depressive symptoms had waned and no longer reached a level of statistical significance, the study found.\n\n“The incidence of sustained response at week 12 was 20% in the 25-mg group, 5% in the 10-mg group, and 10% in the 1-mg group,” wrote psychobiologist Dr. Bertha Madras, director of the laboratory of addiction neurobiology at Harvard Medical School’s McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, in an accompanying editorial. She did not participate in the study.\n\n“This is not a spectacular response rate for a psychiatric treatment … and we would only expect this to worsen over a longer follow-up period,” said Dr. Ravi Das, an associate professor of educational psychology research methods and statistics at University College London via email. He who was not involved with the study.\n\nIn addition, “there were an uneven number of severely depressed patients in each group; with significantly fewer severely depressed people in the apparent ‘effective’ (25mg) dose group,” Das said in a statement. “This does not appear to be acknowledged in the paper.”\n\nSafety profile\n\nHeadache, nausea, fatigue and dizziness plagued 77% of the study participants and occurred at all dosage levels, which experts say is a typical response on the day of psilocybin administration.\n\nA small number of people in all three dosage groups experienced suicidal thoughts or injured themselves over the 12-week follow-up period, the study found. Within the first three weeks alone, two people in the 25-milligram group thought about suicide and two intentionally injured themselves. Two people in the 10-milligram group were suicidal, one self-injured and one was hospitalized for severe depression, the study reported.\n\nThose behaviors are “common in treatment-resistant depression studies — most cases occurred more than a week after the COMP360 psilocybin session,” the company said.\n\n“Remember that this is in people who were assessed not to be at significant risk of suicide when they entered the trial. The numbers were fairly small, but this is something that will need to be taken carefully into account in any later-stage trials,” said Kevin McConway, professor emeritus of applied statistics at The Open University, a British public research university.\n\nThe study results are promising, but many questions remain and it’s unknown if this drug would be successful for different types of depression, said McConway, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“They can’t tell us how effective this psilocybin plus therapy treatment is in comparison with other existing drug or non-drug treatments for depression,” said McConway, noting that as a next step for follow-up trials.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/19/coronavirus-reader-questions-death-age-flu-symptoms-food-timeline/2863776001/", "title": "Coronavirus questions: Rent relief, unemployment, virus on surfaces", "text": "As the coronavirus pandemic continues to shut down daily life across the globe, thousands of our readers across the nation have asked us questions about COVID-19.\n\nAnd we're answering them.\n\nFor basic facts about the virus – what it is, how it spreads and where it's located – you can get caught up by reading our in-depth explainer here. We've also debunked some viral coronavirus myths.\n\nBut you're curious and continue to ask important questions via our newsletter, Coronavirus Watch. (Not a newsletter subscriber? Sign up for it here!)\n\nSo below, you can find answers to questions such as: Is it OK to be outside? How old are people who are dying in the U.S.? Is it safe to get carry-out food?\n\nIf you don't see an answer you're looking for, check out our newest Q&A where we talk about UV radiation, antibodies, cats and more.\n\nWhat else would you like to know? Ask us by filling out the form you can find here.\n\nCan UV radiation from the sun kill the virus?\n\n– Charlie from Dade City, Florida\n\nExperts have advised against using concentrated UV light to prevent or treat the coronavirus and do not recommend going in the sunlight to kill the virus. Only levels of concentration of UV light much higher than what is found in sunlight can kill viruses, the experts note, and the levels that are able to kill viruses can cause irritation to human skin and should be avoided.\n\nNeither sunlight or UV light is listed as a preventative measure on the websites of the World Health Organization or the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFact check:Sunlight does not kill the new coronavirus\n\nMy primary income is from rentals. If my tenants are unable to pay their rent, what kind of relief is available to me?\n\n– Vicki from Santa Rosa, California\n\nTrump in March signed the largest economic stimulus package in U.S. history. The stimulus provides forbearance on mortgage payments for up to a year but just for federally-backed loans. Some states and banks are also issuing relief for other types of mortgages. Once forbearance ends, borrowers would have to work out a repayment plan or loan modification with the mortgage servicer, the National Housing Law Project says.\n\nStill, several states are granting moratoriums to renters but not owners, potentially forcing owners to pay their mortgage, utilities, taxes and other costs even though they have less rental income.\n\nIs it true that everyone who is on unemployment due to COVID-19 will receive an additional $600 a week as part of the stimulus package?\n\n– Hannah from Canton, Ohio\n\nThe stimulus package expands unemployment insurance benefits. If you've lost your job because of the outbreak, you will see your weekly state insurance benefits – which average about $400 – increased by $600 for four months. And if you are still unemployed after state benefits end, you could get an additional 13 weeks of help.\n\nWhat are the results so far with the tests of the Z-Pak and malaria med, hydroxychloroquine?\n\n– Pat from Alexandria, Virginia\n\nThere are no approved therapies or drugs to treat COVID-19. Anecdotal reports suggest that a known anti-malarial (hydroxychloroquine) combined with a common antibiotic (azithromycin, sold as Zithromax and Z-Pak) may offer some benefit in the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nA very small study in France of just a couple dozen patients found some evidence that the combination was effective in fighting COVID-19. A subsequent study of 80 patients in France found clinical improvement in all but one. Studies in China have suggested similar results.\n\nResearchers have warned that the drugs can have risky side effects and could cause subtle heart changes and increase a person's risk of developing arrhythmia.\n\nClinical trials of the drug combination began in New York on March 24, and the FDA on March 29 granted emergency use of hydroxychloroquine by hospitals. Several other clinical trials are in the works, according to ClinicalTrials.gov. But it's still too early to say whether the drugs are effective.\n\nHow many people have recovered from the virus?\n\n– Stephanie from Mt Pleasant, South Carolina\n\nMore than 191,000 people worldwide have recovered from the virus as of Wednesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Most of the recoveries have been in China, followed by Spain, Germany, Italy and Iran.\n\nOf the more than 203,000 confirmed cases in the U.S., more than 8,000 have recovered.\n\nWill families who receive food stamps be eligible for the stimulus check?\n\n– Renda from Miami, Florida\n\nYes, families who receive food stamps are eligible to receive a stimulus check! The $2 trillion stimulus plan includes one-time payments of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child, $367 billion for small businesses, $500 billion for loans to larger industries, $100 billion for hospitals and the health care system, and $600 more per week in unemployment benefits for those out of work.\n\nHere's how you can calculate the amount of stimulus money your household can expect.\n\nIs the virus a DNA molecule protected by a thin layer of fat that will disintegrate if that fat layer is removed outside your body?\n\n– Rita in Las Vegas, Nevada\n\nSARS-CoV-2 particles are spherical bundles of genetic material (RNA) surrounded by a fatty outer layer (lipids) with proteins called spikes protruding from the surface. These spikes latch onto receptor proteins on human cells in the lungs and other tissues and change the structure of those human cells, allowing the viral genes to enter the host cell to be copied, producing more viruses.\n\nViruses need a host to \"survive,\" and the fat layer breaks down when it is out on its own in the environment. Preliminary researc\n\nh suggests that the virus is stable outside the body for different periods of time, depending on the climate and surface. You can \"kill\" the virus using soap, extreme heat and ultraviolet light, and each attacks a different part of this virus structure. Soap breaks up the fatty outer layer. Heat breaks up the protein spikes. And UV light breaks up the genes inside.\n\nHas anyone with preexisting conditions gotten the coronavirus and survived?\n\n– Dee from Arlington, Texas\n\nYes, many people have. While the risk for serious disease and death from COVID-19 is higher in people who are older or who have certain preexisting conditions, thousands have survived.\n\nData from the CDC published Tuesday found that, as of March 28, the U.S. reported 2,692 patients who had one or more underlying health conditions. Of those patients, 173 died. This limited data suggests that thousands of people who have one or more underlying health conditions have not died.\n\nMoreover, a February WHO study of more than 70,000 coronavirus patients in China found that people with preexisting conditions had higher fatality rates than those without preexisting conditions: 13.2% for those with cardiovascular disease, 9.2% for diabetes, 8.4% for hypertension, 8.0% for chronic respiratory disease, and 7.6% for cancer. However, those figures suggest that large percentages of people with preexisting conditions survived.\n\nCan coronavirus be transmitted through secondhand smoke?\n\n– David from Columbus, Georgia\n\n\"It’s not the main mode of transmission. There's probably some component of airborne, but I don’t think secondhand smoke would be a compounding factor,\" said Tania Elliott, clinical instructor of infectious diseases at NYU Langone.\n\nIf the smoke irritates your lungs and causes you to cough, that poses a greater risk of transmission since the virus is thought to mainly spread through respiratory droplets when someone coughs or sneezes, Elliot said.\n\nSmokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 as the act of smoking means that fingers and possibly dirty cigarettes are in contact with lips, according to the WHO. Smokers may also already have lung disease or reduced lung capacity which would greatly increase risk of serious illness, the WHO says.\n\nWhile data is still evolving about how long the virus may remain alive, a recent study found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air.\n\nIs cross-country road travel advisable to destinations outside of COVID-19 'hot spots'?\n\n– Roland from Albuquerque, New Mexico\n\nThe White House is asking Americans to stay home as much as possible to slow the spread of the virus, and some states and local governments have issued \"stay home\" and \"shelter-in-place\" orders.\n\n\"I don’t think now’s the time to do it,\" Elliott said. \"If you have a house somewhere else, that's fine. But I wouldn’t recommend being in hotels or crowded public settings. If you want take a road trip and go camping, there's risk associated with that.\"\n\nCan you catch the virus from people who've died?\n\n– Nikki from Albany, Georgia\n\nThe main way the virus is thought to spread is through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and this is not a concern after death, according to the CDC. But people should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19, the CDC says.\n\nThere is no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19, the CDC says. Kissing, washing and shrouding should be avoided before, during and after the body has been prepared, if possible. But holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing may pose less of a risk, the CDC says.\n\nWhat is the value of testing for the coronavirus if there is currently no treatment?\n\n– Linda from Brevard County, Florida\n\nThere is value to getting tested because there are many reasons why someone would seek medical care for their symptoms, and ruling out the coronavirus is helpful in seeking other causes, said Jason Christie, chief of pulmonary medicine at Penn Medicine.\n\n\"The biggest problem is we don’t have a quick and reliable test right now. Without that, we have to be smart and ration the testing to those people that need them most. So don’t go out and get tested right now unless you’re sick,\" Christie said.\n\nTesting also helps health officials figure out how prevalent and contagious a virus is.\n\nIs it safe to get groceries during senior shopping hour?\n\n– Pamela from Wellsville, Pennsylvania\n\nAcknowledging that older adults and persons with underlying health conditions are more susceptible to COVID-19, a growing number of stores are dedicating time or opening earlier for senior shoppers and other at-risk groups.\n\nBut Elliott says she doesn't advise it. \"That gives a false sense of security,\" she said. \"By encouraging older people with chronic diseases to go out at a dedicated time, you're still exposing them to a bunch of other people, and if one person in that crowd is infected, then the virus will spread.\"\n\nElliott said she'd rather see stores limiting the number of people who can enter during a given time period so that there are fewer people in the store. She also encourages healthy people to do the shopping.\n\nCan the virus be transmitted through the mail? Should I stop sending greeting cards?\n\n– Pam from Seven Lakes, North Carolina\n\nThe chances of transmission through your mail is very low, Elliott says. \"Parts of the virus can fall on surfaces and survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours. But you have to have pretty good conditions for that to happen. So the likelihood would be very small, even with no precautions,\" she said.\n\nElliott advises people to put their mail down on a plastic plate instead of directly on a counter top or table, to use a letter opener, and to wash hands thoroughly after touching the mail.\n\nResearch on how long a virus may live on surfaces is evolving. The CDC has said there is likely very low risk of transmission of COVID-19 from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks \"because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces.\"\n\nA recent study found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. But a subsequent report from the CDC found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks.\n\nAre plastic grocery bags considered the plastic that you have to wait hours to touch?\n\n– Elizabeth from Greenfield, Indiana\n\nYou should take precaution with any containers, Elliott says. \"The plastic grocery bags I’d throw out right away, wash your hands and then clean your food. Chances (of infection) are low,\" she said. \"But better yet, bring your own bags! It’s better for the environment anyway.\"\n\nThey keep saying stay isolated for two weeks. But what happens after the two weeks?\n\n– Al from Topeka, Kansas\n\nOfficials suggest self-quarantining for two weeks if you've had exposure to somebody with the virus and might be infected. It's a way to monitor if symptoms develop and, at the same time, avoid any possible spread to others. Since the incubation period for the virus is up to 14 days, you're \"cleared\" for the virus after two weeks, Elliott said.\n\nAfter that, you still need to practice social distancing.\n\nIs it advantageous for a younger healthy person to get the coronavirus to build immunity to it?\n\n– Danny from Sundance, Wyoming\n\nNo, for several reasons, says Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\nWhile a protective antibody is generated in those who are infected, scientists are not yet sure whether that immunity will last for a short period of time, for years or for life. Some say the possibility of reinfection is very likely.\n\nMoreover, a new federal health report says Americans of all ages have faced serious health complications amid the outbreak. Data from the CDC show that among the roughly 12% of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. known to need hospitalizations, about 1 in 5 were among people ages 20 to 44. Anywhere from 14% to 21% of adults ages 20 to 44 with COVID-19 have been hospitalized, the CDC data estimates. Two to 4% of cases led to ICU admissions, and less than 1% were fatal.\n\nFinally, it's important to avoid getting and spreading the virus. While the young may not be the most at risk, they're carrying the disease to those who are more vulnerable, such as older people and those with underlying conditions. Dr. Deborah Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, on Wednesday urged \"the millennial generation\" to take special precautions. \"You have the potential to spread it,\" she said.\n\nDoes getting pneumonia shots given to elderly people help if you get this virus?\n\n– Linda from Hendersonville, Tennessee\n\nVaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization. The vaccines simply guard against those specific bacterial infections.\n\nThe COVID-19 virus can, in fact, cause pneumonia, but the vaccines cannot prevent this pneumonia.\n\nI see people in my neighborhood out running, riding bikes and walking their dogs. Is that OK?\n\n– Patti from Carmel, Indiana\n\nYes, that's OK! Just be sure to maintain distance from other people. The CDC recommends a distance of about 6 feet. Even in states and counties where residents are being asked to stay home or \"shelter in place,\" it's still fine to go for a run, hike or do other outdoor activities, as long as proper social distancing is observed.\n\nJust don't be like Chicago, where city officials closed trails and parks after crowds of hundreds of people were seen congregating along the city’s lakefront.\n\nRemember: The White House recommends that you should avoid social gatherings involving more than 10 people, as well as all non-essential travel, shopping trips and social visits.\n\nSocial distancing:Why it's so important to stopping the spread of coronavirus\n\nAre there any projections to estimate the spread of COVID-19 and a timeline of its passing?\n\n– Dennis from Las Vegas\n\nYes, there are many projections, but scientists say they all hinge on how people behave. That's why it's essential to social distance and do what you can to prevent spread.\n\nA conservative USA TODAY analysis based on data from the American Hospital Association, U.S. Census, CDC and WHO estimates that 23.8 million Americans could contract COVID-19, leaving almost six seriously ill patients for every existing hospital bed. Another analysis finds that America’s trajectory of community spread is trending toward Italy’s, where circumstances are dire.\n\nOne researcher at the Global Center for Health Security estimated last month that as many as 96 million Americans could be infected. The U.S. population on March 27 is estimated at 329 million.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security estimated that 38 million Americans will need medical care for COVID-19. The CDC's worst-case-scenario is that about 160 million to 210 million Americans will be infected by December. Under this forecast, 21 million people would need hospitalization and 200,000 to 1.7 million could die by the end of the year.\n\nOutside the U.S., leaked British documents projected that a coronavirus outbreak could rage until spring 2021. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said 60% to 70% of her country's population could eventually become infected.\n\nUSA TODAY analysis:America's coronavirus 'curve' may be at its most dangerous point\n\nIs it safe to get carry-out food?\n\n– Debby from Omena, Michigan\n\nThe CDC and WHO have not issued formal guidance on carry-out food.\n\nWhile the CDC says that there is no evidence to support transmission associated with food, a person may get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own face. The virus can, for example, survive on cardboard up to 24 hours, according to a recent study.\n\nThe issue of carry-out food also raises concerns about the risk couriers are facing by interacting with customers during their shifts. That's why some companies are now offering \"contactless\" delivery options that help people maintain social distancing by allowing couriers to ring the doorbell and leave the package outside.\n\nStudy finds:Coronavirus can live in the air for hours and on surfaces for days\n\nHow soon after exposure can you test positive?\n\n– Pam from Easton, Maryland\n\nThere's no specific data on this question yet, according to Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group. However, we do know that someone infected with the virus may begin showing symptoms anywhere between one and 14 days after catching the virus, most commonly around five days, according to the WHO.\n\n\"The peak viral shedding occurs during the first five days after the onset of symptoms. My guess is that within a few days of being exposed, these patients are beginning to shed virus,\" Poland said.\n\nA recent report from the CDC studying an outbreak at a care home in Washington State found that among 23 residents who tested positive for the virus, 13 were asymptomatic. Within a week, 10 of those 13 developed symptoms, with onset at 3 days.\n\nDo the symptoms for COVID-19 come together or can you have separate symptoms showing up at different times?\n\n– Carlos from Los Angeles\n\nThe most common symptoms are fever, tiredness and dry cough, according to the WHO. Shortness of breath is also among the most common symptoms, according to the CDC. In most cases where symptoms present, those symptoms come together, Hotez said.\n\n\"Usually it presents with fever and cough, or fever, cough, and shortness of breath,\" he said. \"It might present with one of those symptoms first, but then it rapidly progresses to the others.\"\n\nSome patients also have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. Some people do not have symptoms at all.\n\nA New York neurosurgeon is warning people against looking out for fever as the first tell-tale symptom of the virus. His symptoms began with a little bit of congestion and only later progressed to a fever, body aches and chills.\n\nMore on testing:Coronavirus test swabs aren't your standard Q-tips, and they're running out as testing ramps up\n\nHow do you actually die from the coronavirus? What happens?\n\n– Catherine from Carson City, Nevada\n\nIn some cases, the virus ultimately damages tiny air sacs in the lungs, restricting oxygen to the bloodstream and depriving other major organs – including the liver, kidney and brain – of oxygen.\n\nSevere cases of coronavirus:Some result in brain damage, inability to walk\n\nIn a small number of severe cases, that can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which requires a patient be placed on a ventilator to supply oxygen. However, if too much of the lung is damaged and not enough oxygen is supplied to the rest of the body, respiratory failure could lead to organ failure and death.\n\nHere's what that looks like inside the body.\n\nWhat is the age range of U.S. deaths from COVID-19?\n\n– Becky from Bentonville, Arkansas\n\nIn the U.S., ages range from an infant less than one year old to people in their 90s, according to state and local health departments.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health said Saturday that an infant coronavirus patient younger than one year old in Chicago had died. An investigation was underway to determine the cause of death. \"There has never before been a death associated with COVID-19 in an infant,\" department Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said.\n\nThis week health officials also reported that a 17-year-old teen in New Orleans died after contracting the virus. And a 2-month-old in Nashville who tested positive for the virus could be the youngest patient in the nation, officials say.\n\nHowever, this range is not conclusive because health officials have not released the specific ages of several other patients, and new deaths are being reported each day.\n\nIf a person is sick with the coronavirus and gets tested for the flu, would the flu test be positive?\n\n– Antonio from Patchogue, New York\n\nNo, the presence of the coronavirus would not turn a flu test positive. However, it's possible to have both the coronavirus and the flu at the same time. In that case, the flu test would be positive.\n\nThe opposite is also true: Presence of the flu would not result in a positive coronavirus test. It's important to note that, even if someone tests negative for the coronavirus, they still may be infected with the coronavirus.\n\nI was told I should be tested if I could not easily inhale a large breath and hold it for at least 10 seconds. Is this good advice?\n\n–Ted from Scottsdale, Arizona\n\nNo. While shortness of breath is among the most common symptoms of the virus, according to the CDC, that diagnosis does not necessarily involve holding a large breath for 10 seconds. Medically known as dyspnea, shortness of breath is often described as \"an intense tightening in the chest, air hunger, difficulty breathing, breathlessness or a feeling of suffocation,\" according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nIf you think you may be sick, call your doctor and follow CDC guidance.\n\nCan masks be reused by an infected person or used only once?\n\n– Debra from Dayton, Ohio\n\nThe longer a mask is used and the more damp it becomes, the less effective it is, Poland said. \"But it is definitely better than the alternative of no mask!\"\n\nContributing: Molly Stellino, Adrianna Rodriguez, Dalvin Brown, Marco della Cava, Jayme Fraser and Matt Wynn\n\nFollow Grace Hauck on Twitter @grace_hauck", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/11/world/coronavirus-newsletter-intl-05-11-22/index.html", "title": "Biden likely to arrive at his own Covid-19 summit empty-handed | CNN", "text": "This is the weekly edition of CNN’s coronavirus newsletter.

On Tuesday, the country said more than 230,000 new cases and six more deaths. But the reports did not indicate how many of the infections or deaths were conclusively linked to Covid-19 through testing.\n\nThe Biden administration asked Congress in March to authorize $22.5 billion in additional Covid-19 assistance, including $5 billion for the global pandemic, but the package has been repeatedly waylaid. The Senate reached a bipartisan deal in April to approve $10 billion in aid, but it stripped out global Covid-19 financing entirely.\n\nThis has put the President in an awkward position: He will probably show up to his own summit empty-handed.\n\nBiden acknowledged on Monday that “much needed funding” for Covid-19 relief was not forthcoming. In a statement released by the White House, the President said congressional leaders had informed him that including the funding as part of a new aid bundle for Ukraine risked delaying the war effort, so he agreed to let them proceed as separate bills.\n\n“However, let me be clear: as vital as it is to help Ukraine combat Russian aggression, it is equally vital to help Americans combat Covid. Without timely Covid funding, more Americans will die needlessly,” he wrote, adding that failing to approve the funding also risked stalling the global pandemic response.\n\nAs Biden prepares to address the world, cases are rising in the US and the nation’s death toll is edging closer to a grim milestone: 1 million.\n\nPresident Joe Biden gave a speech at a metal manufacturer in Cincinnati, Ohio on May 6, about ramping up domestic production in an effort to reduce inflation and shortages caused in part by the pandemic. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\nOn Monday, South Korea offered help, with President Yoon Suk Yeol saying: “If the North Korean authorities accept, we will not spare any necessary support, such as medicine, including Covid-19 vaccines, medical equipment and health care personnel.” Last week, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Zhao Lijian said it was ready to provide “full support” in North Korea’s fight against the virus – while the country is dealing with its own Covid crisis.\n\nA group of former heads of government are calling on the US to commit $5 billion to the global pandemic response and urging Biden to take on a more robust role at the summit. Experts have repeatedly warned that the entire world needs access to vaccines in order to contain the virus and stop more lethal strains from surfacing. “I want America to recognize that the disease is not over anywhere until it’s over everywhere,” former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown told the New York Times, which reported the story. “We must not sleepwalk into the next variant.”\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday that rising cases in more than 50 countries highlighted the volatility of the pandemic, which is now being fueled by subvariants. Though high population immunity from vaccination and previous infection is keeping hospitalization and death rates down, the same is not guaranteed for places where vaccine coverage is low. The worst-case scenario is that a variant evades current immunity, transmits more easily or causes greater mortality, Tedros said. In South Africa, where cases are surging due to subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, scientists have urged further vaccination to mitigate another wave.\n\nWHO has been calling on world leaders to commit to vaccinating 70% of the global population within a year – a goal that Biden echoed at the first Covid-19 summit last September. “Yes, it’s hard. Yes, some countries won’t manage it by mid-2022. But if we deprioritize based on these factors we’d be risking waves of death that can knock out health systems and cause further backsliding on all other health issues,” Tedros said.\n\nAt least 218 countries and territories have administered more than 11 billion doses of a Covid-19 vaccine since the first Covid case was reported in China in late 2019. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in February that the world wasn’t on pace to meet the 70% goal.\n\nYOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED.\n\nQ: Can I get free at-home Covid tests?\n\nA: The Biden administration is opening an official government website for a third round of orders while reiterating its calls for Congress to act on extra Covid response funding.\n\nThe projection – derived from a range of outside models – is based on an underlying assumption of no additional resources or extra mitigation measures being taken, including new Covid-19 funding from Congress, and no dramatic new variants arising, administration officials said.\n\nThe Biden administration has been sounding the alarm for weeks that additional funding is needed to continue the federal Covid-19 response, even as it seeks a return to “normal” with many pandemic-era restrictions lifting. The 100 million estimate was first reported by the Washington Post.\n\nSend your questions here. Are you a health care worker fighting Covid-19?

A day after the briefing, posts on the UN’s official press account on Chinese social platform Weibo became unviewable, with hashtags containing the WHO chief’s name also being censored, Nectar Gan and CNN’s Beijing Bureau report.\n\nThe crackdown came a week after China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, issued the strongest warning yet against questioning the country’s hardline policy — which has left millions confined to their homes with no end in sight. At a meeting chaired by Xi, the ruling Communist Party’s supreme Politburo Standing Committee vowed to “unswervingly adhere to the general policy of ‘dynamic zero-Covid,’ and resolutely fight against any words and acts that distort, doubt or deny our country’s epidemic prevention policies.”\n\nThe starkest example of this is the country’s biggest city, Shanghai, where officials have continued to intensify lockdown measures despite falling cases.\n\nGroups representing Western businesses in China are urging Beijing to relax its approach to Covid, saying harsh lockdowns are damaging earnings and investment, and forcing a growing number of companies to consider shifting operations out of the world’s second-biggest economy, Laura He writes.\n\nCDC investigating Covid-19 outbreak on board a Carnival cruise ship\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is investigating a recent Covid-19 outbreak on a Carnival cruise ship that docked in Seattle after a two-week voyage.

Look out for your roundup every Wednesday. If you haven’t subscribed yet, sign up here.\n\nCNN —\n\nEuropean countries are seeing a significant increase in Covid-19 cases spurred by highly infectious subvariants of Omicron, raising fears of a new global wave of the disease as immunity declines and the summer travel season gets underway.\n\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) warned last week that “the growth advantage reported for BA.4 and BA.5 suggest that these variants will become dominant” throughout the European Union, and probably result in a surge in cases.\n\nInfections are rising in multiple countries, including Portugal, Germany, France, Greece, Austria, Italy, Switzerland and Spain, according to the Our World in Data (OWID) project at the University of Oxford, which tracks the pandemic.\n\nNew studies have shown that Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 have a growth advantage compared with earlier variants and appear to be good at evading the immune system. In other words, neither previous infections nor vaccines provide particularly strong protection against the subvariants, which is why they’re becoming the dominant strains. BA.4 and BA.5 do not appear to lead to more severe illness, but, as with previous waves, the increase in cases could result in an uptick in hospitalizations and deaths, the ECDC has said.\n\nTourists wearing face masks walk in Athens on June 1, when Greece dropped most of its Covid-19 restrictions. Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe potential impact of one of the subvariants, BA.5, is most apparent in Portugal, where it has fueled a significant rise in Covid-19 infections. That surge now appears to have plateaued, but is still higher than rates elsewhere. On Tuesday, the country registered a daily average of 1,332 new cases per million people over the previous seven days — the fifth-highest new case rate in the world. That compares with Germany’s 760 and France’s 747, according to OWID.\n\nThe number of people in hospital in Portugal, at 1,896, is nearly as high as it was during the original Omicron wave in January. BA.5 became the dominant strain in the country in May, not long after it was first detected in late March, according to Portugal’s National Institute of Health (INSA). By June 5, it accounted for 84% of all Covid infections there.\n\nIn France, the number of new cases per million people has nearly tripled since the beginning of the month, and hospitalizations are rising for the first time since the beginning of April. According to the public health agency Santé Publique France, in its most recent update, BA.5 rose to 24% of sequenced cases in the week of June 6, compared with 18% the week before.\n\nFrench vaccination chief Alain Fischer said on Wednesday that the question wasn’t whether the country was facing a new wave of the virus, but what intensity it might have, saying he was personally in favor of reinstating some restrictions to limit the spread.\n\n“The epidemic is accelerating again and it is completely unexpected in this season,” Dr. Benjamin Davido, an infectious disease specialist at the Raymond-Poincaré hospital outside Paris, told French radio on Sunday.\n\n“With the new Omicron subvariants (BA.4 and BA.5), which are 10% to 15% more contagious, the epidemic has found new energy, even though we have passed through the winter,” Davido said, adding that the lifting of almost all restrictions — like wearing masks on public transportation and airplanes — combined with unraveling immunity, posed a real threat.\n\nDavido and other health experts have warned that hospitals in France could fill up over the summer, unless vulnerable people and those over 60 get booster shots as soon as possible. But while hospital admissions in the country are on the rise, it’s not yet clear whether that’s down to the BA.5 subvariant being more transmissible or because it is escaping dwindling immunity.\n\nIn the UK, where cases and hospitalizations are rising sharply, the start of a new wave also appears to be driven by BA.4 and BA.5, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The latest data from the ONS, released on June 17, showed that Covid infections were up 43% week on week, according to the British Medical Journal (BMJ), a peer-reviewed medical trade journal.\n\nWriting in the BMJ, Christina Pagel, professor of operational research at University College London, said, “We will be the first (but not the last) major country to have a BA.4.5 wave after having had two previous Omicron waves. This means that we might get some additional protection from the high number of infections we had in March which will reduce the size of this coming wave. Nonetheless, a significant proportion of the country will get sick, especially as boosters are waning.”\n\nIt looks like the United States might not be far behind. The latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows BA.4 and BA.5 caused more than one in three Covid-19 infections in America last week. The subvariants are also expected to dominate transmissions in the US within the next few weeks.\n\nYOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED.\n\nQ: Will we ever know how the pandemic began?\n\nA: A team of international scientists tasked with understanding the origins of the coronavirus pandemic released its first report on Thursday, saying that all hypotheses remain on the table, including a possible laboratory incident.\n\n“The most common side effects from either of the vaccines are still the most common side effects we see from pretty much any child that gets any vaccine,” said Dr. Grant Paulsen, the principal site investigator for the Pfizer and the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine clinical trials for kids from 6 months to 11 years old at Cincinnati Children’s hospital.\n\nThese include pain, swelling and/or redness at the injection site and fever. During the trials on the youngest children, myocarditis was not found to be a problem, but Dr. Claudia Hoyen, director of pediatric infection control at UH Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, assures that they will “have all the mechanisms in place once we start vaccinating kids” just in case.\n\nSend your questions here.

That’s my ultimate goal for my kid.”\n\nCovid-19 vaccinations for children younger than 5 began Tuesday across the United States, marking a milestone in the nation’s fight against the disease and making it the first country in the world to offer the shots for children as young as six months old. About 17 million kids under 5 are now eligible for vaccination.\n\nDr. Sarah Schaffer DeRoo described in one word how she felt after getting her 7-month-old son vaccinated against Covid-19: thrilled.\n\nHer active baby boy sat in her lap at a vaccine clinic hosted by Children’s National Hospital in Washington, DC, while receiving his first dose. The shot was administered in his thigh. He cried for a few seconds but then his attention turned to a golden retriever that was on site as a comfort dog provided by the hospital.\n\nThese children lost their young parents to Covid-19\n\nMore than 202,000 US children have lost one or both parents to Covid-19, according to estimates from Imperial College London, Holly Yan reports.\n\nLaila Dominguez, 13, has suffered from anxiety since her father’s death in January. When Covid-19 struck both her parents last winter and her father was hospitalized, she helped watch her two younger siblings and take care of her mother, who was severely sick.\n\nAt times, “it will get really, really dark. And sometimes it’s way too much for me,” Laila said. Her last experience taking care of her traumatized siblings led to a panic attack.\n\nLaila hopes more kids will learn from her story and take Covid-19 seriously, saying that to bullies who taunt her for still wearing a face mask, she bluntly answers: “My dad died.”\n\n“What I wish they knew about Covid is how dangerous it is … and be more aware of what they say.”\n\nMacao shuts most businesses as Covid cases surge, but casinos remain open\n\nThe world’s biggest gambling district began its second day of mass Covid-19 testing on Monday after dozens of cases were detected over the weekend.\n\nCity officials have begun closing schools, tourist attractions, cultural venues and all non-essential businesses. Restaurants have been ordered to suspend dine-in services.\n\nBut for casinos, it’s business as usual.\n\nMacao’s government relies on casinos for more than 80% of its income, with most of the population employed directly or indirectly by the industry. While they remain open, analysts expect them to be hit as the government urges residents not to visit entertainment venues.\n\nThe testing of Macao’s roughly 600,000 residents is expected to end on Tuesday. The Chinese-ruled former Portuguese colony adheres to China’s strict zero-Covid policy that aims to eradicate all outbreaks at just about any cost.\n\nSurviving 70 days in Shanghai – the ‘world’s strictest lockdown’\n\nWhen CNN producer Serenitie Wang left Covid-stricken Hong Kong in March, she was hoping to escape to safer pastures. Instead, she was just swapping the world’s biggest outbreak for the “world’s strictest lockdown” in Shanghai – and 70 days of enforced confinement.\n\n“Covid could seemingly pass between the floors and walls and the realization even the strongest measures couldn’t stop it was terrifying and shocking,” she writes about the spread of the virus in her parents’ 21-story residential housing compound, where she was staying.\n\nWhen she tested positive, she was taken to a “fangcang” – a public venue repurposed for people with Covid, where she was given a cot and a bag containing bedding, a basin and cup for washing, a toothbrush, toothpaste, a towel and slippers.\n\nShe was in a room with 3,000 strangers, each hoping for the negative test results that would secure their release – some remaining positive long after their symptoms disappeared. Everyone was trying to remain optimistic; meals were even delivered with encouraging fortune-cookie style messages attached.\n\nTOP TIP\n\nThe CDC also recommends testing within three days of your flight and not to travel if you are sick.\n\nSince the CDC recommended two Covid-19 vaccine options for children under 5 – one from Pfizer/BioNTech and another from Moderna – parents and caregivers may be wondering which one is right for their child.\n\nBut pediatricians CNN spoke with around the country suggest either is a good option. Their advice? Just get the vaccine that’s available.\n\n“I do not think it’s clear that one is any better than the other. They are different,” said Dr. Paulsen of Cincinnati Children’s. “It is very much what the parents prefer. Balancing those differences as well as, honestly, what’s available and what their pediatrician has or what the local hospital has.”\n\nDoctors also suggest looking online or calling to find out what the local site is offering. Not every location will offer both shots. Some clinics may also not be offering vaccinations for small children or may have restrictions on the ages they serve. Vaccines.gov may be helpful.

Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs.

This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis Pramod Acharya Sugam Pokharel", "Aimee Lewis", "Pramod Acharya", "Sugam Pokharel"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/02/health/reverse-aging-life-itself-scn-wellness/index.html", "title": "The 'Benjamin Button' effect: Scientists can reverse aging in mice ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn molecular biologist David Sinclair’s lab at Harvard Medical School, old mice are growing young again.\n\nUsing proteins that can turn an adult cell into a stem cell, Sinclair and his team have reset aging cells in mice to earlier versions of themselves. In his team’s first breakthrough, published in late 2020, old mice with poor eyesight and damaged retinas could suddenly see again, with vision that at times rivaled their offspring’s.\n\nDavid Sinclair has reversed aging in mice and believes the same can be done for people. Courtesy Richard Groleau\n\n“It’s a permanent reset, as far as we can tell, and we think it may be a universal process that could be applied across the body to reset our age,” said Sinclair, who has spent the last 20 years studying ways to reverse the ravages of time.\n\n“If we reverse aging, these diseases should not happen. We have the technology today to be able to go into your hundreds without worrying about getting cancer in your 70s, heart disease in your 80s and Alzheimer’s in your 90s.” Sinclair told an audience at Life Itself, a health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN.\n\n“This is the world that is coming. It’s literally a question of when and for most of us, it’s going to happen in our lifetimes,” Sinclair told the audience.\n\nCan we cure aging? 04:31 - Source: CNN\n\n“His research shows you can change aging to make lives younger for longer. Now he wants to change the world and make aging a disease,” said Whitney Casey, an investor who is partnering with Sinclair to create a do-it-yourself biological age test.\n\nWhile modern medicine addresses sickness, it doesn’t address the underlying cause, “which for most diseases, is aging itself,” Sinclair said. “We know that when we reverse the age of an organ like the brain in a mouse, the diseases of aging then go away. Memory comes back; there is no more dementia.\n\n“I believe that in the future, delaying and reversing aging will be the best way to treat the diseases that plague most of us.”\n\nA reset button\n\nIn Sinclair’s lab, two mice sit side by side. One is the picture of youth, the other gray and feeble. Yet they are brother and sister, born from the same litter – only one has been genetically altered to age faster.\n\nIf that could be done, Sinclair asked his team, could the reverse be accomplished as well? Japanese biomedical researcher Dr. Shinya Yamanaka had already reprogrammed human adult skin cells to behave like embryonic or pluripotent stem cells, capable of developing into any cell in the body. The 2007 discovery won the scientist a Nobel Prize, and his “induced pluripotent stem cells,” soon became known as “Yamanaka factors.”\n\nHowever, adult cells fully switched back to stem cells via Yamanaka factors lose their identity. They forget they are blood, heart and skin cells, making them perfect for rebirth as “cell du jour,” but lousy at rejuvenation. You don’t want Brad Pitt in “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” to become a baby all at once; you want him to age backward while still remembering who he is.\n\nLabs around the world jumped on the problem. A study published in 2016 by researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, showed signs of aging could be expunged in genetically aged mice, exposed for a short time to four main Yamanaka factors, without erasing the cells’ identity.\n\nBut there was a downside in all this research: In certain situations, the altered mice developed cancerous tumors.\n\nLooking for a safer alternative, Sinclair lab geneticist Yuancheng Lu chose three of the four factors and genetically added them to a harmless virus. The virus was designed to deliver the rejuvenating Yamanaka factors to damaged retinal ganglion cells at the back of an aged mouse’s eye. After injecting the virus into the eye, the pluripotent genes were then switched on by feeding the mouse an antibiotic.\n\n“The antibiotic is just a tool. It could be any chemical really, just a way to be sure the three genes are switched on,” Sinclair said. “Normally they are only on in very young developing embryos and then turn off as we age.”\n\nAmazingly, damaged neurons in the eyes of mice injected with the three cells rejuvenated, even growing new axons, or projections from the eye into the brain. Since that original study, Sinclair said his lab has reversed aging in the muscles and brains of mice and is now working on rejuvenating a mouse’s entire body.\n\n“Somehow the cells know the body can reset itself, and they still know which genes should be on when they were young,” Sinclair said. “We think we’re tapping into an ancient regeneration system that some animals use – when you cut the limb off a salamander, it regrows the limb. The tail of a fish will grow back; a finger of a mouse will grow back.”\n\nThat discovery indicates there is a “backup copy” of youthfulness information stored in the body, he added.\n\n“I call it the information theory of aging,” he said. “It’s a loss of information that drives aging cells to forget how to function, to forget what type of cell they are. And now we can tap into a reset switch that restores the cell’s ability to read the genome correctly again, as if it was young.”\n\nWhile the changes have lasted for months in mice, renewed cells don’t freeze in time and never age (like, say, vampires or superheroes), Sinclair said. “It’s as permanent as aging is. It’s a reset, and then we see the mice age out again, so then we just repeat the process.\n\n“We believe we have found the master control switch, a way to rewind the clock,” he added. “The body will then wake up, remember how to behave, remember how to regenerate and will be young again, even if you’re already old and have an illness.”\n\nScience already knows how to slow human aging\n\nStudies on whether the genetic intervention that revitalized mice will do the same for people are in early stages, Sinclair said. It will be years before human trials are finished, analyzed and, if safe and successful, scaled to the mass needed for a federal stamp of approval.\n\nWhile we wait for science to determine if we too can reset our genes, there are many other ways to slow the aging process and reset our biological clocks, Sinclair said.\n\n“The top tips are simply: Focus on plants for food, eat less often, get sufficient sleep, lose your breath for 10 minutes three times a week by exercising to maintain your muscle mass, don’t sweat the small stuff and have a good social group,” Sinclair said.\n\nAll these behaviors affect our epigenome, proteins and chemicals that sit like freckles on each gene, waiting to tell the gene “what to do, where to do it, and when to do it,” according to the National Human Genome Research Institute. The epigenome literally turns genes on and off.\n\nWhat controls the epigenome? Human behavior and one’s environment play a key role. Let’s say you were born with a genetic predisposition for heart disease and diabetes. But because you exercised, ate a plant-focused diet, slept well and managed your stress during most of your life, it’s possible those genes would never be activated. That, experts say, is how we can take some of our genetic fate into our own hands.\n\nThe positive impact on our health from eating a plant-based diet, having close, loving relationships and getting adequate exercise and sleep are well documented. Calorie restriction, however, is a more controversial way of adding years to life, experts say.\n\nCutting back on food – without inducing malnutrition – has been a scientifically known way to lengthen life for nearly a century. Studies on worms, crabs, snails, fruit flies and rodents have found restricting calories “delay the onset of age-related disorders” such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes, according to the National Institute on Aging. Some studies have also found extensions in life span: In a 1986 study, mice fed only a third of a typical day’s calories lived to 53 months – a mouse kept as a pet may live to about 24 months.\n\nStudies in people, however, have been less enlightening, partly because many have focused on weight loss instead of longevity. For Sinclair, however, cutting back on meals was a significant factor in resetting his personal clock: Recent tests show he has a biological age of 42 in a body born 53 years ago.\n\n“I’ve been doing a biological test for 10 years now, and I’ve been getting steadily younger for the last decade,” Sinclair said. “The biggest change in my biological clock occurred when I ate less often – I only eat one meal a day now. That made the biggest difference to my biochemistry.”\n\nAdditional ways to turn back the clock\n\nSinclair incorporates other tools into his life, based on research from his lab and others. In his book “Lifespan: Why We Age and Why We Don’t Have To,” he writes that little of what he does has undergone the sort of “rigorous long-term clinical testing” needed to have a “complete understanding of the wide range of potential outcomes.” In fact, he added, “I have no idea if this is even the right thing for me to be doing.”\n\nWith that caveat, Sinclair is willing to share his tips: He keeps his starches and sugars to a minimum and gave up desserts at age 40 (although he does admit to stealing a taste on occasion). He eats a good amount of plants, avoids eating other mammals and keeps his body weight at the low end of optimal.\n\nHe exercises by taking a lot of steps each day, walks upstairs instead of taking an elevator and visits the gym with his son to lift weights and jog before taking a sauna and a dip in an ice-cold pool. “I’ve got my 20-year-old body back,” he said with a smile.\n\nSpeaking of cold, science has long thought lower temperatures increased longevity in many species, but whether it is true or not may come down to one’s genome, according to a 2018 study. Regardless, it appears cold can increase brown fat in humans, which is the type of fat bears use to stay warm during hibernation. Brown fat has been shown to improve metabolism and combat obesity.\n\nSinclair takes vitamins D and K2 and baby aspirin daily, along with supplements that have shown promise in extending longevity in yeast, mice and human cells in test tubes.\n\nOne supplement he takes after discovering its benefits is 1 gram of resveratrol, the antioxidant-like substance found in the skin of grapes, blueberries, raspberries, mulberries and peanuts.\n\nHe also takes 1 gram of metformin, a staple in the arsenal of drugs used to lower blood sugars in people with diabetes. He added it after studies showed it might reduce inflammation, oxidative damage and cellular senescence, in which cells are damaged but refuse to die, remaining in the body as a type of malfunctioning “zombie cell.”\n\nHowever, some scientists quibble about the use of metformin, pointing to rare cases of lactic acid buildup and a lack of knowledge on how it functions in the body.\n\nSinclair also takes 1 gram of NMN, or nicotinamide mononucleotide, which in the body turns into NAD+, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. A coenzyme that exists in all living cells, NAD+ plays a central role in the body’s biological processes, such as regulating cellular energy, increasing insulin sensitivity and reversing mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nWhen the body ages, NAD+ levels significantly decrease, dropping by middle age to about half the levels of youth, contributing to age-related metabolic diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. Numerous studies have shown restoring NAD+ levels safely improves overall health and increases life span in yeast, mice and dogs. Clinical trials testing the molecule in humans have been underway for three years, Sinclair said.\n\n“These supplements, and the lifestyle that I am doing, is designed to turn on our defenses against aging,” he said. “Now, if you do that, you don’t necessarily turn back the clock. These are just things that slow down epigenetic damage and these other horrible hallmarks of aging.\n\n“But the real advance, in my view, was the ability to just tell the body, ‘Forget all that. Just be young again,’ by just flipping a switch. Now I’m not saying that we’re going to all be 20 years old again,” Sinclair said.\n\n“But I’m optimistic that we can duplicate this very fundamental process that exists in everything from a bat to a sheep to a whale to a human. We’ve done it in a mouse. There’s no reason I can think of why it shouldn’t work in a person, too.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/25/coronavirus-highlights-shortage-palliative-care-us-hospitals/5081810002/", "title": "Coronavirus highlights shortage of palliative care at US hospitals", "text": "Liz Szabo\n\nKaiser Health News\n\nFor Jill Hofstede, whose 90-year-old mother has Alzheimer’s disease, news about the coronavirus becomes more terrifying every day.\n\nAlthough the potential shortages of mechanical ventilators and intensive care beds have made headlines, Hofstede fears a surge of COVID-19 patients could deprive her mother of something far more basic should she contract the disease: relief from pain and suffering.\n\n“I do not want her to die of the virus,” said Hofstede, 57, a mother of five who lives in Brush Prairie, Washington. Even more crucially, Hofstede said, “I would not want her to suffer.”\n\n“There should be some right to dying with dignity, even in the midst of a pandemic,” she said.\n\nSome experts worry that a long-standing shortage of palliative care professionals – who focus on the physical pain and mental and spiritual distress caused by serious illness – could leave many COVID-19 patients in distress.\n\nCoronavirus:Live updates\n\nStaffing wasn't up to par even before coronavirus\n\n“There is already a shortage, which will only worsen as demand goes up because of current events,” said Dr. Arif Kamal, a palliative care researcher at the Duke University School of Medicine.\n\nThe supply of palliative care teams could be further diminished if many health care providers become ill themselves.\n\nPalliative care staffing could not meet the country’s needs even before the coronavirus appeared.\n\nAmong all U.S. hospitals with at least 50 beds, 72% provide palliative care, according to a report from the Center to Advance Palliative Care. That number is dramatically lower in certain states. Fewer than 40% of hospitals provide palliative care in Alabama, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Wyoming.\n\n'What choice do we have?' New Jersey residents camp out all night for coronavirus tests\n\nWhy palliative care is important\n\nPalliative care is vital when patients are suffering, especially for those near death, said Dr. Diane Meier, director of the Center to Advance Palliative Care, a nonprofit organization.\n\nSpecialist palliative care teams are “a scarce resource, just like ventilators,” Meier said.\n\nPatients in acute respiratory distress can survive only if they are put on a mechanical ventilator, which breathes for them until their bodies recover, said Dr. Greg Martin, president-elect of the Society of Critical Care Medicine, which represents intensive care doctors. Ventilators require specially trained staff, including critical care nurses and respiratory therapists, to set them up, monitor them and adjust the mix of air patients need.\n\nA new report from the society concluded there is only enough hospital staff to operate 130,000 ventilators, although the country may need many more. That could lead to rationing and difficult decisions about which patients to save.\n\nKristen Goode said she fears that her 86-year-old grandfather, who has leukemia, will go without the comfort care or pain relief provided by palliative care teams.\n\n“There are a lot of things they can do to make sure patients aren’t suffering, but that takes time and personnel,” said Goode, 27, of Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nMany hospitals recognize the valuable role palliative care teams play, Meier said.\n\n“We are part of the command and control center at virtually every hospital we’re talking to,” Meier said.\n\nHow well are we social distancing? Smartphone location data can rank the states\n\nHofstede isn’t optimistic. “There is no way this small group of professionals will be able to meet the need,” she said.\n\nShe worries that because of the coronavirus pandemic, frail patients like her mother “won’t even get into the hospital, that they will be turned away from testing and not even get in the door.”\n\nHofstede, who cares for her mother at home, feels unequipped to treat a desperately sick patient. “I would hate for my loved one to be home and not get the medical assistance they need,” she said.\n\nA new report from Imperial College London estimates that more than 1 million Americans could die from COVID-19. Studies show that older people are at greatest risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nDr. Rachelle Bernacki, a palliative care physician at Boston’s Dana Farber Cancer Institute, said she is already trying to make sure the hospital has key medications on hand.\n\n“Palliative care is right on the front line” of the coronavirus outbreak, Bernacki said. “We are going to be playing a very important role. People will be leaning on us.”\n\nHow palliative care helps in dealing with coronavirus\n\nSome COVID-19 patients with pneumonia develop a life-threatening complication called acute respiratory distress syndrome, in which fluid leaks into the lungs and makes breathing difficult or impossible. Patients who can’t breathe often become anxious and panicked, which can make it even harder to breathe, said Christopher Friese, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Nursing.\n\nDoctors have many ways to relieve the suffering caused by COVID-19, said Dr. Christian Sinclair, associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Kansas Medical Center. These include oxygen masks or nasal tubes; drugs called bronchodilators that relax muscles in the airways and increase airflow to the lungs; low-dose morphine and anti-anxiety medications, such as Valium or Xanax, he said.\n\nSimple measures can help COVID-19 patients being treated at home, as well, Sinclair said. He recommends helping patients sit up, which can ease breathing problems.\n\nDr. Rab Razzak, a Cleveland palliative care specialist who treats many patients with respiratory illness, also teaches his patients “mindfulness” breathing exercises, similar to those used in meditation.\n\nAlthough a wide range of health professionals can prescribe medication, health providers who don’t specialize in palliative care may be unfamiliar with these therapies, said Arthur Caplan, a bioethics professor at NYU Langone Medical Center.\n\nCaplan noted that palliative care professionals also excel in talking to patients and their loved ones about the end of life – a topic many doctors avoid.\n\nRazzak said his institution is training other health staff to deliver palliative care. And Vital Talk, a nonprofit that teaches communication skills to doctors, has created a “playbook” for talking to patients about coronavirus, including sample scripts doctors can follow.\n\nMore than 1,000 people registered for a March 18 webinar from the Center to Advance Palliative Care about preparing for COVID-19, Meier said. She had to turn others away because the computer system couldn’t handle any more.\n\nDuring the webinar, Dr. R. Sean Morrison of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York said, “Palliative care is everyone’s job. Everyone who comes in with severe COVID-19 is going to have breathlessness and respiratory symptoms,” two symptoms that palliative care doctors are accustomed to treating.\n\nEven under normal working conditions, 22% of patients with serious illness say hospital staff was not attentive to their needs, while 18% reported getting conflicting information from hospital staff, according to a 2018 Commonwealth Fund report.\n\nGoode said her past experience taking care of an elderly grandparent doesn’t inspire confidence that hospitals will be able to meet everyone’s needs.\n\nTwo years ago, Goode’s grandmother had a serious fall. An emergency room doctor told Goode that her grandmother – who had Alzheimer’s disease – was bleeding internally, but was too frail to undergo surgery or other invasive medical interventions. Her grandmother waited 2½ hours to receive pain relievers. She died three days after the fall.\n\n“This was the normal operations on a Thursday afternoon at a Level 2 trauma center,” Goode said. “If the health care system is so overwhelmed that they need to pick and choose who gets care, then they won’t have the bandwidth to administer a lot of the palliative care treatments, either.”\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Stephen Morrison, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Those who have been vaccinated … and boosted would get exposed. Some, maybe a lot of them, will get infected but will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well in the sense of not having hospitalization and death.”\n\nIn contrast, those who are not vaccinated are “going to get the brunt of the severe aspect of this,” he added.\n\nAcross the United States, at least one in five eligible Americans – roughly 65 million people– are not vaccinated against Covid-19. More than 62% of the country has been fully vaccinated, but only 23% are fully vaccinated and boosted, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFauci’s comments came in response to a question about whether the pandemic has entered a new phase. That will come when there’s enough protection in the community and drugs to easily treat severe Covid-19, he said, adding, “We may be on the threshold of that right now.”\n\nAlso Tuesday, US Food and Drug Administration acting commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock said that while most people could catch the virus, the focus now should be on making sure hospitals and essential services function.\n\nWoodcock was responding to a question from Sen. Mike Braun about whether it’s time for the United States to change its Covid-19 strategy. Her statement was not a new assessment of Covid-19, but rather an attempt to make clear the need to prioritize essential services as the Omicron variant surges.\n\n“I think it’s hard to process what’s actually happening right now, which is: Most people are going to get Covid,” Woodcock said Tuesday at a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing. “And what we need to do is make sure the hospitals can still function, transportation, you know, other essential services are not disrupted while this happens.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the number of US patients hospitalized with Covid-19 hit a record high, adding strain to health care networks and pushing states toward emergency staffing and other measures as they struggle to cope.\n\nMore than 145,900 people were in US hospitals with Covid-19 as of Tuesday – a number that surpasses the previous peak from mid-January 2021 (142,246), and is almost twice what it was two weeks ago, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe hospitalization record comes amid a surge in cases fueled by the highly transmissible Omicron variant.\n\nThe United States averaged more than 754,200 new Covid-19 cases daily over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University data. That’s about three times last winter’s peak average (251,987 on January 11, 2021), and 4.5 times the peak from the Delta-driven surge (166,347 on September 1), according to JHU.\n\nThe country has averaged 1,646 Covid-19 deaths a day over the past week – 33% higher than a week ago, according to JHU. The peak average was 3,402 daily on January 13, 2021, JHU data shows.\n\nThe Omicron variant caused 98.3% of new coronavirus cases in the United States last week, according to estimates posted Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA technician administers a Covid-19 test Monday at a drive-thru location at Churchill Downs, Kentucky. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\nLeaders activate new measures to combat surging numbers\n\nHospitals are increasingly juggling staffing issues – not just because of the increased demand, but also because their employees, who are at a high risk of infection, have to isolate and recover after testing positive.\n\nIn Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a limited state of emergency Monday after the number of intensive care unit hospitalizations more than doubled since December 1. The order allows hospitals to expand bed capacity and gives more flexibility in staffing, he said, adding that it also expands the use of telehealth as well as expanding which medical professionals can give vaccines.\n\nIn Texas, at least 2,700 medical staffers are being hired, trained and deployed to assist with the surge, joining more than 1,300 personnel already sent across the state, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement to CNN.\n\nKentucky has mobilized the National Guard to provide support, with 445 members sent to 30 health care facilities, the state announced.\n\n“Omicron continues to burn through the commonwealth, growing at levels we have never seen before. Omicron is significantly more contagious than even the Delta variant,” said Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, noting the earlier variant that spurred a surge of cases in the summer and fall.\n\n“If it spreads at the rate we are seeing, it is certainly going to fill up our hospitals,” he said, and Kentucky is “down to 134 adult ICU beds available.”\n\nAnd New Jersey reinstated a public health emergency, Gov. Phil Murphy announced, saying the state needed to “commit every resource available to beating back the wave” caused by Omicron. In the past two weeks alone, the state saw more than 10,000 people requiring hospitalization due to Covid-19, the governor said in a video announcement.\n\nMitigation measures such as mandatory masking are also being revived in some areas.\n\nDelaware Gov. John Carney signed a universal indoor mask mandate Monday because of hospitalization increases, with some hospitals “over 100% inpatient bed capacity amid crippling staffing shortages,” he said. Churches and places of worship are exempt, while businesses should provide masks to customers and have signage about indoor mask requirements.\n\n“It’s time for everyone to pitch in and do what works. Wear your mask indoors. Avoid gatherings or expect to get and spread Covid. Get your vaccine and, if eligible, get boosted. That’s how we’ll get through this surge without endangering more lives,” Carney said.\n\nShare of hospitalizations from breakthrough infections is growing, but risks for unvaccinated are higher\n\nThe HHS data on Covid-19 hospitalizations includes both those patients who are hospitalized because of Covid-19 complications and those who may have been admitted for something else but test positive for Covid-19. This has been true throughout the pandemic, though the share of patients who fall into each category may have changed over time.\n\nFully vaccinated people are accounting for a growing share of people hospitalized with Covid-19 – but hospitalizations among people who received a booster shot are still rare, and the gap in risk by vaccination status has been wide.\n\nBetween April and July 2021, before the emergence of the Omicron variant, more than 90% of Covid-19 hospitalizations were among people who were either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, according to a study published by the CDC.\n\nBut a sampling of data collected by CNN suggests that figure has dropped to somewhere between 60% and 75% in recent days and months:\n\n• In Pennsylvania, about 75% of Covid-19 hospitalizations between September and early December 2021 were among people who were not fully vaccinated, according to data from the state health department.\n\n• In New York, about 61% of Covid-19 hospitalizations during the week ending January 2, 2022 were among people who were not fully vaccinated, according to data from the state health department.\n\n• Beaumont Health, the largest health care system in Michigan, reported on Thursday that 62% of Covid-19 patients in its eight hospitals were unvaccinated.\n\nIn some hospitals, up to 40% of patients with Covid-19 “are coming in not because they’re sick with Covid, but because they’re coming in with something else and have had Covid or the Omicron variant detected,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nBut Covid-19 cases in hospitals strain resources, regardless of whether a patient was hospitalized because of Covid-19, CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.\n\n“If they get (incidentally) diagnosed with Covid in the hospital, they still need to go into infection protocol – personal protective equipment, all of that still needs to be utilized. So it’s a huge drain on the system overall,” Gupta said Tuesday.\n\nWhile fully vaccinated people are accounting for a larger share of Covid-19 hospitalizations, multiple accounts suggest that those who are fully vaccinated and boosted account for a small share.\n\nIn the University of Maryland Medical System, less than 5% of hospitalized patients were fully vaccinated and boosted, President and CEO Dr. Mohan Suntha said Thursday. Beaumont Health reported Thursday that only 8% of Covid-19 patients were fully vaccinated and boosted.\n\nThe CDC did not respond to CNN’s multiple requests for data on the share of Covid-19 hospitalizations by vaccination status.\n\nThe agency publishes data on its website regarding the relative risk by vaccination status. Cumulatively, the risk of hospitalization has been eight times higher for unvaccinated people than for fully vaccinated people. But in the last week of November, CDC data showed that hospitalization rates were about 17 times higher for unvaccinated people than for fully vaccinated people.\n\nSchools and industries face Omicron issues\n\nThe debate over safety in schools from Covid-19 continues to play out as only about one in six children ages 5 to 11 is fully vaccinated, according to data from the CDC.\n\nAs Los Angeles prepared to return to school on Tuesday, approximately 62,000 students and staff had tested positive for Covid-19 and will have to stay home, data from the Los Angeles Unified School District showed Monday, equating to a 14.99% positivity rate. The positivity rate of Los Angeles County at large, by comparison, has spiked to 22%.\n\nIn Chicago, educators returned to school Tuesday and students are expected to resume in-person learning Wednesday following a nearly weeklong dispute. The Chicago Teachers Union had voted to teach remotely last week, and the school district responded by canceling classes for four days.\n\nThe agreement, announced late Monday, included metrics for when a classroom would need to go remote due to Covid-19 levels.\n\nIn areas where schools have returned to in-person learning after the holiday break, the time needed for those with Covid-19 to recover has impacted some essential services.\n\nOther sectors also are struggling due to high infection rates.\n\nSome municipalities have seen nearly a quarter of their trash collection workforce call in sick in recent weeks due to Covid-19, leading to delays, according to the Solid Waste Association of North America.\n\n“This coincided, unfortunately, with increased trash and recycling volumes associated with the holidays. However, we hope that as volumes decline and sanitation workers return to work, these delays will prove temporary,” executive director and CEO David Biderman said in a statement Monday.\n\nIn travel, US airlines canceled thousands of additional flights over the weekend due to Covid-19 callouts and winter storms, and cruise line Royal Caribbean International announced it has canceled voyages on four ships because of “ongoing Covid-related circumstances around the world.” Last week, Norwegian Cruise Line canceled the voyages of eight ships.\n\nPublic transit systems in major metropolitan areas such as New York City and Washington, DC, have had to scale back service with employees ill from Covid-19.

Here's what history tells ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt was one of the strangest episodes in military history, an event so unusual that it was first treated as a myth.\n\nAt 8:30 pm on Christmas Eve of 1914 in the dank and muddy battlefields of northern Europe during World War I, a British soldier dispatched a report to headquarters: German soldiers have illuminated their trenches and are singing carols while wishing British soldiers a merry Christmas.\n\nBritish officers ordered their men to be silent, but it was too late. A British soldier responded with his own chorus of “The First Noel.” A German soldier called out across No Man’s Land – the barbed wire-strewn, deadly middle ground separating the armies – “Come out, English soldier; come out there to us.”\n\nThe soldiers climbed out of their trenches and met in the middle. So did others, gathering to exchange chocolate, wine and souvenirs. They even organized a soccer game, which the Germans won 3-2.\n\nMost of the soldiers who shook hands on that fog-shrouded Christmas Eve would be dead before the war ended four years later. But letters from survivors and grainy black-and-white photographs prove it was no myth. An estimated 100,000 soldiers on both sides simply refused to fight because they were too exhausted and jaded. The Christmas Truce even lasted until New Year’s in some places.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin attends a wreath-laying ceremony on June 22, 2022 to mark the Soviet Union's war against Nazi Germany in World War II. Putin's army in Ukraine, though, may face a different fate because of larger problems in Russia, experts say. Maxim Shipenkov/Pool/Reuters\n\n“By December 1914, the men in the trenches were veterans, familiar enough with the realities of combat to have lost much of the idealism that they had carried into war in August, and most longed for an end to bloodshed,” according to an account of the Christmas Truce in Smithsonian Magazine.\n\nMore than a century later, there’s little chance that Russian and Ukrainian soldiers will shower each other with gifts this winter. But the Christmas Truce story is an example of a peculiar feature of war that offers a warning to the beleaguered Russian army in Ukraine:\n\nThere are moments throughout history where entire armies suddenly stop fighting, though they are evenly matched or even numerically superior to their enemy.\n\nWhat causes armies to lose the will to fight? And how might that play out with the Russian army in Ukraine?\n\nThis is the question that CNN asked combat veterans and military historians. While history is full of embattled armies like the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II, which fought with ferocious intensity even though they knew they would not win, it also records other armies that “quiet quit” — stopped attacking the enemy or did the bare minimum to stay alive.\n\nRussia’s troops may be approaching that precipice, says Jeff McCausland, a combat veteran of the Gulf War and a visiting professor of international security studies at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania.\n\nHe says it’s become clear that the Russian army is poorly trained and supplied, and that its soldiers in many cases have lost their will to fight.\n\n“Fear and panic are more infectious than Covid” for an army, says McCausland, co-author of “Battle Tested! Gettysburg Leadership Lessons for 21st Century Leaders.”\n\nThe sources for both fear and panic are varied. But McCausland and other historians say that throughout the history of warfare, there are at least three reasons why armies lose the will to fight.\n\nThey lose faith in their cause\n\nMcCausland has seen a broken army lose the will to fight up close.\n\nHe says he commanded a battalion during the Gulf War in 1990-1991 and saw so many Iraqi soldiers surrender that his unit had trouble accommodating the prisoners. They ended up giving water to the captured soldiers and pointing them toward the rear.\n\nWhat happens when an army loses faith in its leaders and its cause? The Iraqi Army in the first Gulf War offers an answer. Iraqi soldiers surrendered in massive numbers, without a fight, to the US and coalition forces. Patrick Durand/Sygma/Getty Images\n\nThe war started when the Iraqi Army under Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. But many Iraqi soldiers simply didn’t think Kuwait or Iraq’s brutal leader were worth dying for.\n\n“There was one instance where Iraqi soldiers surrendered to a drone that was circling over them,” McCausland says.\n\nA more recent example of an army losing the will to fight came in Afghanistan.\n\nAmid the US military’s withdrawal from the country in 2021, the Afghan National Army collapsed. They allowed the Taliban to quickly take control, even though the US had invested years and billions of dollars in training them. It was a low point for President Biden’s administration.\n\nThe reason for the Afghan army’s complex surrender could be distilled in one question, McCausland says.\n\nAn army can outfight and outlast a larger and better equipped foe if they have higher morale. This is one reason why the Afghan army quickly collapsed after the 2021 departure of US military forces, which left military installations empty -- like the sprawling Bagram Air Base north of Kabul. Rahmat Gul/AP\n\n“If you asked a Taliban soldier, ‘What the hell are you fighting for?’ he would say I’m fighting to free my country from the crusaders, just like my grandfather freed the country from the Soviets and my great-great grandfather freed the country from the British. And I’m fighting for my religion, my country and my home,” McCausland says.\n\nAnd if the same question was asked of an Afghan army soldier?\n\n“He would say I’m fighting for a paycheck—if the company commander doesn’t steal it.”\n\nThe Taliban believed in their cause; the Afghan army didn’t, says McCausland.\n\nThey lose faith in their leaders\n\nEvery war has its defining images. The Ukraine war has already yielded some unforgettable ones showing the contrast in leadership styles of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nRecent photos of Putin typically show him attired in a suit, alone at the head of an absurdly long conference table, in a large, sterile room, with a general or bureaucrat cowering at the other end. The caption could well read: “paranoid and isolated dictator in action.”\n\nThe best leaders often inspire their armies by visiting the front lines. Russian President Vladimir Putin has drawn criticism for keeping physical distance from his troops and even from his closest advisors, as this image suggests. Aleksey Nikolskyi/Sputnik/Kremlin/Reuters\n\nContrast those images of Putin with those of Zelensky. One shows him standing resolute with his circle of advisers at night in Kyiv after vowing not to abandon the city even though he and his family were in danger. Other photographs show him in fatigues, buffed and bearded, swapping hugs with soldiers on the front lines.\n\nMcCausland, who is also a national security consultant for CBS radio and television, says the images offer a lesson in leadership.\n\n“Just look at both photos in terms of who would you like to work for,” says McCausland, who offers leadership workshops to companies, non-profits and government institutions through his company, Diamond6. “I don’t care whether you’re in the military or you’re working for a corporation. It’s pretty easy to decide.”\n\nArmies lose the will to fight when they lose faith in their leaders, McCausland and others say.\n\nThey say soldiers don’t expect generals or other leaders to hunker down in frontline trenches with them. But they want to know if their leaders care for them and respect their sacrifice.\n\nIf you want to know how a leader can inspire an army to superhuman levels of endurance, consider this popular story from one of the greatest commanders in history: Alexander the Great.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky, center, visits the town of Bucha, where civilian bodies were found in the street after the town was retaken from Russia by the Ukrainian army. Zelensky has given a master class in effective war leadership, military historians say. Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAlexander was leading his parched army through an unforgiving desert in pursuit of an enemy when scouts returned to him with a scoop of precious water in a helmet. They handed him the helmet in front of his army.\n\nAlexander thanked the soldiers and then, in full view of his troops, poured the water on the ground. He announced he would not take any water unless all his men had the same. His troops cheered.\n\nAlexander the Great never lost a battle.\n\n“So extraordinary was the effect of this action that the water wasted by Alexander was as good as a drink for every man in the army,” one chronicler would write later.\n\nThey lose the backing of their country\n\nWe hear commentators warn about the dangers of hyper-polarization in American politics, the corrupting power of unregulated and virtually untraceable “dark money” and the breakdown of civic norms.\n\nWhat many don’t say is that these trends can become a national security issue in times of war. Put simply, an army can quit when their country becomes too corrupt or divided to support them.\n\nA classic example is the mass collapse of the South Vietnamese Army in the spring of 1975. The US military had been South Vietnam’s big brother and benefactor for a decade as both countries fought the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese army.\n\nBut the South Vietnamese government was riddled with corruption. Its leaders and their cronies siphoned off military aid to enrich themselves, and never built popular support among the populace they purportedly served.\n\nA corrupt and undivided government can drain an army of the will to fight. This is partly why many South Vietnamese soldiers fled the battlefield during the fall of their country in 1975. Many abandoned their uniforms on the road as they fled. Jacques Pavlovsky/Sygma/Getty Images\n\nAfter the US military withdrew combat troops in 1973, the North Vietnamese army launched its final offensive on Saigon two years later. The South Vietnamese army refused to fight. News photos from that period show the army’s equipment littering roadways as soldiers abandoned their units and attempted to hide among the civilian population, says Derek Frisby, a historian at Middle Tennessee State University.\n\n“Once it looked like North was going to take over the South, there was nothing the South Vietnamese army could do about it,” Frisby says. “Once the Americans left, it [the loss of South Vietnam) seemed inevitable.”\n\nWars aren’t just fought by soldiers. They are fought by a country, and its people and its institutions. They are what historian Michael Butler calls “social endeavors.”\n\nThe health of a country’s institutions - its government, military and media outlets – matter just as much as a soldier’s will to fight, says Butler, author of “Selling a ‘Just’ War: Framing Legitimacy and U.S. Military Intervention.”\n\nButler pointed to “On War,” the pioneering work by the 19th century Prussian military strategist Carl von Clausewitz, who wrote that the “forces of passion” are every bit as critical to a successful war effort as the military and the government.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin reviews naval troops as he attends a parade marking Russian Navy Day on July 31, 2022. Olga Maltseva/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIf a government is corrupt and does not have the trust of the people, its armies can lose the will to fight, Butler says. He says that appears to be taking place in Russia, where society has long been afflicted by a “societal malaise.”\n\nIts citizens have experienced the traumatic breakup of the Soviet Union, rampant corruption, political apathy, and the crushing of independent media and dissenting voices, he says. Political apathy has grown.\n\nThe malaise afflicting civic Russia may be spreading to its military, he says, adding that the signs are already there in the thousands of men fleeing Russia to escape conscription.\n\n“That’s pretty compelling evidence that that the forces of passion are not really effectively locked into this war,” says Butler, a political science professor at Clark University in Massachusetts. “It’s not surprising to see that playing out on the battlefield with troops who are deserting or disengaging.”\n\nThe forces of passion now, though, seem to favor Ukraine. Its army’s men and women (women soldiers serve in combat units in the Ukrainian military) know what they’re fighting for.\n\n“Ukrainians are motivated by perhaps the strongest force a soldier can have – defense of their country, families and homes,” McCausland says.\n\nThe big question for Russian troops this winter\n\nThe US military faced a crisis of morale half a century ago in Vietnam.\n\nAmerican troops never surrendered during the Vietnam War. They never lost a major battle during the war. The 1968 Tet Offensive, a failed campaign by North Vietnam’s army and the Viet Cong, was a military victory for the US.\n\nMany US troops lost the will to fight in Vietnam in part because of a massive anti-war movement in their native country. In this photo, demonstrators march down Fifth Avenue in New York City in 1968 to protest against US involvement in the war. AP\n\nAnd yet it was also a devastating political loss. The American public turned against the war. Antiwar protests rocked the country. The American public grew enraged when they learned their country’s political and military leaders had lied to them about the purpose and success of the war.\n\nMany American combat soldiers simply lost the will to fight. The US’ abrupt withdrawal from Vietnam was one of the most humiliating chapters in our history.\n\nThe political context of the US’s war in Vietnam was different than the current war in Ukraine. In Russia, war protests have been crushed and the media has largely been uncritical of Putin’s conduct.\n\nBut on the battlefield, many Russian soldiers are discovering what some American soldiers realized in Vietnam — that they are fighting for a lie.\n\nAs John Kerry, a Vietnam combat veteran and future Senator who turned against the war, put it during a 1971 congressional hearing:\n\n“How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?’\n\nThis is the question that may haunt Russian soldiers in Ukraine this winter. If Putin doesn’t give them an answer that makes their hardships worthwhile, the mass migration of men fleeing Russia after conscription may spread to the battlefield.\n\nAnd one frigid winter night, when the only sounds may not be of Christmas carols but of men dying on the battlefield, Russian soldiers may ask one another:\n\nHow do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?”", "authors": ["John Blake"], "publish_date": "2022/10/29"}]}

Most grocery stores, restaurants and retail shops will be open. In Atlanta, the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park has been closed due to the partial government shutdown, but a grant from the Delta Air Lines Foundation will open the park through Feb. 3. The park includes King's birth home, Ebenezer Baptist Church where King was a co-pastor, Fire Station No. 6 and a visitor center.

His calculation is based on weather conditions, debt levels, time since Christmas and time since failing our new year’s resolutions. But, the validly of the equation is questionable. Mental health expert Isabella Goldie says depression can’t be calculated and the concept of Blue Monday is largely a PR stunt used to sell items advertised to improve wellbeing.\n\nNYC is getting a little cheaper\n\nNew York City is appealing to visitors for countless reasons, but price is not usually one of them. Starting Monday, the city will be at its cheapest thanks to a new initiative called NYC Winter Outing organized by the tourism marketing association, NYC & Company. For the first time, NYC Restaurant Week, NYC Broadway Week and NYC Must-See Week will take place at the same time.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nJoe Biden knows what it’s like to be the youngest guy in the room – he was sworn in as a senator at 30, the minimum age allowed by the Constitution.\n\nWe all now know what it’s like for Biden to be the oldest president in history – if he stands for reelection in 2024 and wins, he’ll be 86 at the end of a second term.\n\nThe people who wrote the Constitution adopted an age minimum for presidents – 35 – but they set no maximum, perhaps not realizing that hundreds of years later, people would be living much longer lives.\n\nA defense against dynasties\n\nOne reason the framers agreed on a minimum age for presidents was to avoid American political dynasties, according to the National Constitution Center.\n\nJames Monroe, the future President who opposed ratification of the Constitution, said that 35 was a good minimum age because, “in the course of nature very few fathers leave a son who has arrived to that age.”\n\nTimes have changed. Biden is an outlier in the US for being a President who has lost two children, but he has a son who is 52 and a daughter who is 41.\n\n25, 30, 35\n\nThere is an arbitrary feeling to the age minimums set by the Constitution. Starting with the minimum age of 25 set for members of the House, the framers added five years for senators and five more for president.\n\nThey set no age requirements or other specific qualifications for Supreme Court justices, including length of service, which is why the new conservative majority could be ensconced for generations.\n\nThe argument to step aside\n\nWhile the Constitution allows for old presidents, political pundits are increasingly loud about questioning the wisdom of a Biden run for reelection.\n\nThe Atlantic writer Mark Leibovich wrote a plea in June titled, “Why Biden Shouldn’t Run in 2024,” for the President to bow out after one term. His argument was that the President is too old, although Leibovich was ashamed to admit it.\n\n“It all feels impolite to point this out—disrespectful, ageist, and taboo, especially given the gross Republican smears about Biden being a doddering and demented old puppet,” Leibovich wrote. “No one wants to perpetuate this garbage.”\n\nThis weekend, The New York Times writer Peter Baker took a more analytical look at Biden’s age, reporting how the President spends most weekends at home in Delaware and calibrates his schedule to avoid especially long foreign trips and to tamp down on evening appearances.\n\nMany presidents live very long lives\n\nBiden doesn’t turn 80 until November and could well have decades of life ahead of him.\n\nNo US president has lived to 100, but recent presidents have all lived very long lives.\n\nJimmy Carter is the longest-living former President, a 97-year-old cancer survivor. Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford all lived into their 90s. But all these men enjoyed long retirements: 15 years for Reagan, 25 for Bush, nearly 30 for Ford, and 41 and counting for Carter.\n\nWe’ve seen this movie before\n\nThe oldest presidents often face questions about their fitness, typically in the form of whisper campaigns from their political rivals.\n\nDonald Trump, who was in his 70s as President, frequently saw his temperament questioned. Reagan ultimately developed Alzheimer’s disease, but allegations that he showed symptoms in his final years in office have never been proven.\n\nRELATED: Reagan didn’t have Alzheimer’s while in office\n\nRunning into their 80s\n\nBiden’s old Senate colleagues routinely run for reelection in their 80s.\n\nSen. Charles Grassley of Iowa is running for reelection, and he turns 89 in September.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who is the subject of ageist questions about her fitness, recently turned 89, and her term lasts until the 2024 election.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, on the other hand, decided last year when he was 81 not to run for reelection.\n\nOther senators like Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Richard Burr of North Carolina seem downright young for planning to retire from the Senate while in their 60s.\n\nDecades at the top\n\nNancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn, all in their 80s, have been top Democrats in the House since 2002.\n\nIf Democrats lose control of the House after November’s midterm elections, it would be an obvious moment for the party to begin looking to a new generation of leaders.\n\nThe facts vs. the smears\n\nWhen The Atlantic column urging Biden not to seek reelection was published in June, CNN’s John Harwood tried to separate the valid questions about aging from the false and politically damaging idea that Biden is not cogent and capable.\n\n“What’s true is the presidency is a hugely taxing job mentally and physically, and Joe Biden is old,” Harwood said on “Reliable Sources.” He added: “He doesn’t talk or walk as smoothly as he once did.”\n\nWhat is not true is the trope pushed in conservative media that Biden is not currently mentally capable of doing the job. The President is engaged and acute, Harwood said.\n\nMajorities have concerns\n\nWhen I asked CNN’s polling editor Ariel Edwards-Levy for recent examples of public opinion on Biden’s age, she provided multiple examples of majorities of Americans thinking Biden’s advanced age is an issue:\n\nIn a November 2021 Fox poll , 53% of registered voters said that Biden’s age was interfering with his ability to serve effectively as President, and 40% said it was not.\n\nIn a February 2022 ABC News/Washington Post poll , 40% of US adults said they thought Biden “has the mental sharpness it takes to serve effectively as president,” while 54% said he did not.\n\nDiscomfort with Biden’s age extends to Democrats as they look to the next presidential election:\n\nNew York Times/Siena College poll released on Monday finds that 64% of voters who intend to vote in the 2024 Democratic primary would prefer a nominee other than Biden. Among the group who would prefer a different nominee, 33% say that their reason for wanting someone different is mostly to do with Biden’s age, with another 3% citing his mental acuity.\n\nBeating back age questions in 2020\n\nBiden overcame many younger Democratic candidates to win the nomination in 2020, when the top priority for many voters was simply to defeat Trump. Voters will have other things on their minds in 2024, particularly if Trump is not a candidate or does not win the GOP nomination.\n\nEdwards-Levy also argued that people’s attitude toward politicians’ ages can often be at least partially a reflection of how they feel about that candidate more generally.\n\nIn other words, Biden’s age is a problem so long as Biden is not popular.\n\nOr, as Harwood said last month, “Joe Biden would look a little bit younger if he was at 50% (approval) than at 40%, but he’s not – and so he’s going to have to deal with these stories for some time.”", "authors": ["Zachary B.

On March 25, the same survey showed a much tighter race, with Biden leading by just 2 percentage points, 49%-47%.\n\nAnd Trump's overall approval rating has slipped since the March 25 poll, which for the first time in his presidency found more Americans approving (48%) than disapproving (46%) of the job he was doing. In May's poll, his approval rating dropped 2 points to 46% and his disapproval rating jumped 7 points to 53%.\n\nDemocratic and Republican voters were firmly behind their party's standard-bearers, 95% and 94%, respectively. But Biden had a wide lead among registered independents, 56%-39%, after leading by just 1 point with those voters two months ago.\n\nThe candidates' support showed sharp divides by gender and race. Trump led by 8 points among male voters (52%-44%) and Biden held a 28-point advantage among female voters (62%-34%). Trump led by 9 percentage points among white voters, 53%-44%, while Biden was backed by 89% of black voters and 69% of Hispanic voters.\n\nTrump's slide has coincided with the spread of the coronavirus across the U.S. When the previous poll was released, there were fewer than 70,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and the death toll was under 1,300. There are now nearly 1.8 million confirmed cases in the U.S. and more than 104,000 people dead from the disease.\n\nThe poll of 1,001 Americans was conducted May 25-28 and therefore does not reflect the full impact of recent anti-police brutality protests on voters' opinions. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\n'The symmetry is remarkable':Wisconsin perfectly divided between 2 parties – and over Trump\n\nOpinions flip on coronavirus response\n\nThe last ABC/Post poll found the majority of Americans (51%) approved of Trump's handling of the outbreak, with 45% disapproving. Those numbers have virtually flipped in two months, with 53% now saying they disapprove of his response to the crisis and 46% saying they approve.\n\nWhen asked who they trusted more to handle the government's coronavirus response, 50% said Biden and 42% said Trump. But they were evenly split 47%-47% when asked who they trusted more to manage the economic recovery from the pandemic.\n\nThe lockdowns and stay-at-home orders meant to slow the spread of the virus have devastated the economy and driven unemployment to levels not seen since the Great Depression. The weakened economy undermines a cornerstone of Trump's reelection pitch, which has centered on a thriving stock market and low unemployment.\n\nIn a November 2018 ABC/Post poll, 65% of Americans had a positive view of the economy and 34% had a negative one. Now, those numbers are inverted, with 34% holding a positive view of the economy and 65% a negative one.\n\nBiden leads Trump 66%-30% among Americans who have been laid off or furloughed since the outbreak started. A 52% majority still approves of Trump's handling of the economy, down from 57% two months ago.\n\nMany states are expanding mail-in and absentee voting in response to the outbreak. Trump has strongly objected to those efforts, claiming, without evidence, that it would lead to massive election fraud. Despite the president's concerns, 65% of Americans support an increase in voting-by-mail-in, while 30% are opposed.\n\nAn enthusiasm gap between Trump, Biden\n\nAn area where Trump holds an advantage over Biden is in the enthusiasm of his supporters. Eight-seven percent of the registered voters who said they favor Trump in the election said they will \"definitely\" vote for the president and 90% said they were enthusiastic about doing so.\n\nBy contrast, 74% of the voters who back Biden said they would definitely vote for him and 76% were enthusiastic about it. (Twelve percent were \"not at all\" enthusiastic.) And Biden's 10-point lead among registered voters drops to 5% among those who are both registered and say they are \"certain\" to vote.\n\nBiden's 46% favorability rating was only slightly higher than Trump's (42%), and was down 7 points from September. When it came to unfavorable ratings, the margin was wider, with 55% of Americans saying they viewed the president unfavorably and 48% saying the same of his opponent. But that represented an 11-point increase in unfavorability for Biden since September.\n\nGeorge Floyd:Biden meets with black leaders at local church amid unrest\n\nFifty percent of Americans said Trump is a strong leader, compared with 43% who said that of Biden. But when it came to who they thought was honest and trustworthy, Biden bested Trump 48%-35%. And 45% said Biden \"understands the problems of people like you,\" while 35% said Trump did. Americans also thought Biden's temperament was better suited for the job than Trump's, with 53% saying his personality fit the role compared to 38% who thought that of Trump.\n\nThe president and his supporters have also attacked the 77-year-old Biden as \"Sleepy Joe\" and implied age was sapping his cognitive ability. But 51% said Biden \"has the mental sharpness it takes to serve effectively as president,\" while 43% said he did not.\n\nOn the other hand, a 52% majority said Trump lacked the mental sharpness needed for the job, while 46% said his mind was up for it.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/01"}]}

Now port congestion and delays are back and could be around for a while.\n\nCovid lockdowns in China have wreaked havoc at Shanghai, the world’s biggest container port, and are now causing problems at other major ports around the world.\n\nSome Chinese cities, including Shanghai, have started easing Covid restrictions in recent days, but experts say that the damage has already been done, and global shipping will suffer well into the summer. That could exert even more pressure on global supply chains already reeling from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and keep inflation running hot.\n\nData from Project44, which tracks global supply chains, showed that shipment delays between China and major US and European ports have quadrupled since late March, when China shut down the city of Shanghai, which has the world’s busiest container port.\n\nA Cosco Shipping container ship is seen at the Yangshan Deep Water Port amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Shanghai, China April 24, 2022. Str/Reuters\n\nBy the end of April, ships from China to Seattle were taking four days longer than expected to arrive, up from about one day the previous month.\n\nThe time it takes ships to leave China and arrive at major ports around the world increased steadily over the past year, but there had been some signs of relief since December with transit times between Shanghai and Long Beach, for example, dropping in January and February.\n\nSince March, however, there’s been a sharp increase again in transit times on that route.\n\nTo add to the problem, many truck drivers have struggled to reach ports in China to pick up containers because of travel restrictions and Covid testing requirements. Shipping giant Maersk warned in an advisory last month that trucking services in Shanghai would be “severely” impacted by these restrictions.\n\n“With the manufacturing industry being shuttered [in Shanghai] and truckers unable to travel quickly, exports have been reduced, and shipment delays have increased,” said Josh Brazil, director of Supply Chain Data Insights at Project44.\n\nDelays will “continue into the summer months,” as factories struggle to return to normal operations in Shanghai, he added.\n\nAlthough authorities have allowed some businesses to restart production, many workers are still stuck in quarantine at home. Factories that do reopen are facing component shortages and difficulty in securing trucks to carry goods into or out of the port.\n\n“The ripples in shipment delays are only beginning to become visible and are expected to extend well into the next few months,” said Brazil.\n\nShanghai — China’s leading financial center and most populous city — has been under a strict lockdown since late March. More than 8 million residents are still banned from leaving their residential compounds. The Covid restrictions have spread to other cities, including Beijing — the nation’s capital.\n\nShanghai port remained open throughout the lockdown, but data from various shipping firms show an increasing backlog of ships and containers.\n\nUS supply chain companies have expressed concerns about fresh chaos heading towards American ports, which are still recovering from the severe congestion and delays they suffered last year.\n\nShelley Simpson, chief commercial officer for JB Hunt Transport Services, said late last month that while there has been “a temporary relief” at US ports, things may get a lot “a lot worse” this summer because of what’s happening in China.\n\nIt “just takes a little bit of disruption to really change the environment all over again,” she added.\n\nShips and containers jam the ports\n\nShipping queues are getting worse in China — and other parts of the world.\n\nNearly 20% of container vessels globally are currently waiting outside congested ports, according to a survey published last Thursday by Windward, an Israel-based global maritime data firm.\n\nAlmost a quarter of those unberthed ships are stuck outside Chinese ports. That’s 412 ships, up 58% since February, the survey added.\n\nIt’s clear that lockdowns in China have caused a bottleneck, the firm said.\n\nAcross China, at least 27 cities are under full or partial lockdown, which could be impacting up to 185 million residents across the country, according to latest CNN calculation on Wednesday. Beijing effectively shut down its largest district this week.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping signaled this week that China would continue with its zero tolerance approach to Covid. On Thursday, Xi told all levels of government to “resolutely adhere to the zero-Covid policy.”\n\nChina is home to seven of the world’s top ten container ports, including Shanghai, Ningbo-Zhoushan, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong. In Shanghai — the epicenter of China’s current Covid outbreak, the situation remains severe.\n\nThe number of vessels waiting at the Port of Shanghai had increased to 384 by April 25, up 27% from a month earlier, according to most recent data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nPressure is also building on other Chinese ports, as vessels try to find alternative ports to berth. Ships have faced growing delays since late March outside Ningbo-Zhoushan port, the world’s third largest port, less than a hundred miles from Shanghai, according to Lloyd’s List Intelligence.\n\nContainers are also piling up because of truck shortages.\n\nTrucks wait to load containers at Yangshan Deepwater Port on April 27, 2022 in Shanghai, China. Tian Yuhao/China News Service/Getty Images\n\nAt the peak of the lockdown in Shanghai, containers were sitting for as many as 15 days at the port before being picked up by truckers, up from fewer than 5 days when the restrictions first took effect, Project 44 data showed. The average wait time has since come down but was still 10 days last Wednesday.\n\nZhang Wei, vice mayor of Shanghai, acknowledged last week that the city is seeing “reduced efficiency” in cargo transport and “poor logistics” since the lockdown.\n\nManufacturing and trade take a hit\n\nThe turmoil at the ports has already hit China’s factories and foreign trade, as manufacturers have to wait longer to get raw materials.\n\nIt is also harder for them to ship their products to customers. Inventories of finished goods have surged to the highest level in about a decade, as products pile up in warehouses due to weak demand and the difficulty of finding trucks to move them.\n\nCranes lift containers at Yangshan Deepwater Port on April 27, 2022 in Shanghai, China. Tian Yuhao/China News Service/Getty Images\n\nLatest PMI surveys — released on Saturday — showed that factory activity slumped to the worst level since February 2020, when China was battling the initial Covid outbreak. New export orders that manufacturers received in April fell at a much faster pace than in March.\n\nThe decline in export orders showed that the chaos at some major ports, including Shanghai, have hit China’s trade with the rest of the world, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.\n\n“Worryingly, there was plenty of evidence of worsening supply pressures, with supplier delivery times collapsing, input prices surging and inventories of finished good rising to their highest since June 2012,” wrote Mitul Kotecha, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities, in a report.\n\n“Such supply pressures will have ramifications across supply chains globally, as already evidenced in some recent US Q1 earnings reports in the tech sector,” he added.\n\nGlobal inflation to go higher\n\nThe situation in Shanghai will push global inflation higher this year, said Daejin Lee, associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nHe pointed out that last year’s inflation was driven by two factors — supply shortages of key parts owing to supply chain bottlenecks, and record high container freight rates.\n\nBoth problems continue this year, even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has fueled global inflation by driving up prices for energy and other key commodities.\n\n“Another lengthy delay” in seaborne supply of key parts because of China’s port congestion could increase consumer prices “much faster than previously expected,” Lee said.\n\nMaersk said Wednesday that freight rates will stay elevated as supply chain pressures persist. According to the company, congestion in sectors such as trucking and warehousing in mainland China, have created “bottlenecks, resulting in challenged supply chain management services and elevated rates.”\n\nThe company’s average freight rate jumped 71% in the first quarter from a year earlier.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/world/coronavirus-newsletter-intl-07-13-22/index.html", "title": "BA.5: The 'worst variant' is here | CNN", "text": "This is the weekly edition of CNN’s coronavirus newsletter. Look out for your roundup every Wednesday. If you haven’t subscribed yet, sign up here.\n\nCNN —\n\nNearly two-and-a-half years since the coronavirus pandemic began, the most infectious and transmissible variant yet has arrived.\n\nRepeated Covid-19 waves have left millions of people dead, with only vaccines helping to blunt the toll. Now the virus is spreading again — evolving, escaping immunity and driving an uptick in cases and hospitalizations. The latest version of its shape-shifting, BA.5, is a clear sign that the pandemic is far from over.\n\nThe newest offshoot of Omicron, along with a closely related variant, BA.4, are fueling a global surge in cases — 30% over the past fortnight, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nIn Europe, the Omicron subvariants are powering a spike in cases of about 25%, though Dr. Michael Ryan, the executive director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Program, has said that number may actually be higher, given the “almost collapse in testing.” BA.5 is on the march in China, ratcheting anxieties that major cities there may soon re-enforce strict lockdown measures that were only recently lifted. And the same variant has become the dominant strain in the United States, where it accounted for 65% of new infections last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nDr. Fauci explains why new BA.5 subvariant is concerning 04:58 - Source: CNN\n\n“We have been watching this virus evolve rapidly. We’ve been planning and preparing for this moment. And the message that I want to get across to the American people is this: BA.5 is something we’re closely monitoring, and most importantly, we know how to manage it,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator, in a news briefing on Tuesday.\n\nOn the same day, WHO’s Emergency Committee said Covid-19 remained a Public Health Emergency of International Concern — its highest level of alert, first declared on January 20, 2020 — amid rising cases, ongoing viral mutation and increasing pressure on already overstretched health systems. In a statement, the committee, which is made up of independent experts, highlighted challenges to the ongoing global Covid-19 response, including a drop-off in testing and spotty genome sequencing, raising the question of just how accurately any nation might reasonably be able to monitor BA.5.\n\nOfficial data dramatically undercount the true number of infections in the US, epidemiologists say, leaving the nation with a critical blind spot as the most transmissible coronavirus variant yet takes hold. Some experts think there could be as many as 1 million new infections every day in the broader US population — 10 times higher than the official count.\n\nAs for how to manage the new wave, Jha urged Americans aged 50 and older to get second booster shots. Adults who are up to date with vaccinations are less likely to be hospitalized than those who are unvaccinated. But only about one in four adults in the US over 50 have gotten their recommended second boosters, data collected by the CDC show.\n\nUS health officials are urgently working on a plan to allow second Covid-19 boosters for all adults, a senior White House official confirmed to CNN on Monday, amid fears that younger adults’ immunity may be waning as Covid-19 cases rise with the dominance of BA.5.\n\nWhat makes BA.5 different? Eric Topol, a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research, has called BA.5 “the worst version of the virus we’ve seen.” He explained in a recent newsletter: “It takes immune escape, already extensive, to the next level, and, as a function of that, enhanced transmissibility,” well beyond earlier versions of Omicron.\n\nIn other words, BA.5 can easily evade immunity from previous infections and vaccines, increasing the risk of reinfection. Though the variant does not appear to lead to more severe illness, in an interview with CNN on Monday, Topol said that given the extent of BA.5’s immune evasion, he expects to see an escalation in hospitalizations, as we’ve seen in Europe and elsewhere that the variant has taken root. “One good thing is it doesn’t appear to be accompanied by the ICU admissions and the deaths as previous variants, but this is definitely concerning,” he added.\n\nPublic health experts in the US may take some solace from the trajectory of the variant in Europe. WHO’s Ryan said last week that while many European countries are experiencing a jump in hospitalizations, “what we’re not seeing is an increase in intensive care unit admissions, so the vaccines are very much still working and it is those gaps in immunity that are causing the problem.”\n\nBut still, steep reductions in Covid-19 surveillance worldwide are hindering epidemiologists’ efforts as they race to trace the virus’ evolution.\n\n“Sub-variants of Omicron, like BA.4 and BA.5, continue to drive waves of cases, hospitalization and death around the world,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a media briefing on Tuesday. “Surveillance has reduced significantly – including testing and sequencing – making it increasingly difficult to assess the impact of variants on transmission, disease characteristics, and the effectiveness of counter-measures.”\n\n“New waves of the virus demonstrate again that the Covid-19 [pandemic] is nowhere near over,” he added.\n\nYOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED.\n\nQ: Will we ever know how the pandemic began?\n\nA: A team of international scientists tasked with understanding the origins of the coronavirus pandemic released its first report on Thursday, saying that all hypotheses remain on the table, including a possible laboratory incident.\n\n“I don’t think that most people should have to change their daily activities, but I do think people need to be aware of their risk of contracting Covid-19 if they don’t take additional precautions,” Wen said. The question to ask yourself, she added, is this: How much do I want to continue to avoid infection?\n\nFor individuals who want to reduce their risk, Wen advises that they stay up to date with their boosters (in the US, everyone age 5 and older can receive a first booster, and those 50 and older can receive a second booster for a total of four shots). She also recommends wearing a high-quality N95 mask or equivalent in indoor, crowded settings, and staying outside for large gatherings as much as possible — something easier to do in the summertime.\n\n“For those who find masks uncomfortable, I’d encourage mask-wearing in the highest-risk settings — for example, mask while in a crowded security line at the airport and during boarding and deplaning,” she said.\n\nSend your questions here.

Those who are “not suitable” for vaccination will be exempt from the requirement, a city official said, without clarifying how they can provide the proof needed for exemption.\n\nThe vaccine mandate comes as Beijing reported three cases of the highly contagious Omicron subvariant. Several Chinese cities have imposed new curbs after detecting BA.5. Shanghai, which only recently emerged from a two-month lockdown, identified its first case on Friday and will perform two rounds of Covid tests this week. An outbreak of BA.5 has already shut down the northwestern city of Xi’an, home to 13 million people, where entertainment, sports and religious venues have been closed, and restaurants limited to takeaway and delivery services.\n\nCasinos in the gambling hub of Macao were ordered to shut for the first time since February 2020 because of a Covid outbreak, sending shares of their operating companies plunging, and fears of new lockdowns in Shanghai undermined the broader China market. Chinese stocks remained under pressure after Monday’s sell-off fueled by the threat of new Covid restrictions, especially the tech sector, Laura He reports.\n\nPeople stand in line at a coronavirus testing site in Beijing on July 4. Andy Wong/AP\n\nDrug-resistant infections and deaths have risen among hospital patients\n\nThe US had made significant progress in fighting drug-resistant infections in recent years. But those gains were largely erased during the Covid-19 pandemic, with hospital-acquired infections and resulting deaths rising 15% in 2020, according to new data, Deidre McPhillips reports.\n\nA special report released Tuesday by the CDC found that more than 29,400 people died from antimicrobial-resistant infections in the first year of the pandemic — nearly 40% of those deaths were among people who got the infection while in the hospital. The full number is probably even higher, given that data for half of the 18 pathogens identified as threats are unavailable or delayed.\n\nWHO has called antimicrobial resistance a “silent pandemic,” and drug-resistant infections were linked to nearly 5 million deaths globally in 2019. The Covid-19 pandemic probably contributed to the increased risk in the US, particularly because many people delayed care or left infections untreated — either because of closed clinics or fear of exposing themselves to Covid-19 — which can increase the risk of developing drug resistance.\n\nPulse oximeters don’t work as well for people of color\n\nOften when Dr. Thomas Valley sees a new patient in the intensive care unit at Michigan Medicine in Ann Arbor, he clamps a pulse oximeter on their finger — one of the many devices he uses to gauge their health and what course of care they require, whether they are a child having seizures, a teenage car accident victim or an older person with Covid-19.\n\nBut recently, Valley, an assistant professor in the University of Michigan’s Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, realized that the small device may yield less accurate oxygen readings in patients with dark skin. If the device isn’t calibrated correctly, the darker pigmentation can affect how the light is absorbed by the sensor, leading to flawed oxygen readings and patients being discharged when they shouldn’t.\n\nThe findings of Valley and his colleagues add to a growing body of research – dating back to the 1980s – that suggests flawed pulse oximeter readings among Black and brown patients can be a real and life-threatening issue in medical care. But the public has only recently been made more aware of this health disparity, and US health officials have announced plans to investigate the accuracy of pulse oximeters, Jacqueline Howard reports.\n\nTOP TIP\n\nAdvice for anxious new moms\n\nEdith Bracho-Sanchez, director of pediatric telemedicine and assistant professor of pediatrics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, didn’t think she’d be an anxious mom. But that changed when she had her son. “I stress over every decision I make for William. I make long pro and con lists, I discuss everything with my partner, sleep on things and ultimately, I pray,” she wrote in a recent column for CNN.\n\nKnowing how difficult it is to make decisions — big and small — she said she understood why some parents might struggle with the choice to vaccinate their children against Covid-19. This is why she says she did it, and her advice to anxious new moms like her:\n\nFirst, Covid-19 is an unpredictable illness. While most children have minor symptoms and recover well, many have landed in hospitals and emergency rooms, and to date, more than 400 children under the age of 5 have died from the illness in the US alone, according to the CDC. We also don’t yet fully understand the long-term effects of the disease.\n\nSecond, I know the vaccine is in the body for a short period of time and with a specific mission. It instructs the body to make protective antibodies against Covid-19, and the body’s own cellular mechanisms quickly break it down soon after. Because of this, there really is no plausible way it will interfere with my little William’s development, something about which I am constantly thinking.\n\nLISTEN TO OUR PODCAST\n\nIs it possible we’ve been going about conversation the wrong way our entire lives?

Rising unemployment could make it ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nLast year, Auckland’s largest real estate company couldn’t sell properties quickly enough to meet demand in New Zealand’s biggest city.\n\nHouses were “flying out the door,” said Grant Sykes, a manager at real estate agency Barfoot & Thompson. “There were chin-dropping moments when agents stand around the room and are gobsmacked at the prices being achieved,” he told CNN Business.\n\nIn one example, a property sold for 1 million New Zealand dollars ($610,000) above the asking price in an auction that lasted all of eight minutes. (Most homes in New Zealand are sold at auction.)\n\nThat was in May 2021, when sales attracted thousands of bidders who drove prices ever higher. Since then, Barfoot & Thompson’s clearance rate at auction has plummeted, according to Sykes, prolonging sales times and sending prices lower.\n\nThe time it takes to sell a property in New Zealand has increased by around 10 days on average since October 2021, according to the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand. Sales have plunged nearly 35% and median house prices are down 7.5% over the past year.\n\nHouses in the suburb of Devonport across from the central business district of Auckland, New Zealand. Brendon O'Hagan/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nNew Zealand is at the sharp end of a global housing market squeeze that has grim ramifications for the world economy.\n\nThe pandemic boom, which sent prices into the stratosphere, is running out of steam and house prices now are falling from Canada to China, setting the stage for the broadest housing market slowdown since the global financial crisis.\n\nRising interest rates are driving the dramatic change. Central banks on a warpath against inflation have taken rates to levels not seen for more than a decade, with ripple effects on the cost of borrowing.\n\nUS mortgage rates topped 7% last month for the first time since 2002, up from just over 3% a year ago, before pulling back slightly in November as inflation eased. In the European Union and United Kingdom, mortgage rates have more than doubled since last year, chasing would-be buyers from the market.\n\n“Overall, this is the most worrying housing market outlook since 2007-2008, with markets poised between the prospect of modest declines and much steeper ones of 15%-20%,” said Adam Slater, a lead economist at Oxford Economics, a consultancy.\n\nOne key factor determining how low prices go? Unemployment. A sharp increase in joblessness could lead to forced sales and foreclosures, “where steep discounts are common,” according to Slater.\n\nBut even if the correction in prices is mild, a housing market slowdown could have severe consequences because housing transactions in turn boost activity in other sectors of the economy.\n\n“In an ideal world, you’ll get a bit of froth blown off the top [of house prices] and everything is fine. It isn’t impossible, but it’s more likely that housing downturns come with nastier consequences,” Slater told CNN Business.\n\nWarning signs\n\nHouse prices are already falling in more than half of the 18 advanced economies that Oxford Economics tracks, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Australia and Canada, where prices dropped by around 7% from February to August.\n\n“Data lags probably mean that most markets are now seeing falling prices,” said Slater. “We’re in the early period in quite a clear downturn now and the only real question is how steep and how long it’s going to be.”\n\nHouse prices in the United States — which rose during the pandemic by the most since the 1970s — are falling too. Economists at Goldman Sachs expect a decline of around 5%-10% from the peak reached in June through to March 2024.\n\nIn a “pessimistic” scenario, US prices could plunge as much as 20%, Dallas Fed economist Enrique Martinez-Garcia wrote in a blog post recently.\n\nPrices for new homes in China fell at the fastest pace in over seven years in October, according to official figures, reflecting a deepening property market slump that has gripped the country for months and is weighing heavily on its economy. Home sales have fallen by 43% this year, according to China Index Academy, a research firm.\n\nSales are sliding elsewhere too, as banks take a more cautious approach to lending and aspiring homebuyers delay purchases in the face of much higher borrowing costs and a deteriorating economic outlook.\n\nHouse sales in Britain were 32% below the previous year’s level in September, according to official figures. A closely watched survey showed that new buyer inquiries fell for the sixth successive month in October to the lowest level since 2008, excluding the early months of 2020 when the market was largely shut because of the pandemic.\n\nIn the United States, sales of existing homes were down by more than 28% year-over-year in October, the ninth consecutive monthly decline, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\nMortgage rates in 25 major cities around the world tracked by UBS have almost doubled on average since last year, making house purchases much less affordable.\n\n“A skilled service sector worker can afford roughly one-third less housing space than before the pandemic,” according to the UBS Global Real Estate Bubble Index.\n\nAn estate agent's 'for sale' board is pictured on a house at the end of a row of terraced homes in northern England on November 2, 2022. Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs well as putting off new buyers, the sharp increase in rates has shocked existing homeowners accustomed to more than a decade of ultra-low borrowing costs.\n\nIn Britain, more than 4 million mortgages have been issued to first-time buyers since 2009, when rates were near zero. “There’s a lot of people out there who don’t appreciate what it’s like when their monthly outgoings rise,” said Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at broker Knight Frank.\n\nIn countries with a larger share of variable rate mortgages, such as Sweden and Australia, the shock will be immediate and could increase the risk of forced sales that drive prices down faster.\n\nBut even in places where a large proportion of mortgages are fixed, such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom, the average maturity of these mortgages is quite short.\n\n“This means much more debt will be subject to (often significantly) higher rates over the next year or so than might first appear to be the case,” Slater wrote in a report last month.\n\nJobs are key\n\nWhile interest rates have been the catalyst for the housing market slowdown, the jobs market will play a bigger role in determining how low prices ultimately plunge.\n\nModeling of past house price crashes by Oxford Economics shows that employment is the decisive factor in determining the severity of a downturn, because a spike in joblessness raises the number of forced sellers.\n\n“History shows that if labor markets can remain strong, then the chances of a more benign correction are higher,” according to Innes McFee, chief global economist at Oxford Economics.\n\nEmployment levels in many advanced economies have recovered since falling at the start of the pandemic. But there are early signs that labor markets are starting to cool as weak economic growth hits demand for workers.\n\nA decisive increase in unemployment is a very big danger for housing markets.” Adam Slater, Oxford Economics\n\nAfter recovering strongly at the beginning of the year, the number of hours worked was 1.5% below pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter, amounting to a deficit of 40 million full-time jobs, according to estimates by the International Labour Organization.\n\n“The outlook for global labour markets has worsened in recent months and on current trends job vacancies will decline and global employment growth will deteriorate significantly in the final quarter of 2022,” the ILO said in an October report.\n\nThe unemployment rate in the United States ticked upwards in October to 3.7%. In the United Kingdom, job vacancies have fallen to the lowest level in a year. The UK Office for Budget Responsibility expects unemployment to rise by 505,000 to a peak of 1.7 million — an unemployment rate of 4.9% -— in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n“A decisive increase in unemployment is a very big danger for housing markets,” said Slater of Oxford Economics.\n\nA pedestrian passes unfinished apartment buildings at the West Bund Park residential project in Shanghai, China, on Jan. 14, 2022. Qilai Shen/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nA drag on the economy\n\nMost market watchers are not expecting a repeat of the 2008 housing market crash. Banks and households are in better financial shape, and housing supply in some countries remains tight.\n\nBut even a modest a fall in house prices will knock confidence, causing homeowners to cut back on spending.\n\nA slowdown in activity will also deal a blow to many other parts of the economy because of the housing market’s links to builders, lawyers, banks, moving companies and furniture stores, to name a few.\n\nChina’s property market accounts for about 28-30% of GDP because of these linkages. In the United States, housing’s broader contribution to GDP generally averages 15-18%, according to the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nIn a worst-case scenario — one in which house prices fall more sharply than anticipated and price declines are met with a slump in residential investment and tighter lending by banks — Oxford Economics forecasts that world GDP will expand by just 0.3% in 2023, rather than the 1.5% it currently expects.\n\n“An additional negative factor, compared to the [global financial crisis], is that the Chinese housing market is also in a downturn,” according to Slater. “So rather than offsetting the impact on world output of a global housing downturn, as was the case after the GFC, the Chinese housing sector is contributing to the slump.”\n\n— Laura He contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Hanna Ziady"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/18/economy/air-travel-summer-junteenth/index.html", "title": "The most popular air travel day this year was a a mess and things ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAmericans gained a new federal holiday last year: Juneteenth. This year the holiday, which commemorates of the end of slavery in the United States, falls on Sunday but it will be observed in many places on Monday, June 20.\n\nGiven that this long summer weekend also coincides with Father’s Day, that means there will be a lot of travel going on.\n\nThe Friday before Juneteenth clocked in as the most popular air travel day of 2022, according to statistics from the Transportation Security Administration. Airports haven’t been that crowded since Thanksgiving 2021.\n\nTSA officers said they screened about 2,438,784 people at airport security checkpoints nationwide on Friday, the highest checkpoint volume since November 28, the Sunday after Thanksgiving. That also was about 100,000 more travelers than the Friday before Memorial Day weekend.\n\n“Welcome to the Juneteenth Holiday Weekend of travel!” wrote TSA spokesperson Lisa Farbstein on Twitter.\n\nWhile Juneteenth became an official holiday last year, this is the first year that the US stock market and banks will close in its honor.\n\nThe surge in numbers couldn’t have come at a worse time for US airlines. A combination of rough weather, staff shortages and infrastructure challenges have left major carriers struggling to keep up with the surge in travel. Nearly 9,000 flights were delayed within the US Friday and another 1,500 flights were canceled according to the data group FlightAware.\n\nIn all, more than 3,200 flights were canceled between Friday and Sunday, per FlightAware, including more than 850 flights on Saturday and more than 900 Sunday.\n\nDelta Air Lines alone canceled at least 248 flights on Sunday. United Airlines canceled 90 flights, and American Airlines canceled 96 flights.\n\n“A variety of factors continue to impact our operations, including challenges with air traffic control, weather and unscheduled absences in some work groups,” Delta said in a statement to CNN. “Canceling a flight is always our last resort, and we sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience to their travel plans.”\n\nCNN has reached out to United and American for a comment on the flight cancellations.\n\nThe increase in delays and cancellations comes just one day after Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg met with airline CEOs to discuss ways to improve performance and operations ahead of another expected surge in travel over the 4th of July holiday.\n\n'Broken system': Expert reacts to airlines pushing to end international traveler testing 02:50 - Source: CNN\n\nAbout 2,700 flights were canceled over Memorial Day weekend. Major airlines already are preemptively canceling more flights just as the busy summer season heats up. Southwest Airlines has cut nearly 20,000 flights between June and Labor Day and is struggling to hire the 10,000 new workers it says it needs to meet demand.\n\n“I go through the Whataburger drive-thru and I pay and get my bag, and stapled to the bag is a job application,” Southwest CEO Robert Jordan joked to the Dallas Morning News last year about the difficulty in finding job applicants. “That’s what it’s come to.”\n\nDelta said it will cancel 100 daily flights in the US and Latin America from July 1 to August 7. In an open letter to customers, Delta pilots wrote that the labor shortage has put them on pace to fly more overtime hours this year than in all of 2018 and 2019 combined.\n\n“The pilot shortage for the industry is real, and most airlines are simply not going to be able to realize their capacity plans because there simply aren’t enough pilots, at least not for the next five-plus years,” United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said during the airline’s quarterly earnings call in April.\n\nUnions representing pilots at Delta, American and Southwest say that airlines got themselves into the current situation by refusing to replace pilots who retired and took leaves of absence during the height of the pandemic when air travel plummeted.\n\nAbout 8,000 new commercial pilots have received certificates in the last year, according to pilot unions, and they say there shouldn’t be a shortage. The current service cut narrative, they claim, is being used by companies to justify a cut to training and safety requirements that will boost profit margins.\n\nSome US senators are taking note. “While some flight cancellations are unavoidable, the sheer number of delays and cancellations this past weekend raises questions about airline decision-making,” wrote Senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey in a letter to Buttigieg earlier this month.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/06/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/football/qatar-2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-human-rights-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Migrant workers helped build Qatar's World Cup tournament, now ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nKamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers, having finished yet another grueling working day, when he and – he says – a few others were arrested this August. Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs.

This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis Pramod Acharya Sugam Pokharel", "Aimee Lewis", "Pramod Acharya", "Sugam Pokharel"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/21/uk/uk-strikes-explainer-ambulance-nurses-railways-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "UK strikes: Paramedics and nurses have joined Britain's wave of ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nAnother day, another round of strikes in Britain.\n\nAs the Christmas holidays approach, railway workers have brought the transport network to a standstill. Border Force staff are preparing to walk out. Postal workers, bus drivers and civil servants are either in the middle of strike action or threatening to strike.\n\nThis week, nurses staged their biggest walkout in decades. And on Wednesday, paramedics are on strike in many parts of England, in a particularly bitter dispute that will bring further turmoil to an already ravaged public health system.\n\nThe public have been urged to only call ambulances if they absolutely need to. ‘Don’t get so drunk that you end up with an unnecessary visit to A&E,” Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, told the BBC.\n\nBut Wednesday’s strike heaps further pressure on the government, which has been accused of disregarding the calls of workers. Health Secretary Steve Barclay told the Daily Telegraph that ambulance workers have “taken a conscious choice to inflict harm on patients,” comments that drew the ire of workers and unions.\n\nA collection of individual disputes across various sectors have coalesced into a broader sense that something has gone very wrong in Britain, with workers saying that their pay, conditions and ability to provide essential services have been compromised by years of cuts and underinvestment.\n\nHow have things got to such a nadir?\n\nWho is on strike?\n\nThursday’s strike by ambulance workers, who are demanding a pay rise in line with inflation, comes after thousands of nurses walked out on 15 and 20 December.\n\nIt is not just health and emergency services that are affected; virtually all forms of travel have been affected in some ways by strike or are expected to be in coming weeks – along with education, the criminal justice system, the postal service and a host of other fields.\n\nRailway strikes have been raging for several months and frequently dominate front pages in the UK. The RMT union, which mostly represents guards, ticket examiners and maintenance staff, has called a series of walkouts, including over the Christmas period. ASLEF, which represents train drivers, has also planned action in January. Railway workers want better pay and increased job security.\n\nPostal workers with Royal Mail, which is now a private company, are taking action in the run-up to Christmas, affecting deliveries during the busy festive stretch.\n\nBorder Force workers in the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) are striking for eight days during the holiday period. The strikes will impact London Heathrow airport, as well as hubs at London Gatwick, Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff and Glasgow. Baggage handlers have also walked out on some dates.\n\nBus drivers in London planned a series of strikes throughout December.\n\nSeveral teachers’ unions are consulting their members about striking, after pay offers were rejected. There is already a national teachers’ strike set for Scotland next month.\n\nCriminal barristers went on strike earlier in the winter, before voting to accept a pay offer and end the action.\n\nWhy are strikes sweeping Britain?\n\nEach workforce has complaints specific to their sectors that have brought them to the picket line. But the wave of strikes must also be viewed in light of the UK’s long-running economic and societal stagnation, which has left workers desperate for a better deal.\n\nA cost of living crisis and soaring inflation have left Britons worse off this year. When adjusted for inflation, wages in the UK have fallen at one of the sharpest rates since records began in 2001, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nAnd Britain’s public sector workers in particular are bearing the brunt; average pay growth in the private sector was 6.9% in the middle of 2022, compared to 2.7% for the public sector – the ONS said this gulf is “among the largest differences between the private sector and public sector growth rates we have seen.”\n\nStill, for many striking workers, anger can be traced back further than the current economic crises.\n\nSince former Prime Minister David Cameron’s austerity program saw budgets for public services slashed, employees have complained of a decline in many of Britain’s local agencies and institutional safety nets.\n\nFunding for local councils and schools slumped over the course of the 2010s, a decade of decline that critics say has held Britain back, leaving a gaping wound in the services parents, children and citizens rely on every day.\n\nThe aftershocks of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic further tightened the purse-strings and complicated a cautious effort to emerge from the tight-fisted approach that defined the 2010s.\n\nMore recently, instability at the heart of government – Britain is on its fifth Prime Minister in six years – and a disastrous financial program unveiled by shambolic ex-PM Liz Truss have dashed many Brits’ hopes that the public sector will get a boost in the near future.\n\nBritish railways have been severely disrupted by strikes for months. CARLOS JASSO/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHow desperate is Britain’s NHS?\n\nStrikes in the National Health Service – a pillar of Britain’s national identity and one of the world’s most lauded governmental programs – are rare.\n\nUntil this month, the UK’s largest nursing union had never called a walkout in its 106-year history. Wednesday’s ambulance strike is the first such action since 1990.\n\nThere are some concerns about the level of service that will continue during the strike. Members of the armed forces are being deployed in an effort to relieve the impact, and health minister Will Quince suggested on BBC Radio that people should avoid contact sport or other “risky activity” while ambulance services are disrupted, comments that were roundly criticized as flippant.\n\nBut workers in the NHS have been pushed to the brink in recent years, with a staffing crisis, low pay and skyrocketing waiting lists leaving hospitals and wards crammed full and staff exhausted.\n\nBrits must now wait an average of one hour for an ambulance if they’ve reported a suspected heart attack, stroke or other similar issues, despite an 18-minute national target. The wait for a “Category 1” call, which relates to immediate threats to life, is up to 10 minutes, despite a seven-minute target.\n\nConditions do not always improve while a patient arrives in hospital, where waiting times are at record levels. Every day, across the country, ambulances can be seen lined up outside emergency departments, waiting to discharge their patients.\n\nIn the West Midlands area of England, one person died after an ambulance delay in the whole of 2020. In the first nine months of 2022, that figure had soared to 37, according to the BBC’s Newsnight program, which obtained the figures through a Freedom of Information request.\n\n“The reality is, every day, nurses across the UK are walking into understaffed hospitals,” Andrea Mackay, who has worked as a nurse for seven years at a hospital in southwest England, told CNN on her reasons for striking last week.\n\n“During one of my worst shifts I was the only nurse to 28 unwell children,” added Jessie Collins, a pediatric nurse. “It’s not safe and we cannot deliver the care that these children need at times.”\n\nHas this happened before?\n\nThis wave of strikes is the biggest to hit Britain in a decade, and the sheer number of services being affected has drawn comparisons to the so-called winter of discontent of 1978 to 1979.\n\nThat period followed bitter pay disputes between the government and both the public and private sector; following her 1979 election victory, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher waged a largely victorious battle with many of Britain’s unions, severely diminishing their power.\n\nIn reality, the strikes of 2022 have caused a fraction of the impact that those did.\n\nA total of 417,000 working days were lost to strikes in October, the most recent month for which figures are available, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) – a far cry from the several million days lost at the end of the 1970s.\n\nBut October’s figure is the highest number for any month since 2011, and virtually all pay disputes seem far from resolved, stoking fears that next year will be one of mass disruption.\n\nWhat do the strikes mean for the government?\n\nThe government of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says it cannot afford the pay demands being made by the public sector unions. In the case of railway strikes, it has said the onus is on private train companies to resolve the disputes – despite the fact that the government controls the purse-strings, having bailed out the network during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut the ongoing disruption is a major headache for Sunak, who took over from Truss with the promise of a sensible and restrained approach to Britain’s stuttering economy.\n\nOpinion polls show the government is shouldering much of the blame for the spate of labor unrest, and that the public is generally sympathetic towards striking workers.\n\nMinisters have repeatedly taken a firm line, refusing to bow to the demands of any one union – opening itself up to criticism that it is not making enough effort bring an end to the strife.\n\nRishi Sunak has resisted unions' demands, but has been accused of not doing enough to end the strikes. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nOpposition Labour leader Keir Starmer attacked Sunak on the nursing strike in Parliament last week, telling him that “the whole country would breathe a sigh of relief” if he halted the strike by striking a deal with the RCN.\n\nThe industrial action was a “a badge of shame for this government,” Starmer said.\n\nHis party, which has historical links to several unions, is walking a delicate line on the strikes; Starmer has refused to explicitly support unions’ demands, but has pointed to their walkouts as evidence that the Conservatives have stalled the economy.\n\nThose arguments will be tested even further over the Christmas period and in the New Year, and public opinion will be vital in strengthening the government’s hand or forcing them to the negotiating table.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/04/tech/elizabeth-holmes-rise-and-fall/index.html", "title": "The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes: A timeline | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nFour years after the top two Theranos executives, Elizabeth Holmes and Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, were first indicted together on a dozen federal fraud charges stemming from their time heading up the failed blood testing startup, both have been convicted by juries.\n\nTheir trials marked the final chapter for Theranos, a startup once valued at $9 billion and lauded for its promise to upend the healthcare industry. Theranos claimed its technology could accurately and efficiently test for conditions like cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood. With that promise, it attracted $945 million in financing, a board of well-known political figures and prominent retail partners.\n\nA Stanford University dropout, Holmes – inspired by her own fear of needles – started the company at the age of 19, with a mission of creating a cheaper, more efficient alternative to a traditional blood test. Theranos promised patients the ability to test for conditions like cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood. She attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, a board of well-known political figures, and key retail partners.\n\nThen came a Wall Street Journal investigation into the company, which called into question the company’s testing methods and the capabilities of its technology. In 2018, Holmes and Balwani were each charged with a dozen counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Both pleaded not guilty.\n\nHere are the highlights of the rise and fall of Theranos.\n\nMarch 2004: Holmes drops out of Stanford to pursue Theranos\n\nHolmes, a Stanford University sophomore studying chemical engineering, drops out of school to pursue her startup, Theranos, which she founded in 2003 at age 19. The name is a combination of the words “therapy” and “diagnosis.”\n\nSeptember 2009: Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani joins Theranos\n\nBalwani guarantees a $10 million loan to Theranos and soon after takes on a formal role at the startup. Balwani, roughly 20 years older than Holmes, first met her in 2002 through a program in Beijing to learn Mandarin. Balwani had enjoyed a successful career in the software industry, and following the sale of his e-commerce startup, was pursuing an MBA.\n\nSeptember 2013: Holmes opens up about Theranos; announces Walgreens partnership\n\nA decade after first starting the company, Holmes takes the lid off Theranos and courts media attention the same month that Theranos and Walgreens announce they’ve struck up a long-term partnership. The first Theranos Wellness Center location opens in a Walgreens in Palo Alto where consumers can access Theranos’ blood test.\n\nThe original plan had been to make Theranos’ testing available at Walgreens locations nationwide.\n\nSeptember 2014: Holmes named one of the richest women in America by Forbes\n\nHolmes is named to the magazine’s American billionaire list with the outlet reporting she owns a 50% stake in the startup, pinning her personal wealth at $4.5 billion.\n\nElizabeth Holmes speaking onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt on September 8, 2014 in San Francisco, California. Steve Jennings/Getty Images\n\nDecember 2014: Theranos has raised $400 million\n\nTheranos has raised more than $400 million, according to a profile of the company and Holmes by The New Yorker. It counts Oracle’s Larry Ellison among its investors.\n\nJuly 2015: Theranos gets FDA approval for Herpes test\n\nThe FDA clears Theranos to use of its proprietary tiny blood-collection vials to finger stick blood test for herpes simplex 1 virus – its first and only approval for a diagnostic test.\n\nOctober 2015: Theranos is the subject of a Wall Street Journal investigation; Holmes hits back\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports Theranos is using its proprietary technique on only a small number of the 240 tests it performs, and that the vast majority of its tests are done with traditional vials of blood drawn from the arm, not the “few drops” taken by a finger prick. In response, Theranos defends its testing practices, calling the Journal’s reporting “factually and scientifically erroneous.”\n\nA day later, Theranos halts the use of its blood-collection vials for all but the herpes test due to pressures from the FDA. (Later that month, the FDA released two heavily redacted reports citing 14 concerns, including calling the company’s proprietary vial an “uncleared medical device.”)\n\nOne week after the Journal report, Holmes is interviewed on-stage at the outlet’s conference in Laguna Beach. “We know what we’re doing and we’re very proud of it,” she says.\n\nHolmes speaking at a Wall Street Journal technology conference in Laguna Beach, California on October 21, 2015. Glenn Chapman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAmid the criticism, Theranos reportedly shakes up its board of directors, eliminating Henry Kissinger and George Shultz as directors while moving them to a new board of counselors; the company also forms a separate medical board.\n\nNovember 2015: Theranos and Safeway partnership falls short\n\nSafeway, which invested $350 million into building out clinics in hundreds of its supermarkets to eventually offer Theranos blood tests, reportedly looks to dissolve its relationship with the company before it ever offered its services.\n\nJanuary 2016: Federal regulators take issue with Theranos’ California lab; Walgreens pulls back\n\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sends Theranos a letter saying its California lab has failed to comply with federal standards and that patients are in “immediate jeopardy.” It gives the company 10 days to address the issues.\n\nIn response, Walgreens says it will not send any lab tests to Theranos’ California lab for analysis and suspends Theranos services at its Palo Alto Walgreens location.\n\nMarch 2016: CMS threatens to ban Holmes, Balwani from lab business\n\nCMS threatens to ban Holmes and Balwani from the laboratory business for two years after the company allegedly failed to fix problems at its California lab. Theranos says that’s a “worst case scenario.”\n\nMay 2016: Balwani steps down; Theranos voids two years of blood tests\n\nBalwani departs. The company also adds three new board members as part of the restructuring: Fabrizio Bonanni, a former executive vice president of biotech firm Amgen, former CDC director William Foege, and former Wells Fargo CEO Richard Kovacevich.\n\nTheranos voids two years of blood test results from its proprietary testing devices, correcting tens of thousands of blood-test reports, the Journal reports.\n\nJune 2016: Holmes net worth revised to $0; Theranos loses its largest retail partner\n\nForbes revises its estimate of Holmes’ net worth from $4.5 billion to $0. The magazine also lowers its valuation for the company from $9 billion to $800 million.\n\nWalgreens, once Theranos’ largest retail partner, ends its partnership with the company and says it will close all 40 Theranos Wellness Centers.\n\nJuly 2016: Holmes is banned from running labs for two years\n\nCMS revokes Theranos’ license to operate its California lab and bans Holmes from running a blood-testing lab for two years.\n\nAugust 2016: The company unveils ‘miniLab’ device\n\nHolmes tries to move past recent setbacks by unveiling a mini testing laboratory, called miniLab, at a conference for the American Association for Clinical Chemistry. In selling the device, versus operating its own clinics, Theranos seeks to effectively side-step CMS sanctions, which don’t prohibit research and development.\n\nOctober 2016: Theranos investor sues the company; Theranos downsizes\n\nTheranos investor Partner Fund Management sues the company for $96.1 million, the amount it sunk into the company in February 2014, plus damages. It accuses the company of securities fraud.

The UK economy will feel ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nFor years, home ownership in Britain has been a one-way bet. Prices have climbed steadily since the global financial crisis, rising in even larger increments after the pandemic began.\n\nFueled by a post-lockdown buying frenzy, the average UK house price hit a record £275,000 ($315,474) in December, a £27,000 increase on the previous year’s high. People buying houses for the first time benefited from cuts to taxes on their purchases and even though homes were more expensive, rock-bottom mortgage rates kept monthly payments affordable.\n\nPrices have risen every year since 2012, when they dropped by 1.1%, according to data from Nationwide, a major mortgage lender. Now, that boom is over.\n\nIt was already fading well before Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng blew up the UK bond market and sent borrowing costs through the roof. But the financial market turmoil sparked by the former prime minister and her then finance minister’s plans for unfunded tax cuts made matters much worse.\n\nThe sharp and sudden increase in mortgage rates that followed has made it much more expensive to buy a house, leading some forecasters to predict a 10%-15% plunge in prices over the next year or so.\n\nThe UK's former finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng and former Prime Minister Liz Truss at the Conservative Party conference on October 02, 2022 in Birmingham, England. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nEven though most of Truss’ tax cuts have been ditched by new finance minister Jeremy Hunt and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, calming bond markets, the era of cheap debt that helped drive house prices ever higher is coming to an an end.\n\nOn Thursday, the Bank of England increased its key interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point — it’s biggest hike in 33 years — taking it to 3% from near zero at the end of last year. That’s the highest level since November 2008.\n\nThat will keep mortgage rates elevated, even if not at their current inflated levels.\n\n“I think all that can happen in the short term is that we go back to where we were at the end of August,” said Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at broker Knight Frank. “There’s a bigger, wider psychological shift that has to take place after 13 years of ultra-low borrowing costs and the housing market readjusting to mortgage rates that are not below 1% or 2%.”\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nUK mortgage rates have been ticking upwards since spring, in line with rising interest rates. But Truss and Kwarteng’s “mini” budget of Sept. 23 kicked those increases into overdrive.\n\n“The mini budget added a whole percentage point onto mortgage rates,” said Richard Donnell, executive director of research at online property portal Zoopla.\n\nThe promise of sweeping tax cuts but no plan to pay for them caused a bond market rout that pushed up borrowing costs for lenders. “The biggest immediate impact was the accelerated pace of change in mortgage rates,” said David Hollingworth, associate director of communications at broker L&C Mortgages.\n\nWithin days, lenders pulled over 1,500 products and more than half have still not returned to the market, according to financial product comparison website Moneyfacts.\n\nEven though Kwarteng and Truss are out, along with most of their tax cuts, mortgage rates have still not fallen back to where they were before the pair unveiled their doomed economic plan.\n\nThe “mini” budget added a whole percentage point onto mortgage rates.” Richard Donnell, executive director of research at Zoopla\n\nAverage two-year and five-year fixed rates stood at 6.47% and 6.32% on Tuesday, levels not seen since 2008. That compares with around 4.75% before the “mini” budget, according to Moneyfacts.\n\nFor a typical borrower, with a mortgage worth 70% of the price of their home, that would increase monthly repayments by £500 ($574), according to Donnell.\n\nThe dramatic rates reset has seen some homeowners spend thousands of pounds to refinance early for fear that rates could climb higher still.\n\nKaram Heer, a tax adviser based in London, decided to refinance his two-year fixed mortgage a year earlier than planned, taking his rate from 1.75% to 3.57%. That will cost him an extra £375 ($424) a month until January 2028.\n\n“We haven’t had a choice really,” he said. Even though it cost him £4,500 ($5,162) to switch deals early, Heer wanted the certainty of a fixed rate because, as he told CNN Business, “I have absolutely no clue what’s going to happen with interest rates.”\n\nTudor Nanu and his wife, who bought a house in February, are considering doing the same. The health care workers in southeast England are preparing to take a £6,000 charge ($6,883) to refinance early at a rate almost double what they had been paying. The higher rate would cost them an extra £500 ($574) a month, on top of the one-off refinancing hit.\n\nHomes are pictured in south London, on October 3, 2022. Niklas Halle'n/AFP/Getty Images\n\nGovernment bond yields fell back in October and swap rates — a gauge of bank funding costs that are used to price mortgage rates -— are also falling. That means mortgage rates are likely to come down in the next few weeks.\n\nStill, there’s no returning to the “ultra-low levels of recent years,” said Donnell, who thinks mortgage rates of 4% to 5% will become the new norm.\n\nThat will come as a shock to millions of homeowners who bought houses when rates were much lower. According to Bill at Knight Frank, more than 4 million mortgages have been issued to first-time buyers since 2009 when rates “hit the floor.”\n\n“So there’s a lot of people out there who don’t appreciate what it’s like when their monthly outgoings rise,” he told CNN Business.\n\nAs many as 1.8 million borrowers on fixed-rate mortgages will have to refinance next year, according to the Resolution Foundation, a think tank. Neal Hudson, a housing market analyst at research firm BuiltPlace, estimates that about 300,000 fixed-rate deals will come to an end between October and December.\n\n“As more buyers come up against the reality of monthly mortgage bills rising by hundreds of pounds, the financial pain will spread through the housing market,” Bill added.\n\nHouse price falls ‘inevitable’\n\nSigns of a slowdown are already starting to emerge, as banks take a more cautious approach to lending and aspirant home buyers delay purchases in the face of much higher borrowing costs.\n\nUK house prices fell 0.9% between September and October, the first decline in 15 months, according to data from Nationwide. The average house now costs £268,282 ($309,396).\n\nMortgage approvals also declined to 66,800 in September, from 74,400 in August, data published Monday by the Bank of England showed.\n\nZoopla’s Donnell said demand from new buyers has fallen 30% since the Truss budget. “Straight after the mini budget there was a scrabble to do deals, now sales are still happening but at a 20% lower run rate than they would be normally,” he said.\n\nA member of the public looks at residential properties displayed for sale in the window of an estate agents' in London on September 30, 2022. Isabel Infantes/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAlan Edwards, a local government worker from the north of England, was about to start house hunting, hoping to buy early next year, until the mini budget caused mortgage rates to spike.\n\n“I can’t see that happening now,” he told CNN Business. Edwards expected rates to rise over the next few months, but not “this fast this quickly,” he said. “We’ve really got to pay attention to the government now because they can drive our costs up by having a bad week of their own making.”\n\nThose who do buy won’t be able to borrow as much, which will knock prices. Take, for example, someone who a year ago could afford to put £1,500 ($1,700) a month towards a 25-year mortgage. At an interest rate of 1.75%, the low reached in September 2021, that person could have borrowed £378,000 ($433,000). Today, at an interest rate of 5.5%, the monthly payment is enough only for a £244,500 ($280,000) mortgage.\n\nA drop in buying power makes a significant drop in house prices inevitable, according to Andrew Wishart, a senior economist at Capital Economics. The consultancy expects prices to fall between 10% and 15% between now and 2024. Credit Suisse has made a similar projection.\n\nThat’s a wider problem for the UK economy, given that 36% of household wealth is tied up in property, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. When house prices fall, homeowners feel less confident about their personal finances, causing them to cut back on spending and hold off on making additional investments.\n\nHomeowners may already be shoring up their finances, saving more in anticipation of higher mortgage payments. Households deposited an additional £8.1 billion ($9.3 billion) with banks and building societies last month, compared with £3.2 billion ($3.7 billion) in August, the biggest increase since June 2021, according to Bank of England data.\n\nEven if house price declines simply take prices back to where they were before the pandemic-induced buying spree, it will still hit the UK economy hard, because many sectors of the economy, from financial services and construction to moving companies and furniture stores, rely on a strong and active housing market.\n\nAnalysis by Knight Frank and the British Property Federation in 2020 found that for every 100,000 housing transactions involving existing homes, the UK economy benefited to the tune of almost £1 billion ($1.14 billion).\n\n“Higher debt payments, falling property prices and a slump in construction will play a major role in dragging the economy into recession,” Wishart said.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban Hanna Ziady", "Anna Cooban", "Hanna Ziady"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/china/china-zero-covid-relaxation-crisis-intl-hnk-mic/index.html", "title": "Health experts warn of dark days ahead as China moves away from ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nChina’s zero-Covid policy, which stalled the world’s second-largest economy and sparked a wave of unprecedented protests, is now being dismantled as Beijing on Wednesday released sweeping revisions to its draconian measures that ultimately failed to bring the virus to heel.\n\nThe new guidelines keep some restrictions in place but largely scrap the health QR code that has been mandatory for entering most public places and roll back mass testing. They also allow some Covid-19 cases and close contacts to skip centralized quarantine.\n\nThey come after a number of cities in recent days started to lift some of the harsh controls that dictated – and heavily restricted – daily life for nearly three years in China.\n\nBut while the changes mark a significant shift – and bring relief for many in the public who’ve grown increasingly frustrated with the high costs and demands of zero-Covid – another reality is also clear: China is underprepared for the surge in cases it could now see.\n\nExperts say though much is still unknown about how the next weeks and months will progress, China has fallen short on preparations like bolstering the elderly vaccination rate, upping surge and intensive care capacity in hospitals, and stockpiling antiviral medications.\n\nWhile the Omicron variant is milder than previous strains and China’s overall vaccination rate is high, even a small number of severe cases among vulnerable and under-vaccinated groups like the elderly could overwhelm hospitals if infections spike across the country of 1.4 billion, experts say.\n\n“This is a looming crisis – the timing is really bad … China now has to relax much of its measures during the winter (overlapping with flu season), so that was not as planned,” said Xi Chen, an associate professor at the Yale School of Public Health in the United States, pointing to what was likely an acceleration in China’s transition, triggered by public discontent.\n\nThe guidelines released Wednesday open up a new chapter in the country’s epidemic control, three years after cases of Covid-19 were first detected in central China’s Wuhan and following protests against the zero-Covid policy across the country late last month.\n\nWhere China once controlled cases by requiring testing and clear health codes for entry into most public places and for domestic travel, those codes will no longer be checked except for in a handful of locations like medical institutions and schools. Mass testing will now be rolled back for everyone except for those in high-risk areas and high-risk positions. People who test positive for Covid-19 but have mild or asymptomatic cases and meet certain conditions can quarantine at home, instead of being forced to go to centralized quarantine centers, as can close contacts.\n\nLocations classified by authorities as “high risk” can still be locked down, but these lockdowns must now be more limited and precise, according to the new guidelines, which were circulated by China’s state media.\n\nThe changes mark a swift about-face, following mounting public discontent, economic costs and record case numbers in recent weeks. They come after a top official last week first signaled the country could move away from the zero-Covid policy it had long poured significant resources into – though another official on Wednesday said the measures were a “proactive optimization,” not “reactive,” when asked in a press briefing.\n\n“China has pursued this policy for so long, they’re now between a rock and a hard place,” said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the US. “They don’t have good options in either direction anymore. They had really hoped that this epidemic globally would run its course, and they could survive without impact. And that hasn’t happened.”\n\nAs restrictions are relaxed, and the virus spreads across the country, China is “going to have to go through a period of pain in terms of illness, serious illness, deaths and stress on the health care system” as was seen elsewhere in the world earlier in the pandemic, he added.\n\nA QR code for Covid-19 contact tracing displayed at the entrance to a subway station in Shanghai, China, on Monday. Qilai Shen/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nSurge potential\n\nSince the global vaccination campaign and the emergence of the Omicron variant, health experts have questioned China’s adherence to zero-Covid and pointed out the unsustainability of the strategy, which tried to use mass testing and surveillance, lockdowns and quarantines to stop a highly contagious virus.\n\nBut as some restrictions are lifted, in what appears to be a haphazard transition following years of focus on meticulously controlling the virus, experts say change may be coming before China has made the preparations its health officials have admitted are needed.\n\n“An uncontrolled epidemic (one which only peaks when the virus starts running out of people to infect) … will pose serious challenges to the health care system, not only in terms of managing the small fraction of Covid cases that are severe, but also in the ‘collateral damage’ to people with other health conditions who have delayed care as a consequence,” said Ben Cowling, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nBut even with easing restrictions, Cowling said, it was “difficult to predict” how quickly infections will spread though China, because there are still some measures in place and some people will change their behavior – such as staying at home more often.\n\n“And I wouldn’t rule out the possibility that stricter measures are reintroduced to combat rising cases,” he said.\n\nExperts agree that allowing the virus to spread nationally would be a significant shift for a country that up until this point has officially reported 5,235 Covid-19 deaths since early 2020 – a comparatively low figure globally that has been a point of pride in China, where state media until recently trumpeted the dangers of the virus to the public.\n\nModeling from researchers at Shanghai’s Fudan University published in the journal Nature Medicine in May projected that more than 1.5 million Chinese could die within six months if Covid-19 restrictions were lifted and there was no access to antiviral drugs, which have been approved in China.\n\nHowever, death rates could fall to around the levels of seasonal flu, if almost all elderly people were vaccinated and antiviral medications were broadly used, the authors said.\n\nLast month, China released a list of measures to bolster health systems against Covid-19, which included directives to increase vaccination in the elderly, stockpile antiviral treatments and medical equipment, and expand critical care capacity – efforts that experts say take time and are best accomplished prior to an outbreak.\n\n“(Is China prepared?) If you look at surge capacity three years on and the stockpiling of effective antivirals – no. If you talk about the triage procedures – they are not strictly enforced – and if you talk about the vaccination rate for the elderly, especially those aged 80 and older, it is also overall no,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.\n\nChinese authorities, he added, would likely be closely assessing outcomes like the death rate to decide policy steps going forward.\n\nCitizens wearing masks board a subway train on Monday in Henan province's Zhengzhou. Negative Covid-19 test results are no longer required for riding public transport. VCG/Getty Images\n\nThe gaps\n\nThe US has at least 25 critical care beds per 100,000 people, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development – by contrast, China has fewer than four for the same number, health authorities there said last month.\n\nThe system also provides limited primary care, which could drive even moderately sick people to hospitals as opposed to calling a family doctor – putting more strain on hospitals, according to Yale’s Chen.\n\nMeanwhile, weak medical infrastructure in rural areas could foster crises there, especially as testing is reduced and younger people living in cities return to rural hometowns to visit elderly family members over the Lunar New Year next month, he said.\n\nWhile China’s overall vaccination rate is high, its elderly are also less protected than in some other parts of the world, where the oldest and most vulnerable to dying from Covid-19 were prioritized for vaccination. Some countries have already rolled out fourth or fifth doses for at-risk groups.\n\nBy China’s accounting, more than 86% of its population over 60 are fully vaccinated, according to China’s National Health Commission, and booster rates are lower, with more than 45 million of the fully vaccinated elderly yet to receive an additional shot. Around 25 million elderly have not received any shot, according to a comparison of official population figures and December 1 vaccination data.\n\nFor the most at-risk over 80 age group, around two-thirds were fully vaccinated by China’s standards, but only 40% had received booster shots as of December 1, according to official data.\n\nBut while China refers to third doses for its widely used inactivated vaccines as booster shots, a World Health Organization (WHO) vaccine advisory group last year recommended that elderly people taking those vaccines receive three doses in their initial course to ensure sufficient protection.\n\nThe inactivated vaccines used in China have been found to elicit lower levels of antibody response as compared to others used overseas, and many countries using the doses have paired them with more protective mRNA vaccines, which China has not approved for use.\n\nCowling said evidence from Hong Kong’s outbreak, however, showed China’s inactivated vaccine used in the city worked well to prevent severe disease, but it was critical that the elderly receive three doses in the initial course, as recommended by the WHO. They should then use a fourth dose on top of that to keep immunity high, he added.\n\nTop health officials on November 28 announced a new plan to bolster elderly vaccination rates, but such measures will take time, as will other preparations for a surge.\n\nMinimizing the worst outcomes in a transition out of zero-Covid depends on that preparation, according to Cowling. From that perspective, he said, “it doesn’t look like it would be a good time to relax the policies.”", "authors": ["Simone Mccarthy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/economy/uk-gdp-economy-g7/index.html", "title": "Boris Johnson's go-to boast on UK GDP obscures the painful truth ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is fond of saying the United Kingdom has the fastest growing economy in the G7.\n\nThe prime minister can back up his claim with data published by Britain’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Friday, which showed the United Kingdom had the fastest growing economy of the Group of Seven nations over last year as a whole.\n\nUK gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic activity — grew by 7.5% as activity bounced back with the lifting of coronavirus restrictions.\n\nBut those figures don’t tell the whole story. The growth numbers are pumped up because the United Kingdom endured the deepest recession of any major developed economy in 2020 and its worst performance since 1921, providing a lower base for subsequent comparison.\n\nJohnson’s boast also doesn’t reflect what happened in the final three months of last year. UK GDP expanded 1% in the fourth quarter, according to ONS data published Friday. That trailed the United States (1.7%) and Canada (1.6%), which are both in the G7.\n\nEven those statistics obscure a larger truth: the United Kingdom is hurtling toward its worst cost of living crisis in 30 years, the Bank of England expects unemployment to rise next year and growth to be “subdued,” taxes are going up and new post-Brexit import controls could slam foreign trade.\n\nShort-term economic indicators have also been exceptionally volatile, reflecting the stop-start nature of business as coronavirus restrictions have come and gone. A better way to measure performance is to compare current economic output with levels before the pandemic arrived. Here, the United Kingdom is languishing near the middle of the G7 ranking.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the UK economy was still 0.4% smaller than it was before the pandemic struck, according to the ONS. By the same measure, the US economy has expanded 3.1%, while France and Canada have grown by 0.9% and 0.2%, respectively.\n\nThe German and Italian economies have not yet achieved their pre-pandemic size, and comparable data for Japan is not yet available.\n\nJohnson may be able to repeat his G7 claim without being slapped down by fact checkers. But it’s less likely to land well with the British people, whose average disposable incomes after tax are forecast to decline by 2% this year.\n\nUK inflation hit 5.4% in December, its highest rate since 1992, according to official statistics released last month. Wages advanced at an annual rate of just 3.8% in December, leaving households with less purchasing power.\n\nA volunteer collects donated items from shelving racks at a food bank in Colchester, England, on January 20. Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBrits are already feeling rising costs. Some 85% of people have noticed an increase in the costs of groceries, according to a January survey conducted by YouGov. Roughly 35% say their housing costs, including rent and mortgages, have risen. Nearly 75% have noticed higher fuel prices.\n\nThe cost of living crisis is about to get much worse.\n\nThe Bank of the England expects inflation to surge higher over the coming months and peak at 7.25% in April. In early February, the central bank hiked interest rates for a second time in three months in an effort to rein in rising prices, increasing pressure on homeowners with variable rate mortgages. More interest rate hikes are expected later this year.\n\n“We are facing a squeeze on real incomes this year,” central bank boss Andrew Bailey told reporters last week. “It is necessary for us to … raise interest rates because if we don’t do that, we think that the effects will be worse.”\n\nEnergy bills will go even higher in April, when regulators increase a cap on how much consumers can be charged to heat and light their homes by 54%.\n\nThe change means that the typical consumer will see their energy bills increase by £693 ($939) to £1,971 ($2,670) per year. Some of that will be offset by a cut in local taxes, and a discount that will have to be repaid over 5 years.\n\nThe Joseph Rowntree Foundation said some families on low incomes would face annual bills as high as £2,326 ($3,152) from April, while the Resolution Foundation warned that the number of households in “fuel stress” — those spending more than 10% of the family budget on energy — would double to 5 million.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson leaves 10 Downing Street on February 9. Matt Dunham/AP\n\nOther government policies are adding to the burden on households.\n\nJohnson is pushing ahead with plans to hike the National Insurance payroll tax in April in order to fund health and social care. The hike should help the elderly, but the tax is regressive, meaning higher earners pay a lower marginal rate than the poor.\n\nAnd in early October, the government cut Universal Credit — a benefit claimed by those out-of-work or earning low incomes — back to its pre-pandemic level. More than 5.8 million people lost £20 ($28) a week, although the government later boosted the income of some people who work and receive the benefit.\n\nOne more big economic risk looms. The government has yet to implement fully the border checks that are needed as a result of Brexit, and there is considerable doubt over whether preparations are on track despite three previous delays.\n\nThe UK Parliament’s influential Public Accounts Committee said this week that “there remains much to be done to introduce import controls.” The trade group Logistics UK echoed that assessment, warning that delays at the border could cause a backup of trucks that would stretch for 29 miles.\n\nTaken together, the combination of spiraling costs, taxes and risks to trade leave the prime minister with little reason to boast about the state of the UK economy.", "authors": ["Charles Riley"], "publish_date": "2022/02/11"}]}

Catch the latest episode at 9 p.m. ET/PT Sunday on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nA mysterious tiny dragon lives among the ice of the Andes Mountains in South America – and if you blink, you might just miss it.\n\nThe Patagonian ice dragon is an insect just over half an inch (1.3 centimeters) long and it lives on glaciers.\n\nThe Southern Patagonian Ice Field may serve as an impressive reserve of fresh water, but the rivers of ice are a difficult place to live. The dragón de la Patagonia, a type of stonefly, has adapted to survive in this frozen land.\n\nThe dragon is what scientists call an extremophile, or an organism that can live in extreme environments.\n\nThis stonefly is the only true insect that lives in Patagonia’s ice field, and its entire life cycle takes place on the ice. There are two known species of ice dragon, Andiperla morenensis and Andiperla willinki, but there could be more waiting to be found.\n\nThat’s the extent of what scientists know, biologist Isaí Madríz said. Everything else is the basis of hypothesis or speculation.\n\nBut there are more questions than answers about the ice dragon.\n\nTiny but mighty\n\nTime may be running out for the ice dragon. The diminutive insect is endangered because the ice sheet it calls home is rapidly melting due to global warming.\n\nMadríz is dead set on learning everything he can about the dragon, and sharing that knowledge with others, to better understand a rare creature that learned how to survive in an icy, barren landscape millions of years ago.\n\nMadríz, often called the “bug detective,” has researched Patagonia’s biodiversity for years. In addition to being the world’s expert on the primitive crane fly, he investigates poorly understood lineages of insects.\n\nThe ice dragons live their entire life cycle on glaciers. CNN Original Series\n\nDuring his regular expeditions to the ice field, Madríz began collecting observations of the ice dragon and sharing them with laboratories that study the species in Argentina and Chile.\n\n“I’m facedown on the ice, inching along looking at the insects and following them,” he said. “It’s kind of like going back to when you’re a kid, looking at insects and just figuring out what they do.”\n\nThe bug detective\n\nHis sleuthing has paid off. So far, Madríz has been able to observe behaviors of these insects that can only be witnessed in the field.\n\nHe has seen ice dragon eggs up close – a rarity since young ice dragons have proven to be elusive.\n\n“The amazing thing is, once you start looking into the eggs, it looks like a little tiny shrimp,” Madríz said. “You can see the entire organism already developed.”\n\nBy the time the female ice dragon lays the eggs, the baby insects are fully formed. Scientists don’t yet know how long they take to emerge from the eggs, but their invisible nature is now understood – it’s because young ice dragons are translucent. On the ice, they are impossible to see until they begin to grow and mature and their exoskeletons become darker.\n\nMadríz also learned by accident that ice dragons can withstand another extreme.\n\nIn order to preserve and study specimens, scientists usually briefly boil them in water, which helps to maintain shape without the tissues collapsing.\n\nMadríz dipped three ice dragons in boiling water for about 10 to 15 seconds and turned to do something else. When he returned, one of the ice dragons was crawling out of the dish.\n\n“We’re going to find out that this species is a lot more interesting than what we thought about because you don’t go from freezing to boiling water and survive, with the exception of something like a tardigrade,” he said. Microscopic tardigrades have an ability to survive and even thrive in the most extreme environments.\n\nRemaining questions\n\nMadríz hopes that many answers about the ice dragon will be revealed within the next few years. He wants to uncover how these insects opted to make glaciers their homes, rather than water, and then adapted to a unique lifestyle.\n\nMadríz and his fellow researchers are hard at work on uncovering the inner workings of the species, including how it survives in the ice field and what it eats.\n\nThere is currently speculation that the ice dragon’s blood contains glycerol, a natural antifreeze, but the amounts, and whether it keeps the insect’s blood from freezing, is unknown. Future research could tell the tale.\n\nIt’s possible that ice dragons feed on tiny algae on the ice. They may also eat other insects that live in nearby valleys and are blown over by wind, landing on the glaciers and dying. And ice dragons are known to feed on cryoconite, the fine powder on the ice made of microbes and other small particles. This windblown dust can land on glaciers and decrease their reflectivity, which can make it easier for them to melt.\n\nThe Valdivian temperate rainforest in southern Chile is home to this peculiar predator: the kodkod.

Enrique Haag Rodriguez The monito del monte, seen here at Chile's Bosque San Martín Experimental Station, is a tiny marsupial, raising its young in pouches like koalas and kangaroos. It's the only creature in South America to hibernate, and when it enters this state, it breathes once every 3 minutes. Its amazing ability to survive the winter could help scientists better understand the metabolism of humans.

Santiago Sainz-Trápaga/Kevin Zao In Patagonia, marine otters known as chungungo live along the rocky coastline. Until a few decades ago, the chungungo were seen as pests and almost hunted to extinction. Their fur was a valuable prize. However, their numbers are recovering as the local fishing community has a change of heart.

Little is known about these dolphins, but their distinctive round fins and white bellies make them easy to recognize. Mauricio Handler Pumas are protected across Patagonia's national parks, such as Torres del Paine in Chile, but in the past, ranchers have hunted the animals to protect their sheep and cattle from predators.

The insect eats tiny algae that live in the ice and even other ice dragons in hard times. Its habitat is melting away. CNN Original Series The huemul is an incredibly rare South Andean deer. An estimated fewer than 1,500 remain -- just 1% of their former population -- making them one of the rarest mammals on the planet . Conservationists in Chile's Parque Nacional Patagonia follow their movements using radio-tracking collars. Cristobal Santamaria Concha Scientist Verena Häussermann has discovered cold-water corals living in a remote fjord in Chile's Corcovado Gulf. It's one of the only places on Earth where these corals can be found in shallow waters. Unlike tropical corals that need sunlight, these depend solely on plankton for survival. The conditions in these waters are naturally acidic and may help scientists figure out how to protect marine life in other parts of the rapidly changing world. Elijah Harris Two hooded grebes perform a mating dance in Bajo Caracoles, Argentina. The birds come to breed on lakes on a volcanic plateau 5,000 feet above sea level in the Andes.

Madríz hopes that awareness for this mysterious creature can make its conservation self-sustainable. Enlisting field guides to teach tourists about the ice dragons can also help to educate travelers who explore Patagonia’s disappearing glaciers.\n\nRather than seeking selfies on the ice, visitors just may come looking for the elusive ice dragon and walk away with an understanding of an incredibly unique ecosystem, Madríz said.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/953157/is-red-alpine-snow-warning-climate-crisis", "title": "Is red snow the latest warning sign of worsening climate crisis? | The ...", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

(AP) — Gary Woodland has one week to avoid making the wrong kind of history in the Dell Match Play.\n\nIn the 16 years since the Match Play made its debut, no runner-up has ever failed to qualify for the 64-man field the following year.\n\nThe field will be determined by the world ranking after this week. Match Play starts on March 23 at Austin (Texas) Country Club.\n\nWoodland, who lost in the championship match to Rory McIlroy last year at Harding Park, is No. 69 in the world going into the Valspar Championship.\n\nIt would appear he needs to move up only three spots with Jim Furyk recovering from wrist surgery and Henrik Stenson saying he would not be playing.\n\nIt might help that Woodland won his first PGA Tour event at Innisbrook in 2011.\n\nEven so, he might not have imagined himself in this position when he left the Match Play a year ago at No. 32 in the world, and went up to a career-best No. 24 two weeks later with a tie for fourth at the Wells Fargo Championship.\n\nBut he hasn't had a top 10 since May. He opened the year with a tie for 13th in the Sony Open, and he was one shot out of the lead going into the final round at Torrey Pines until getting caught in the worst of the brutal weather and closed with an 82 to tie for 18th.\n\nOf the players from No. 62 through No. 70, the only ones not playing this week are Marcus Fraser (No. 63) and Thorbjorn Olesen (No. 65).

Perez said he knew it was bad at the Honda Classic, so he sought a specialist to get tests done.\n\nPerez is expected to be in a sling for four weeks, followed by a few months of physical therapy to strengthen the shoulder.\n\n\"I've been competing at this level for 15 seasons now and want to be out here for at least 15 more,\" Perez said. \"The timing of the injury isn't optimum, but I'm choosing to see the positive in a negative.

But the tour looks foolish when it applies a new tournament name to events that happened decades ago.\n\nIt should be noted that Dean & DeLuca opened its first store six years after Hogan played his final round.\n\nDoes it really devalue the new title sponsor by calling a tournament by its old name in a historical context?\n\nThe most recent example was Adam Scott winning at Doral.

Parents of transgender children facing investigation by state officials. Women forced to drive hours out-of-state to access abortion.\n\nThis is Texas now: While the Lone Star State has long been a bastion of Republican politics, new laws and policies have taken Texas further to the right in recent years than it has been in decades.\n\nElected officials and political observers in the state say a major factor in the transformation can be traced back to West Texas. Two billionaire oil and fracking magnates from the region, Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks, have quietly bankrolled some of Texas’ most far-right political candidates – helping reshape the state’s Republican Party in their worldview.\n\nOver the last decade, Dunn and his wife, Terri, have contributed more than $18 million to state candidates and political action committees, while Wilks and his wife, Jo Ann, have given more than $11 million, putting them among the top donors in the state.\n\nTim Dunn is seen during a National Network for Safe Communities conference in 2015. (From National Network for Safe Communities) From National Network for Safe Communities\n\nThe beneficiaries of the energy tycoons’ combined spending include the farthest-right members of the legislature and authors of the most high-profile conservative bills passed in recent years, according to a CNN analysis of Texas Ethics Commission data. Dunn and Wilks also hold sway over the state’s legislative agenda through a network of non-profits and advocacy groups that push conservative policy issues.\n\nCritics, and even some former associates, say that Dunn and Wilks demand loyalty from the candidates they back, punishing even deeply conservative legislators who cross them by bankrolling primary challengers. Kel Seliger, a longtime Republican state senator from Amarillo who has clashed with the billionaires, said their influence has made Austin feel a little like Moscow.\n\n“It is a Russian-style oligarchy, pure and simple,” Seliger said. “Really, really wealthy people who are willing to spend a lot of money to get policy made the way they want it – and they get it.”\n\nIn this Dec. 29, 2015, file photo, Farris Wilks watches U.S. Senator and then-presidential candidate Ted Cruz deliver remarks in Cisco, Texas. Ronald W. Erdrich/AP\n\nDragged to the ‘hard right’\n\nDunn and Wilks did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In past interviews and opinion pieces, Dunn has argued that his political spending is focused on making Texas’ state government more accountable to its voters, while Wilks has described his donations as aimed at electing principled conservative leaders.\n\nFormer associates of Dunn and Wilks who spoke to CNN said the billionaires are both especially focused on education issues, and their ultimate goal is to replace public education with private, Christian schooling. Wilks is a pastor at the church his father founded, and Dunn preaches at the church his family attends. In their sermons, they paint a picture of a nation under siege from liberal ideas.\n\n“The cornerstones of our government are crumbling and starting to come apart,” Wilks declared in a 2014 sermon at his insular church, the Assembly of Yahweh 7th Day. “And it’s because of the lack of morality, the lack of belief in our heavenly Father.”\n\nTexas’ far-right shift has national implications: The candidates Dunn and Wilks have supported have turned the state legislature into a laboratory for far-right policy that’s starting to gain traction across the US.\n\nThe Texas State Capitol is seen on the first day of the 87th Legislature's third special session on September 20, 2021 in Austin, Texas. Tamir Kalifa/Getty Images\n\nDunn and Wilks have been less successful in the 2022 primary elections than in past years: Almost all of the GOP legislative incumbents opposed by Defend Texas Liberty, a political action committee primarily funded by the duo, won their primaries this spring, and the group spent millions of dollars supporting a far-right opponent to Gov. Greg Abbott who lost by a wide margin.\n\nBut experts say the billionaires’ recent struggles are in part a symptom of their past success: Many of the candidates they’re challenging from the right, from Abbott down, have embraced more and more conservative positions, on issues from transgender rights to guns to voting.\n\n“They dragged all the moderate candidates to the hard right in order to keep from losing,” said Bud Kennedy, a columnist for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram newspaper who’s covered 18 sessions of the Texas legislature.\n\n“I don’t think regular Texans are as conservative as their elected officials,” Kennedy said. “The reason that Texas has moved to the right is because the money’s there.”\n\nDonors with influence on Texas politics 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\nPolitical investments paying off\n\nOver the last decade, many of the most conservative bills in the Texas legislature, on topics from LGBT rights to guns to private school vouchers, were killed by the moderate Republicans who held sway in the state House. That changed last year, thanks to people like Valoree Swanson.\n\nSwanson was a Sunday school teacher and political activist when she challenged a 14-year incumbent Republican, Debbie Riddle, in 2016 in a district covering Houston’s Republican-dominated northern suburbs.\n\nSwanson, who ran to Riddle’s right, shocked political observers by outraising the incumbent – an unusual feat for a first-time candidate. Her largest donor: Empower Texans, a political action committee created by Dunn and largely funded by him and Wilks. She defeated Riddle in the Republican primary by more than 10 percentage points and went on to easily win the general election.\n\nLast year, Swanson won a major legislative victory: She authored the transgender sports bill, which blocks trans students from playing on K-12 school sports teams that aren’t aligned with their genders at birth. While other bills about transgender issues had failed in previous years, the sports bill was approved by a legislature now firmly controlled by the GOP’s right flank after the moderate former House speaker retired. Observers saw it as a validation of the billionaires’ early investments in Swanson’s first campaign, paying off years later.\n\n“They’re effectively investing their money and they’re moving the needle on policy in Austin,” said Scott Braddock, the editor of Quorum Report, a publication that’s been covering the legislature for decades, referring to Dunn and Wilks. “These are extreme people investing a lot of money in our politics to reshape Texas, such that it matches up with their vision.”\n\nDemonstrators gather on the steps to the State Capitol to speak against transgender-related legislation being considered in the Texas Senate and Texas House, May 20, 2021, in Austin, Texas. Eric Gay/AP\n\nSwanson is hardly an outlier: All 18 of the current Republican members of the Texas Senate, and almost half of the Republican members of the Texas House, have taken at least some money from Dunn, Wilks or organizations that they fund. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton have also been major beneficiaries of the billionaires’ spending.\n\nTexas is one of just 10 states that allow individuals to make unlimited contributions to state political candidates, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures – letting Dunn and Wilks have more influence than they might elsewhere in the country.\n\nWhile Dunn and Wilks focus on state politics, they’ve also gotten involved in national races. Wilks, his brother Dan and their wives were among the largest donors to super PACs supporting GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz in 2016, contributing a total of $15 million. And Dunn has given millions of dollars to super PACs supporting former President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans in recent years.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Cruz called the Wilks brothers “the epitome of the American dream” and “fearless champions of conservative causes, much to the consternation of the corrupt corporate media.”\n\nSo far in 2022, Dunn’s and Wilks’ political investments haven’t been as successful as in past years. Defend Texas Liberty, the group they fund, gave more than $3 million to Don Huffines, a former state senator who challenged Abbott in his Republican primary and won just 12% of the vote. Despite his loss, experts pointed out, over the course of the campaign Abbott embraced some of the positions Huffines had staked out, including strong opposition to transgender rights and support for deploying National Guard members to the US-Mexican border.\n\nDefend Texas Liberty’s second-largest beneficiary this year has been Shelley Luther, an unsuccessful far-right legislative candidate who attracted national attention after she was arrested for refusing to shut down her Dallas hair salon to comply with coronavirus restrictions.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Luther – who proposed banning Chinese students from Texas universities and declared she is “not comfortable with the transgenders” – said that Dunn and Wilks had been integral to her campaign.\n\n“Without them, I couldn’t have even run,” Luther said. But she added that the spending wouldn’t have given the billionaires influence over her votes or decisions: “He wants me to do what I say that I represent,” she said of Dunn.\n\nEnforcing the ‘law of the jungle’\n\nThe Texas Highway Patrol stands in front of pro-life demonstrators as pro-choice supporters leave the Capitol in Austin, Texas, on Saturday May 14, 2022. Jessica Koscielniak/USA Today Network\n\nDunn and Wilks don’t just use campaign donations to play a role in state politics. They also fund a network of organizations that have been influential at boosting conservative causes.\n\nTexans for Fiscal Responsibility, a non-profit chaired by Dunn, has released a “Fiscal Responsibility Index” each legislative session grading state lawmakers based on their stances on conservative bills. The scorecard, which is often cited in election ads that show up in voters’ mailboxes, is known in Texas political circles for its ability to make and break Republican primary campaigns.\n\n“If you don’t show up well on the scorecard, you’re going to have a lot of money spent against you,” Seliger said.\n\nTexas Republicans say that even a deeply conservative record doesn’t protect someone from a primary challenge funded by Dunn, Wilks and groups they bankroll.\n\nState Sen. Bob Deuell had won elections for years in his northeast Texas district and racked up a conservative record – including co-authoring a 2013 abortion bill that was considered among the strictest in the country at the time, and was struck down by the US Supreme Court.\n\nBut in 2013, Deuell, a doctor, supported a bill that overhauled Texas’ end-of-life procedures. Texas Right to Life, a group whose largest donor over its history is Wilks, falsely claimed the bill would “strengthen Texas’ death panels.” The following year, Deuell was challenged by Bob Hall, a tea party activist.\n\nBob Deuell speaks to CNN's Ed Lavandera in Greenville, Texas on February 23, 2022. CNN\n\nTexas Right to Life spent more than $150,000 on mailers, voter guides and political consultants for Hall and other candidates in 2014, airing a barrage of ads claiming Deuell had “turned his back on life and on disabled patients.” Hall won the Republican primary in a runoff by 300 votes. Since that first campaign, Hall has received more than $900,000 from Dunn, Wilks, and groups that they are major funders of – about a third of his total donations.\n\n“All this West Texas money is what made him into a viable candidate,” Deuell said of Hall, who did not respond to requests for comment from CNN.\n\nSeliger, Deuell’s former colleague in the Senate, has also staked out conservative positions on many issues, and Dunn gave his campaign $1,000 during his first year in office in 2004.\n\nBut after Seliger decided he couldn’t support efforts to divert funding from public schools to private school vouchers, Dunn turned on him, he said. In the decade since, he’s found himself repeatedly running against a challenger backed by groups funded by Dunn and Wilks.\n\n“That’s the law of the jungle now in Texas,” Seliger said. “The majority of Republican Senate members just dance to whatever tune Tim Dunn wants to play.”\n\nConservatism vs. control within the Texas Republican Party 02:37 - Source: CNN\n\nDunn has defended his spending and his group’s campaign tactics.\n\n“Empower Texans remains outside the swamp, and the group informs voters who want their representatives to do in Austin what they promised during election season,” he wrote in a 2018 op-ed in The Dallas Morning News, responding to criticism of the group’s tactics. “If all of us outsiders stick together, we can drain the Austin Swamp.”\n\nZachary Maxwell has had an inside view of the billionaires’ influence. He worked for Empower Texans, Dunn’s PAC, and served as campaign manager and chief of staff for then-state Rep. Mike Lang, who received more than 60% of his campaign donations from Wilks and PACs he and Dunn were major funders of.\n\nMaxwell told CNN in an interview that there was “no way” Lang could have gotten elected without Wilks’ money. At one campaign fundraiser, he said, Jo Ann Wilks handed Maxwell a check for more than $100,000.\n\n“I was like, ‘Can you even write a check that big?’ ” Maxwell remembered. “I about had a heart attack.”\n\nHuge sums like that helped buy Wilks influence once Lang took office, Maxwell said. “Whenever (Farris Wilks) called, he answered,” Maxwell said of Lang. “There was a lot of control.”\n\nLang did not respond to requests for comment from CNN.\n\nWest Texas upbringings\n\nTexas has a long tradition of oil and gas magnates using their fortunes to shape politics. Hugh Roy Cullen, one of Houston’s wealthiest philanthropists, supported the pro-segregation Dixiecrat movement in the 1940s, and H.L. Hunt, who owned a vast swath of the East Texas Oil Field, funded a conservative radio program that aired across the US in the ’50s and ‘60s.\n\nWhat sets Dunn and Wilks apart, political observers say, is how they’ve spent so much money pushing not just business-friendly policies that boost their bottom line but also socially conservative bills that seem designed to reshape Texas in the image of their far-right Christian values.\n\nBoth are products of humble West Texas upbringings who earned huge fortunes in Texas’ energy industry.\n\nDunn, 66, lives in Midland, the childhood home of George W. Bush and a center of the state’s oil industry. He grew up in nearby Big Spring, the son of a farm and factory worker, and studied chemical engineering at Texas Tech before working for Exxon and other oil and banking companies.\n\nHe started his own oil company, now named CrownQuest Operating, in 1996. The firm operates oil wells around West Texas’ Permian Oil Basin and beyond, and pumped 31 million barrels of oil in Texas in 2021, making it the state’s 12th largest oil producer, according to government records.\n\nDunn became more involved in Texas politics in 2006, when he opposed a tax measure that included a new tax on business partnerships – including some that fund oil wells, Texas Monthly reported. He started an organization to oppose the measure, Empower Texans, which continued to fund conservative causes even after the tax legislation passed. The group’s PAC shut down in 2020, and the billionaires more recently pivoted to funding Defend Texas Liberty.\n\nWilks, 70, grew up in a converted goat shed in Cisco, Texas, a town of 3,700 where sleepy streets are dotted with more than a dozen churches. He and his younger brother Dan were the sons of a bricklayer and started their careers as apprentice masons.\n\nAfter several other business ventures, in 2002 they founded Frac Tech Services, a company that provided trucking services for fracking operators. It was perfect timing: Fracking was about to take off in Texas and elsewhere in the US amid a boom in shale gas.\n\nLess than a decade later, in 2011, the Wilkses sold their majority share of the company for more than $3 billion to a group that included international investors. Since then, they’ve been buying up land in Texas and around the Western US, joining the ranks of America’s largest landowners – and getting involved in politics.\n\nFarris Wilks is the pastor of the Assembly of Yahweh 7th Day Church, which operates a sprawling compound outside of Cisco and was founded by his father. In sermons, he has denounced homosexuality and abortion rights in vitriolic terms.\n\n“A male on male or a female on female is against nature,” Wilks declared in a 2013 recording of one sermon posted on his church’s website, which is no longer publicly available. “This lifestyle is the predatorial lifestyle in that they need your children. … They want your children.”\n\nDunn also preaches at his church, the Midland Bible Church, where he serves as a member of the congregation’s “pulpit team.”\n\n“No matter what rules you grew up with, none of them are enforceable in God’s kingdom,” he declared in one 2018 sermon.\n\nIn a 2004 interview with The Times of London, Dunn told a reporter he believed that, as the newspaper put it, “his oil has existed for only 4,000 years, the time decreed by Genesis, not 200 million years as his geologists know.”\n\nThat religious fervor has influenced Dunn’s and Wilks’ political moves. In a meeting with former Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, who is Jewish, Dunn declared that only Christians should hold leadership positions in the chamber, Texas Monthly reported. Straus declined an interview request with CNN.\n\nAnd both Wilks brothers have donated millions of dollars through their personal foundations to conservative Christian groups, including crisis pregnancy centers, according to IRS records, which work to dissuade women from abortion and in some cases share misleading medical information.\n\n‘The goal is to tear up, tear down’\n\nPeople who’ve worked with Wilks and Dunn say they share an ultimate goal: replacing much of public education in Texas with private Christian schools. Now, educators and students are feeling the impact of that conservative ideology on the state’s school system.\n\nDorothy Burton, a former GOP activist and religious scholar, joined Farris Wilks on a 2015 Christian speaking tour organized by his brother-in-law and said she spoke at events he attended. She described the fracking magnate as “very quiet” but approachable: “You would look at him and you would never think that he was a billionaire,” she said.\n\nBut Burton said that after a year of hearing Wilks’ ideology on the speaking circuit, she became disillusioned by the single-mindedness of his conservatism.\n\n“The goal is to tear up, tear down public education to nothing and rebuild it,” she said of Wilks. “And rebuild it the way God intended education to be.”\n\nIn sermons, Dunn and Wilks have advocated for religious influence in schooling. “When the Bible plainly teaches one thing and our culture teaches another, what do our children need to know what to do?” Wilks asks in one sermon from 2013.\n\nDunn, Wilks and the groups and politicians they both fund have been raising alarms about liberal ideas in the classroom, targeting teachers and school administrators they see as too progressive. The billionaires have especially focused on critical race theory, in what critics see as an attempt to use it as a scapegoat to break voters’ trust in public schooling.\n\nIn the summer of 2020, James Whitfield, the first Black principal of the mostly White Colleyville Heritage High School in the Dallas suburbs, penned a heartfelt, early-morning email in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, encouraging his school to “not grow weary in the battle against systemic racism.”\n\nJames Whitfield looks at photos at his home in Bedford, Texas on January 13, 2022. CNN\n\nThe backlash came months later. Stetson Clark, a former school board candidate whose campaign had been backed by a group that received its largest donations from Dunn and organizations he funded, accused Whitfield during a school board meeting last year of “encouraging all members of our community to become revolutionaries” and “encouraging the destruction and disruption of our district.” The board placed Whitfield on leave, and later voted not to renew his contract. He agreed to resign after coming to a settlement with the district. Clark did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhitfield said he saw the rhetoric pushed by Dunn and Wilks as a major cause of his being pushed out.\n\n“They want to disrupt and destroy public schools, because they would much rather have schools that are faith-based,” Whitfield said. “We know what has happened over the course of history in our country, and if we can’t teach that, then what do you want me to do?”\n\nMeanwhile, the legislature has also been taking on the discussion of race in classrooms, passing a bill last year that bans schools from making teachers “discuss a widely debated and currently controversial issue of public policy or social affairs.” The legislation was designed to keep critical race theory out of the classroom, according to Abbott, who signed the bill into law.\n\nSome of the co-authors and sponsors of the bill and previous versions of the legislation received significant funding from Dunn and Wilks.\n\nThe billionaires “want to destroy the public school system as we know it and, in its place, see more home-schooling and more private Christian schools,” said Deuell, the former senator.\n\nThe Texans feeling the impact include Libby Gonzales, an 11-year-old transgender girl living in the Dallas suburbs. She and her family say they feel like targets after the new law restricting trans students’ participation in school sports went into effect last year – passed by Swanson and other legislators bankrolled by Dunn and Wilks. Now, Libby won’t be able to play for the girls’ soccer team that she’d like to join.\n\nLibby Gonzales plays outside her home in a suburb of Dallas on January 19, 2022. CNN\n\n“We don’t have issues in our neighborhood, among our friends,” said her mother, Rachel Gonzales. “It’s when our legislators meet and decide that they’re going to leverage their political power against some of the most marginalized kids in our state.”\n\nGonzales has started volunteering for political campaigns in an attempt to turn the tide on anti-trans policies. Libby said she’s been following the news about Texas’ conservative turn – and worrying what’s coming next.\n\nLast month, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a think tank that Dunn serves on the board of, called on the legislature to ban the prescription of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for minors.\n\n“I’m under attack,” Libby said. “I have no idea why people don’t understand that I’m just a girl: an 11-year-old girl living in Texas – with amazing hair.”", "authors": ["Casey Tolan Matthew Reynard Will Simon Ed Lavandera", "Casey Tolan", "Matthew Reynard", "Will Simon", "Ed Lavandera"], "publish_date": "2022/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/01/13/peak-academy-charter-school-asheville-nc-recommended-students/4419158002/", "title": "Peak academy charter school in Asheville NC recommended for ...", "text": "PEAK Academy, a proposed Asheville charter school with a focus on serving black and low-income students, took a significant step towards becoming a reality.

According to the PEAK application, the proposed school currently plans to pay new teachers around $50,000 a year (or 3% more than their current district salaries, depending on which amount is greater).\n\nAdvisory board members routinely applauded PEAK's ambitious academic promises, while seeking details on the instructional approach PEAK would take to raise reading and math levels.\n\n\"I appreciate your no-excuse approach,\" advisory board member Lindalyn Kakadelis said.\n\nPEAK intends to begin as a K-2 school before growing one grade each year until the school runs kindergarten through eighth grade. At capacity, PEAK hopes to teach 400 students, roughly double the size of the only current charter school in Asheville, Francine Delaney New School for Children.\n\n\"We're one of the most vibrant communities in the state, and it's a gross disservice for us to eliminate or dismiss a whole population of our kids,\" PEAK board member Gene Bell told the charter advisory board. \"I think the PEAK Academy has the staff, the board and our commitment to make a change.\"\n\nMore Education Coverage:Accessibility seen as a barrier to racial, economic diversity in area charter schools.\n\nMore:Proposed Asheville charter school to focus on black, low-income students\n\nCharter critics and history\n\nNot everyone views charter schools as the answer to systemic race and income-based education disparities.\n\n\"We've got over 20 years of history now, and the broad evidence does not suggest that charter schools have been able to find the magic that would eliminate achievement gaps,\" said Michael Priddy, interim executive director of the Public School Forum of North Carolina. \"And even for the most part, charters haven't found the magic that would narrow the achievement gaps.\"\n\nIn 1996, North Carolina passed its first charter school law, ushering in the unique public schools to the state. Charter schools receive public funding but are independent from district school boards.\n\nNorth Carolina limited the number of charter schools at 100 until 2011 when the General Assembly lifted the cap. Today, more than 200 charters operate across the state, part of a broader shift of students learning outside traditional district schools.\n\nAround 20% of K-12 students in North Carolina now attend schools outside districts according to Terry Stoops of the John Locke Foundation think tank.\n\nA final vote to approve PEAK Academy will be made by the State Board of Education in March.

And if elected, she might be the only Republican governor in the country to have interned for Massachusetts' Democratic Sen. Edward \"Ted\" Kennedy.\n\nKalus and her Democratic opponent, Gov. Dan McKee, are a study in contrasts: In age, gender, ideology, temperament and lifestyle.\n\nWhile Kalus has moved around, McKee's attachment to his hometown of Cumberland is one of his defining characteristics, and after more than a year leading the state, he at times still seems to identify as a mayor.\n\nIn an election year of races featuring claims of provincialism or carpetbagging, Kalus versus McKee may be the most intense.\n\nMore:McKee and Kalus clashed in first debate of the general election.

And I also know what we have in Rhode Island and what we don't have in Rhode Island.\"\n\nIf she wins next month, Kalus would be the first GOP governor since Donald Carcieri, who also emerged out of the private sector, in 2002.\n\nMore:Can the governor stop energy bills from going up? Depends on how you read this RI law.\n\nGrowing up in California and Massachusetts\n\nKalus' earliest years were spent in the San Diego area, but after her parents went through a messy divorce, her mother moved the family from California to her stepfather's hometown on the South Shore of Massachusetts when Kalus was 11.\n\nHer mother, a physical therapist, started a physical therapy staffing company. Her stepfather, from whom she took the Kalus name, worked on the bookkeeping side of startup companies.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Kalus says she came from \"humble beginnings\" and mentions the tumult of the divorce, but at least in Massachusetts it doesn't appear her family was poor.\n\nA lot of the hardships and formative experiences she mentions on the campaign trail were from her high school years.\n\n\"I was not doing well in high school, and I don't think they knew what to do with me,\" she said. \"They have the right to a quality education in Massachusetts, which is a constitutional right there, very different from Rhode Island. So there was an obligation to figure it out, because I was a high-IQ, low-performing student.\"\n\nShe entered a Dual Enrollment Partnership, which allows students to earn high school credits by taking free college courses. She began commuting from the South Shore to the University of Massachusetts at Boston for classes and \"never stepped foot in the high school I graduated from.\"\n\nCongressional District 2:Magaziner in attack mode in congressional debate; Fung pushes back\n\nMore:With Magaziner behind in the polls, we asked strategists: How would you run his campaign?\n\nThe experience instilled a belief in nontraditional school arrangements, \"school choice,\" and the importance of letting children go to school outside their area.\n\nIt was during this period, going back and forth between Scituate and Boston, that she said she one day wandered into a gym in Quincy and started taking boxing classes.\n\nEventually, Kalus said, her parents let her get an apartment in Boston's North End, and she mostly lived there until college at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.\n\nDid Kalus live in RI full time before 2021?\n\nKalus met her future husband, Dr. Jeffrey Weinzweig, while she was studying at UMass and he was a plastic surgeon in Providence. At the time, her sister was studying at the Rhode Island School of Design, she said.\n\nAt the same time he was practicing medicine, Weinzweig, now 59, owned a comedy club in the early days of the Providence Place mall.\n\n\"It was called Stitches, because he's a surgeon, if you get the sort of double meaning,\" she said. \"My husband has like a 'dad joke' sense of humor.\"\n\nIn 2001, Stitches Komedy Kafe received a $350,660 loan from the Providence Economic Development Corporation under then-Mayor Vincent A. \"Buddy\" Cianci Jr., according to city records.\n\nMore:Should RI 'send in the troops' to solve RIPTA bus driver shortage?\n\n\"He loves Buddy to this day,\" Kalus said.\n\nThe loan was repaid in full in January 2017, according to Andrew Grande, spokesman for Mayor Jorge Elorza.\n\nOn the question of whether Kalus ever lived in Rhode Island full time before last year, the answer is hazy. At one point, she said she did in the early 2000s, when she was in college. Pressed on whether she commuted an hour and 45 minutes each way to Amherst, her campaign said, \"they were back and forth between PVD and Boston for a long time.\"\n\nKalus graduated from UMass in 2005 with degrees in finance and legal studies.\n\nOne possible outcome would have been for her to move full time to Providence with Weinzweig, who had a condo at Corliss Landing. But needing money to pay off student loans, she took a consulting job with Accenture in Boston.\n\nShe said she was so ambivalent about joining corporate America that she convinced Accenture to let her spend four months visiting Bayangovi, a city on the edge of the Gobi Desert in Mongolia, before she started work.\n\nShe spent three years working at Accenture and then went back to school, in New York and London, for joint MBA programs at Columbia and the London School of Economics.\n\nBy the time those programs were over, Weinzweig had left Rhode Island for Illinois, a move the Kalus campaign has blamed on Rhode Island's weak economy and bad business climate.\n\nAs it happens, the state in 2010 was finishing eight years under Republican Carcieri.\n\nWas he to blame?\n\n\"It's 80 years of bad policies in this state,\" she said. \"I am not going to be somebody that sticks up for any politician that has led this state into the place that it is now.\"\n\nSpecifically, Kalus said Rhode Island \"underfunded Medicaid,\" which affected the type of work, including cranial and facial reconstructive surgery, that Weinzweig did at Rhode Island Hospital. (As an aside, she said he was on call and worked the night of the Station nightclub fire.)\n\n\"And those cases are not insured, or Medicaid hardly pays enough to keep the lights on,\" she said. \"So this idea that my husband is a plastic and reconstructive surgeon and therefore could make it, it's just fundamentally untrue.\"\n\nWeinzweig moved to a better job in Boston and then, by the time she was out of graduate school, to greater Chicago.\n\nIn Illinois, Kalus and Weinzweig set up their own plastic surgery practice. As she describes it, he led the medical side of the operation and she ran the business side. That included a lending arm so patients could finance their procedures. It appears to have been lucrative.\n\nOne of Kalus' policy priorities is cutting regulations in health care, especially the \"certificate of need\" permits required to open new facilities.\n\nA return to politics, and a change in philosophy\n\nThe move to Illinois coincided with Kalus' entry into professional politics, and her perspective seemed to have changed from her college years, when she interned for Ted Kennedy.\n\nShe got a job working on the 2010 gubernatorial campaign of Andrew McKenna Jr. (in a race to replace the imprisoned Rod Blagojevich). McKenna lost the GOP primary.\n\nAnd four years later, she joined the campaign of Bruce Rauner, who went on to become Illinois governor. After the election, Rauner brought her into his administration as \"director of public engagement.\"\n\nRauner ran as a moderate Republican with liberal positions on social issues, but he clashed with the Democratic legislature on spending and, particularly, labor policy. He pushed for an Illinois \"right to work\" law that would have banned mandatory union dues at union workplaces, and he also supported pension reform.\n\nAsked whether she favors \"right to work\" legislation in Rhode Island, Kalus said it isn't politically viable and declined to say whether she personally supports such an idea.\n\nRauner lost to Gov. J.B. Pritzker in 2018.\n\nFrom Florida to Rhode Island, and eyeing the governor's seat\n\nKalus said that as someone who had grown up around saltwater, she never took to life in the Midwest and moved to the Florida Keys to be by the ocean.\n\nKalus and Weinzweig started their testing and vaccination provider business, Doctors Test Centers, at the onset of the pandemic and, driven by some combination of New England longing and the soul-searching many Americans felt during COVID lockdown, moved to Rhode Island.\n\nShe said she had not thought about running for governor when she arrived to work on her testing contract with the state.\n\nRhode Island Republican Party Chairwoman Sue Cienki said Kalus reached out to her sometime last year, possibly around 18 months ago, and inquired about opportunities to run for office.\n\nCienki was impressed with Kalus' background, but at the time there were others interested, including Filippi.\n\n\"At that point I said, 'You need to be able to raise or put in $2 [million] to $3 million to run for governor, a million upfront because you have no name recognition,'\" Cienki recounted. \"She didn't blink. She said no problem. Then I knew she was a serious candidate.\"\n\nAs of last week, of the $3.85 million Kalus has raised for the campaign, $3.7 million came from her own pocket.\n\nKalus said Rhode Island's $1,000 individual contribution limit is \"broken\" and favors insiders, but she is undecided about whether the limit should be lowered or eliminated altogether.\n\nSince Gov. Gina Raimondo became governor in 2015, the legislature and executive branch have largely worked in concert on big issues.\n\nBut as the boxing gloves emblazoned on her campaign Winnebago attest, if Kalus beats McKee in November, that is likely to change.\n\nShe isn't afraid to throw political bombs, and her growing disdain for McKee seems to, at least in part, come from her view that he doesn't have a driving philosophy or vision.\n\nIn one sense, Kalus harks back to other well-known GOP candidates, including Carcieri, who promised to bring business acumen into government.\n\nBut compared with Carcieri or two-time GOP nominee for governor Allan Fung, Kalus brings a more populist approach. She often talks about lifting up the less fortunate and sprinkles terms like \"inclusiveness,\" \"engagement\" and \"community organizing\" in conversations.\n\nWhen picking a GOP governor she considers her political hero, she didn't choose Massachusetts' technocratic-style Gov. Charlie Baker, but the confrontational Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. (She has distanced herself from DeSantis flying migrants to Martha's Vineyard.)\n\n\"I just want an economy that works for everyone,\" she said of what she admires about DeSantis. \"And the thing is that in Florida it is a place where entrepreneurship is happening, where businesses are going there because they feel that they can make it.\"\n\nKalus can't pinpoint a particular point in time or issue that made her change from a Democrat to a Republican, but said the Democratic Party changed more than she did.\n\n\"The Democratic Party left the people, and I have never left working with people my entire career,\" she sad.\n\npanderson@providencejournal.com\n\n(401) 277-7384\n\nOn Twitter: @PatrickAnderso_", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/03/24/mps-school-board-candidates-on-milwaukee-spring-2023-election-ballot/70018483007/", "title": "MPS School Board candidates on Milwaukee spring 2023 election ...", "text": "All Milwaukee voters April 4 will have a hand in choosing the next school board member to hold the only citywide seat governing Milwaukee Public Schools, as board president Bob Peterson is stepping down.\n\nSome Milwaukee voters will have a second school board seat on their ballot for their local area.

In District 1, Shandowlyon Hendricks Reaves will face incumbent Marva Herndon. In District 3, board vice president Sequanna Taylor is stepping down; Gabi Hart will take on Darryl Jackson in that race.\n\nLearn more about the candidates below.\n\nJeff Spence\n\nBackground: Jeff Spence, who also ran for a seat on the common council but lost in the primary, works at the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District as a senior fellow and officer of diversity, equity and inclusion. He previously served on the school board from 1999 to 2015, when he lost to teachers-union-backed Wendell Harris. The union opposed Spence’s openness to approving independently run charter schools.\n\nSupporters: Spence said his campaign has received contributions from charter school advocate and founder Howard Fuller, former county executive Chris Abele, former school board members Mark Sain and Bruce Thompson, Milwaukee Succeeds Director Vincent Lyles, conservative donor Ted Kellner and equity fund director Cory Nettles, who co-chaired a capital campaign for Fuller's school.\n\nDonors: As of the most recent campaign finance filings in January, Spence had not yet logged contributions. The next reports are due March 27 and will be available on the city website.\n\nWebsite:jeffspenceformilwaukee.godaddysites.com\n\nViews:\n\nSpence said MPS should consolidate students and staff into fewer buildings, in cases where buildings are not at capacity, and sell other buildings. He said elementary schools with 200 or fewer students, or traditional high schools with 300 or fewer students, may not be offering as many opportunities for students, and the district would benefit from saving money on upkeep of underused buildings.\n\nSpence said he would propose adding seats on the school board for the mayor and county executive. The idea is softer than other power-shifting proposals that the board has fought off in the past, including putting the mayor in charge or dissolving the district. Spence said the officials would have no more power than other board members. But it would mean voters outside the city would have voting power for one seat. Spence said the collaboration would lead to “collective strategies” to address intertwined issues of education, health and stable housing. He also said, in a forum hosted by Leaders Igniting Transformation, that he disagrees with the board’s 2020 decision to end contracts with Milwaukee Police.\n\nSpence said MPS needs to prioritize reading and math, that Milwaukee needs more alternative educational models, and parents should be able to choose from a range of schools whether they are run by MPS or not. He said he would support “universal school choice,” a concept backed by Republican lawmakers who say any student should be able to use tax-funded vouchers to attend private schools.\n\nMissy Zombor\n\nBackground: Zombor is the marketing director for Rethinking Schools, a magazine co-founded by school board president Bob Peterson with a focus on social justice in education. She previously served as communications director for the MPS teachers union. Like two candidates who ran in the 2021 board election, Zombor is a member of the Milwaukee Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nSupporters: Zombor is endorsed by Peterson, who is vacating the seat. She is also endorsed by the MPS teachers union, Black Leaders Organizing for Communities, Citizen Action, Wisconsin Working Families Party, the Democratic Party of Milwaukee County, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes; state Dem. lawmakers Darrin Madison, Evan Goyke, Ryan Clancy, Christine Sinicki, Tod Ohnstad, LaTonya Johnson and Chris Larson; county supervisors Marcelia Nicholson, Juan Miguel Martinez and Peter Burgelis; and Common Council members Jonathan Brostoff and Marina Dimitrijevic.\n\nDonors: As of the most recent campaign finance filings in January, Zombor had raised over $10,000, with the largest donation being $1,000 from Clancy. She has since received $5,000 from the MPS teachers union, according to a later filing by the union's political action committee. Zombor’s next report is due March 27 and will be available on the city website.\n\nWebsite:www.missyformilwaukee.com\n\nViews:\n\nZombor said MPS, which has dealt with chronic staff vacancies, needs to better compensate teachers to ensure smaller class sizes and that each school can regularly offer arts, physical education and career education. She said she would support bonuses for educators who stay in the district, health insurance for all full-time substitute teachers, and a faster hiring process.\n\nZombor’s priorities also include transportation, meals and mental health. She said she would push to add GPS trackers to school buses so families can track them, and would advocate for free county bus passes for MPS students. She wants more schools to reopen their kitchens to prepare fresh meals and offer customizable options like sandwich, baked potato or salad bars. She said she would “defend and expand” recess, and push for more mental health staff and restorative justice practices. At LIT's forum, she said she supports the school board’s 2020 decision to end contracts with Milwaukee Police.\n\nZombor said she doesn’t think the school board should approve any new “non-instrumentality” charter schools, which are schools authorized by MPS to be run by independent boards. She said she wouldn’t necessarily vote against renewing contracts with existing non-instrumentality charter schools but thinks the board should “take a close look” before doing so.\n\nDistrict 1\n\nShandowlyon Hendricks Reaves\n\nBackground: Hendricks Reaves, who now owns a dump truck business, ran for state superintendent in 2021 and lost in the primary. She previously worked as a teacher and administrator in public, private charter and higher education settings, before working for the state Department of Public Instruction while now Gov. Tony Evers was state superintendent, and then serving as director of Evers’ Milwaukee office when he became governor. Also from 2016 to 2022, Hendricks Reaves worked as a consultant for a range of clients including MPS, other public and private schools, and City Forward Collective — where she is credited with launching the organization’s parent organizing work.\n\nSupporters: Hendricks Reaves is endorsed by the Leaders in Education Fund, a national organization that has been linked with charter-backing billionaires, as reported by the Washington Post; and supported a range of candidates across the country, including current board member Aisha Carr. Hendricks Reaves is also endorsed by former state Rep. Elizabeth Coggs (Democrat), former state superintendent candidate Sheila Briggs, Racine Unified School District Superintendent Eric Gallien, America's Black Holocaust Museum President Robert Davis, former candidate for state Assembly Andrew McKinney (Republican), pastor Doyle Sprewer, and former educators Latish Reed, Mary Pat Siewart, Janie Hatton, David DeGuire and Jennie Dorsey, among others.\n\nFunders: As of the most recent campaign finance filings in January, Hendricks-Reaves reported raising about $2,700: mostly her own money as loans to the campaign, along with $1,000 from Rogers Onick, a retired MPS principal, and $100 from Briggs. The next reports are due March 27 and will be available on the city website.\n\nWebsite:www.friendsofshandowlyon.com\n\nViews:\n\nWith a similar platform to her run for superintendent, Hendricks Reaves has proposed a \"Bill of Rights\" for students that includes early childhood education, a nurse in every school, arts programming, options for virtual instruction and career internships. At LIT's forum, she said she disagrees with the school board’s 2020 decision to end contracts with Milwaukee Police.\n\nHendricks Reaves said she would push for more state funding for MPS and higher pay for teachers. She also said she would work to recruit and support more teachers of color in MPS, including more opportunities for high school students to start studying to become teachers, and creative partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities — possibly linking student teachers from HBCUs with retired Black educators in Milwaukee willing to house and mentor them.\n\nHendricks Reaves said MPS should consider selling underused buildings to save money, though if it meant shuttering schools, she said the board should give families and staff one or two years' notice before doing so, with a plan for moving those students. Additionally, she said she would not actively oppose expansion of charter schools or vouchers for private schools.\n\nMarva Herndon (inc.)\n\nBackground: Herndon was elected to the board in 2019. She worked as a computer programmer for 25 years and retired from Harley-Davidson in 2009. She founded the Bryant Heights Neighborhood Association in 2001 and has been involved with the NAACP education committee, Schools and Communities United, and Wisconsin Public Education Network, which advocates for funding for public schools and against expansion of non-district charter schools and vouchers for private schools.\n\nSupporters: Herndon has announced endorsements from the MPS teachers union, Black Leaders Organizing for Communities, Citizen Action, Wisconsin Working Families Party, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Ald. Jonathan Brostoff and Ald. Marina Dimitrijevic.\n\nFunders: As of the most recent campaign finance filings in January, Herndon reported she started with a committee balance of about $1,900 and had no new fundraising. She has since received $1,461 from the MPS teachers union, according to a later filing by the union's political action committee. The next reports are due March 27 and will be available on the city website.\n\nWebsite:www.facebook.com/marvaformps\n\nViews:\n\nIn her time on the board, Herndon has pushed for more music, arts and physical education programming at MPS, particularly on the north side of the city where programs had dwindled, ultimately succeeding with the passage of the 2020 referendum. The pandemic and staffing vacancies have impeded some progress, and she said she hopes to see the effort through.\n\nHerndon said she wants to continue other initiatives the board is working on, including restoring school-based kitchens to make fresher meals for students. She also co-sponsored a resolution last year to cut the district’s greenhouse emissions by 45% by 2030 and support the national Justice 40 Initiative goal to ensure 40% of jobs related to climate go to marginalized communities. At LIT's forum, she said she stood by her 2020 vote with the school board's majority to end contracts with Milwaukee Police.\n\nHerndon has long opposed the public funding of private and non-district charter schools, in part because they educate fewer students with disabilities and leave school districts with comparatively higher costs for special education, which affects the district’s whole budget.\n\nPamela Holmes\n\nBackground: Holmes launched a write-in campaign after city election officials determined she failed to turn in the required 400 valid nomination signatures from her district. She retired in 2017 after 17 years as a sergeant with the Milwaukee Police Department. She serves on Assembly Speaker Robin Vos' Task Force on Racial Disparities, and as state chapter president of the National Black Police Association.\n\nSupporters: Holmes said she was endorsed by former County Supervisor Michael Mayo.\n\nFunders: Holmes has not reported fundraising. Election officials said she will have to file a finance report March 27, since she is registered as a write-in candidate.\n\nWebsite:www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100089306573676\n\nViews:\n\nAsked why she was running, Holmes said she has been frustrated with MPS through the course of her volunteer work since retiring from the police department. She said she has worked with Youth Victory Over Violence to organize conversations between police and students about gun violence, reckless driving and other issues but MPS has not brought them “on board to have the conversations.”\n\nHolmes said she wants to address bullying in MPS and said she thinks police should be invited back into MPS schools to stop it. She said the district should make sure officers in the schools are officers who choose to be in schools, rather than being forced to be there. At LIT’s forum, she said she disagrees with the board’s 2020 decision to end contracts with Milwaukee Police.\n\nHolmes recently pulled her daughter out of MPS and moved her to a suburban school. She said she wants to see MPS offer the resources she's seen her daughter get in the suburb, including extracurricular activities at all schools. She said there should be more state funding for public schools, and she does not oppose funding for vouchers for private schools.\n\nErika Siemsen\n\nBackground: Siemsen was elected to the school board in 2019. Previously, she worked as a teacher at Neeskara Elementary, a MPS school, for over 30 years and served as a representative with the MPS teachers union.\n\nSupporters: Siemsen is endorsed by the MPS teachers union, Black Leaders Organizing for Communities, Citizen Action, Wisconsin Working Families Party, Fair Wisconsin, state lawmakers Chris Larson and Evan Goyke (Democrats), County Supervisors Ryan Clancy and Peter Burgelis, Alderman Jonathan Brostoff and Alderwoman Marina Dimitrijevic, among others.\n\nFunders: As of the most recent campaign finance filings in January, Siemsen reported she started with a committee balance of about $3,800 and had added just $27 in December. She has since received $1,482 from the MPS teachers union, according to a later filing by the union's political action committee. The next reports are due March 27 and will be available on the city website.\n\nWebsite:erikaformps.com\n\nViews:\n\nSiemsen co-wrote a resolution in 2020 to reduce class sizes, starting with the youngest grades. She said she wants to continue that work by building up the workforce of teachers entering the field, including supporting current MPS students in starting down that path.\n\nSiemsen said she wants to work on improving school meals. She recently co-authored a resolution to start a Food Justice Task Force to recommend changes for MPS. The task force will involve board members, staff, administrators and students — including students from Youth Empowered in the Struggle, which has been pushing for better meals.\n\nAt LIT's forum, she said she stood by her 2020 vote with the school board's majority to end contracts with Milwaukee Police. Siemsen said she wants to see MPS expand mental health supports and make resources more equitable across the district. She said she would prefer all charter schools be district run.\n\nGabi Hart\n\nBackground: Hart is a confronting mass incarceration fellow with the Milwaukee Turners. In 2016, she co-founded Program the Parks with activist Vaun Mayes, in response to seeing teenagers fighting and getting kicked out of parks. Their organization offered free food, jobs for teens raking leaves and shoveling snow, and a range of activities like dance contests, movie screenings and karate. She also worked as a business analyst for coding training program IC Stars from 2019 to 2021.\n\nSupporters: Hart is endorsed by school board vice president Sequanna Taylor, who is vacating the seat. She is also endorsed by the MPS teachers union, Fair Wisconsin, Citizen Action, Ald. Jonathan Brostoff, and V100 program director Reggie Brown, among others.\n\nFunders: As of the most recent campaign finance filings in January, Hart didn’t report any fundraising. The next reports are due March 27 and will be available on the city website.\n\nWebsite:www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100089330091388\n\nViews:\n\nHart said her top priority is reducing suspensions and expulsions at MPS, which have continued to be disparately high for Black students. She said the district should look at ending the use of suspensions for certain behaviors, such as being late to school. While tardiness isn’t a category on the district’s suspension reports, skipping class is. She said the district should work with community groups to “get to the root” of issues, use restorative justice practices and spaces in schools where students can calm down.\n\nHart said she wants to involve students more in board decisions and specifically work with LGBTQ students and student groups to see how schools could improve. Hart said she has marched in students’ protests, including one at North Division about lead in water, and would work to ensure safe water fountains districtwide — something MPS is using some federal pandemic relief dollars to fund. At LIT's forum, she said she supports the school board's 2020 decision to end contracts with Milwaukee Police.\n\nHart said she is still learning about the charter and voucher systems but would like to see limits on them in order to retain funding for MPS where she said there is more accountability to an elected board.\n\nDarryl Jackson\n\nBackground: Jackson is a real estate investor and vice president of business development at a construction management firm, Brothers Infrastructure Group Construction. According to his campaign website, Jackson is a graduate of Bradley Tech and has mentored MPS students through his construction firm. Jackson declined an interview request from the Journal Sentinel but answered questions by email.\n\nSupporters: Jackson said he is endorsed by Aisha Carr.\n\nFunders: As of the most recent campaign finance filings in January, Jackson didn’t report any fundraising. The next reports are due March 27 and will be available on the city website.\n\nWebsite:www.darryljacksonformps.com\n\nViews:\n\nNoting many students may not choose college, Jackson said MPS should focus on reading and math and better provide students with \"transferable skills\" for a range of career pathways. He said the district should work with local companies to establish more student internships and apprenticeship programs.\n\nJackson said he would seek to reduce suspension and expulsion rates by \"creating a formal talk back session to give view points from both sides to gather an understanding as to why.\" At LIT's forum, he said he disagreed with the board's 2020 decision to end contracts with Milwaukee Police.\n\nJackson said the district could better support teachers by investing in higher-quality training and offering financial advisory services for retirement planning. Jackson said he supported Evers' budget proposal, including the freeze on vouchers for private schools, \"as of now.\" He said he's not sure yet how he would handle requests for new charter schools as doesn't yet know enough about how many charter schools exist or the need for more.\n\nLearn more and vote\n\nLearn more about all the school board candidates by watching the replay of LIT's Feb. 15 forum on the organization's Facebook page.\n\nLearn about candidates for state Supreme Court, Milwaukee Common Council, Milwaukee County Board and other offices at jsonline.com.\n\nFind information on your polling place, registering to vote, and what's on your ballot at myvote.wi.gov.

Progressive human rights ideas also emerged and changed the world as women, blacks, and the LGBT community demanded, and often won, equal rights. Technology evolved, modifying and innovating our lives in ways never dreamed of.\n\nThe world certainly has progressed, but wars have raged on, and climate change has picked up speed, endangering the ecosystems of our planet.\n\nTo put this in perspective, 24/7 Wall St. has compiled a list of the most important event in each of the past 100 years. We drew on research material and news reports to determine what event had the biggest impact in a particular year.\n\n1919: National booze ban\n\n• Date: Oct. 28\n\n• Location: Washington D.C.\n\nCongress passes the 18th Amendment that bans the production, transport or sale of alcoholic beverages in the United States. The legislation opens the way for Prohibition, which lasts from 1920 to 1933. The public flouts the law, which succeeds in enriching gangsters and contributing to the rise of organized crime.\n\n1920: Women's suffrage\n\n• Date: Aug. 26\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nThough the United States was founded under democratic principles, only a minority of its population (starting with white landowning males over the age of 21) could actually vote. But after the 19th Amendment of the Constitution is passed, women finally gain a voice and the right to cast their ballots.\n\nSports gambling:Why sports betting hasn't gone nationwide yet after Supreme Court ruling\n\n1921: Chinese Communists rise\n\n• Date: July 1\n\n• Location: Beijing\n\nIn a prequel to the rise of Mao Zedong and Red China, the Chinese Communist Party is founded, and three weeks later it convenes its first National Congress that is attended by Mao. It would take another 28 years before the Republic of China becomes the People's Republic of China.\n\n1922: British Empire shrinks\n\n• Date: Feb. 28\n\n• Location: London\n\nThe British Empire was at its peak toward the end of World War I, commanding a global population estimated to be as many as 570 million people, or about a fourth of the world's population at the time. The empire's size began to shrink in 1920, when Britain declared limited independence for Egypt, which leads to full independence two years later.\n\n1923: Great Kanto earthquake\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Tokyo, Yokohama, Japan\n\nThe Great Kanto earthquake, also known as the Tokyo-Yokohama earthquake, strikes the Japanese mainland at noon on Sept. 1, 1923, with a magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale. The death toll is estimated at 140,000 people. The force of the temblor destroys hundreds of thousands of homes that either collapse or are engulfed in fire. The quake sets off a tsunami that reaches a height of almost 40 feet at Atami in the Sagami Gulf, killing 60 people there. The most significant outcome of the catastrophe is the rebuilt Tokyo that would become a modern metropolis.\n\n1924: From Lenin to Stalin\n\n• Date: Jan. 21\n\n• Location: Moscow\n\nFollowing the death of Vladimir Lenin on Jan. 21, the new leader of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, immediately begins a purge of political rivals. Some are simply moved to different positions, while others, like Leon Trotsky, the presumed successor to Lenin, are exiled. Stalin's paranoia grows as he takes control of the nation, and with it the level of violence and killing of anyone perceived to be a threat to his power and control.\n\n1925: Scopes monkey trial\n\n• Date: July 10\n\n• Location: Dayton, Tennessee\n\nAfter teaching the theory of evolution in a Tennessee high school, the state prosecutes science teacher John Thomas Scopes because state law prohibits such teaching as it runs counter to Biblical beliefs. The trial pits well-known Christian fundamentalist William Jennings Bryan against renowned attorney Clarence Darrow. The jury rules against Scopes, forcing him to pay a fine of $100 (about $1,460 in 2017 dollars). It would take another 43 years before the U.S. Supreme Court rules that laws punishing people for teaching evolution violate the First Amendment.\n\n1926: U.S. starts numbered highway system\n\n• Date: Nov. 11\n\n• Location: U.S.\n\nIn a precursor to the modern interstate highway system, the federal government introduces a national highway numbering system in an effort to standardize roadways, especially local roads and trails with names unfamiliar to outsiders. The U.S. Numbered Highway System makes it easier for the growing number of car owners to figure out how to get from one city or town to the next and opens the way for the great American road-trip tradition.\n\n1927: Lindbergh nonstop to Paris\n\n• Date: May 21\n\n• Location: New York to Paris\n\nWhen the monoplane The Spirit of St. Louis touches down at Le Bourget Field in Paris on the evening of May 21, Charles Lindbergh becomes the person to fly over the Atlantic Ocean nonstop. Lindbergh would become one of the heroes of the age. His feat fires the imagination of aspiring aviators about the commercial possibilities of flight. Lindbergh would stay in the news, but for regrettable reasons. A strong advocate for American isolationism in the 1930s, he is criticized for his admiration of Nazi Germany's aircraft industry. Also, his son would be killed during a bungled kidnapping attempt in 1932.\n\n1928: Earhart crosses Atlantic\n\n• Date: June 17-18\n\n• Location: Wales\n\nAmelia Earhart becomes the first woman to pilot a plane across the Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Wales, making her an American national heroine and feminist icon who would go on to set numerous aviation records. She would later set another record as the first person – man or woman – to fly solo from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. Earhart and her co-pilot Fred Noonan would vanish over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 during Earhart's attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Recent evidence has emerged indicating Earhart may have sent distress signals after surviving a crash, possibly on the remote Gardner Island in the western Pacific Ocean.\n\n1929: Wall Street crashes\n\n• Date: Oct. 24-29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nThe \"Roaring Twenties\" come to a halt on Black Tuesday in October 1929, when stocks take a nosedive, contributing to the Great Depression. Reasons for the worst economic downturn in American history include over-lending by weakly regulated banks, excessive stock price valuation, too many stocks purchased on margin, unrestrained exuberance that sends millions of people to convert their savings into stocks, tightening of the credit by the Federal Reserve and an agricultural drought.\n\n1930: Ho Chi Minh rises in Vietnam\n\n• Date: Feb. 2\n\n• Location: Hanoi\n\nIn an event that would have repercussions for U.S. foreign policy decades later, Vietnamese independence fighter Ho Chi Minh founds the Communist Party of Vietnam as part of his effort to oust French colonial occupiers. \"Uncle Ho,\" as he was known to his many supporters, was inspired by the Russian Bolsheviks, who oppose the Tsarist autocracy, seeing parallels between that struggle and the fight against the foreign occupiers of his country.\n\n1931: Empire State Building completed\n\n• Date: May 1\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nPresident Herbert Hoover inaugurates the completion of the Empire State Building on May Day. It becomes the tallest building of the iconic Manhattan skyline until the construction of the World Trade Center Towers are completed in 1973. Incredibly, the 86-story office building took only 13 months to build, with construction starting in March of the previous year.\n\n1932: Hitler becomes German\n\n• Date: Feb. 25\n\n• Location: Germany\n\nSeven years after Adolf Hitler renounces his Austrian citizenship, a fellow member of the Nazi Party gets him a low-level government job, which comes with automatic citizenship. This opens the way for him to run for office. Already a well-known party activist, it takes Hitler only two years from receiving his citizenship status to becoming the leader of Germany.\n\n1933: FDR elected\n\n• Date: March 12\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nWith the Great Depression sending millions of Americans to soup kitchens and chasing whatever work they can find, newly elected President Franklin Delano Roosevelt begins his weekly \"Fireside Chats\" as Americans are eager for guidance and solace during those dark times. FDR's first radio talk explains to Americans in plain language why he ordered that banks would close temporarily at different time in different parts of the country. The purpose, he explains, is to curb panic rushes of withdrawals, which has been hurting efforts to stabilize the banking system.\n\n1934: Hitler consolidates power\n\n• Date: June 30\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nGermans, who had been suffering from a disastrous economic depression in 1929-30, begin to embrace the ideas of the Nationalist Socialist Workers Party – the Nazi Party. It becomes the largest party after the 1932 elections. In 1933, Adolf Hitler is appointed chancellor of Germany. After President Paul von Hindenburg dies in 1934, Hitler then purges members of his own party – the bloody Night of the Long Knives – with the help of Nazi storm troopers and becomes the unquestioned leader of Germany.\n\n1935: FDR launches New Deal\n\n• Date: Aug. 14\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nPresident Roosevelt, grappling with the Great Depression, signs into law his signature Social Security Act, a law that creates the country's first retirement security system. Earlier that year, as part of his \"New Deal\" policy, the president established the Works Progress Administration, a massive economic stimulus program, putting millions of Americans to work building the country's public infrastructure.\n\n1936: Owens flouts Nazis\n\n• Date: Aug. 3\n\n• Location: Berlin\n\nAs the concept of racial purity and superiority dominates Germany in the 1930s, African-American sprinter Jesse Owens of Oakville, Alabama, shows them who is the master racer. During the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and under the gaze of Adolf Hitler, Owens wins four Olympic gold medals for the 100-meter and 200-meter sprints, the long jump, and the 100-meter relay.\n\nFrom Alaska to Florida:States with the biggest and smallest governments\n\n1937: UAW changes car industry\n\n• Date: Feb. 11\n\n• Location: Flint, Michigan\n\nNearly two years after the establishment of the United Automobile Workers (UAW), the union scores a major victory in Flint, Michigan. Workers at the General Motors Fisher Body Plant Number One lay down their tools and occupy the factory, demanding union representation, a fair minimum wage, safer working conditions, and not to outsource labor to non-union plants. Despite efforts by GM and local police to extricate them from the plant, including shutting off the heat, cutting off food supply, and attacks that leave 16 workers and 11 police officers injured, the strike lasts 44 days. The strike leads to an agreement between GM and the UAW, which includes a 5% pay raise and permission to talk in the lunchroom.\n\n1938: Anti-Semitism surges\n\n• Date: Nov. 9\n\n• Location: Germany, Austria, Sudetenland\n\nGrowing anti-Semitic scapegoating amid Germany's crippling economic conditions culminates in the Kristallnacht, or \"Night of Broken Glass,\" a pogrom sparked by a speech from German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Storm troopers and other Nazi groups are ordered to attack and destroy Jewish businesses, homes and houses of worship. In one night of attacks in Germany, Austria and the German-speaking area of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, dozens of Jews are killed and tens of thousands are rounded up and sent to concentration camps.\n\n1939: World War II starts\n\n• Date: Sept. 1\n\n• Location: Westerplatte, Poland\n\nUnder the cover of predawn darkness, a German battleship floats quietly into the center of Danzig Harbor and opens fire on a Polish stronghold in Westerplatte, the first shots of World War II. In the following weeks, Nazi forces, including 2,000 tanks and 1,000 aircraft, would shatter Polish defenses and surround Warsaw, which surrenders 26 days after the Danzig Harbor attack.\n\n1940: McDonald's founded\n\n• Date: May 15\n\n• Location: San Bernardino, California\n\nBrothers Richard and Maurice McDonald open McDonald's Barbecue Restaurant, offering BBQ ribs, pork sandwiches and 23 other menu items. Eight years later, they would restructure their popular local business to focus on hamburgers, milkshakes and fountain sodas, emphasizing speed, a simple menu and low prices. In the 1950s, businessman Ray Kroc would buy out the brothers and grow McDonald's into what it is today – the world's largest restaurant chain.\n\n1941: Attack on Pearl Harbor\n\n• Date: Dec. 7\n\n• Location: Oahu, Hawaii\n\nKnowing the U.S. is gearing up to engage them in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II, Japan deploys a massive air attack on U.S. Navy ships parked at Pearl Harbor. The surprise assault by 353 Japanese aircraft leads to the deaths of 2,403 people, including 1,177 sailors aboard the ill-fated USS Arizona, one of 19 vessels that were damaged or destroyed in the attack. Nearly 330 aircraft were also damaged or destroyed.

Among the reasons cited for the drop are rising tensions in the Persian Gulf, concern over higher interest rates and the belief that the bull market is ending. Computerized trading, relatively new at the time, accelerates trade orders, which speeds up the market drop. As a result of the collapse, exchanges put in place so-called circuit breakers intended to halt trading when stocks fall too fast. This measure is designed to provide investors a cooling off period and avoid a panic.\n\nThe 50 hottest cities in America:Phoenix tops the list\n\n1988: When the U.S. armed Iran\n\n• Date: March 16\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nLt.

Bush enact the Homeland Security Act, the biggest government reorganization of national security efforts since the Department of Defense was created in 1947. The sweeping legislation creates the massive Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for everything from protecting infrastructure from cyberattacks to managing the new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.\n\n2003: U.S. crushes Iraq\n\n• Date: March 19\n\n• Location: Iraq\n\nWith the help of British and other allied forces, the United States begins its invasion of Iraq with a rapid bombing \"Shock and Awe\" campaign with the intention of destroying Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction; the weapons are never found. Coalition forces manage to quickly topple the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein, but have to fight insurgent forces for years afterward.\n\n2004: Facebook founded\n\n• Date: Feb. 4\n\n• Location: Cambridge, Massachusetts\n\nMark Zuckerberg, a 23-year-old Harvard University student, creates \"The facebook,\" a local social networking site named after the orientation materials that profiles students and faculty and given to incoming college freshmen. Fourteen years later, Facebook has become a $510 billion digital advertising behemoth so integral to many people's lives that it has been criticized for helping foreign powers and propagandists influence the U.S. political system.\n\n2005: Katrina overwhelms New Orleans\n\n• Date: Aug. 29\n\n• Location: U.S. Gulf Coast\n\nAfter spending four days in the Gulf of Mexico bulking up to a Category 5 hurricane, Katrina slams into New Orleans, inundating the city and creating a humanitarian crisis that lasts for weeks. The catastrophe underscores the precarious situation not only in the Big Easy but also the surrounding area of the Gulf Coast. At least 1,833 people in the storm's path are killed, and the storm inflicts $161 billion in damages to the region, the costliest storm in U.S. history.\n\n2006: Hussein executed\n\n• Date: Dec. 30\n\n• Location: Baghdad\n\nThree years after U.S. soldiers pulled him from a hole in the ground where he had been hiding, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein is hanged after he was convicted for crimes against humanity, specifically for ordering the massacre of 148 Shiites in 1982 following a failed assassination attempt against him.\n\n2007: The iPhone\n\n• Date: Jan. 9\n\n• Location: San Francisco\n\nApple CEO Steve Jobs, who died in October 2011, first shows the world one of the most popular branded consumer electronic devices in history, the iPhone. Since the first-generation phone that Jobs introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show that year, there have been 18 versions of the mobile device, and more than 1.2 billion units have been sold globally through 2017. Only Samsung's Galaxy smartphone comes close to that volume.\n\n2008: Dow plunges\n\n• Date: Sept. 29\n\n• Location: New York City\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average records the largest-ever intraday drop, 777.68 points, after Congress rejects a massive $700 billion bailout of U.S. banks. The bill would pass days later. The market reacts also to months of global market turmoil amid the 2008 global financial crisis spurred by the U.S. subprime mortgage market crash. The Dow fell by more than half during the 2007-09 Great Recession, tumbling from 14,164 on Oct. 9, 2007, to 6,594 on March 5, 2009.\n\n2009: America's first African-American president\n\n• Date: Jan. 20\n\n• Location: Washington, D.C.\n\nAfter winning in a landslide against Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, amassing in 365 electoral votes and 53% of the popular vote, Barack Obama is sworn in as the first African-American president of the United States.

Hurricane Maria inflicts immense damage to the U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which was already struggling from economic insolvency.\n\nDetailed findings & methodology\n\nThere is little doubt that in the last 100 years, mankind has progressed dramatically. People live longer, eat better, have greater access to improved medical care and are freer to express their opinions and associate with whomever they want.\n\nThat optimism can be seen in population growth. Despite the two most devastating wars in human history, the world population has nearly tripled, from 1.9 billion to 7.5 billion, since 1917.\n\nOne hundred years is an eye blink in history, yet 100 years ago, women did not have the right to vote in the United States. African-Americans were prevented from voting in the American South. Labor unions were in their infancy and were weak, and laws reforming child labor had yet to be passed by Congress. All that changed because of women’s suffrage, the inexorable march of civil rights and the strengthening labor unions.\n\nOne hundred years ago, a person anywhere in the world was more likely than not to be illiterate. And there was a good chance he or she was the subject of colonial rulers in South America, Africa and Asia. Two world wars would spell the end of imperial houses in Austria-Hungary, Germany and Russia, and weaken the grip of another, Great Britain. Independence movements sprouted in Europe, Africa and Asia, yearning for freedom and expressing national pride.\n\nNationalism had its dark side, though, with fascist governments ruling Italy and Germany. It would take a world war to remove their scourge. Another form of totalitarianism, communism, would dominate the USSR and Eastern Europe for several generations, as well as China and other countries in Asia, before the West would triumph over the Soviet Union and its allies in the Cold War.\n\nSpeaking of the Cold War, that conflict launched the space race and accelerated technological progress, hastening the use of personal computers and cell phones. These inventions have fundamentally changed our lives – from the way we communicate to the way we shop and socialize – and made billions of dollars for the companies that make them and their founders. These products and innovations are a major part of the culture today.\n\nTo determine the most important event the year you were born, 24/7 Wall St. drew on research materials and media sources to compile its list.

Ruling in a lawsuit filed on behalf of voters with health problems that make them more susceptible to getting sick from the new coronavirus, U.S. District Judge Abdul K. Kallon said that being forced to follow some provisions during the general election could wrongly endanger their lives. Voters 65 and older with health problems shouldn’t be required to have a notary or two witnesses sign ballot affidavits or to submit a copy of a photo identification, Kallon wrote. Also, counties that wish to allow “curbside voting” should be allowed to do so for those who need it, he ruled. Otherwise, Kallon wrote, voters face the “impossible choice” of jeopardizing their health or not voting.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state court judge plans to decide Monday whether to block enforcement of witness requirements for absentee ballots. Superior Court Judge Dani Crosby heard arguments Thursday in the case brought by Arctic Village Council, a tribal government; the League of Women Voters of Alaska; and two individuals who have cited health concerns amid the COVID-19 pandemic. An attorney for the state, Lael Harrison, argued a change in requirements so close to the Nov. 3 general election could cause voter confusion. She also said the Division of Elections is concerned about its credibility with voters. “They’re concerned about voters saying to themselves, ‘How do we know they won’t change it back again later without telling us? How do we know they won’t change something else at the last minute?’ ” she said.\n\nArizona\n\nLake Havasu City: Hospital officials and the state’s schools chief on Wednesday urged local governments not to lift their mask mandates, warning that moving too quickly could reverse the state’s progress in tamping down COVID-19. Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman said schools play a critical role for children and families, and the state can’t ease up on efforts to control the coronavirus outbreak. “Our school communities are depending on continued steps to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in our state,” Hoffman, a Democrat, said in a statement. The Health System Alliance of Arizona, which represents most of the state’s big hospital chains, also warned in a statement Wednesday that eliminating mask mandates risks burdening the health care system.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Wednesday reported 19 more people have died from the illness caused by the coronavirus. The Department of Health reported the total number of fatalities from COVID-19 now totals 1,369. That number includes confirmed and probable cases. The Arkansas Department of Corrections on Wednesday reported its second employee death from COVID-19. A department spokeswoman said Don Rigney, an education and program manager at the Riverside Vocational Technical School at the Ouachita River Unit, died Friday at a Hot Springs hospital. Forty-two inmates have died since the pandemic began. The state’s confirmed cases increased by 607 to 80,610. The state’s probable cases increased by 335 to 3,087. The number of people hospitalized remained unchanged at 490. Arkansas ranks seventh in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill late Wednesday that would have guaranteed most laid-off hospitality workers would be first in line to get their jobs back once those industries begin rehiring. When Newsom ordered people to stay home because of the coronavirus, California’s airports, hotels, event centers and janitorial services had to lay off many of their low-wage, mostly Latino, workers. The Legislature passed a bill at the end of August that would have required the companies to offer those workers their jobs back once they begin rehiring. “I recognize the real problem this bill is trying to fix,” Newsom said in his veto message. But he said the bill is written so broadly that it would apply “during any state of emergency for all layoffs, including those that may be unrelated to such emergency.” Moreover, he wrote, the requirements “place too onerous a burden on employers” who also have been hard-hit.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: A federal judge denied a request to override the state’s 175-person limit on religious gatherings as a result of the pandemic. U.S. District Judge Christine Arguello wrote in her decision that allowing those gatherings would “present a high risk of harm to the state of Colorado as well as the public in general.” The request filed by Andrew Wommack Ministries attempted to obtain a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to override state coronavirus regulations. Liberty Counsel, a conservative advocacy group, is appealing the ruling. The decision was announced a week before the ministry’s planned Pastor’s Conference, scheduled to begin Monday. The event draws pastors and ministers from throughout the country and is required attendance for more than 600 students at Charis Bible College. State public health officials linked a spike in coronavirus cases to a Bible conference run by Andrew Wommack over the summer.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBozrah: About 1,000 people who rely on food from the Meals on Wheels program won’t get new deliveries for the next two weeks because of precautions being taken after a worker was exposed to the coronavirus. The Thames Valley Council for Community Action said it has closed a warehouse through Oct. 13 because a staff member was exposed to someone who had tested positive for COVID-19. The organization says it is asking homebound customers in New London and Windham counties to use prepackaged meals that were provided as backup in the spring with instructions to save them in case deliveries had to be stopped during the pandemic. Each customer was given 14 nonperishable meals in April, Dawn Cwynar, an executive assistant with the nonprofit, told the Norwich Bulletin. Those who have already consumed their emergency stockpile will receive boxes of shelf-stable meals, which were kept in stock in case of emergency.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state’s Pandemic Resurgence Advisory Committee released a report Thursday on steps Delaware needs to take to prepare for a potential second wave of COVID-19 as well as lessons learned from the past six months. The committee, with representatives from the public and private sectors, made recommendations like increased testing for Black and Latino communities, ensuring health care providers and hospitals have enough personal protective equipment, deploying short-term financial support programs for disproportionately affected businesses, and extending funding for emergency sheltering, such as hotels. The report also noted how nursing homes, poultry plants and restaurants were affected by the pandemic. It said one poultry plant experienced a positive rate of 30% at one point during the pandemic. Some of the plants, the committee found, had difficulty implementing social distancing and COVID-19 guidelines.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Some District of Columbia Public Schools students will soon have the opportunity to see their classmates in person again, WUSA-TV reports. The district is allowing 13 schools to set up “student support centers,” which will involve in-person programming for small groups of students. “School, as we know, is a place of hope,” Tyler Elementary School Principal Jasmine Brann said. “It’s a wonderful beacon of light in a community, so we’re eager to welcome our students back to their school, to their playground.” During her situational update Monday, Mayor Muriel Bowser said the programs are designed to supplement distance learning and range from tutoring to social-emotional support and outdoor engagement activities.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Faced with a state ultimatum, the Miami-Dade school board agreed unanimously to reopen schools for classroom instruction next week despite looming fears that they’re unprepared to prevent another spike in coronavirus infections. It was either share classroom air again or lose millions in state funding by scratching a reopening plan approved by Florida Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran. He ordered the board in a letter last week to follow through on Monday and said the state would allow only case-by-case exceptions for certain schools. Corcoran’s letter objected to a previous board decision to postpone classroom instruction, perhaps until late October, so that more safety measures could be implemented and personal protective equipment obtained for teachers and staff. Miami-Dade has both the largest school district in Florida and the state’s worst coronavirus caseload.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The governor extended his emergency rules regarding COVID-19 again Wednesday as the state surpassed 7,000 deaths from the respiratory illness. Gov. Brian Kemp extended the underlying state of emergency that allows him to issue other orders, which had been set to expire Oct. 10, until Nov. 9. The Republican pushed back the expiration of a series of rules and guidelines related to the pandemic from Oct. 1 until Oct. 15. Georgia has recorded more than 318,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus overall. The state’s seven-day average of new cases has fallen below 1,200 a day, a level equal to where it was in late June but still above the lowest point in late May. Georgia has ranked 24th in the country for new cases per capita in the past two weeks, down from a point during the summer when it was worst nationwide for that measure.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A nursing home is trying to contain a COVID-19 outbreak involving 21 residents and six staff members, officials said. The state Department of Health is investigating the cases at the Liliha Healthcare Center in Honolulu, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. An employee tested positive Sept. 16, and the home tested all residents and staff two days later. Positive results were reported Sept. 20. The infected residents are isolated at the 92-bed nursing home, which is testing staff and residents every Friday and checking for symptoms twice daily. Officials said 17 residents who tested negative were transferred to Wahiawa General Hospital for further testing and monitoring. Liliha Healthcare Center said it is taking “precautionary measures” to contain the virus including routine sanitization, employee screenings, and temperature and oxygen-level monitoring among residents.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will remain in the fourth and final stage of reopening the economy during the coronavirus pandemic for at least another two weeks, Gov. Brad Little said Thursday. The Republican governor also said Idaho will receive 530,000 rapid antigen tests that will be prioritized for schools. Officials said the tests take 15 minutes, are 95% accurate and use a less invasive nasal swab. Little said infections and hospitalizations are too high to move out of the fourth stage, which allows all businesses to open as well as gatherings of more than 50 people as long as distancing of 6 feet and other precautions are taken. Little also announced the formation of the Idaho COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Committee in anticipation of a vaccine that would be distributed by the federal government. An initial vaccine supply will likely be limited and in Idaho will likely first go to health care workers.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration, which has been criticized for refusing to backtrack on its decision to postpone high school fall sports such as football and volleyball, delivered some tough news Wednesday with restrictions on Halloween festivities. Instead of trick-or-treating this year, parents could arrange outdoor gatherings where kids and a parent wearing face masks could pick out candy that is spread out on tables, suggested the state’s public health director, Dr. Ngoze Ezike. “For anyone wearing a costume, whether a child or an adult, a costume mask is not a substitute for face coverings,” Ezike said. “If face coverings are worn under the costume mask, please ensure that this does not create any breathing problems. And if it does, don’t discard your face covering. Put the costume mask aside.” The state’s rules forbid haunted houses but allow for hayrides and visits to pumpkin patches and orchards, with proper social distancing.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State officials released to the public a new online tool Wednesday designed to help track coronavirus cases in schools. Health officials said the dashboard will reflect the new and cumulative numbers of positive COVID-19 cases among students, teachers and other workers in a given school. An early look at the data during Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb’s weekly coronavirus briefing Wednesday afternoon reflected at least 2,354 positive COVID-19 cases in schools around the state since the new school year started this fall. Data will be updated each week. Schools reporting fewer than five positive cases will have their data suppressed to protect privacy. The tracker’s release follows concerns from health experts about sharp increases in COVID-19 cases among Indiana’s younger population groups.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The city’s school board approved a plan Wednesday night to return to in-classroom learning, but it included metrics for allowable coronavirus infection rates that the district doesn’t currently meet, making it unclear if students will actually return to school as planned. The board voted 6-1 to gradually implement a hybrid learning plan, starting with prekindergarten on Oct. 12 and ending with high school students Nov. 10. Students can choose to remain in all-remote learning or opt for 50% instruction in classrooms with the remainder online. Des Moines is the only district in Iowa that hadn’t approved a plan that met Gov. Kim Reynolds’ demand that school districts hold at least half of their classes in-person. The state Department of Education had planned to begin a process that could find the district out of compliance with state law.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The top public health official in the state said Wednesday that Kansas has yet to see its biggest wave of coronavirus cases, suggesting the pandemic could spawn an average of 800 or even 900 new cases a day in coming months. Dr. Lee Norman, the head of the state Department of Health and Environment, said Kansas is likely to surpass the record numbers of new confirmed and probable cases it has recently seen. The state had an average of 646 new cases a day for the seven days ending Wednesday, second only to the 667 cases per day for the seven days ending Monday. While the state’s most populous counties have continued to generate hundreds of new cases every week, rural areas also have been seeing spikes. And health department data released Wednesday showed that outbreaks have returned to the state’s prison system.\n\nKentucky\n\nPaducah: The National Quilt Museum is now offering online subscriptions. Quilt Museum Digital was launched Tuesday as a way to reach quilting and fiber art enthusiasts around the world, museum CEO Frank Bennett told The Paducah Sun. Bennett said he felt the move was necessary given the continuing safety protocols due to the coronavirus pandemic. The museum in Paducah is getting only about 40% of its normal visitors, he said. “Museums have really had to pivot their model, and a lot of them have gone to different variations of digital formats, offering things online that they haven’t done before to keep people engaged, and, of course, we all need more revenue, as well,” he said. The subscription-based service starts out at $8 a month and includes videos of new exhibits as well as supplemental and exclusive materials, such as interviews with artists and curators.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: House Republican lawmakers outlined their grievances Wednesday about the state’s handling of the COVID-19 outbreak, saying Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards’ regulations are too strict, even as public health experts warned of another expected coronavirus spike in flu season. Legislators across two hearings complained about crowd limits on football games, mask requirements for cheerleaders and dance teams, restrictions on churches, closures of bars, constraints on nursing home visitation, and different treatment of bars, restaurants and casinos. “People are telling me they feel like their rights are being violated, that we are overreaching government,” said Rep. Jack McFarland, a Winnfield Republican. The criticism came in a special session that GOP lawmakers convened in part to consider rolling back some of Edwards’ rules and curbing the Louisiana governor’s sole authority to issue executive orders during disasters.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s largest farm trade show will be a virtual event next year as the agricultural sector continues to adapt to the coronavirus pandemic. The Maine Agricultural Trades Show will be held online in January 2021, the state’s Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry said in a statement. The department organizes the event, and department officials said the ability to gather in person “is still likely to be limited to a level that is much lower than the number of people who would regularly attend” the show. The trade show has taken place since 1941 and typically includes more than 100 exhibitors and dozens of conference sessions. It also serves as a networking and planning event for the state’s farmers, who use the show to get ready for the coming season.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state has reported zero deaths from the coronavirus in a 24-hour period for the first time since March 28. The state said Thursday morning that there had been no deaths reported in the past day. That doesn’t necessarily mean that no COVID-19 deaths occurred in that time frame, as some deaths are not immediately reported due to a time lag in the submission of a death certificate. Still, Gov. Larry Hogan said it’s an “encouraging milestone” and a tribute to the efforts of health care workers. Maryland has reported a total of 3,805 deaths from the coronavirus so far. Officials reported that there have been 125,510 coronavirus cases confirmed in the state as of Thursday. That was an increase of 785 cases in 24 hours.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city and nine other communities in Massachusetts are now considered to be at “high risk” for the coronavirus, a state designation that will delay the next phase of reopening. In all, 23 cities and towns are now in the “high-risk” category after their infection rates reached 8 or more cases per 100,000 residents. Besides Boston, the other communities newly designated as high risk are Attleboro, Avon, Dracut, Haverhill, Lowell, Lynnfield, Methuen, Middleton, North Andover and Springfield. The label means those cities and towns won’t be allowed to move to the next stage of reopening Monday. Gyms, museums and libraries will remain limited to 40% of capacity, and indoor performance venues will stay closed, among other restrictions. Attleboro Mayor Paul Heroux said Thursday that 11 members of the city’s fire department had tested positive for COVID-19, and one was hospitalized in serious condition.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer revised rules related to the care of nursing home residents with the coronavirus, saying they should be sent to facilities with solid federal staffing ratings. Currently, infected residents from homes without a dedicated COVID-19 unit go to one of 21 state-designated “hub” nursing homes when they leave the hospital or when they need a higher level of care but not hospitalization. Under an order issued late Wednesday, they instead will be transferred to “care and recovery” centers that will replace the hub network. A hub home can be a care and recovery facility but only if it meets certain standards. The facility has to have a staffing rating of at least three out of five stars, for instance, and cannot have an abuse or neglect citation. Whitmer did not, as Republican lawmakers have suggested, establish COVID-only facilities or buildings. She also lifted an outright ban on communal dining.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A federal judge on Wednesday rejected a challenge by Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jason Lewis to the state’s coronavirus restrictions, turning aside the former congressman’s arguments that the rules unconstitutionally limit his freedom to campaign. U.S. District Judge Donovan Frank ruled that Democratic Gov. Tim Walz acted within his authority to respond to the public health crisis when he imposed restrictions on crowd sizes, travel and other measures meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected over 99,000 Minnesotans and killed more than 2,000. Some of those restrictions already have been relaxed or rescinded, the judge noted. Lewis, a conservative former talk radio host who served one term in the U.S. House before losing in 2018, has been campaigning against the state’s coronavirus restrictions since the early days of the pandemic. He said he plans to appeal and make the ruling an issue in the race.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves ended a statewide mask mandate Wednesday but said he will still require people to wear face coverings in schools to curb the spread of the coronavirus. “We should not use the heavy hand of government more than it is justified,” Reeves said at a news conference. Mississippi’s mask mandate has been in place since Aug. 4. Reeves, a Republican, has chosen to extend the mandate several times since then. However, on Wednesday, he said the declining number of confirmed virus cases and hospitalizations are positive developments that call for the lifting of some restrictions. In addition to schools, people will still be required to wear face coverings while receiving “close contact personal care services” in such places as salons, barbershops and spas.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The American Civil Liberties Union on Wednesday filed a federal lawsuit against a Missouri court order allowing some Kansas City-area evictions to continue during the coronavirus pandemic. Jackson County Circuit Court Presiding Judge David Byrn issued a Sept. 3 order banning evictions as long as tenants give landlords a declaration that they’re struggling to pay rent because of the pandemic. But the order still allows evictions if landlords don’t receive that notice from tenants or if the eviction is based on tenants breaking the law, damaging property or violating a contract. Attorneys for the ACLU argue the Missouri court order goes against a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention temporary ban on evictions intended to help with social distancing and make it easier for sick or at-risk communities to self-isolate.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock urged local officials where coronavirus cases are surging to consider stricter measures including shutting down bars in some hot spots to halt the virus’s spread. But he stopped short Wednesday of any new statewide restrictions, as the state’s COVID-19 caseload continues to grow dramatically. Health officials reported 348 new COVID-19 cases Wednesday, marking a new daily record for the third time in the past week. Montana has surpassed 13,000 known cases, 180 people have died, and 170 people are hospitalized. The governor said during a Wednesday news conference that six of the state’s 56 counties account for 65% of new reported cases: Yellowstone, Roosevelt, Missoula, Flathead, Cascade and Gallatin. Bullock said the increase “should cause us all some alarm.” He urged Montanans to follow guidelines and rules already in place.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Officials are defending the state’s $27 million contract with a Utah company to provide coronavirus testing services that some lawmakers have questioned because it was hastily arranged without taking bids. In early April, state labs were running short on testing supplies at the same time all states were trying to significantly increase testing for the virus, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. Doug Carlson, with the state’s Department of Administrative Services, told Nebraska lawmakers Monday that the state was having trouble finding testing supplies from either federal agencies or private vendors until Nomi Health offered to step in. Lawmakers approved a resolution that Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha introduced calling for a study of the Test Nebraska program to determine what changes, if any, might be needed before the contract could be renewed next year.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A day after Gov. Steve Sisolak authorized relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings statewide, Washoe County health officials urged local leaders Wednesday to postpone any changes because of a dramatic spike in new daily cases in Reno-Sparks the past two weeks. Sisolak announced Tuesday night that he was lifting a mandatory 50-person cap on public and private gatherings statewide. As he has with previous directives, the Democratic governor said local governments are free to adopt stricter rules. Washoe County Health District Officer Kevin Dick said Wednesday he’s recommending to city and county managers that they stick with the current cap. “We have almost doubled the number of new cases that are occurring over two weeks,” Dick said. The daily average of about 106 new cases over a 14-day stretch is a record for the county – an 88% increase compared to two weeks ago, he said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A total of $557,000 is going to the New Hampshire Community Loan Fund to support small businesses and promote economic growth in communities amid the pandemic, the state’s congressional delegation said Tuesday. “As the economic fallout spurred by this pandemic worsens, it is essential that New Hampshire businesses have the support they need to survive this crisis,” U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, said in a statement. U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, said the fund “is providing critical financial support to communities in need, including to support affordable housing.” The award was allocated by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which enables organizations like the New Hampshire Community Loan Fund to increase lending and investment activity in low-income and economically distressed communities.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHackensack: One of the first two jury trials in the state since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has been suspended over concerns about the virtual jury selection plan put in place over the summer. The trial in Bergen County was to begin this week, but defense lawyers argued that the jury selection process implemented by the state unfairly excludes minority and older jurors. On Wednesday, an appeals court suspended the trial, and it’s expected to hear arguments this month. As part of a plan to resume jury trials on a limited basis – and reduce a backlog of thousands of cases that had piled up – the state Supreme Court released a plan in August that provided for jury selection to be conducted mostly online. In the Bergen County case, involving a Filipino defendant, the jury was predominantly white, said Matthew Adams, vice president of the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: New Mexico State University has announced that classes will be entirely online after the Thanksgiving break and that the college’s fall commencement will not be held in person because of coronavirus restrictions. University President John Floros said Wednesday that the university surveyed students, faculty and staff at the Las Cruces campus to gauge their opinions on returning following the break. The university received more than 6,600 responses, with more than 70% of faculty and staff and 60% of students favoring online-only courses beginning Nov. 30, Floros said. Classes that are currently online are not expected to change. There will be two weeks left in the fall semester after the holiday, and the campus will remain open to provide housing, dining and other services, officials said. Floros said the university plans to return to in-person classes for the spring semester.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Schools across the state have reported that at least 1,200 students, teachers and staff have tested positive for the coronavirus since the start of the academic year, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday, though that number is almost certain to be an undercount. As of Tuesday, 693 public and private schools across the state had reported at least one infection since classes began to resume in early September. Schools reported more than 700 students and 400 school staff had tested positive for the virus. No information was available on whether the sick students had any opportunity to infect other members of their school community or whether they had even returned to in-person learning before they tested positive. State officials noted that the count, made public by the state through its online COVID-19 Report Card for schools, doesn’t capture the full extent of infections among either schoolchildren or teachers.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper announced Wednesday that bars, amusement parks and movie theaters can partially reopen starting Friday under a new Phase 3 order. The updated executive order that will remain in effect through Oct. 23 also allows fans to attend outdoor sporting events. Venues with more than 10,000 seats can operate at 7% capacity, while those with 10,000 or fewer people can open to 100 people or operate at 30% capacity, whichever is less. But the increased reopening comes with restrictions on businesses as the state’s coronavirus case numbers have held steady but at higher-than-desired levels. Mandy Cohen, the state’s top public health official, warned that the state’s progress in dealing with COVID-19 is “fragile.” Cooper acknowledged the concerns and pleaded with North Carolinians to comply with the state’s mask mandate and other safety measures.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Sanford Health opened a new unit at its Bismarck hospital Wednesday, adding 14 more beds. Sanford said it’s not exclusively for coronavirus patients, but it could be used to treat them if the need arises. Six of the 14 beds in the new unit opening Wednesday are designated for intensive care patients. The expansion at Sanford Bismarck gives the hospital 242 beds. The new unit is on the main floor, where the adult physical, occupational and speech therapies were located, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Sanford Health and CHI St. Alexius employees listed concerns about hospital capacity at the Burleigh-Morton COVID-19 Task Force meeting last week. There have been nearly 678 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota over the past two weeks, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: An aid package is coming soon for small businesses and people struggling to pay rent during the coronavirus pandemic, according to Ohio’s GOP Senate finance chairman. Lawmakers and Gov. Mike DeWine are figuring out the best way to provide the money – from federal pandemic relief funds – as quickly as possible, Senator Matt Dolan, a Republican from Chagrin Falls, said Wednesday. The governor and lawmakers are jointly working on a plan that would also provide assistance for companies experiencing difficulty making mortgage payments. Given the importance of the issue, moving the money through the state Controlling Board is one option, said Dan Tierney, a DeWine spokesman. The bipartisan panel approves larger state spending measures. The aid comes as unemployment claims have ticked upward in recent days after weeks of declines from their record highs at the start of the pandemic.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The City Council has voted to expand and extend a requirement that masks be worn in public when social distancing is not possible in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The council voted Wednesday to lower the age of those who must wear a mask from 18 to those 10 and older and to extend the mandate that was to expire Nov. 30 until Jan. 31. Oklahoma City has a similar mask mandate for those 11 and older that is to expire Oct. 20. Both cities allow exceptions such as bar and restaurant patrons who are eating or drinking and those taking part in athletic events. Oklahoma remains among the worst states in the U.S. for positive coronavirus tests per 100,000 people and the number of new reported cases, according to a report released this week by the White House Coronavirus Task Force.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: COVID-19 infections in the state rose 32% last week, when 1,999 new cases were reported, according to the Oregon Health Authority. The percentage of positive tests remained at 6.2%. The number of tests administered the week of Sept. 21-27 rose to 24,243. Meanwhile, a lot of unemployed people in the state got big checks Wednesday, with many more still stuck in bureaucracy. The Oregon Employment Department made payments through the Lost Wages Assistance program, paying out an additional $300 weekly payment for the five weeks between July 26 and Sept. 5, officials said Wednesday. Acting department director David Gerstenfeld said $225 million was paid out to more than 48,000 people on a single day. But the department performed a tally of those whose unemployment claims were still in adjudication and found 49,000 people in Oregon were still waiting in that status as of Sept. 23.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A Republican lawmaker’s positive test for COVID-19 on Thursday prompted legislative leaders to immediately cancel the day’s state House voting session, and human resources workers were deployed to trace his personal contacts to see if others should be quarantined. Rep. Paul Schemel, R-Franklin, issued a statement saying he began to feel sick Wednesday and got the positive test result Thursday. He then notified House officials. He was most recently in the Capitol on Tuesday. Although state House employees are all required to wear masks in the Capitol, that does not apply to the representatives themselves. Schemel’s press release did not say if he had been wearing a mask while inside the Capitol’s public spaces. A significant number of House Republicans have continued to be maskless inside the Capitol, and some have defiantly ridiculed mask-wearing as an overreaction or ineffective.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: More than 100 students at Johnson & Wales University have been quarantined after 31 people who attend the school’s Providence campus tested positive for COVID-19. University officials announced the quarantine measures Wednesday evening, adding that the students who tested positive all lived in off-campus housing and are experiencing mild symptoms. Other COVID-19 clusters have been reported at Providence College and the University of Rhode Island, where students have gathered in groups off-campus. Gov. Gina Raimondo said Wednesday that irresponsible behavior by young people is a leading factor in a recent increase in infections. Officials said 170 people had tested positive earlier this week in the highest single-day number since last spring.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Several parties and large gatherings coinciding with the University of South Carolina’s football game had to be broken up Saturday, as people celebrated the first game of the season, police said. Columbia Police told The State newspaper Wednesday that three social distancing citations and four warnings were issued to residences that house some USC students. Police said the largest gathering was at an apartment complex near the Gamecocks’ Williams-Brice stadium, where about 300 people got together after the game. Another citation was issued to a residence in the Five Points area, where about 100 people gathered before kickoff. Columbia police spokeswoman Jennifer Timmons said property owners were also cited for the social distancing violation. Each violation was a 10-point infraction, and if a property accumulates 15 points in a one-year span, property owners could get their rental permits revoked, according to city records.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State lawmakers on Wednesday worked to finalize their plan on how to spend more than $1 billion in federal coronavirus relief funds ahead of a special legislative session tentatively scheduled for next week. Lawmakers have been holding public input sessions in recent weeks as they discuss the best way to address the health and economic crises caused by the pandemic. But as the state looks to spend the bulk of the $1.25 billion in federal funds it received in the spring, Gov. Kristi Noem and some lawmakers have tussled over spending the money. Noem’s office has maintained that the governor has the authority to spend federal funds without a vote from the Legislature. Her office has described the special session as a way for lawmakers to offer input into how the money is used. Noem has announced that she intends to call the Legislature to convene Monday.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A manufacturer of N95 respirator masks plans to set up a $25 million facility in Middle Tennessee that is expected to create 220 jobs over the next three years. The state Department of Economic and Community Development says Moldex-Metric Inc. is creating its first manufacturing center in Tennessee by retrofitting an existing building in Lebanon. Moldex also plans to build a distribution center on the 21-acre site in Wilson County. State officials say the company with headquarters in Culver City, California, is expanding to meet a surge in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Moldex has been manufacturing respirators and hearing protection products for almost four decades.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The number of newly reported cases of the coronavirus in Texas took a jump Wednesday as state health officials reported 5,335 new cases, 40% more than the 3,812 cases reported Tuesday. That raised the total Texas caseload since the state began coronavirus tracking in March to 748,767. Of those, 69,767 cases were active, and 3,344 patients were hospitalized Wednesday, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported. The true number of cases is likely higher, though, because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. The state also reported 107 new deaths from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. That’s a 51% increase from the 71 deaths reported Tuesday. The death toll in Texas now sits at 15,711.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: After Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox criticized the Salt Lake City School District for not mandating in-person learning, the district reaffirmed its commitment to online learning during the pandemic until it is safe. “Many of our students are being left behind – especially those in low-income areas, students with disabilities,” Cox said in a gubernatorial debate Tuesday. “The Salt Lake City School District is the only school district in the state that has not gone back to in-person learning. And that’s a huge mistake. It is damaging our kids, and that needs to change right now.” District spokesperson Yandary Chatwin said that despite Cox’s comments, the district will continue with remote, online learning in order to keep faculty, staff, students and their families safe from the coronavirus. Interim Superintendent Larry Madde said state leaders have intentionally opted not to release a statewide response, instead deferring to local officials.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: A judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by a gym owner against the state over whether he could operate during the COVID-19 business restrictions this past spring. Vermont’s attorney general had sued Sean Manovill in May for operating Club Fitness in Rutland in violation of state rules. Manovill countersued, saying the state violated the Vermont Constitution with an “unlawful taking” of his business, WCAX-TV reports. A judge on Tuesday ruled that the state, governor and attorney general did not violate Manovill’s constitutional or statutory rights. “This decision is a win for Vermonters and Vermont businesses who have done the right thing and complied with the Governor’s orders,” Attorney General T.J. Donovan said in a statement Wednesday. “The Court’s ruling confirms what Vermonters know and have done: We all have to do our part because we are all in this together.”\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: Efforts by the city to resume jury trials during the COVID-19 pandemic have stalled because most of the people being called to serve aren’t showing up. Roughly 9 out of 10 possible jurors aren’t showing up for court in Norfolk, a jump from the usual no-show rate of about 1 in 3, The Virginian-Pilot reports. On paper, Norfolk began holding jury trials last week, almost exactly six months after the pandemic forced local judges to shut them down. The Norfolk Circuit Court is one of four in Virginia that has won approval from the state Supreme Court to restart jury trials. While four trials were scheduled for last week in Norfolk, none of them actually happened. Defendants in three of the cases set for trial pleaded guilty. In the fourth, the victim who would have testified against the defendant didn’t show. Still, court officials had summoned 120 people for possible jury duty in that case, but only 14 showed up.\n\nWashington\n\nSnoqualmie: At least 25 COVID-19 cases have been reported at the Salish Lodge & Spa, public health officials said Wednesday. The outbreak involves 23 staff and two guests, according to a news release sent by Public Health - Seattle & King County spokeswoman Sharon Bogan. Anyone who visited the popular lodge east of Seattle next to Snoqualmie Falls on Sept. 16-30 should get tested for COVID-19 and monitor for symptoms, the news release said. The lodge was used as the exterior of the Great Northern Hotel in David Lynch’s “Twin Peaks” TV series, and its adjacent waterfall is immortalized in the show’s opening credits. Salish Lodge & Spa is fully cooperating with Public Health to implement recommendations, is facilitating testing for staff and is currently closed, according to health officials. Alan Stephens, general manager of Salish Lodge & Spa, said the entire facility will be sanitized.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Former coal CEO Robert E. Murray, who has fought federal regulations on the industry, has filed an application with the U.S. Department of Labor for black lung benefits, according to a published report. West Virginia Public Broadcasting and Ohio Valley ReSource report the former head of Murray Energy said on the form that he is still board chairman of the company but can no longer serve as president and CEO due to his health. Murray has fought federal mine safety regulations for years. His company filed an unsuccessful lawsuit in 2014 over regulations to cut the amount of coal dust in coal mines to reduce the incidence of black lung disease, saying they were overly burdensome and costly to the industry. In the black lung claim, Murray, 80, says he is heavily dependent on oxygen and is “near death.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Marcus Theatres has temporarily closed 17 of the 72 cinemas it reopened this summer, citing a decline in audience demand and the limited number of new movie releases. The coronavirus pandemic led to the closure of movie theaters across the state in mid-March. The Milwaukee-based Marcus began reopening many of its theaters in August, after test runs at a handful of theaters in June. Theaters Marcus has closed again include those in Appleton, Green Bay, Delafield and Menomonee Falls. Besides the anxiety about heading inside for a movie and the prospect of catching COVID-19, Marcus and other theater operators have grappled with a shortage of new studio releases. Theater owners hoped the thriller “Tenet” would bring people back, but besides that movie there haven’t been many other big movies released.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The University of Wyoming has announced that its wrestling program halted activities after the team confirmed six cases of COVID-19. The university said in a statement that the team won’t engage in any athletic activities and that members are being asked to self-isolate through Oct. 14, including attending classes remotely, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The announcement came a week after the cheer team stopped activities because three of its 40-member squad tested positive for the virus. The school also closed its law school last month to in-person classes after six students also tested positive for COVID-19. University officials reported 113 active confirmed COVID-19 cases among students and employees as of Wednesday. Fourteen cases involved students living on campus. Another 112 people were quarantined for possible exposure.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/06/08/top-workplaces-cincinnati-find-all-130-winners-2022/7281384001/", "title": "Top Workplaces Cincinnati: Find all 130 winners for 2022", "text": "The Enquirer\n\nThe Enquirer invited all 130 Top Workplaces to tell us what makes each of them special.

Did it help?", "text": "DELBARTON, W.Va. – The coal miner’s son had studied his county’s rough-and-tumble labor history, written his dissertation on it, taught his high school students about it.\n\nNow Eric Starr, who knew history never repeats itself, felt history doing just that. And he was part of it.\n\nStanding at a secret meeting like those held by striking miners a century ago, dressed in black except for a red bandana like the ones those miners wore, he exhorted his fellow public school teachers to defy the governor and their own unions and stay out on strike.\n\n“I’m not going back,’’ he said. “We’ve been sold out!’’\n\nThat was last winter. Mingo County teachers – with no legal right to strike, no encouragement from their union and little prospect of victory – became the first in West Virginia to vote to walk out over their health plan and their pay.\n\nThe one-day walkout spread.\n\nOn Feb. 22, 2018, teachers across West Virginia went on strike, sparking a movement that spread to other red states, including Oklahoma and Arizona, and then, this year, to Los Angeles and Denver. On Thursday, teachers plan to strike in Oakland, California.\n\nBut the 2018 West Virginia teacher strike, which changed so much nationally, didn’t change that much back where it started. And on Tuesday, West Virginia teachers again staged a walkout – just to maintain the status quo.\n\nStarr sees the irony.\n\n“I love seeing what’s going on elsewhere,’’ he says. He’s 28, in his fourth year of teaching. “But West Virginia can be a slow place to change.’’\n\nWhen the 2018 West Virginia strike ended March 7, it seemed like a great victory for public school teachers, who for years had been blamed widely for the failures of American schools, and for West Virginia schools in particular.\n\nBut history, even when it repeats itself, isn’t that simple. The 2018 strike’s legacy is still in doubt.\n\nThe state’s promise of a dedicated funding source for public employees’ health insurance – the main issue in the strike – remains unfulfilled.\n\nDespite a 5 percent raise, teacher pay remains far behind neighboring states’, a disparity that explains why the year began with 700 classroom vacancies, or 4 percent of the state teacher force.\n\nThe settlement did not increase the number of school specialists, like counselors and nurses, to help students from families scarred by the state’s opioid epidemic.\n\nThe teachers’ vow during the strike to “remember in November’’ produced only mixed results. Republicans, most of whom opposed teacher demands, kept control of both houses in the Legislature. This year they revived proposals that helped prompt the 2018 strike. Teachers and service personnel went on strike again.\n\nThe walkout on Tuesday closed schools in nearly every West Virginia county, and lawmakers sidelined the education legislation teachers were protesting. That's a victory for teachers.\n\nBut, teachers say, they are still waiting for the kinds of policies that would show them respect. Suspicious of the state's GOP leaders, teachers are striking again Wednesday, to ensure lawmakers don't revive the bill in question. Nearly all schools are closed.\n\nTeachers in America:No matter where they work, they feel disrespect\n\n'Any talks of striking'?\n\nIf last year's strike wasn’t revolutionary, it was remarkable.\n\nAt a time when organized labor seems in terminal decline, a national public school teachers’ movement emerged from the coalfields of southern West Virginia, one of the most isolated and conservative corners of America.\n\nAt a time when political partisanship is peaking – and despite the Democratic slant of teachers’ unions – the strike united Clinton and Trump voters. It was a political unicorn: a “liberal” cause advocated by conservatives.\n\nBut it was no anomaly. Children here are raised on stories of battles between miners and mine companies in what came to be known as “Bloody Mingo.’’ Many of the teachers who walked out were first on picket lines when they were in diapers.\n\nYet these old passions might not have been revived without a weapon the miners never enjoyed – social media.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2018, a teacher posted an innocent query on a Facebook page: “Just curious if there are any talks of striking.’’\n\nSoon, there was talk of little else.\n\nPoll:Even when teachers strike, Americans give them high grades. Unions fare worse.\n\nWelcome to the Mountain State\n\nJay O’Neal is a middle school social studies teacher who moved to West Virginia in 2015. After his first year, he realized that because of increasing health insurance costs, he’d take home $450 less than the previous year.\n\nTeachers across the nation lost ground economically during and after the Great Recession, as states slashed education spending. West Virginia, whose signature coal industry has collapsed, ranked 48th in teacher pay before the strike, according to the National Education Association.\n\nYet teaching in West Virginia has gotten harder as students have gotten needier, partly because of the opioid crisis. Many are in a household with neither biological parent, and teachers sometimes must find ways to keep kids fed over the weekend, or get their electricity turned back on. One of O’Neal’s students found his father with a needle sticking out of his arm, dead of an overdose.\n\nO’Neal wasn’t born into West Virginia’s “strike culture.’’ But in October 2017 he started a Facebook group page to unite members of the state’s two main teacher unions, the West Virginia Education Association and the rival West Virginia Federation of Teachers.\n\nHis timing was propitious. The state’s public employee health insurance agency had announced a new round of cost-saving measures. One based premiums for family coverage on the household’s total income, rather than just the teacher’s. Another was a wellness program that would effectively penalize those who didn’t do things like provide personal biometric data, go to the gym or wear an activity tracker like a Fitbit.\n\nThe program was anathema to famously independent-minded West Virginians. What business is it of some bean-counter what my spouse makes? Or what I weigh?\n\nO’Neal heard plenty of grumbling in the teachers’ lounge, but little or nothing in public or on Facebook. His teachers' page had only about 1,000 members. “I don’t get it,’’ he told a friend. “Nothing’s happening.’’\n\nIt was as if \"strike\" was a dirty word. “Everyone was thinking about it,’’ recalls Eric Starr. “Then someone worked up the guts to say it.’’\n\nStrike fever\n\nThat someone was Rachel Kittle, a 32-year-old special education teacher from – no surprise – the coalfields. She didn’t feel gutsy, however. Striking was just what she and her colleagues were already talking about.\n\nShortly after her Jan. 6 post – “any talks of striking?’’ – O’Neal got a message from a friend: “Have you looked at Facebook?’’\n\nTEACHERS' VICTORY: Showed 'power of women'\n\nThere was Kittle’s query, followed by an explosion of comments. The first was dismissive: “The unions are terrified and the teachers are unwilling.’’ But there were other voices:\n\n“Not all teachers.’’\n\n“There will not be an end to the cuts until a line is drawn.’’\n\n“As long as you take it without protesting, they will keep giving it to you.’’\n\n“Teachers went on strike in 1990. How did that get organized?’’\n\nSoon, O’Neal couldn’t keep up with requests to join the group.\n\nStrike fever spiked after Gov. Jim Justice, who’d been elected as a Democrat with union support before becoming a Republican to back Trump, proposed a mere 1 percent raise in his State of the State address.\n\nDale Lee, president of the WVEA union, felt compelled to address the topic at a rally on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Teachers expecting a call to the barricades were disappointed.\n\n“I've heard a lot of people talk about, \"It's time for a walkout; it's time for a strike,' \" Lee said. “It's not the first step in what we should do to achieve our goals.’’\n\nBut this was a battle in which union leaders would be followers.\n\nIt started in the coalfields\n\nOn Jan. 23, Mingo County teachers became the first in the state to decide to skip school for a day to go to the state capital to protest. They called it “Fed Up Friday.’’ Several other southern coalfield counties quickly followed suit.\n\nWithout a right to strike or bargain collectively, the teacher unions had become more practiced at lobbying the state officials who set their members’ compensation than at confronting them. Now, they struggled to catch up with the rank and file. A WVFT official told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that the union didn’t know how many counties had decided to walk out, but was sending staffers to county meetings “to find out what’s going on.’’\n\nOn Fed Up Friday, teachers from the coalfields gathered in the capitol rotunda in Charleston to protest. As they chanted, colleagues around the state watched.\n\nA month later, on Feb. 22, after another one-day walkout and a statewide strike authorization vote, 20,000 teachers went out.\n\nTimeline:How the 2018 West Virginia teacher strike evolved\n\nSchool was closed in all 55 counties. Superintendents, already facing a teacher shortage, didn’t have nearly enough subs to hold classes. The teachers would never lose a day’s pay.\n\nPublic opinion seemed with the teachers. When the attorney general said the strike was illegal and offered to go to court on behalf of county school boards, he got no takers.\n\nFive days into the strike, the governor and the union leaders, who’d been negotiating, announced a settlement, including a 5 percent raise. They told teachers to go back to work two days later, on March 1.\n\nBut the Senate’s Republican leaders had not signed off; the rank and file had not been consulted; and the governor, some teachers pointed out, was a coal-company owner. “We weren’t gonna fall for his word,’’ Kittle recalls. Teachers outside the capitol chanted: “Back to the table!’’ and “We got sold out!’’\n\nAt county meetings like the one in Mingo where Eric Starr spoke up, the rank and file agreed. They weren’t going back – they were going wildcat.\n\nThe strikes spread\n\nMeanwhile, in Arizona, a teacher named Noah Karvelis had started a Facebook page like the one in West Virginia. Most of his colleagues supported a strike in their state, he tweeted, “especially with … WV’s success.’’\n\nHe created a Facebook event that called on Arizona teachers to wear red: “West Virginia is showing the entire nation what happens when teachers stand in solidarity.’’\n\nFinally, West Virginia’s Republican Senate agreed to a 5 percent raise for all state employees. And the governor promised to freeze health insurance premiums for 18 months; to create a task force to find a dedicated source of health insurance funding; and to waive higher costs for workers who didn’t comply with the wellness plan.\n\nOn March 7, after nine canceled school days, the teachers went back to class.\n\nBut teachers in other states started to walk out. On April 2, Oklahoma and some counties in Kentucky; April 26, Arizona; April 27, Colorado. On May 16, North Carolina teachers staged a one-day walkout and rally.\n\nA glass half empty?\n\nA year later, it’s easy to emphasize what the West Virginia teacher strike didn’t do.\n\nThe raise, which averaged about $2,000 per teacher, was hardly life-changing. It let teachers pay off some bills or pay down some loans, or maybe buy a car. But their colleagues continue to flee to higher-paying districts in other states. Mingo High School, for instance, has been trying since May to replace its choir director, who left for a similar job in Ohio that paid $10,000 more. No one has even applied for the vacancy.\n\nAs for health insurance, the governor has proposed $150 million in the state budget to stabilize employees’ costs. But there still has been no agreement on how to insulate such funding from the yearly budget process.\n\nThe strike’s political legacy is also unclear. Some fault teachers for not mobilizing enough relatives and friends to vote; some say teachers themselves didn’t turn out in enough numbers, reviving memories of the pre-strike complacency that frustrated activists like O’Neal.\n\nWhatever its cause, the teachers’ failure in November to elect more supporters in the Legislature came back to haunt them this year.\n\nThe broad education bill that prompted Tuesday’s walkout would have given teachers another 5 percent raise, but also allowed the state to establish its first charter schools. It would have let parents take taxpayer money for their child's education in public school and spend it on options such as private school. Those were the sorts of issues behind the 2018 strike.\n\nTo kill legislation that hadn't even been passed, teachers had to strike again. They won a victory in ensuring their situation didn't get worse. But it also didn't get better.\n\nThe old-time miners went on strike against mine owners. Today, public teachers ultimately strike against taxpayers, personal or commercial. Taxpayers are voters, and voters say they’re for higher teacher salaries. They also say they’re against higher taxes.\n\nTalk of the nation\n\nIn one way, the strike didn’t so much revive history as reverse it.\n\nWith the fall of coal, a region once famed for sometimes-cussed independence became synonymous instead with a fatalistic acceptance of the status quo and a dependence on welfare, from food stamps to disability pay.\n\nThe strike, however, put West Virginia suddenly in the vanguard of the middle working class.\n\nNo one personifies that reversal more than Robin Ellis, a Mingo High English teacher who is also a grandmother, a social conservative, a Republican and one of the 69 percent of West Virginians (and 83 percent of Mingo residents) who voted for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nShe’s also the daughter of an 83-year-old retired union miner who went on strike several times.\n\nDuring last year's strike, Ellis stood on her town’s main street to flag down motorists and, as traffic backed up, make the teachers’ case. And, like young Eric Starr, she rose at a meeting after the tentative settlement to urge her colleagues to stay out.\n\nShe says the strike was about more than money or respect. It was about an obligation to the generations past. “The word ‘strike’ prompts something in us here,’’ she says.\n\n“I don’t think my daddy has ever been prouder of me.’’", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/18/roadrunner-van-monkeypox-quick-build-shelters-news-around-states/49396769/", "title": "Roadrunner by van, monkeypox: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Convicted former state House Speaker Mike Hubbard told people he was innocent and “held my nose” as he signed a letter apologizing for his crimes, according to state prosecutors who used Hubbard’s own phone calls and emails from prison to cast doubt on his claims of remorse as he seeks early release. The attorney general’s office combed through emails and 600 of Hubbard’s phone calls from prison and cited some of the conversations as they oppose his request for early release from prison. State attorneys said the communications show he was “not truthful” when he signed a letter apologizing for his 2016 conviction for violating state ethics law, including using his public office for personal financial gain. Hubbard submitted the letter – in which he said that “I recognize and admit my errors” – in September along with a request for early release from prison. He wrote that his conviction embarrassed the state and his family and that “for this, I am severely sorry and respectfully ask forgiveness from everyone affected.” According to the Monday court filing, Hubbard told a friend before submitting the apology letter that “I promise you I did nothing wrong.” Prosecutors said Hubbard also talked to friends about efforts to add language to community corrections legislation that could benefit his release.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A fast-growing area north of Anchorage known as a hotbed of conservatism gained the most population since the 2010 census and will keep the same number of seats in the Legislature under a new map of state political boundaries that some critics say shortchanges the area. It’s not the only criticism of the plan approved by a divided state Redistricting Board, and court challenges are expected. Among the criticisms are House district pairings for Senate seats for the Anchorage and Eagle River areas that board member Nicole Borromeo said would open the board to “an unfortunate and very easily winnable argument of partisan gerrymandering.” Census data showed the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, which is about the size of West Virginia and includes Palmer and former Gov. Sarah Palin’s hometown of Wasilla north of Anchorage, had 18,086 more people last year than in 2010, the biggest jump for any borough or census area in Alaska. The region also was the second most populous overall in the state, with an estimated 107,081 people, behind Anchorage, with 291,247, according to census data. While the region would have the same number of seats, new House maps would place two Wasilla incumbents in the same district.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s corrections chief says incarcerated people often have greater access to health services than people who aren’t locked up. Corrections Director David Shinn’s defense of the health care system for inmates came as he testified at a trial about the quality of medical and mental health care in state prisons, after the state has faced years of complaints and been fined $2.5 million for not complying with a settlement over the issue. A judge who threw the settlement out this summer concluded that the state showed little interest in making many improvements it promised under the 6-year-old deal and that inadequate care for prisoners had led to suffering and preventable deaths. “They often have greater access to care than I do as a private citizen,” Shinn said of people behind bars. Lawyers for the inmates are asking U.S. District Judge Roslyn Silver to take over health care operations in state-run prisons, appoint an official to run medical and mental health services there, ensure prisons have enough health care workers, and reduce the use of isolation cells, including banning their use for prisoners under age 18 or those with serious mental illnesses. They say Arizona’s prison health care operations are understaffed and poorly supervised, routinely deny access to necessary medications, fail to provide adequate pain management for end-stage cancer patients and others, and don’t meet the minimum standards for mental health care.\n\nArkansas\n\nLonoke: A former sheriff’s deputy pleaded not guilty Monday in the fatal shooting of a white teenager whose death has drawn the attention of civil rights activists. Michael Davis entered the plea to a felony count of manslaughter in the June 23 shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Davis shot Brittain during a traffic stop outside an auto repair shop along Arkansas Highway 89 south of Cabot, a city of about 26,000 people roughly 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. Davis was charged in September in Brittain’s death. Davis told investigators he shot Brittain once in the neck after the teen reached into the back of his truck and did not comply with his commands to show his hands, according to Davis’ arrest affidavit. Brittain was holding a container – which his family members have said held antifreeze – and no evidence of firearms was found in or near the truck, the affidavit said. A passenger with Brittain said he and the teen had been working on the transmission for Brittain’s truck. The passenger told investigators he never heard Davis tell the teen to show his hands, according to the affidavit. Davis was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley in July for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred. Staley said there’s no footage from the shooting, only the aftermath.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Staples Center is getting a new name. Starting Christmas Day, it will be Crypto.com Arena. The downtown Los Angeles home of the NBA’s Lakers and Clippers, the NHL’s Kings and the WNBA’s Sparks will change its name after 22 years of operation, arena owner AEG announced Tuesday night. A person with knowledge of the deal said Crypto.com is paying $700 million over 20 years to rename the building. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the parties aren’t publicly announcing the terms of what’s believed to be the richest naming rights deal in sports history. The 20,000-seat arena has been the Staples Center since it opened in October 1999, with the naming rights owned by the American office-supplies retail company under a 20-year agreement. The name will change when the Lakers host the Brooklyn Nets in the NBA’s annual Christmas showcase. Crypto.com is a cryptocurrency platform and exchange headquartered in Singapore. Along with its sports tenants, the arena has hosted 19 Grammy Awards ceremonies, three NBA All-Star Games, two NHL All-Star Games, and countless high-profile concerts, performances and important public events, including memorials for Michael Jackson, Nipsey Hussle and Kobe Bryant. The Lakers have won six NBA championships during their tenure in the cavernous arena.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: A suburban Denver police department has agreed to reforms after the killing of Elijah McClain led to indictments against officers and a first-of-its-kind civil rights investigation that found a pattern of racially biased policing and excessive force. The plan, announced Tuesday by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and Aurora’s city manager, police chief and fire chief, was reached in response to a civil rights investigation launched by Weiser amid outrage over the death of McClain, a Black man who was put into a chokehold by police and injected with ketamine by paramedics in 2019. The proposal calls for the city to revamp its use-of-force policies and launch new training programs in an effort to combat bias in the ranks. Another key goal of the agreement is eliminating unnecessary use of force and increasing tracking and transparency about how officers engage with the community, Weiser said. It also aims to create a more diverse workforce in the police and fire departments. Aurora city officials said they are on board with the plan, which also includes the city’s fire department. It still hinges on City Council approval. “We are not going to shy away from reform,” Aurora Police Chief Vanessa Wilson said. “To the officers on the street, this consent decree is nothing to be afraid of.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Seven women who say they suffered excruciating pain after a nurse stole fentanyl for her personal use and replaced it with saline sued Yale University on Wednesday, alleging it failed to safeguard its supply of the painkilling opioid at a fertility clinic. The women say they underwent painful and invasive procedures for in vitro fertilization and were supposed to receive fentanyl at the Yale University Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility clinic in Orange, Connecticut, last year. Unbeknownst to them, they received saline instead of fentanyl, and when they told staff of their extreme pain during and after the procedures, their concerns were dismissed, according to the lawsuit filed in state court in Waterbury by the women and their spouses. “Yale’s failure to develop and implement safety measures mandated by state and federal law to secure drugs like fentanyl resulted in these patients being traumatized,” Joshua Koskoff, a lawyer for the women, said in a statement. “What should have been a time of hope for these women and their families became one of unimaginable suffering.” Yale spokesperson Karen Peart Peart said university officials will not comment on the lawsuit, which seeks undisclosed damages.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: A fledgling nonprofit’s efforts to address homelessness with temporary shelter villages are progressing in Sussex County and could become a statewide solution. “Our vision is to build across state,” said Judson Malone, Springboard Collaborative co-founder and director. “We think we have a provable model that actually has a solution to homelessness.” The Georgetown Town Council passed a resolution Oct. 27 allowing Springboard to build and manage a temporary shelter village, similar to a tiny home village. Conley’s Church, in the Angola area of Lewes, has offered its property for a second such site. Springboard will use shelters designed by an Everett, Washington, company called Pallet, named for how the shelters are shipped. They’re framed with aluminum, and the panels are made of fiberglass-reinforced plastic with a foam-insulating core, according to the company’s website. Like traditional houses, Pallet shelters are temperature-controlled, weather-resistant and lockable, but they can be assembled in less than an hour and cost as low as $5,500. They’re not quite tiny houses, though. Pallet shelters do not have plumbing, kitchens or bathrooms, as they’re meant to be temporary shelters. In typical Pallet villages, there are shared bathhouses, laundry facilities and eating areas.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: After 34 days of protest at the Blackburn University Center, Howard University students have reached an agreement with the school, ending their weeks­long sit-in demonstration, WUSA-TV reports. “Howard University is pleased to announce that we have come to an agreement with the students who occupied Blackburn,” university President Wayne Frederick wrote in a statement released on Twitter and Youtube. “The health and well-being of our students is the most important part of my job as president. As I have said before, even one issue in one of our dormitories is too many, and we will continue to remain vigilant in our pledge to maintain safe and high-end housing.” Frederick’s statement also referenced the 2020 campus master plan, promising to “grow and invest in our beloved Hilltop” and to share more details soon of his plans to bring the campus back together following this division. Dozens of Howard University students had occupied the Blackburn University Center for weeks, setting up and living out of tents to bring attention to several issues, including living conditions in their dorm rooms, as they claim some were found to have mold. They also wanted student representation to be restored on the university board of trustees.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: More than 1,000 manatees have died in the state so far this year, eclipsing a previous annual record as the threatened marine mammals struggle with starvation due to pollution in the water. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission reported the updated total Wednesday. The 1,003 manatee deaths so far in 2021 are many more than the 637 recorded last year and well above the previous mark of 830 set in 2013. Slow-moving, bulky manatees have long struggled to coexist with humans. Boat strikes account for some deaths and many injuries. But state officials and environmental groups say polluted water runoff from agriculture, sewage and other man-made development has caused algae blooms in estuaries, choking off the seagrass upon which manatees rely. Climate change is worsening the problem. Authorities expected another bad year for manatees, with more deaths to come as Florida enters the winter months, when the animals congregate in warm-water areas where food supplies have dwindled. Seagrass beds on the state’s eastern coast have been hit especially hard. To compound the problem, manatees are slow to reproduce. According to the nonprofit Save the Manatee Club – co-founded by Florida troubadour Jimmy Buffet – one calf is born every two to five years after a manatee reaches sexual maturity at about age 5. Twin births are rare.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Scores of housing activists, tenants and lawmakers rallied Tuesday to pressure officials to speed up the distribution of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid aimed at preventing evictions in the state. Congress set aside nearly $1 billion in funding for Georgia to help tenants pay past-due rent and utility bills during the pandemic, but the state has struggled to get the money out. Georgia had distributed less than 10% of the first set of funds by the end of September, according to a report last week by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. The report singled out Georgia, Ohio, Arizona and Tennessee for their slow disbursement of aid and large populations of renters. At Tuesday’s rally in downtown Atlanta, Lajoycelyn Bowles, 43, said she has repeatedly contacted the Georgia Department of Community Affairs – the state agency administering Georgia’s funds – but has never heard back. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 in August and has been too sick to work. She received an eviction notice this week from her landlord in Lithonia. “I’m frustrated and pissed off,” she said. The Department of Community Affairs said in a statement that it has distributed $44.2 million to more than 6,900 tenants and landlords so far. It has also added staff and extended working hours to handle an increase in applications.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state ranks last in the nation for the early diagnosis of lung cancer, according to a new study from the American Lung Association. Just 2.8% of high-risk smokers in Hawaii undergo annual CT scans that capture detailed pictures of the lungs, compared to 5.7% nationally, the study said. A state-by-state analysis also found that just 19% of lung cancer cases in Hawaii are diagnosed early, compared to 24.5% nationally, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that smokers and former smokers who are at high risk of developing lung cancer undergo the CT scans. The high-risk category includes adults between the ages of 55 and 80 who smoke a pack a day or more and former heavy smokers who quit in the past 15 years. The annual screenings are limited to the highest-risk smokers, in part due to the risk of false positive results, which can cause anxiety and lead to follow-up tests and procedures that aren’t needed and carry their own risk. Detecting lung cancer early can dramatically improve the chances of successfully treating it. The five-year survival rate for people diagnosed early is 60%. The survival rate drops to 6% when spotted at a late stage. The study found that Native Hawaiians are more likely to be diagnosed and die of lung cancer than other ethnic groups.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A bill making it easier for residents to get worker compensation if they become ill after taking an employee-mandated vaccine sailed through the state House and headed for the Senate on Tuesday. The measure passed the House on a 67-3 vote. It was among seven COVID-19-related bills the chamber pushed through with expedited voting and sent to the Senate. Supporters said workers are getting sick after being vaccinated against COVID-19, and some are having problems receiving compensation. The bill tilts the field toward employees for compensation of hard-to-prove claims such as illnesses caused by vaccines, backers said. “If the employer is telling you, ‘You have to do this in order to work here,’ if they’re doing that, then, by golly, I think our system ought to provide a fair compensation method,” Democratic Rep. John Gannon said. Bill opponents said THAT Idaho’s worker compensation has worked well for decades and that workers sickened by vaccines are already being compensated. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says common side effects of COVID-19 vaccines can include tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever and nausea. Also heading to the Senate was a bill that would prohibit questioning the sincerity of people claiming religious exemptions from vaccinations.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Monday signed a law making voting easier for people with disabilities and creating a group to study removal of further barriers. The law also makes adjustments in deadlines and other technical requirements for candidates in next year’s primary election because it’s later. Pritzker signed a law in June moving the primary from March 15 to June 28 because late-arriving 2020 census numbers delayed the drawing of new congressional district boundaries. Under the law, which takes effect immediately, any polling place that is accessible to voters with disabilities and elderly voters is to include at least one voting booth that is wheelchair-accessible. The Access to Voting for Persons with Disabilities Advisory Task Force will be composed of 15 members, three each appointed by the governor and leaders of the partisan caucuses in House and Senate. The group must meet at least four times and publish its results. Another change allows voters to designate sex on voter registration forms as “male,” “female” or “non-binary.” The measure was sponsored by Senate President Don Harmon, an Oak Park Democrat, and Democratic Rep. Katie Stuart of Edwardsville.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s largest teachers union is calling on lawmakers to address educator burnout and ongoing teacher shortages during the next legislative session that begins in January. The state is “slowly making progress” on teacher pay, but additional action is needed to attract and retain teachers, Indiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill said during a news conference Monday. Teacher workload and burnout were already issues before the start of the pandemic, Gambill said, but the onset of the coronavirus has since worsened the teacher shortage. “We are now going into the third consecutive school year impacted by the coronavirus pandemic,” he said. “Our educators, already overburdened, are facing unsustainable levels of stress and stress-related illness.” The shortage of teachers – compounded by a substitute shortage – has meant more educators are required to work longer hours without time off or time for classroom planning, Gambill said. For some, he said that has included working 12-plus-hour days on top of second or third jobs. Gambill said educators cite a lack of professional respect as a contributing factor in the lack of teachers. In response, he said the union is calling on the Legislature to restore teachers’ ability to bargain contracts that include health and safety conditions, class sizes and prep periods.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Most Iowans support United Auto Workers members over their Deere & Co. bosses in the 10,100-worker strike in Iowa, Illinois and Kansas, a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll finds. About 58% of Iowa adults say they mostly side with Deere workers, compared to just 16% who mostly side with the employers. Another 19% are unsure, and 7% support neither group. With the strike in its fifth week, the UAW announced Friday that it had reached a tentative agreement with Deere. Union members, who have rejected two previous offers, were voting Wednesday on the latest pact. Striking UAW members have a majority or plurality of Iowans’ support regardless of political party, age, gender, educational attainment, religious affiliation, income bracket, or whether they live in a rural or urban area. Selzer & Co. conducted the poll of 810 adults Nov. 7-10. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Elsie Carroll, 31, a customer service representative in Dubuque who participated in the poll, said she supports the workers because she believes they would sacrifice their paychecks to go on strike only if the company is failing them. UAW members on strike receive $275 a week from the union, far less than what they earn at Deere.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A high-ranking Republican lawmaker who is running for statewide office wants the upcoming special session to put an end to coronavirus contact tracing, calling the practice an invasion of privacy. State Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, made the suggestion to “stop this specific contact tracing” at a Monday meeting of the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules and Regulations. The GOP supermajority in both chambers of the Legislature forced Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly to call a special session starting Nov. 22. Lawmakers are set to debate proposals on COVID-19 vaccine mandate exemptions and unemployment insurance for unvaccinated workers who lose their jobs, though additional measures could be proposed. Tyson, who is running for state treasurer, said during and after the meeting that she would want legislation removing virus contact tracing language from last session’s appropriations bill. But she demurred on whether she would introduce a bill or an amendment herself. The budget bill granted the Kansas Department of Health and Environment the authority to hire contact tracers and to adopt related regulations. It is unclear whether repealing the contact tracing provision as Tyson proposed would end the practice or remove some of the more arduous rules imposed by the Legislature.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Appalachian Regional Commission has awarded more than $1.5 million in federal funds to five Kentucky projects that aim to address the region’s substance abuse crisis through recovery-to-work programs, Gov. Andy Beshear said. The grants announced Tuesday are part of an ARC initiative that focuses on funding efforts that help create recovery-friendly work environments and provide supports to those in recovery and their employers. The projects can also include job training. Since April 2021, ARC has invested $14.9 million in 47 related projects. A request for proposals for a third round of awards will be be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A state board granted parole Wednesday to Henry Montgomery, whose Supreme Court case was instrumental in extending the possibility of freedom to hundreds of people sentenced to life in prison without the opportunity for parole when they were juveniles. Montgomery, 75, was convicted in the 1963 killing of Charles Hurt, an East Baton Rouge sheriff’s deputy who caught him skipping school. Montgomery was 17 at the time. He was initially sentenced to death, but the state’s Supreme Court threw out his conviction in 1966, saying he didn’t get a fair trial. The case was retried and Montgomery convicted again, sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He served decades at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. A three-member board voted unanimously in favor of parole. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the meeting was held on Zoom, with Montgomery appearing on camera from the prison where he has spent his entire adult life. “He’s been in prison for 57 years. He has an excellent … disciplinary record. He is a low risk by our assessment. He’s got good comments from the warden. He has a very good prison record,” board member Tony Marabella said as he voted to approve Montgomery’s release with certain conditions, including a curfew and that he have no contact with the victim’s family.\n\nMaine\n\nFreedom: A wayward roadrunner is on the mend in the Pine Tree State after traveling across the country in a moving van. The greater roadrunner, a species native to Southwestern states, hitched a ride in the storage area of a moving van from Las Vegas to Westbrook, Maine. Volunteers took the bird to Avian Haven, a bird rehabilitation facility. Avian Haven representatives said they took the call about the bird Nov. 13, and it continued to rest Tuesday. They said in a Facebook post that the bird was in “remarkably good shape” for having been stuck in a van for four days but might have lost weight during the journey. The center is looking at ways to return the roadrunner to Nevada once it is healthy enough, said Diane Winn, Avian Haven’s executive director. The center has created a special habitat for the bird that is warmer than its typical outdoor areas while also being sufficiently roomy, the group said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A case of monkeypox has been confirmed in a Maryland resident who recently returned from Nigeria, state health officials announced Tuesday. The person had mild symptoms and is recovering in isolation but isn’t hospitalized, the Department of Health said in a news release. The general public doesn’t need to take any special precautions, officials said. People who may have been in contact with the person who was diagnosed with the illness have been identified, and public health authorities are continuing to follow up with them, Deputy Secretary for Public Health Dr. Jinlene Chan said in a statement. Monkeypox is in the same family of viruses as smallpox but generally causes a milder infection, officials said. It can be spread through direct contact with lesions or body fluids or via contaminated materials like clothing or large respiratory droplets. Illness typically begins with flu-like symptoms and lymph node swelling and progresses to a rash on the face and body. The people who may have been exposed in this case will be monitored for symptoms for 21 days after exposure. Human monkeypox infections primarily occur in central and western African countries and have only rarely been documented outside of Africa.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Michelle Wu was sworn in Tuesday as the first woman and first person of color elected mayor in the city’s long history. The swearing-in of Boston’s first Asian American mayor came two weeks after Wu won the election. Before Wu, Boston had elected only white men as mayor. “City government is special. We are the level closest to the people, so we must do the big and the small. Every streetlight, every pothole, every park and classroom lays the foundation for greater change,” Wu said after taking the oath of office. “After all, Boston was founded on a revolutionary promise: that things don’t have to be as they always have been. That we can chart a new path for families now, and for generations to come, grounded in justice and opportunity,” she said. Wu, 36, takes over for a fellow Democrat – former acting Mayor Kim Janey – who was Boston’s first woman and first Black resident to serve in the top post, to which she was not elected. To push back against soaring housing costs that have forced some former residents out of the city, Wu has promised to pursue rent stabilization or rent control. The biggest hurdle to that proposal is the fact that Massachusetts voters narrowly approved a 1994 ballot question banning rent control statewide. Another of Wu’s top campaign promises is to create a “fare-free” public transit system.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: A federal judge retained jurisdiction Tuesday in a dispute over a Canadian oil pipeline that runs through a section of the Great Lakes, rejecting Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s contention that the case belongs in state court. The clash over whether Enbridge Energy’s Line 5 should continue operating raises issues “under consideration at the highest levels of this country’s government” involving a U.S.-Canada treaty and federal pipeline safety regulation, U.S. District Judge Janet Neff ruled. The matter “is properly in federal court,” she wrote in a 15-page opinion that drew praise from Enbridge. Whitmer’s office expressed disappointment, and environmentalists ramped up pressure on President Joe Biden to intervene. Line 5 moves 23 million gallons daily of crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, passing through northern Wisconsin and Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. A 4-mile section is divided into two pipes that cross the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet. Whitmer ordered Enbridge last year to close the 68-year-old line, agreeing with Indigenous tribes, environmentalists and tourist businesses that it risks a devastating spill. Enbridge contends the line is safe and ignored the Democratic governor’s May 12 shutdown deadline.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The Department of Defense will send medical teams to two major hospitals to relieve doctors and nurses who are swamped by a growing wave of COVID-19 patients, Gov. Tim Walz announced Wednesday. The teams, each comprising 22 people, will arrive at Hennepin County Medical Center and St. Cloud Hospital next week and begin treating patients immediately, Walz said in a conference call from the Finnish capital, Helsinki. the latest stop on his European trade mission. Minnesota has become one of the country’s worst hot spots for new coronavirus infections. Hospital beds are filling up with unvaccinated people, and staffers are being worn down by the surge. Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said Tuesday that she’s ready to expand access to booster vaccines to all adults by the end of the week if the federal government doesn’t act first. “Our best defense against this is the vaccine,” Walz told reporters. He noted that Minnesota is No. 2 in the county for the number of booster shots given, behind only Vermont, and that first doses have risen 60% over the past week. “And we know that that is our way out of this. … I need Minnesotans to recognize, as we’ve been saying, this is a dangerous time.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Saying it could be days before tap water is safe to drink, officials issued a citywide boil-water order the same day the Environmental Protection Agency was in town to tout the newly passed federal infrastructure bill. About 15,000 residents and businesses, mostly in south and west Jackson, were without water Monday and early Tuesday, city officials said. Water pressure is gradually being restored, and most residents should have at least some water coming out of the tap. “Obviously, this is not a position that we want to be in,” Jackson City Engineer Charles Williams said. The water is not safe to drink anywhere in the city until the Mississippi State Department of Health tests the water and declares it contaminant-free. The boil order will probably be lifted gradually as water pressure is restored, Williams said, with Thursday the soonest the order may be lifted in any part of Jackson. Williams said the city received a bad batch of aluminum chlorohydrate, a chemical used to treat drinking water, and workers shut down part of the water treatment system at the O.B. Curtis plant Saturday. None of the chemical made it into the city’s water supply, and residents were not exposed, Williams said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: State Attorney General Eric Schmitt sued the city’s school district Tuesday over its response to his office’s requests for records related to critical race theory and anti-racist teaching. Schmitt’s office submitted a Sunshine Law request in October seeking records from the district relating to how and whether it teaches critical race theory. Schmitt, a Republican running for Senate, alleges in the lawsuit that the district broke the law by demanding payment for services other than copies before it would make public records available to his office. He also contends the district didn’t use hourly rates that would have kept the cost of fulfilling the request as low as possible, as required by law. The district initially required a deposit of $37,000 to process the request before it began searching for records, according to the lawsuit. Schmitt’s lawsuit claims the district has used critical race theory in its teachers’ training for at least two years, citing as an example a training program in 2020 for about 170 teachers and staff that would “create shared understanding … around complex issues of systemic racism and xenophobia” and allow them to “receive tools on how to become anti-racist.” District spokesman Stephen Hall said in a statement that the district focuses on equity but does not teach critical race theory.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Native American tribes in the state – including the Blackfeet Nation, Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, and Fort Belknap Indian Community, as well as the Rocky Mountain Tribal Leaders Council – have expressed support for a bill that would establish a panel to look into the history of U.S. efforts to force assimilation. The Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies in the U.S. Act would establish a formal, diverse commission to investigate and document Indian boarding school policies, including the U.S. government’s attempt to terminate Indigenous cultures, religions and languages. The commission should recommend practices for the federal government to acknowledge these atrocities and promote healing. The panel would also hold culturally sensitive public hearings for boarding school survivors and community members. The Blackfeet Tribal Business Council in October passed a resolution supporting congressional efforts in approving the act. Lauren Monroe Jr., council secretary, said past atrocities still influence Indigenous people today. “For Blackfeet people that don’t speak the language or don’t know our history, this isn’t so much in the past as it is in the present,” he said. “Until we have this conversation, there can’t be progress or healing.”\n\nNebraska\n\nScottsbluff: A fire that had burned about 2,560 acres in northwest Nebraska was about 40% contained, officials said Tuesday. The fire in the Buffalo Creek Wildlife Management Area in Scotts Bluff and Banner counties began Sunday, and efforts to contain it are expected to last through the week, The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency said. The Buffalo Creek wildlife area is about 7 miles southeast of Gering and Scottsbluff. No homes had been burned, no injuries were reported, and no evacuations had been necessary, according to an update provided Tuesday. The firefighting effort has included helicopters, with 27 departments supplying resources and firefighters, who have been working 16-hour shifts, the Scottsbluff Star Herald reports. The National Weather Service posted a red flag warning for the area, which means any fire that ignites could grow rapidly. The area was reporting temperatures in the 50s and the 60s, 20% humidity and wind speeds of 20-30 mph.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A man’s admission that he voted twice in November 2020 in a case on which state Republicans seized to claim voter irregularities amounted to “a cheap political stunt” that backfired, a state court judge said Tuesday. Donald “Kirk” Hartle appeared by videoconference from his defense attorney’s office to plead guilty to a misdemeanor – voting more than once in the same election – and told Clark County District Court Judge Carli Kierny he accepted full responsibility for his actions and regrets them. Hartle’s attorney, David Chesnoff, prevented his client from having to describe publicly how he voted early using a ballot that had been mailed to his dead wife. Rosemarie Hartle died in 2017, but her name remained on the voter rolls. Chesnoff told the judge that state Attorney General Aaron Ford’s office agreed to reduce two felony charges against Hartle to the misdemeanor. Kierny made it clear she was unhappy with the deal but accepted it. Hartle was fined $2,000 and has to stay out of trouble for one year. The judge set a Nov. 17, 2022, date to review the result. “This seems to me to be a cheap political stunt that kind of backfired,” Kierny said, “and shows that our voting system actually works because you were ultimately caught.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: The city is getting a $25 million federal grant to help improve transportation in the South Millyard area. The grant was announced by the state’s congressional delegation Tuesday. “This project will mitigate traffic congestion, provide increased transportation options including biking and walking trails and a pedestrian bridge over Granite Street and create opportunities for development throughout South Elm Street,” Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig said in a statement. “This is a big deal for the City of Manchester.” The grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation will be allocated through the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity grant program. Manchester’s award ties with the state of New Mexico for the largest RAISE grant in the country this year.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: State lawmakers are proposing financial relief for the city’s casinos to help them continue to recover from the coronavirus pandemic by exempting two of the industry’s fastest-growing revenue streams from calculations on how much the casinos should pay the city. It would reduce payments for some casinos, including the Borgata, while imposing higher payments onto others, including Hard Rock. The bill, advanced Monday by a state Senate committee, is a renewal of a measure requiring the casinos to make payments in lieu of taxes to Atlantic City that was first enacted five years ago, when the city was reeling from the closure of five of its 12 casinos. There currently are nine casinos. Easily able back then to show that their businesses were worth less in a declining market, the casinos successfully appealed their property tax assessments year after year, helping to blow huge holes in Atlantic City’s budget. Meanwhile, New Jersey’s red-hot sports betting industry smashed its own national record in October for the highest amount of bets taken in a single month, topping $1.3 billion. That figure easily surpassed the $1.01 billion worth of bets that Atlantic City’s nine casinos and the three horse tracks that offer sports betting took in September.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nEunice: The city is looking to salty underground sources as it seeks an “unlimited” supply of water. The Eunice City Council recently voted to have a Hobbs-based engineering firm continue studying the benefits of building a desalination plant for the community. Amid depletion of fresh water from the Ogallala Aquifer continues, the council wants to know the feasibility of a proposed alternative: desalination of saline or brackish water. The Hobbs News-Sun reports it could cost about $5.5 million to build a plant, and the completion of the engineering study likely will provide a more accurate estimate. City Manager Jordan Yutzy told the councilors that the engineering work by Pettigrew and Associates will cost about $464,000. State funds are paying for the work. The engineering firm began the study last summer to determine whether water from underground brackish aquifers can economically be desalinated for human consumption. The Ogallala Aquifer underlies portions of eight states, in which agriculture, commercial industry and residences use more than is replenished from rainfall or snowmelt. Below the freshwater aquifer are saline and brackish water supplies that need to be treated, often at high cost, before human consumption.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A new effort to find a mass-transit solution for LaGuardia Airport after a $2 billion rail link project was put on hold amid criticism from public officials will look at options including ferry service, a subway extension and dedicated bus lanes. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport, announced Tuesday that it has commissioned a panel to review alternatives for LaGuardia, one of the few major airports in the country without a rail link. The panel will consist of Mike Brown, former London transportation commissioner and managing director of Heathrow Airport; Janette Sadik-Khan, former New York City transportation commissioner; and Philip Washington, the CEO of Denver International Airport and a former CEO of Los Angeles Metro. Tom Wright, president and CEO of the Regional Plan Association, a New York-based think tank, called the formation of the panel “the right move at a critical time for our region.” A 1.5-mile elevated railway linking the airport to a rail station near CitiField in Queens was given environmental approved by federal regulators in July, but the plan prompted criticism from Gov. Kathy Hochul and other officials, as well as a lawsuit from an environmental group.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The largest school system in the state said none of its students went hungry Tuesday despite a sickout by school cafeteria workers demanding better pay and improved working conditions. Leaders at the Wake County Public School System warned parents that another sickout could affect food services at other schools Wednesday, The News & Observer of Raleigh reports. Late Monday evening, the Wake County school system alerted families at 32 schools that they should bring their own lunch on Tuesday because the system couldn’t guarantee meal service. But a tweet sent in the morning indicated the district was able to provide meals to every student who wanted one. The district provided bagged lunches to students, according to Lisa Luten, a school spokeswoman. Luten also said parents and local businesses and restaurants also brought in food for students Tuesday. WCPSS warned Tuesday night that 15 schools could be affected by staffing shortages Wednesday. The sickout comes as a 19% vacancy rate is forcing the cafeteria workers to do more work than before. Two weeks ago, dozens of WCPSS school bus drivers called out sick for a three-day protest that disrupted bus service for many students.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Defense Department’s internal watchdog said its investigation into a $400 million border wall contract found it was properly awarded to a North Dakota firm whose owner used multiple appearances on Fox News to push for the job. The Pentagon’s inspector general on Monday released results of the audit, requested last year by House Homeland Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. He asked for the review of the contract awarded to Dickinson, North Dakota-based Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to ensure that the company’s bid met standards and that the contract was awarded in accordance with federal procurement regulations. “We reviewed Fisher Sand and Gravel’s proposal, compared it to the solicitation, and agreed with (the Corps’) assessment that it was the LPTA (Lowest Price Technically Acceptable) and was properly awarded the contract,” the audit said. Company President Tommy Fisher is a GOP supporter and has appeared on conservative media touting his company as the best pick for building the wall that former President Donald Trump made a priority. The company was awarded a contract to build 31 miles of wall in Arizona but had little experience with such construction.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A transit officer who was captured on surveillance video shoving a 68-year-old man off a rail platform and onto the tracks in February has been charged. Patrick Rivera, 41, pleaded not guilty to three charges, including first-degree misdemeanor assault, on Saturday, cleveland.com reports. Rivera was placed on unpaid leave after charges were filed, Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority spokesperson Linda Scardilli Krecic told the news outlet. Rivera was called to the site because the man refused to move his belongings when asked by a custodian, cleveland.com reports. Rivera wrote in a report that the man was aggressive and lunged at him, at which point he shoved the man. Video footage shows that the interaction happened quickly and that Rivera and another officer prevented the man from immediately climbing back up onto the platform even though trains were active on that track. Rivera wrote two citations for the man after he shoved him, but prosecutors later dropped the charges after a psychologist found the man was not competent to stand trial because of mental illness. Rivera was not fired or suspended because he signed an agreement with RTA that he would be fired if he “makes another mistake” in the next year. Former RTA Police Chief Michael Gettings called Rivera’s actions “unacceptable.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Students across the metro area walked out of classes Wednesday in support of death row inmate Julius Jones, who is scheduled to be executed Thursday. Students at Northwest Classen, Classen SAS, Putnam City North, Harding Charter and John Marshall staged walkouts Wednesday morning. Students were seen congregating in parking lots and on football fields. The walkouts happened as Jones’ supporters awaited word from Gov. Kevin Stitt on whether he will grant Jones clemency ahead of his scheduled execution. Oklahoma City rapper and activist Jabee Williams, a longtime supporter of Jones, spoke to the students from Classen SAS, who marched about 10 blocks from their school to the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon. “Julius loves you, he appreciates you, and he knows he is not alone,” Williams said. “What you guys did today was so brave.” He said there is a dark cloud hanging over Oklahoma right now. “If this man is executed, there’s a part of us that will be executed too. We won’t be the same,” Williams said. Greg Robinson, a community organizer and supporter of Jones from Tulsa, also praised the students for their walkout in support of Jones. “Why is it that a group of high schoolers,” Robinson said, “got more courage than the people that walk through this building?”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A philanthropist filed papers with the secretary of state on Tuesday to decriminalize sex work in Oregon, aiming to put the issue before voters in the 2022 election. “Sex worker rights are human rights, and the denial of those rights enables human trafficking,” said chief petitioner Aaron Boonshoft, who filed the prospective petition for the Sex Worker Rights Act. Advocates said Oregon’s laws that criminalize sex work make it difficult for workers to report rape, harassment and human trafficking to police, fearing they themselves could be arrested. Organizers of the effort said the proposal would end criminal penalties for participating in consensual adult sex work and add health and safety protections while maintaining laws against human trafficking. “Our current system is broken and harms sex workers,” said Anne Marie Backstrom, political director for the campaign. “Sex workers deserve to do their job without fear of arrest or violence, and, like all workers, they deserve access to health care, labor protections and public services.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A bill to allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit was passed by a divided state House on Tuesday but faces a veto threat from the governor. The parties were split in the vote, as occurred in the state Senate last week, with Republicans mostly supporting it and Democrats mostly opposed. Supporters said that getting concealed carry permits under current law can be subject to the whims of county sheriffs and that permit holders can forget when their licenses expire and therefore unknowingly violate the law. Opponents pointed out the proposal is unlikely to be enacted, as Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s office said he will veto the legislation, and argued the bill would make people less safe by making guns more readily accessible. Pennsylvanians are generally allowed to openly carry loaded firearms, although current law is silent on it. Only in Philadelphia is a permit required for it. The legislation sent to Wolf would remove Philadelphia’s open-carry permit requirement, as well as the state’s requirement for people to get a permit to carry a concealed weapon, including for storing them in their cars.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Civil rights organizations have sued the state’s Department of Corrections on behalf of a man who alleges his rights were violated when he was held in solitary confinement for eight months as punishment for his complaints about prison conditions. The Rhode Island Center for Justice and the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island sued the state’s corrections director and other prison administrators at the behest of Joseph Shepard, 28, on Monday. In the lawsuit, Shepard alleges his constitutional rights to free speech and due process were violated when prison administrators put him in solitary confinement in retaliation for raising concerns. A spokesperson for the Department of Corrections said the state disagreed that Shepard had served time in solitary confinement because the prison system “does not practice solitary confinement, as we have stated on the record numerous times.” Shepard claimed in the lawsuit that he brought concerns about prison conditions to administrators but was told to follow the formal grievance procedure. In response, Shepard sent documents to civil rights groups to bring attention to the cause. He was then placed in high-security segregation for eight months for being in possession of documents that had never been identified as contraband, he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state House will return to Columbia next month for a special session about redistricting. House Speaker Jay Lucas said the House will first meet at 2 p.m. Dec. 1 with the primary focus on approving the new state House, Senate and U.S. House districts based on 2020 U.S. census data. The chamber may also be in session Dec. 2 and Dec. 6 if necessary. The Senate hasn’t announced the dates it might meet in special session, but they are expected to gather in early December, too, because that would leave three months for legal challenges about the new maps to be resolved before filing for the new districts in the 2022 elections begins in March. The Legislature set aside only a few issues that can be taken up in the special session without a two-thirds vote. They include redistricting and spending billions of dollars in federal pandemic funds and from a settlement with the federal government over radioactive material stored past a deadline at the Savannah River Site. The list of items did not include COVID-19 vaccine or mask mandates. The General Assembly returns in January for the second year of its regular session.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem’s daughter says she’ll quit the real estate appraiser business following scrutiny over whether her mother used her influence to aid her application for an appraiser license. Kassidy Peters slammed a legislative inquiry and news reporting on the episode in a letter to Secretary of Labor Marcia Hultman on Tuesday. She also released a document that a legislative committee was seeking to subpoena. Lawmakers were zeroing in on the timeline of a meeting Noem called last year that included Peters and key decision-makers in a government agency that had moved days earlier to deny her application for an upgrade to her appraiser certification. “I am writing you today to express my disappointment and anger that my good name and professional reputation continue to be damaged by questions and misinformation concerning the Appraiser Certification Program,” Peters wrote to Hultman in the letter. She told Hultman she would turn in her license by the end of the year, adding: “I’m angry and I can acknowledge that this has successfully destroyed my business.” The Republican-dominated Government Operations and Audit Committee had requested the document to confirm Hultman’s assertion that state regulators had already decided to give Peters another chance to win her appraiser certification prior to the meeting in the governor’s mansion. Noem echoed that defense in a later news conference. But the signed agreement with Peters is dated the week after the July 27, 2020, meeting.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Universities, transportation agencies and the operator of a national laboratory are among those landing exemptions to a new state law that strictly limits or prohibits most government entities and businesses from implementing COVID-19 prevention mandates. For some, approval was almost immediate. Six of the 19 entities that submitted requests Monday – the first day to apply – were granted exemptions to the new law’s stringent requirements. Tennessee now largely bars governments and businesses from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination and only lets schools and other public entities require masks in rare, dire public health situations. Exemptions also are allowed if groups can show they would lose federal funding by complying with the state law, which conflicts with policies implemented by President Joe Biden’s administration. Early exemptions have been given to Vanderbilt University, the University of Tennessee system, the University of Memphis, East Tennessee State University and UT-Batelle, which operates Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Crockett County Ambulance Service also was approved, though state officials noted that certain Medicare and Medicaid providers are already exempt. Other medical providers also applied.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Democrat Beto O’Rourke said Wednesday that he has raised more than $2 million after announcing his campaign for governor Monday, showing a persistent ability to quickly pile up cash after coming off failed runs for the U.S. Senate and presidency. The money came from more than 31,000 donations in the first 24 hours, with 57% of the contributions coming from Texas, spokesman Abhi Rahman said. Small donors have powered O’Rourke’s massive fundraising hauls in the past, but his campaign did not disclose a breakdown of contribution sizes so far. The numbers showed an early burst of enthusiasm for the former El Paso congressman, who in one day raised more money than the entire campaign of Democrats’ little-known candidate for Texas governor in 2018. But O’Rourke still has a long way to catch or even approach Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who this summer reported having at least $55 million in his campaign account, more than any incumbent governor in the country. Abbott, who is seeking a third term, routinely collects six-figure donations in big money from Texas executives. The Lone Star State’s sheer size makes mounting a statewide campaign costly, and Abbott and O’Rourke are likely to make this among the most expensive governor’s races in the country.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Gov. Spencer Cox cut the ceremonial opening ribbon Monday for a new business center. The Cedar City Business and Innovation Center is meant to provide a space for community members, students and businesses to come together to discuss entrepreneurial ideas, said Brennan Wood, president of Southwest Technical College. In a speech, Cox touted the center as a place that could be used as a “model” for other business centers to open in the state, saying he sees these centers as playing an important role in Utah’s economic future. “This is how we future-proof our education system,” he said. “It’s how we future-proof our economy. We do that by working together and innovating together.” The Cedar City center is located on the grounds of Southwest Technical College but isn’t technically an extension of the college, as the center had many other partners in its opening. Those include Southern Utah University, the Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity, the office of economic development for Cedar City and Iron County, and the Women’s Business Center of Utah. The center’s main mission is to help people handle the early challenges of starting a small business by offering office space, professional equipment, opportunities for business guidance and businesses classes.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: An audit has found that the cost of state employee health care jumped between 2010 and 2019 and urged changes to save money. The report released by State Auditor Doug Hoffer found that the cost of annual medical reimbursements for state employees, retirees and their families increased 51% in that time, from $94 million to $142 million. One reason the report identified for the increase was that different health providers charged different amounts for the same care. “The difference in prices paid for the exact same health care procedures under the State employee health plan is startling, especially since higher prices do not necessarily mean higher quality,” Hoffer said in a statement. The reports suggests that the state move to reference-based pricing, in which the state would set a maximum price it would pay for any service instead of paying the price negotiated by the health care provider and insurance company. Hoffer said that could save the state $16.3 million annually. A second suggestion is to provide state workers, retirees and their families with information about the cost of care and implement a cash incentive for them to use less expensive options. The report predicted this could save $202,000 annually if implemented for seven specific services.\n\nVirginia\n\nFredericksburg: A school board rescinded a directive for staff to pull books with “sexually explicit” books from libraries early Tuesday after hours of passionate public comment. The Spotsylvania County school board voted 5-2 to reverse the order amid public backlash, but some board members said they’ll continue to take a stance against the inclusion of what they view as offensive material in school library books, The Free Lance-Star reports. Board members Rabih Abuismail and Kirk Twigg, who spoke of burning books at last week’s meeting, did not support the reversal. “I think we should throw those books on the fire,” Abuismail said at the Nov. 8 school board meeting, while Twigg said many “would like to see the books before we burn them so we can identify within our community that we are eradicating this bad stuff.” Monday’s specially called meeting on the matter was held at the Chancellor High School auditorium to accommodate the large number of speakers expected. It stretched past midnight as dozens of parents, students, teachers and librarians spoke, most in support of libraries and books. Two speakers, both high school students, spoke in favor of removing books from library shelves. Comments were cut off at midnight.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The head of the state’s bipartisan redistricting commission that failed to meet its deadline for redrawing political maps urged state Supreme Court justices to consider their work nonetheless now that the high court will have to complete the process. The panel had a deadline of 11:59 p.m. Monday to approve new boundaries for congressional and legislative districts following the 2020 census but acknowledged Tuesday that it had not been able to complete its task on time. This is the first time the panel has failed to finish its work on time since the state adopted a constitutional amendment giving redistricting authority to a bipartisan commission after the 1990 census. “While we acknowledge we missed the deadline for our maps to be considered by the Legislature, we see no reason why the Court can’t do so,” Commission Chair Sarah Augustine said in a statement late Tuesday night. “These maps reflect the input of the thousands of people who took part in the process with us. It would be a shame to see these maps go unconsidered simply because the clock struck 12.” Despite the plea to the Supreme Court, many were critical of the process by the panel – especially in the final hours Monday night, when there were complaints its deliberations were closed to the public and may have violated open meetings laws.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Two trees to be displayed in the West Virginia Capitol during the holidays will feature photos recognizing military and first responders. West Virginians can submit photos to be displayed on the trees, according to a news release from Gov. Jim Justice and first lady Cathy Justice. The trees will be placed in the west rotunda of the main Capitol building. A third tree will be decorated by Gold Star mothers and families to honor people who died while serving the country. Photos will not be returned, and photocopies should be submitted. The military recognition form and the first responder recognition form and tag are available online. Photos, submission forms and tags must be received by Nov. 29. They can be submitted by email to first.lady@wv.gov or regular mail to attention of Katie Morris, West Virginia Governor’s Mansion, 1716 Kanawha Blvd. East, Charleston, WV 25305.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Two top state Republicans are criticizing mandatory University of Wisconsin-Madison sexual violence prevention training that includes references to privilege, identity and critical race theory. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos on Tuesday wrote a letter to the school chancellor demanding answers on why graduate students are required to watch the two-hour webinar that university spokesperson John Lucas said includes “a brief reference” to critical race theory, which he said is supported by academic research and noted in the citations. Critical race theory is an academic framework that centers on the idea that racism is systemic in U.S. institutions, which function to maintain the dominance of white people. It has become a catchall political buzzword for any teaching in schools about race and American history, and conservatives have seized on the concept to galvanize their base. Vos said it was “unacceptable” and “appalling” to mandate a class that “instills the university’s negative opinion of white students and the idea that students should feel guilty simply because of their race.” Gubernatorial candidate and former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch first drew attention to the training in a video she posted on Facebook last month.\n\nWyoming\n\nKemmerer: A small city in the top U.S. coal-mining state will be home to a Bill Gates-backed experimental nuclear power project near a coal-fired power plant that will soon close, officials announced Tuesday. Bellevue, Washington-based TerraPower will build its Natrium plant in Kemmerer, a southwestern Wyoming city of 2,600 where the coal-fired Naughton power plant operated by PacifiCorp subsidiary Rocky Mountain Power is set to close in 2025. “Our innovative technology will help ensure the continued production of reliable electricity while also transitioning our energy system and creating new, good-paying jobs in Wyoming,” TerraPower President and CEO Chris Levesque said in a statement. The project will employ as many as 2,000 people during construction and 250 once operational in a state where the coal industry has been shedding jobs. If it’s as reliable as conventional nuclear power, the 345-megawatt plant would produce enough climate-friendly power to serve about 250,000 homes. The announcement came days after officials from the U.S. and other countries pledged at a global climate-change summit in Scotland to continue working to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/12/14/year-review-50-stories-50-states-moved-us-2017/930070001/", "title": "2017 year in review: 50 stories from 50 states that moved us in 2017", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe year began with Donald Trump assuming the mantle of 45th president of the United States. The day after he was inaugurated, more than two million people across the world called for a \"revolution\" as a bulwark against the new administration they feared would roll back reproductive, civil and human rights.\n\nThe year that followed was no less dramatic.\n\nFormer National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was ousted from the White House over his Russian contacts. NFL players continued to kneel. There were multiple data breaches, but none larger than Equifax, which compromised the personal information of nearly half of all Americans.\n\nInevitably, there was tragedy. The catastrophic 2017 hurricane season brought us Harvey, Irma and Maria, which Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico will spend years recovering from. New York City saw its worst terrorist attack since 9/11. In Las Vegas, 58 people died in the worst mass shooting in American history.\n\nBut there was also wonder. For the first time in almost 100 years, a total solar eclipse spanned across the country. We celebrated the news that one of our own, California native Meghan Markle, is set to wed Prince Harry and become the first divorced, biracial, Jewish American actress to join the British royal family.\n\nIn the end, 2017 closes with hope. Women punctuated the year with the powerful rallying cry #metoo, prompting a national reckoning on a culture of sexual violence that has persisted unabated for far too long.\n\nAfter another eventful year, USA TODAY revisits one story from each state — the big news, the best investigations and the moments we can't stop talking about.\n\nAlabama: Roy Moore and America’s reckoning on sexual violence\n\nThe eyes of a nation were fixed on Alabama this December to see who the state would choose to take over its open Senate seat in an election that was seen not only as a referendum on President Trump — who supported embattled Republican candidate Roy Moore — but also on the country's tolerance of predatory sexual behavior. Trump was elected in spite of more than a dozen allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him. But Moore, who was accused in November of sexually assaulting and harassing multiple teenage girls when he was in his 30s, was defeated by Democrat Doug Jones. It is the first time in 25 years that Alabama has elected a Democrat to the Senate.\n\nThe Alabama special election came during what America has come to refer to as its \"post-Weinstein moment,\" a reckoning on powerful men who have abused women with impunity, and who, until recently, rarely faced consequences. Since the reports Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein harassed, abused and assaulted more than 80 women over several decades, women around the country who have long suffered in silence flooded social media under the hashtag #metoo and made public statements about the sexual misconduct they've endured. For many Americans, this reckoning is complicated by Trump's presence in the White House. Trump's accusers have revived calls for a congressional investigation into his misconduct. Some say Jones’ victory will embolden Democrats to do just that.\n\nAlaska: Fear of climate change rises after U.S. leaves Paris Accord\n\nIn 2017, America became the only country on Earth not part of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement after President Trump decided to leave the pact in June. The Paris agreement, negotiated by former president Barack Obama, aims to combat global warming by gradually reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In Alaska, climate change is always front-of-mind. Many residents of Sarichef Island and an Iñupiaq village of 650 blame human-caused climate change for accelerating the island’s erosion and fear leaving the Paris agreement will supercharge destruction that's already occurring.\n\nArizona: McCain, battling brain cancer, stops Obamacare repeal\n\nIt was a tense July night on the Senate floor when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. — roughly a week after announcing his brain cancer diagnosis — sunk the GOP-backed \"skinny repeal\" of Obamacare with a dramatic \"thumbs down.\" Before the vote, congressional leaders had struggled to reach consensus on a plan to replace former president Barack Obama's signature health care law, which the GOP had promised for seven years to expunge the law from the books. Republicans ultimately scrapped a vote on a last-ditch Obamacare repeal effort in September, which McCain also opposed. As for his health, McCain said in September he would continue treatments for brain cancer while also doing his job on Capitol Hill.\n\nArkansas: Controversial Ten Commandments monument destroyed after less than 24 hours\n\nAfter years of fierce debate, Arkansas built a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the state capitol building. Less than 24 hours later, the monument was razed. Michael Tate Reed, 32, plowed his car through the statue while filming the incident on his cellphone and posting the video on Facebook, authorities said. The 6-foot, 6,000-pound memorial drew the ire of opponents like the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas and the Temple of Satan, who said the monument was an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. Supporters saw it as a way to celebrate the role the Ten Commandments played in this country’s law. State Sen. Jason Rapert, who led the push to initially erect the monument, vowed to raise funds to build its replacement.\n\nCalifornia: Meghan Markle, America's fairy-tale royal bride\n\nRoyal wedding bells are ringing yet again. Suits actress and California native Meghan Markle is set to wed Prince Harry, the world's most eligible royal bachelor. The couple announced their engagement in November. Markle, who was raised in Los Angeles, will make history as the first divorced, biracial, Jewish American actress to join the British royal family. After they wed, Harry will likely receive a new royal title as a duke from his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and Markle will, like Duchess Kate, be known as a titled royal duchess, HRH Meghan, Duchess of so-and-so. Also in royals: Prince William and Kate Middleton announced they are expecting their third child. Sister Pippa Middleton's May wedding was the A-list event of the year.\n\nColorado: Baker's confections vs. gay couple's affections\n\nIn 2012, Charlie Craig and David Mullins went into baker Jack Phillips' Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colo., to buy a cake for their wedding. But Phillips doesn't do cakes for same-sex weddings. Craig and Mullins said Phillips' refusal violated a Colorado anti-discrimination law. Five years later, their disagreement over a cake went all the way to the Supreme Court in a case testing the Constitution's guarantee of free speech and religion against state laws prohibiting discrimination. The court, bolstered in April by the addition of stalwart conservative and fellow Coloradan Neil Gorsuch, appeared split down the middle when the justices heard oral arguments Dec. 5. The decision, which will likely hinge on Justice Anthony Kennedy, isn't expected until next year.\n\nConnecticut: Hate crime, or roommate feud gone too far?\n\nIn late October, former University of Hartford student Briana Brochu was charged with breach of peace and criminal mischief for tampering with items that belonged to her roommate, who is black. Brochu admitted she licked Chennel \"Jazzy\" Rowe's eating utensils and smeared bodily fluids on her backpack. Rowe posted a Facebook video about the incident, which quickly viral, and prompted backlash on social media as many questioned whether Brochu's actions were racially motivated. The Connecticut NAACP and others called on Hartford prosecutors to file a hate crime charge against Brochu, but Brochu's lawyer, Thomas Stevens, told the Hartford Courant he does not believe the charge will be added. Stevens told the paper there was nothing \"racial that motivated\" the incident, and said they were simply roommates who did not get along.\n\nDelaware: Beau's death convinced Joe Biden not to run for president\n\nHad he run for president, Joe Biden believes he would have taken the oath of office Jan. 20 rather than the train home to Wilmington. The former vice president and Delaware senator, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom days before leaving office, revealed in his emotional book that he originally considered staying out of the 2016 race to pave the way for his son Beau's budding political career, and Beau’s death following a brutal bout with cancer ultimately convinced him it wasn’t the time to make the run. So what about a 2020 push? He hasn’t ruled it out quite yet.\n\nFlorida: Irma devastates the Gulf coast\n\nHurricane Irma sawed up Florida's Gulf coast in early September, the strongest hurricane the Sunshine State had faced in a decade. Its slow crawl toward Florida caused a run on hardware store and grocery essentials, while evacuation orders threw the state's highways into a standstill. After it pummeled Key West, the storm struck the Naples area, taking down trees and causing flooding across the state. All told, millions lost power and dozens died, including 14 people at a Hollywood nursing home, where a power outage left residents in sweltering conditions for three days. It sparked a criminal investigation in which 12 of the deaths were deemed homicides. Now, state lawmakers seek laws requiring assisted living facilities to have generators.\n\nGeorgia: Equifax data breach leaves millions of consumers vulnerable\n\nAtlanta-based company Equifax, once trusted to handle our credit scores, has become a pariah of the financial world since hackers stole the vital information of 145 million Americans in Equifax’s system. The breach announced this September included Social Security numbers, names, addresses and dates of birth. How did Equifax get into the mess? A security patch for a known system bug was issued but Equifax hadn’t installed it. Lawmakers asked questions, the CEO resigned, and a good chunk of America freaked out. One way consumers tried to protect themselves was by freezing their credit, but since everyone tried to do it at once, there were problems. Here's how to protect yourself from a breach.\n\nHawaii: Trump travel ban found trouble in paradise\n\nThe Aloha State was not a welcoming place for President Trump's plans to ban travel from a group of predominantly Muslim countries. The administration issued three versions of the ban in 2017 and all three were blocked by a federal judge in Hawaii. But despite the Hawaii bench’s best efforts to thwart the ban, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled this month that Trump’s order can take full effect while legal challenges against the latest version are still tied up in courts. By allowing the full travel ban to take effect for now, the justices may be signaling that they are likely to uphold it on the merits at a later date.\n\nIdaho: Bergdahl avoids jail time for disappearing from Afghanistan base\n\nSgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the U.S. Army soldier who disappeared from his base in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban, avoided jail time despite pleading guilty to desertion and misbehavior in front of the enemy. Former president Barack Obama won freedom for the Idaho native in 2014 by negotiating a prisoner swap with the Taliban militants. His case even became the subject of the second season of the podcast Serial. Bergdahl faced a life sentence for abandoning his post, but a military judge ruled to reduce him in rank to private and dishonorably discharge him. President Trump slammed the decision in a tweet, calling it, \"a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military.\"\n\nIllinois: Conspiracy, obstruction charges in Laquan McDonald killing\n\nThe dash cam footage was chilling. Sixteen shots fired at Laquan McDonald as the 17-year-old walked away from police. Now prosecutors say three Chicago police officers were trying to \"conceal the true facts\" in McDonald's death. A Cook County grand jury indicted the officers in June with state charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and misconduct. \"These defendants did more than merely obey an unofficial 'code of silence,'\" special prosecutor Patricia Brown Holmes said of the alleged coverup. Officer Jason Van Dyke previously pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trail on first-degree murder charges.\n\nIndiana: A canceled wedding, but love prevails\n\nWhen an Indiana couple called off their $30,000 wedding a week before the big day, they were stuck with a non-refundable reception. What did would-be bride Sarah Cummins do? She invited guests from four area homeless shelters. Her generosity inspired a local man to donate suits for guests, his tailor donated a few more and another local business contributed dresses and accessories. The July dinner, which included chicken, salmon, wedding cake and even a late-night snack of pizza, turned a painful situation positive, Cummins said. She now volunteers for a center for homeless families in Indianapolis.\n\nIowa: A giant wave connects sick kids to the outside world\n\nThe new children's hospital practically hangs over the University of Iowa's Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City. Before the season kicked off, a fan named Krista Young had an idea: \"Kinnick should hold a 'wave to the kids' minute during every game.\" The Facebook post went viral and on Sept. 2, when the Hawkeyes' football team hosted the Wyoming Cowboys, 68,000-plus fans rose, turned to the hospital and offered a long, sustained wave to sick children — some of whom haven't left in months — gathered near the windows to watch the game. Kristen Brown, a nurse at the Stead Family Children's Hospital, said the now-regular waves connect kids to the outside world. \"Anytime we can make them feel normal and a part of something, it's very meaningful,\" she said.\n\nKansas: Principal resigns after student newspaper questions her credentials\n\nA team of high school journalism students in Kansas published an investigative story questioning their incoming principal's qualifications. And then she resigned. The student reporters received national recognition after they revealed that Amy Robertson, their would-be new principal, received her master's and doctoral degrees from Corllins University, an unaccredited online school. Robertson, who currently works with an education consulting firm in Dubai, said she received her degrees before the university lost accreditation. The Pittsburg School Board accepted Robertson's resignation in April.\n\nKentucky: Passenger's removal from United flight sparks uproar\n\nOn April 9, Kentucky doctor David Dao was shown on video being forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Louisville. Dao was among four passengers scheduled to be removed to accommodate crew members. The footage of Dao screaming as he was pulled from the plane went viral. Days later, Dao's lawyer said he suffered a concussion and broken nose. The incident prompted United to make changes to its passenger policies. Two security officers involved in the incident were fired.\n\nLouisiana: 'I'm back': Steve Scalise returns to Congress after shooting\n\nWith two words, \"I'm back,\" Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise tweeted his remarkable return to the U.S. Capitol after a gunman critically wounded him during a congressional baseball team practice on June 14 outside Washington, D.C. Four others were shot before the gunman was killed. Scalise was discharged from the hospital six weeks later to begin a process of intensive rehabilitation. On September 28, Scalise got back to work, tweeting a photo of him and his wife Jennifer looking out at the National Mall from the Capitol. His return to the House floor was met by a standing ovation. \"You have no idea how great this feels to be back here at work in the people's House.\"\n\nMaine: Thousands send Christmas cards to dying boy\n\nJacob Thompson just wanted to celebrate one more Christmas. The 9-year-old from Maine, who had been diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma in February 2014, made a simple request when he was admitted to the hospital in October and was told he had only a month to live: Send Christmas cards. Tens of thousands of cards flew into Jacob's small hospital room as the boy's story captured the hearts of people across the nation. Having a love for penguins, he even got a special visit when the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut brought the tuxedo birds to meet their young fan. Thompson died Nov. 19.\n\nMaryland: The day the NFL took a knee\n\nNFL players responded in full force on a Sunday in September after President Trump repeatedly called for punishing players who didn’t stand during the national anthem. In the first game that day, a number of teammates from the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars either knelt or locked arms at a high-profile game in London. Landover, Md.-based Washington Redskins players stood with arms locked, though some players chose to kneel. And across the league demonstrations spread, as many players broke out of their routine by joining the protests or engaging in team-wide displays of unity. The protests first began in the 2016 season, when then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick said it was his way of speaking out against racial injustice and police brutality.\n\nMassachusetts: Michelle Carter gets 15 months in prison for texting boyfriend to commit suicide\n\n\"You can't think about it. You just have to do it. You said you were gonna do it.\" Michelle Carter, 20, sent dozens of texts like this encouraging her boyfriend Conrad Roy III, 18, to commit suicide, which Roy eventually did after Carter instructed him to get back in a truck filling with carbon monoxide. Carter was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison, of which she'll serve 15 months. The case was the first to determine the legality of telling someone to commit suicide. Legal experts are concerned that it could set a bad legal precedent.\n\nMichigan: '90s grunge lost an icon in Chris Cornell\n\nSoundgarden singer Chris Cornell's distinctive, nearly four-octave wail was nearly synonymous with the grunge-music era of the 1990s. Just hours after performing for a Detroit crowd in May, the 52-year-old was found unresponsive in his hotel room. The Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office ruled the death a suicide by hanging, although his family questioned the findings. Cornell was just one among many celebrities we lost this year.\n\nMinnesota: #MeToo movement hits Minnesota hard\n\nDemocratic Senator Al Franken announced his resignation in December after more than a half dozen women said he touched them improperly or made unwanted sexual advances. Franken disputed some accusations and suggested he was being held to a different standard than President Trump. Franken became the second member of Congress to announce his resignation due to sexual harassment allegations in 2017. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., a civil rights icon first elected to the House in 1964, stepped down after several women accused him of harassment. Franken's fellow Minnesotan Garrison Keillor, the iconic Prairie Home Companion host, was fired in November after allegations of \"inappropriate behavior.\"\n\nMississippi: Bringing 'insane asylum' dead back to life\n\nUp to 7,000 dead bodies are buried underneath the University of Mississippi Medical Center campus. They are former patients of the state's first mental institution, called simply the Insane Asylum, built in 1855. Underground radar shows the coffins stretch across 20 acres of the campus. UMMC discovered 66 coffins while doing construction on the campus in 2013, but has since detected thousands more. UMMC is now teaming up with a professor from Millsaps College in Jackson for a possible National Endowment of Humanities grant that would fund a study of the asylum and its history as well as engage families whose ancestors lived there. The center is looking at exhuming the bodies, and preserving as well as studying the remains.\n\nMissouri: Girl mistakes elk for deer, shoots it dead, story goes viral\n\nAbby Wilson, 14, was hunting alone when she said she spotted a very large white-tailed deer and pulled the trigger. The problem? It wasn't a deer. It was an elk. Her father, Donald White, immediately called the conservation department upon realizing his daughter's mistake. Because there's no elk hunting season in Missouri, the animals are protected and wildlife officials are determining whether to issue any citations or warnings to the young hunter. After the story went viral, White said comments directed at her, including that she should be locked up, amounted to bullying.\n\nMontana: Body slam shows just one of many threats facing journalists\n\nThe first year of the Trump era was a tough one for American journalists. On top of competing with \"alternative facts\" and being labeled the \"enemy of the American people\" by the president, some reporters were physically stopped from doing their jobs. In May, wealthy businessman Greg Gianforte, who was running for Montana's open House seat, was arrested for assaulting Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs on the eve of the election. Gianforte won over Montana voters but apparently lied to investigators after the body slam.\n\nNebraska: Sasse sasses Trump\n\nIt's no secret that Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse took his fair share of jabs at President Trump this year. The young Republican from Plainview recently asked the president if he was \"recanting\" his oath of office following an apparent threat of the freedom of the press. He also called out Trump for his Twitter attack on the hosts of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" saying \"it's beneath the dignity of your office.\" Sasse's and other GOP legislators', well, sass, highlights Trump's struggle to make nice with Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nNevada: Deadliest year for mass killings in more than a decade\n\nOn Oct. 1, America changed forever when a gunman shattered his hotel windows at the Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegas and opened fire on 22,000 country music fans at the outdoor Route 91 Harvest Festival. Fifty-eight would die in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Nearly 500 were injured. The gunman's motive remains a mystery. A wounded country came together again in November when a gunman killed 25 people, including a pregnant woman whose unborn baby also died, during a church service in Sutherland Springs, Texas. With that, 2017 earned a bitter honor of being the most deadly year for mass killings in the U.S. in more than a decade. Three of the five largest mass killings — in Sutherland Springs, Las Vegas and at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. — have taken place since June 2016.\n\nNew Hampshire: Voter fraud or bogus claims?\n\nFollowing the 2016 election, President Trump called for a crackdown on voter fraud. Trump claimed he lost New Hampshire because thousands of Massachusetts residents were bused to New Hampshire to cast illegal votes against him. The solution? A voter fraud election commission was set up to investigate the matter. To date, legal experts and the New Hampshire deputy secretary of state said there is no evidence of voter fraud and the commission itself seems to have gone dark in recent weeks, with the last meeting held Sept. 12 in the Granite State.\n\nNew Jersey: Chris Christie feels the heat over 'beachgate'\n\nJust before the Fourth of July, Governor Chris Christie was spotted lounging outside his residence on Island Beach State Park. The only problem? He'd just closed that beach to the public — and all the other state parks in New Jersey — thanks to a state government shutdown. The photo became the source of endless memes, and New Jersey residents told the governor to \"get the hell off the beach!\" A few weeks before \"beachgate,\" a poll found Christie's approval ratings had sunk to 15%, making him the least popular governor in any state in the past 20 years. After legislators struck a deal in ending the three day shutdown in time for the holiday, Christie announced he was headed right back to the beach.\n\nNew Mexico: Plague found, and this isn't the first time\n\nThe plague, once called the Black Death, wiped out nearly half of the European population in the Middle Ages. And while it sounds like a disease that should have no place in modern times, each spring and summer cases pop up, often in Western areas. In late June, New Mexico confirmed a total of three cases of the plague in Santa Fe County. According to the New Mexico Department of Health, all three were hospitalized and later released. So, how does one get the plague? It’s typically transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas, and while terrifying sounding, it can be treated if the symptoms are recognized early.\n\nNew York: Terror in NYC\n\nIt was New York City's worst terrorist attack since 9/11, and occurred just a few blocks away from where the iconic twin towers crumbled. This November, Sayfullo Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan with ties to the Islamic State, ran down cyclists and pedestrians on a busy bike path before crashing into a school bus, killing 8 people and injuring 12. Saipov's killings occurred mere hours before the city's annual Halloween parade was to kick off, but revelers were undeterred. Amid heavier police presence, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio joined a million people who marched and danced down 6th Avenue in defiance of terror. De Blasio said, \"What New Yorkers showed already is we will not change, we will not be cowed, we will not be thrown off by anything.\"\n\nNorth Carolina: Gerrymandering case struck down case, but what’s next?\n\nThe United States Supreme Court in June struck down dozens of state legislative districts in North Carolina because they disadvantaged black voters. Then, federal judges rejected a request by North Carolina voters to hold special elections next March in new districts once lines are redrawn to eliminate illegal racial gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is the deliberate process of redrawing lines to sway electoral outcomes in favor of a certain political party. As Karl Rove once said: \"He who controls redistricting can control Congress.\" The issue has also been disputed in other states across the USA this year, particularly Wisconsin, which has a gerrymandering case before the Supreme Court with far-reaching national implications.\n\nNorth Dakota: Dakota Access Pipeline flows amid controversy\n\nAfter months of protests from environmental groups and Native American activists, the Army said it would allow the $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline to cross under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota, completing the disputed project. The 1,200-mile pipeline began transporting crude oil on June 1 from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a distribution hub in Illinois. Activists renewed calls to shut it down after a federal judge ruled the Army Corps of Engineers complied with some, but not all, requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act before issuing a permit. The developer of the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, has since filed a $1 billion federal lawsuit against several environmental groups accusing them of fraud, eco-terrorism and participation in a criminal enterprise.\n\nOhio: Otto Warmbier's death, and a year of high-stakes tension with North Korea\n\nThe death of Ohio native Otto Warmbier was a heartbreaking moment in a year of marked tensions with North Korea. Warmbier, a college student at the University of Virginia, was arrested in North Korea on charges of trying to steal a poster. The 22-year-old was returned home in June in a coma; he died shortly thereafter. Pyongyang denied it tortured or mistreated him, claiming Warmbier contracted botulism and was given a sleeping pill. Throughout 2017, President Trump and Kim Jong Un, whom Trump dubbed \"Little Rocket Man,\" exchanged ever more heated threats over North Korea's rapid development of nuclear weapons that could strike the U.S. mainland.\n\nOklahoma: Another blow to Black Lives Matter\n\n\"Hands up, don't shoot,\" became a rallying cry after Michael Brown was killed in 2014 in Ferguson, Mo. Terence Crutcher had his hands up. Police shot. In May, a jury acquitted of first-degree manslaughter white Tulsa officer Betty Jo Shelby, who says she fired out of fear last year when she killed 40-year-old Crutcher. His family burst into tears at the verdict. In a video of the incident, the Tulsa Police Department can be heard saying Crutcher \"looks like a bad dude.\" Crutcher's twin sister later said, \"That 'big bad dude' was a father ... a son.\" The controversial verdict led to protests from Black Lives Matter. Shelby has since resigned from the Tulsa Police Department.\n\nOregon: The Great American Eclipse captivates a nation\n\nFor the first time in almost 100 years, a total solar eclipse spanned across the country. Americans paused and enjoyed some unity as the moon passed between the sun and the Earth. Many traveled to the path of totality to experience the eerie darkness. From coast to coast, Americans watched — hopefully while wearing eclipse glasses — as the moon's shadow traced its 67-mile wide path across the country starting in Oregon. Those 2-3 minutes of darkness brought millions of tourist dollars to hotels, campgrounds, restaurants and museums in cities in the eclipse path.\n\nPennsylvania: They gave him 18 drinks. Then, left him to die\n\nThe horrifying death of a 19-year-old fraternity pledge captured on video exposed dangerous hazing rituals by members of Penn State University's Beta Theta Pi. After frat brothers gave Timothy Piazza 18 drinks in less than one hour and 22 minutes, his blood-alcohol content was about four times the legal limit for driving. Piazza was found unconscious in the basement the next day and later died. At least two dozen face charges in the case. Three other pledges across the nation died this year in Greek-related drinking incidents.\n\nRhode Island: Michael Flynn, and the role of Russia in the 2016 election\n\nDespite being one of the most vulnerable figures in special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn remained beloved in his Rhode Island hometown in 2017. Flynn was ousted from the White House just weeks after President Trump's inauguration over his Russian contacts, and in December, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Flynn is among four campaign aides charged so far in Mueller's investigation. Flynn is the only one who served in Trump's administration. The only other guilty plea is George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign associate Rick Gates have been charged and pleaded not guilty. In addition to Mueller's investigation, three Congressional committees are looking at Russia.\n\nSouth Carolina: Governor stands by Trump amid sanctuary city crackdown\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster made it clear in October that the Palmetto State would not tolerate any cities acting as sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants. The governor's strong condemnation of sanctuary cities came months after President Trump's executive order cracking down on cities that limit cooperation with immigration agencies. Following the order, leaders of some of the nation's biggest cities, including New York City, Chicago, and Boston, flatly stated they would not cooperate with the president. In November, a federal judge permanently blocked Trump's executive order on sanctuary cities.\n\nSouth Dakota: Old gold mine might hold treasured info on why we exist\n\nResearchers are in search of a different kind of treasure in a rural South Dakota gold mine: potential secrets explaining how the universe was created. The mine in Lead, S.D., that once hosted gold rushes in the 1800s will serve as home to scientists participating in the largest U.S.-based particle physics experiment. The experiment will determine whether particles called neutrinos help explain our existence. Over the next 10 years, workers will remove more than 870,000 tons of rock and install a four-story, 70,000-ton neutrino detector. The collaboration will involve 1,000 scientists from more than 30 countries.\n\nTennessee: Tuition-free community college\n\nTennessee students can put away their checkbooks if community colleges are in their future. In May, the southern state became the first to offer a tuition-free education to nearly every resident without a degree. Even though Tennessee was the first state to pass the measure, it isn't without precursors. New York legislators passed a budget in April that covered tuition for families making less than $100,000 a year. In February, San Francisco voters passed a tax measure that would cover community college tuition for anyone who lived in the city for more than a year, though the state of California did not follow suit.\n\nTexas: Hurricane Harvey hit hard\n\nHurricane Harvey's historic downpour brought destruction to the Texas Gulf coast. Harvey killed dozens, dumped more than 50 inches of rain and drove thousands from their homes. Its effects will be felt for months and years into the future. Amid the destruction, people stepped up to help. There was Houston Texans star J.J. Watt raising more than $37 million in online donations, human chains pulling people to safety and an impromptu gospel singing performance at a shelter. Watt perhaps put it best: \"When times are the toughest, humanity stands at its strongest.\"\n\nUtah: Outcry over nurse's arrest for refusing to draw unconscious patient's blood\n\nA Utah police officer was fired after he arrested a nurse who refused to let him draw blood from an unconscious patient without a warrant. Body cam footage of the arrest shows Detective Jeff Payne dragging Alex Wubbels from University Hospital while she sobs \"this is crazy.\" An investigation was opened after video of the arrest went viral, and Wubbels received a $500,000 settlement from the city and the university that runs the hospital. She said she would give a portion of the settlement to the nurses union and help lead a campaign to stop physical and verbal abuse of nurses on the job.\n\nVermont: This 13-year-old wants to be governor\n\nEthan Sonneborn, 13, has some lofty political ambitions. The young Democrat announced this summer that he's running for governor in 2018, and with Vermont's founders imposing no age requirement for its highest office, his path to power is a little easier. The Bristol resident follows the news closely, chooses his words deliberately and sees his age as an asset, not a liability. \"We elected our oldest president ever,\" Sonneborn said, \"and he tweets like a kindergartner.\" His views on the president echo those of prominent Vermont progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, who told USA TODAY one year after the election that Trump's presidency is an \"unprecedented disaster.\" A hot topic Sonneborn would have to address if elected: recreational marijuana. Gov. Phil Scott vetoed a legalization bill in May, a decision with which Sonneborn took issue.\n\nVirginia: White supremacy in Charlottesville\n\nIt's 2017, and there were neo-Nazis in the streets. In August, hundreds of white nationalists, white supremacists and neo-Nazis descended upon Charlottesville, Va., for a \"Unite the Right\" rally to protest the removal of a Confederate statue of Robert E. Lee. The rally turned violent when James Alex Fields, Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, who had expressed support for neo-Nazi positions, drove his car at high speed into a crowd of protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. President Trump was reticent to condemn the white supremacists, saying \"many sides\" were to blame for the violence. After his comments, Heyer's mother said she wouldn't take phone calls from the president. The rally was headlined by far-right white nationalist Richard Spencer, who returned to the city for another protest in October. Here's why Charlottesville has become ground zero for white supremacists.\n\nWashington: Amazon's new dome home\n\nAmazon joined Apple and Google in the race to build futuristic tech headquarters, introducing the Spheres, three (you guessed it) spheres that will \"round\" out the Seattle cityscape. The tallest of the glass and metal orbs rises 90 feet and is more than 130 feet in diameter, with two smaller spheres on each side. The space will host up to 800 employees for potential meetings, meals and mingling. It will also feature plenty of plant life, along with tree-house meeting rooms, a river and waterfalls, and a green \"bird's nest\" conference room. The rest of the public can visit through shops located near the entrance or by signing up for tours once it opens next year.\n\nWest Virginia: Coal country digs Trump\n\nWest Virginia, once a Democratic stronghold, is now Trump country. West Virginia’s conservative shift has been so pronounced that Gov. Jim Justice changed his political stripes in August and flipped from Democrat to Republican after just seven months in office. The state hasn't gone Democrat in a presidential election since 1996, and Hillary Clinton lost there by more than 40%. President Trump, who promised to bring coal mining jobs back, also got 77% of the vote in the Republican primary there. Trump took a lot of heat for politicizing the Boy Scout Jamboree held in West Virginia in July (prompting an apology from the Boy Scouts) but he was right back in the state the following week to rally the base and tout an end to \"war on beautiful clean coal.\"\n\nWisconsin: Blacked-out vacationers suspect tainted booze\n\nAbbey Conner went on a family vacation to an all-inclusive Mexican resort in January, but shortly after arriving, she was found face down in the pool, brain dead. Connor's death days later sparked a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation that found 100-plus people saying they blacked out from moderate to light drinking at Mexican resorts. Some were robbed. Others were raped. Few ever found justice. The State Department issued an alert about possibly tainted or counterfeit alcohol. Mexican officials swept tourist spots and claimed to seize 10,000 gallons of illegal booze from a shoddy distributer. They reported no such evidence at the resort where Connor drowned.\n\nWyoming: Trump national parks moves met with backlash\n\nThis year may have been your last chance to visit Yellowstone without doling out $70 to do so. The Trump administration in October proposed a price increase for the Wyoming landmark and 16 other national parks. Trump also faced criticism — and legal action — for his decision to shrink federally protected land by about two million acres in Bear Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah earlier this month. In April, Trump signed an executive order to review more than a dozen national monuments across the USA.\n\nWashington, D.C.: Nation's capital becomes epicenter of the #resistance\n\nHome to the most massive manifestations of opposition to the Trump agenda in a year that saw #resistance protests and marches against the administration across the country, Washington, D.C., became a hotbed for public demonstrations countering the president. The Women's March on Washington was the first and fiercest, coming the day after Trump's inauguration (which did NOT draw the biggest crowd to the National Mall in history, despite some claims to the contrary) and drawing an estimated 500,000 people angered at a president accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct. Huge crowds also gathered for the March for Science, the People's Climate March and the March for Truth. Forgot about September's pro-Trump, Mother of All Rallies? It's understandable. Only a thousand folks turned out and it was held the same day as the historic Juggalo March.\n\nPuerto Rico: Maria devastates Puerto Rico, fueling feud with Trump\n\nHurricane Maria pounded Puerto Rico in late September, causing unprecedented devastation to the island of 3.4 million people. The storm knocked out the majority of Puerto Rico's power and sparked a feud between the island and President Trump. For those unclear, Puerto Rico is indeed part of the United States — it's a commonwealth — and yes, its residents are U.S. citizens. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz took shots at Trump for the government's response to Maria, which she called \"inadequate.\" Trump publicly bashed Cruz, saying she had \"poor leadership ability.\" Months after the storm, large parts of the island remained without power, prompting Washington to seek efforts to modernize Puerto Rico's power grid.\n\nGuam: Priest sex abuse cases shatter faith on Guam\n\nThe predominantly Catholic island of Guam was rocked when a Pacific Daily News investigation unearthed decades of sexual assault, manipulation and intimidation against children reared on the remote U.S. territory by some of its most revered men, the Catholic clergy. At least 143 cases of child sexual abuse have been reported against Catholic priests tied to Guam. Of those cases, 87 involve a single former priest and scoutmaster, Louis Brouillard, who allegedly committed horrendous sexual crimes against children, including accounts of rape, drugging and even tying up a boy before forced sex acts. Also among the accusations: a boy fondled on the way to his grandmother's burial, and another molested for the first time on his seventh birthday, then raped or assaulted 100 more times.\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands: Ravaged by back-to-back hurricanes\n\nBefore Hurricanes Irma and Maria made their way to Florida and Puerto Rico, they tore through the U.S. Virgin Islands, a cluster of American islands in the Caribbean. Weeks after the back-to-back September storms, Virgin Islanders – who are Americans by birth – were in the grips of a long and painful recovery. Thousands went without power, and telephone and internet coverage remained spotty. Many fled – perhaps never to return. When USA TODAY reporter Fredreka Schouten returned home, she found family and friends' houses torn apart, and her former school with windows blown out and metal littered about. The destruction brought back memories of past devastating storms – Hugo in 1989 and Marilyn in 1995.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nRemember when?\n\nThis is a compilation of stories from across USA TODAY and the USA TODAY Network.
