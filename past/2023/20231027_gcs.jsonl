But already, the tale is one of searing trauma, with the broader American Jewish community now again forced to be resilient as it’s reminded of the ever-present potential for disaster.\n\nA rabbi welcomes a stranger\n\nA stranger arrived that morning at the synagogue.\n\nRabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker welcomed in the man and made him a cup of tea, the rabbi told CBS on Monday.\n\nCytron-Walker may not have known immediately that Malik Faisal Akram, 44, was a British national. Akram had arrived in the US via New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in late December, a US law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nIn the two weeks before he met Cytron-Walker, Akram had spent three nights – January 6, 11 and 13 – at a Dallas homeless shelter, according to Union Gospel Mission Dallas CEO Bruce Butler. He was very quiet and wasn’t there long enough to build any relationships, Butler said.\n\nOver their shared tea, Cytron-Walker and Akram talked, the rabbi said.\n\n“Some of his story didn’t quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that’s not necessarily an uncommon thing,” said the rabbi, who soon that day would lead a religious service for the 157 membership families of his congregation, established in 1999.\n\nThe rabbi pointed Jeffrey Cohen, the vice president on the synagogue’s board of trustees, to their guest that day. Cohen went over and introduced himself, he wrote in a Facebook post describing his experience.\n\n“He was on the phone, but briefly stopped his conversation,” Cohen said. “He said hello, smiled, and after we introduced ourselves, I let him go back to his call. He seemed calm and happy to be in from the frigid 20 degree morning. His eyes weren’t darting around; his hands were open and calm, he said hello, he smiled.”\n\nBecause of the recent coronavirus surge, many of Congregation Beth Israel’s members had stayed home on Saturday to watch the weekly prayers via Facebook or Zoom. Services began at 10 a.m.\n\nAs the rabbi led the prayers – his back turned as he faced toward Jerusalem – he heard a click. It came from the stranger.\n\n“And it turned out, that it was his gun,” Cytron-Walker said.\n\nCohen said he heard that same click, the “unmistakable sound of an automatic slide engaging a round.” The mysterious guest then began yelling something. Cohen dialed 911 on his phone, put the screen side down and moved as commanded, he wrote.\n\nAkram took four people hostage, including the rabbi, authorities said.\n\n‘I’m going to die at the end of this’\n\nPolice got an emergency call at 10:41 a.m.\n\nThey rushed to the synagogue and set up a perimeter, evacuating residents nearby, police said. Soon, nearly 200 members of local, state and federal law enforcement, including the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on hand, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said.\n\nMeanwhile, the livestream – intended for the faithful who’d stayed home to be safe from Covid-19 – appeared to capture some of what Akram was saying.\n\n“I’m gunned up. I’m ammo-ed up,” he told someone he called nephew. “Guess what, I will die.”\n\nThe audio can be difficult to understand, and it’s not clear whom Akram is talking to. But it’s clear he planned to die during the standoff, he repeatedly told people.\n\n“OK, are you listening? I don’t want you to cry. Listen! I’m going to release these four guys … but then I’m going to go in the yard, yeah? … And they’re going to take me, alright? I’m going to die at the end of this, alright? Are you listening? I am going to die! OK? So, don’t cry over me,” the man said to someone else.\n\nCongregation member Stacey Silverman watched the livestream for more than an hour. She heard the suspect ranting, sometimes switching between saying, “I’m not a criminal,” to apologies, she said.\n\nThe man vacillated among languages and was “screaming hysterically,” she said. He claimed to have a bomb.\n\nAkram also “spoke repeatedly about a convicted terrorist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States,” the FBI said in a statement. The convict is believed to be Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani with a PhD in neuroscience who is serving a federal prison sentence in Fort Worth after being found guilty of attempted murder and other charges in an assault on US officers in Afghanistan.\n\nShe was not involved in the Colleyville attack, her attorney said Saturday.\n\n“He wanted this woman released and he wanted to talk to her and he thought – well, he said point-blank – he chose this synagogue because ‘Jews control the world. Jews control the media. Jews control the banks. I want to talk to chief rabbi of the United States,’” Cohen told CNN, adding there is no chief rabbi in the US.\n\nInside the synagogue, Cohen resisted following exactly as Akram commanded, he wrote in his Facebook post. Rather than go to the back of the room as ordered, Cohen stayed in line with one of the exits. When a police officer came to the door and the hostage-taker became more agitated, Cohen moved closer to the exit door, he wrote.\n\nAkram let them call their families, and Cohen called his wife, daughter and son and even posted on Facebook. He also slowly moved a few chairs in front of him – “anything to slow or divert a bullet or shrapnel,” he wrote.\n\nAt one point – at the suspect’s request – the rabbi being held hostage called a well-known rabbi in New York City so the suspect could say Siddiqi was framed and he wanted her released, two officials briefed on investigation said.\n\nAs hours ticked on, law enforcement negotiators had a “high frequency and duration of contact” with the suspect, DeSarno said. The FBI called out its Hostage Rescue Team from Quantico, Virginia, and some 60 to 70 people came to the site, Colleyville Police Chief Michael Miller said.\n\nOne hostage – a man – was released unharmed around 5 p.m., Colleyville Police Sgt. Dara Nelson said. The hostage-taker did not harm the hostages, the rabbi told CBS.\n\nBut, he added, they were threatened the entire time.\n\nA thrown chair activates a bold escape\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Police speak out after synagogue hostages were rescued 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nWith threats and attacks targeting Jewish people growing more common in recent years, Cytron-Walker and his congregation had participated in security courses with law enforcement agencies, he said.\n\nAs Saturday afternoon rolled to the night – and the hostage-taker’s demeanor began to change – that training helped the rabbi and the two others who were still held against their will.\n\n“In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” Cytron-Walker said Sunday in a statement. “Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself.”\n\nCohen helped another hostage move closer to that exit, and whispered to him about the door, he wrote. The third hostage later joined them when they received pizza to eat, putting them all within 20 feet of the exit door.\n\nThey spoke with Akram and asked him questions, trying to buy the FBI time to move into position, he wrote.\n\nYet the situation began to devolve. “At one point, our attacker instructed us to get on our knees. I reared up in my chair, stared at him sternly. I think I slowly moved my head and mouthed NO. He stared at me, then moved back to sit down. It was this moment when Rabbi Charlie yelled run,” he wrote.\n\nCytron-Walker saw his opening when he got the gunman a drink in a glass, he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday.\n\n“As he was drinking, the gun wasn’t in the best position and I thought this was our best chance, I needed to make sure the people who were still with me that they were ready to go,” the rabbi said.\n\n“And so there was a chair that was right in front of me. I told the guys to go, I picked it up and I threw it at him with all the adrenaline,” Cytron-Walker said. “It was absolutely terrifying and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be shot, and I did not hear a shot fired as I made it out the door. I was the last one out.”\n\nThe three hostages burst through the exit door and sprinted away from the building, video taken from outside the synagogue by CNN affiliate WFAA shows. Seconds later, a man in black holding what appears to be a gun stepped halfway through the exit to look outside. He then returned inside the building without shooting, the video shows.\n\nA group of heavily armed law enforcement personnel moved toward another part of the building, the video shows. About 30 seconds later, a series of four bangs erupted, followed by a louder explosive boom that set a number of car alarms to begin wailing. Other armed law enforcement personnel moved into a different position by the building, and another three loud bangs then went off, the video shows.\n\nThe loud boom, heard by a CNN team near the synagogue at about 9:12 p.m., was the result of entry tools used by the hostage rescue team, an ATF spokesperson said.\n\nThe rescue team breached the synagogue, Miller said. The suspect was killed.\n\nNone of the four hostages was harmed, DeSarno said.\n\nMore booms echoed as the tactical team disposed of leftover entry explosives brought by the rescue team. Crime scene investigators recovered one firearm they believe belonged to the suspect, the ATF spokesperson said. An ATF dog found no more explosives, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Facebook, Cohen credited active shooter training he received for his survival and escape.\n\n“We weren’t released or freed,” he said. “We escaped because we had training from the Secure Community Network on what to do in the event of an active shooter.”\n\nThe Secure Community Network describes itself as the “official safety and security organization of the Jewish community in North America.”\n\n“Those courses, that instruction, helped me to understand that you need to act in moments where your life is threatened. I would not have had the courage, I would not have had the knowhow or what to do without that instruction,” Cytron-Walker said. “I want people to understand, it doesn’t matter if you are in a synagogue, if you’re Jewish, if you’re Muslim, if you’re Christian, if you’re religious at all, it can happen in a shopping mall. Unfortunately this is the world that we’re living in.”\n\n‘The time to heal our community has begun’\n\nOn Sunday morning, Cytron-Walker took to Facebook, this time to express his gratitude to those who supported him throughout Saturday’s ordeal.\n\n“I am thankful and filled with appreciation for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support, all of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us,” he wrote in the Facebook post.\n\n“I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the CBI Community, the Jewish Community, the Human Community. I am grateful that we made it out. I am grateful to be alive,” Cytron-Walker said in the post.\n\nNothing suggests the threat posed by Akram is continuing, officials said. The investigation into the case and its motive is likely to be global, DeSarno added, including contacts with Tel Aviv and London.\n\nInitially, the FBI, based on its exchanges, found the suspect to be “singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community, but we’ll continue to work to find motive,” DeSarno said.\n\nOn Monday, the agency called Saturday’s attack “a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted,” according to a statement. The case “is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.”\n\nCongregation Beth Israel held a special service Monday night at which the rabbi spoke about the need to heal after the incident.\n\n“Thank God, thank God,” Cytron-Walker said. “It could’ve been so much worse, and I am overflowing, truly overflowing, with gratitude.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/12/surprise-vacation-yard-sale-reprieve-teacher-sick-day-news-around-states/114862294/", "title": "Surprise vacation, yard sale reprieve, teacher sick day: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State health officials are urging people to serve up a heaping side of precaution at Thanksgiving, as the holiday comes amid a national surge in COVID-19 cases. Officials say people should skip large family gatherings in favor of scaled-back events. “We all want to see our family at holiday time, and yet this is a special year. This is a year unlike any we’ve ever had,” Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said. “Many things maybe could be done virtually, which is not nearly as much fun but certainly safer.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines. Suzanne Judd, an epidemiologist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s School of Public Health, said Thanksgiving is particularly problematic because it’s a holiday celebrated by family gatherings indoors. “Gatherings greater than 10 people pose a substantial risk of one of the people being COVID-positive and not knowing,” Judd said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The spread of the coronavirus at the state’s largest prison has accelerated beyond an initial outbreak, with 110 inmates testing positive for the virus as of Monday. Goose Creek Correctional Center first announced a virus outbreak at the facility Nov. 2, when the Alaska Department of Corrections said 22 inmates and five staff members tested positive, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The prison west of Wasilla near Point McKenzie housed 1,317 pretrial and sentenced prisoners as of Monday, department spokeswoman Sarah Gallagher said. Staff are required and inmates are strongly encouraged to wear masks, she said. The outbreak began in one of the prison’s housing units, known as mods. Each mod has 64 prisoners, indicating the outbreak has expanded beyond a single unit, Gallagher said. Each mod continues to operate as a “family unit” in order to minimize the risk of further transmission, Gallagher said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With the state reporting a daily average of 1,900 new COVID-19 cases over the past week, Gov. Doug Ducey has urged residents to be careful. In a video posted Tuesday, Ducey urged Arizona residents to wear face coverings, wash hands, practice social distancing and stay home when sick. “Gatherings of families and friends from outside your household are no safer than going to the grocery store,” he said. Ducey, a Republican, has not implemented a statewide masking requirement, while many local governments in the state have done so. He announced no new virus prevention initiatives in the video posted on social media and his office’s website. He cited past moves that included increasing testing and providing money to hospitals for protective gear, staffing and ventilators. Ducey said he wants to protect public health “keep our economy safely open and moving, We know that both are important to the health and well-being of Arizonans.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations again hit a new high Tuesday, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson resisted calls for new restrictions on businesses or gatherings to combat a surge in coronavirus cases. An outbreak of the virus among state legislators also grew to 11 on Tuesday, with a lawmaker testing positive. The Department of Health reported 24 more people were hospitalized because of COVID-19, bringing the state’s virus hospitalizations to a new high of 810. The state’s confirmed and probable virus cases rose by 1,424 to 124,235. “The numbers aren’t good, the trend is not good, and we have a lot of work to do here in Arkansas and across the nation,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news briefing on the virus. The state’s COVID-19 deaths rose by four to 2,112. The Republican governor said many of the state’s cases are coming from smaller gatherings at homes that he said can’t be regulated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city will study the feasibility of using its enormous convention center as a temporary shelter for the increasing number of homeless people living on the streets. City Councilman Curren Price introduced a motion Tuesday seeking a report on what it would take to transform the 720,000-square-foot LA Convention Center in his downtown district. The property has not been used for conventions since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, the pandemic has forced more people into homelessness, Price said. With more than 60,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, encampments have gone up throughout the region on sidewalks, in empty lots and under freeway overpasses. “We’re in a panic situation along with a pandemic situation. Folks on the streets are just suffering,” Price told the Los Angeles Times. “We have to do a better job of housing individuals who are homeless.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Department of Public Health and Environment has routinely deleted emails related to the coronavirus pandemic even though the state archives has asked that they be saved, a newspaper has found. The Denver Post reports it discovered that emails sent and received by state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy were deleted after the newspaper requested documents. The department said it would provide some records, including emails. But it said emails “from May would have already been auto-deleted unless otherwise preserved, or they were previously deleted by Dr. Herlihy as part of a normal business process,” said Monica Wilkerson, the department’s records and legal services liaison. As of last year, the department deleted most employee emails after 90 days. The policy mirrors similar practices by the state government. The Colorado State Archives posted a notice in June asking agencies to “keep all records related to COVID-19.” Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition Executive Director Jeff Roberts said it is important to keep records so that journalists can report on a crisis affecting the health and safety of residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Canaan: More than 350 students and 20 teachers in a wealthy suburb are in quarantine after a new round of coronavirus testing turned up 15 infections, according to the local school district. New Canaan schools on Tuesday reported 13 students and two teachers tested positive, days after all 540 tests of students came back negative, the Stamford Advocate reports. There were also 26 new positive tests last weekend, First Selectman Kevin Moynihan said. “We continue to see cases spread from gatherings, dinner parties, out-of-town caregivers, house cleaners and, not unexpectedly, within families,” Moynihan said. “This rapid case increase over the weekend illustrates how fast community transmission spreads and accelerates.” The most recent testing resulted in quarantines for 213 students at New Canaan High School, 70 at Saxe Middle School and 70 at three elementary schools. People in quarantine are told they must stay home for 14 days.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Attorneys for a cleric say they’ve reached a settlement with Gov. John Carney over the coronavirus restrictions he imposed on worship services. The Rev. Christopher Allan Bullock filed a lawsuit in May claiming Carney’s restrictions were unconstitutional and discriminatory. Carney then rescinded many of the restrictions, and his lawyers argued Bullock’s claims were moot. But Bullock’s attorneys asked for an injunction prohibiting the governor from imposing similar limitations in the future. Lawyers representing the New Castle County pastor and community activist said Wednesday that the settlement requires the governor to treat houses of worship in a neutral manner in any future emergency. Among other things, if certain businesses or activities are considered essential, that definition will include churches. Attorney Thomas Neuberger said the state also agreed to pay the plaintiffs $150,000 in lawyer fees and $7,200 in court costs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. reported 206 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday – its highest single-day total since late May, WUSA-TV reports. Daily test data lags behind and is only available up to Nov. 7, so it’s unclear what, if any, connection to the weekend’s celebrations these numbers may have. The city is now averaging more than 100 new cases a day for the first time since May 30.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than a dozen Miami nurses and front-line health care workers are finally getting a well-deserved break. The group was scheduled for an upcoming, mandatory – aka boring – 48-hour training but was instead surprised with an island vacation to the Florida Keys. Jackson Health System supervisors were asked to choose staff who went above and beyond during the pandemic. Many of the staff, including respiratory therapists and lab techs, have not been able to take any time off during the pandemic to relax or spend time with their loved ones and have been working tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients, the hospital said. The 50 workers were told they had to attend a two-day training, but when they gathered at the hospital Tuesday, they were handed gift boxes with gift certificates. Hawks Cay Resort in the Florida Keys donated two-night stays to its island on Duck Key, surrounded by sparkling waters and swaying palm trees, as part of its Heroes Salute program.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is again hitting a new peak in public high school graduation rates. The state Department of Education said Tuesday that 83.8% of seniors graduated on time in the spring. That’s the highest level recorded since Georgia began calculating according to current methods, which require a student to graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma, and rose from 82% in 2019. The state says part of the increase came from a waiver allowing the state to count students with significant cognitive disabilities, about 1% of students overall, as graduating on time even if they take more than four years to complete high school. Because of the pandemic, many high school students did not have to take end-of-course exams last year, which would have counted for 20% of their overall grade. Most students take the courses that require the exams before their senior year, so it’s unclear whether the lack of tests influenced Georgia’s graduation rates.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Bankruptcies declined in October for the eighth time in 10 months as state unemployment reached a national high of 15.1% and as tourism was in the beginning stage of reopening after a major economic downturn. There were 125 bankruptcy filings in October, a 22.6% decrease from the 162 during the same period in the previous year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Data provided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, showed bankruptcy filings were down 9.8% to 1,274 for the year through October compared to 1,412 during the same period in 2019. Chapter 7 liquidation filings, the most common type of bankruptcy, fell 19.8% in October to 93 from 116 in the year-earlier period. Chapter 13 filings, which allow people with regular income sources to establish installment payment plans to creditors over three to five years, dropped 27.3% to 32 from 44 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge dismissed a case against a woman who was cited for holding a yard sale authorities said violated the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order. Judge Van Valin on Friday dismissed the case brought by officials who said the yard sale was not an “essential business,” The Idaho Statesman reports. Valin ruled the yard sale conducted in April by Christa Thompson of Rathdrum was not a business. Defense attorney Edward Dindinger said in a statement that the judge ruled the language of the stay-at-home order issued in response to the coronavirus pandemic did not apply to Thompson. The Rathdrum Police Department said in April that the event was a “large nonessential yard sale” that filled the front yard and spilled into the back yard of her home. Thompson held the sale “to liquidate her late father-in-law’s estate,” Dindinger said. Thompson faced a possible sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state set another single-day record for coronavirus infections Tuesday, pushing the total number of people who have tested positive in the state since the pandemic began past 500,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker presented statistics to show that hospitalizations are nearing their spring peak, when the initial wave of infections had officials scrambling for hospital beds and professionals to tend them. State public health officials reported 12,623 newly confirmed cases of the virus, nearly 15% higher than the previous record set Saturday, when cases also topped 12,000. In Chicago, officials reported a daily average of 1,686 new cases, roughly four times higher than a month ago. “There are no signs of slowing,” Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said. Hospitalizations jumped 7.5% in one day to 4,742. The seven-day average of 4,207 in hospital beds is creeping toward the 4,822 average hit May 5.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is continuing its record-setting increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new infections, health officials said Tuesday as the state once again surpassed 4,000 new cases and reported 63 more deaths. The newly reported deaths raised Indiana’s pandemic death toll to 4,731, including confirmed and presumed coronavirus infections, the Indiana State Department of Health said in its daily statistics update. The 4,879 infections reported Tuesday were Indiana’s second-highest daily count of newly reported coronavirus cases and marked the sixth straight day the state reported more than 4,000 new cases. Indiana’s seven-day rolling average for newly confirmed cases rose to 4,490, according to Tuesday’s daily update of the state’s coronavirus dashboard. That is the highest level Indiana has seen during the pandemic and more than five times the seven-day rolling average of 858 newly confirmed cases the agency reported Sept. 22.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two more state prisons are reporting outbreaks of coronavirus infections, according to the Iowa Department of Corrections. Recent testing has revealed outbreaks at prisons in Clarinda, where 377 inmates and 16 staff members are positive, and Rockwell City, where 254 inmates and four staff members are positive, a DOC report updated Sunday shows. The Clarinda prison has about 900 inmates, and Rockwell City has 426. The department released data Friday showing an outbreak at the Anamosa prison, and the updated numbers show 485 infected inmates of the 982 inmates at the prison. An additional 50 staff members tested positive. Additional smaller prison outbreaks are reported at Mount Pleasant, where 18 inmates and five staff members are positive, and the women’s prison in Mitchellville, where four inmates and 10 staff members are positive.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s largest public school district, in Wichita, has scrapped plans to allow its middle and high school students to attend some in-person classes, and three counties have imposed new restrictions inspired by the coronavirus pandemic. The moves by local officials come as the state works to expand its overall testing capacity so under a “unified” statewide strategy announced by Gov. Laura Kelly in late September. The strategy calls for regular testing of at-risk populations, including first responders, prison inmates, nursing home residents, and K-12 students and staff, as well as more aggressive testing in virus hot spots. The state plans to spend at least $53 million in federal coronavirus relief funds on contracts with private laboratories. But Kelly said Tuesday during a Statehouse news conference: “It won’t work if people are not abiding by the other safety protocols, particularly wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentuckians should avoid large Thanksgiving gatherings as a safeguard to protect extended family and friends from a surging COVID-19 outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Instead, in-person get-togethers should be limited to people from the same household, he said. While the health guidelines might be tough to swallow, the guidance can save lives as Kentucky struggles with its worst outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic governor said. “That person that you may think that you will really miss sitting across the table from you this year, I want to make sure is across the table from you next year,” Beshear said at a news conference. “And this right now is the most dangerous time we’ve had in this virus.” The Thanksgiving guidance came as the state reported 2,120 new virus cases – its highest total for a Tuesday and fifth-highest day overall, Beshear said. He also reported 14 more virus-related deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Shoppers will see state sales taxes suspended for two days this month, under a bill passed by lawmakers in their latest special session and signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, a Gonzales Republican, sponsored the measure to help residents and businesses recovering from hurricanes Laura and Delta and coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The state sales tax holiday will be held Nov. 20-21. Louisiana’s 4.45% state sales tax will not be charged on the first $2,500 of a purchase. The holiday doesn’t cover car, truck and other vehicle purchases. And it doesn’t apply to local sales taxes. The state is estimated to lose $4.5 million in sales tax collections because of the tax holiday, according to a nonpartisan financial analysis of the bill.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers plan to hold their first legislative sessions at the Augusta Civic Center instead of the Statehouse as coronavirus cases grow. The city-owned, 49,000-square-foot civic center, about 3 miles from the Statehouse, is typically used for events such as concerts, agriculture conventions and conferences. It would provide more space than the Statehouse, and that would make it easier to observe social distancing, a spokeswoman for outgoing Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon told the Portland Press Herald. The full Legislature last met in March. The top priority for lawmakers will be crafting a new, two-year state budget at a time when Maine’s finances have been stressed by the pandemic. New Hampshire lawmakers took a similar approach in June when they met in the University of New Hampshire Whittemore Center Arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will reduce indoor operations for bars and restaurants from 75% to 50% in response to rising coronavirus cases and increased hospitalizations, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday. The new limits took effect Wednesday. “Last week, I said that the warning lights were starting to blink on the dashboard and that it appeared we were approaching a critical turning point in the fight. Today, I’m reporting that we have now crossed over into the danger zone,” Hogan said at a news conference. “Too many residents and businesses have COVID fatigue and have begun letting their guard down.” State health officials also have issued a public health advisory effective immediately to strongly discourage indoor gatherings of 25 people or more at family gatherings or house parties. Contact tracing data has shown an increase in cases resulting from such gatherings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases could force the state to once again open field hospitals to care for a possible overflow of patients as intensive care units fill up, Gov. Charlie Baker warned Tuesday. Hospitals are also prepared to make an additional 400 beds available for COVID-19 patients by converting acute care beds to ICU beds to deal with an expected rise in cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus during the fall and winter, Baker said at a press conference. “The trends obviously are going in the wrong direction and show no signs of changing,” he said. When and where field hospitals might be set up depends on space and need, Baker said. Massachusetts residents had done a good job controlling the virus after an initial spike in the spring but are getting careless and allowing the virus to get a toehold again, leading to a second surge, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state on Tuesday posted a record number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases, near 6,500, and reported 59 deaths within the previous 24 hours – its deadliest day in six months. COVID-19, which subsided over the summer after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer imposed sweeping stay-at-home and other restrictions, has rebounded this fall. Asked if she might again order people to stay home, the Democrat said she was talking with the state health department about potential next steps. Mask requirements and gathering limits remain in effect despite a “confusing” state Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a law she used to issue orders, she said. Whitmer said she will not see extended family in person for Thanksgiving and said it is “inherently dangerous” to have more than one household in an enclosed space without ventilation and open windows. The state’s latest average positivity rate is 9.4%, up from 4.9% two weeks ago.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials reported a record 56 new deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said. Walz told Minnesota Public Radio the daily report shows positivity rates above 20%, an important measure of how fast the disease is spreading. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Minnesota has nearly doubled over the past two weeks from just under 7% on Oct. 27 to nearly 13% on Tuesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. The governor made the comments a day after warning Minnesotans that the state is approaching the worst phase of the pandemic and that conditions will get dramatically worse unless people start changing their behavior. He said it won’t be unusual for people to open their newspapers and see 50 to 60 new deaths. “This is just inevitable if we do not change our behaviors and take some mitigation efforts.” Walz told MPR. Minnesota’s previous record was 36 deaths, reported Friday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he, his wife and their three daughters are in isolation after the youngest tested positive for the coronavirus. Maddie Reeves, 8, attends a private elementary school in Jackson. The Republican governor said in a social media post: “She feels OK, but could still use prayers! Please pray for her momma too!” Reeves also said everyone in his family is being tested for the virus. The governor announced his daughter’s infection shortly after he canceled his coronavirus news conference that was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. An executive order issued by Reeves requires children and teachers to wear masks in public and private schools. Sixteen of Mississippi’s 82 counties have been under a mask mandate that was set to expire Wednesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Twenty-eight employees of an election board have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, and a director believes they most likely got infected from voters, though local health officials aren’t convinced. The Jackson County Election Board’s Republican director, Tammy Brown, said Tuesday that eight full-time and 20 part-time employees tested positive for the virus in the past 21/ 2 weeks. Most are doing well and recovering at home, but two are hospitalized, including one in intensive care, Brown said. Jackson County is Missouri’s second-largest county, behind St. Louis County. While Kansas City is part of Jackson County, the city has its own election board. The Jackson County board handled votes cast by nearly 200,000 people. Jackson County Health Department spokeswoman Kayla Parker said community transmission is so widespread that determining the source would be next to impossible.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the state’s chief epidemiologist said the spread of the coronavirus has stressed medical services to the brink, and he predicted the situation will get worse as winter sets in. “We’re kind of preparing for the worst here,” Jim Murphy said. “We have pretty spooky numbers for COVID, going into a fall respiratory season. It’s not a position that anybody would like to be in.” Murphy said the increase in cases across the state has led to a shortage in health care workers, in addition to a shortage in hospital beds. “You can have a lot of beds. But if you don’t have the staff to support those beds, that’s a problem,” he said. U.S. officials have dispatched a team of nearly 30 physicians, nurses, paramedics and other health care workers to Montana’s largest city. The National Disaster Medical System team arrived Friday and will work in Billings for two weeks, The Billings Gazette reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to set records with the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and health care providers expect that to continue because of the recent surge of cases. Cliff Robertson, CEO of CHI Health, said his group of 14 hospitals in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa is preparing for COVID-19 cases to keep increasing over the next three to four weeks. He said COVID-19 patients already account for about 25% of all the patients in his hospitals. “We highly encourage folks to take this seriously because … this virus is rampant in our community right now,” Robertson said. The steady increase in cases raises the concern that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist at Nebraska Medicine in Omaha. “In three weeks’ time, our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and we will no longer be able to deliver optimal and effective care for COVID, and we will also no longer be able to deliver appropriate care for everyone who comes in with a heart attack or a stroke.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Although the coronavirus is spreading at record rates, the state will not need to tighten restrictions if individuals commit to preventive measures like mask-wearing and working from home, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday. For the third time in three weeks, the governor referred to “alarming trends” and said Nevada was almost at the point where stricter measures would be necessary. But unlike in the past, when he has hesitated to commit to benchmarks or timelines, he provided a deadline: If Nevada doesn’t show signs that it’s containing the virus in two weeks, he will be forced to tighten the state’s prevention measures. “If you don’t have to go out, don’t go out. Reduce your time in public to what is necessary, and limit any and all exposures to those outside your household,” Sisolak said. “Think about changes like ordering groceries for delivery instead of going into the store, or picking up dinner curbside.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAmherst: Officials say an Election Day voter at a polling place tested positive for the coronavirus, but the town had safety precautions in place. WMUR-TV reports town officials in Amherst said they were notified by the state that a voter tested positive for the virus. They said the infected person was at Souhegan High School between 10:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. on Election Day. Amherst town moderator Steve Coughlan said it wasn’t crowded. The town is now contacting election volunteers who may have had direct contact with the voter. Coughlan said plexiglass shields separated voters from election workers. Volunteers had to wear masks, but voters did not. “I think we provided a very safe environment,” Coughlan said. “It would be crazy for us to have thought that there would be zero infected voters out of everyone coming in. So we took precautions that were appropriate.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The family of the state’s first law enforcement officer to die from COVID-19 has filed a claim to sue Hudson County, saying he did not receive any masks or other personal protective equipment while working at the county jail. Bernard Waddell Sr., a corrections officer with 32 years of experience, was forced to work within close proximity to inmates who he believed were infected, said family lawyer Paul da Costa. “Up to his last day on the job, he was not provided with any PPE,” da Costa said. The virus devastated the jail in Kearny. Along with Waddell, it claimed the lives of two nurses, a commissary director and another corrections officer. Waddell, 56, died April 1. The Jersey City resident is survived by his wife and two sons. Around the time of his death, New Jersey was experiencing a severe shortage of face masks and gowns, prompting hospitals to ask the public for donations.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Santa Fe Public Schools is ending a short-lived soft opening of in-person learning as the coronavirus pandemic hobbles the state. “I am announcing today a hiatus of our volunteer hybrid program due to the rampant rise in COVID-19 cases in Santa Fe County and New Mexico and SFPS’ philosophy to always prioritize the safety and well being of our students and staff,” Superintendent Veronica Garcia said. The volunteers included 58 teachers who went to work despite the pandemic, enabling about 200 elementary students to attend school in person at least part of the week. The program started Oct. 26 and will hold the last day of classes Nov. 20. “If parents are able to keep their children home next week, I urge them to do so,” Garcia said. The announcement comes as the state sets records for COVID-19 cases amid dwindling space in hospitals and as students are failing classes at much higher rates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. across the state in the latest effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. He said people will also be barred from hosting private gatherings with more than 10 people. Cuomo said the new restrictions, which go into effect Friday, are necessary because new coronavirus infections have been traced to those types of activities. Businesses can reopen each morning. “Bars, restaurants, gyms, house parties – that’s where it’s coming from, primarily,” Cuomo said. The governor spoke as rates of coronavirus infection continued to rise. He said 1,628 people were hospitalized across the state for COVID-19 on Tuesday, and 21 people died. “What we’re seeing is what they predicted for months,” Cuomo said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state will remain paused in its current reopening plan for an additional three weeks, with indoor gathering limits reduced from 25 people to 10 people starting Friday. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced the tightening of gathering restrictions during a Tuesday news conference. The decision not to further reopen ahead of Thanksgiving comes at a time when the state is concerned about increases it has seen in COVID-19 cases and the percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive. “The science shows that the transmission of this virus is much greater indoors, and the more people are gathered, the easier this virus can spread,” Cooper said. Cooper, who won reelection last week, noted that churches and restaurants would be unaffected by the updated guidance. The executive order will remain in place until Dec. 4.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state continues to lead the nation in daily new coronavirus cases per capita, with 1 in 83 residents testing positive in just the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. In the past two weeks, there were 2,265 new cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. State health officials reported a dozen new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus Wednesday, down from a record 30 deaths Tuesday. The deaths reported Wednesday increased total fatalities to 696 since the pandemic began. The report said 123 deaths have occurred in November, matching all of September. October has been the deadliest month so far in North Dakota, with 292 deaths. State health officials reported 1,039 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and a daily positivity rate of more than 18% for the second straight day.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine beseeched Ohioans on Wednesday to take the surging coronavirus spread seriously, issuing new orders on mask enforcement in businesses, limiting gatherings across the state, and threatening to close bars, restaurants and fitness centers if cases continue to rise. “Throughout our country’s history, each generation has faced unique sacrifices,” DeWine said in the statewide address. “Today, we all must do something far less dramatic but very important: Wear a mask so your friends and family members can live.” DeWine shifted the authority of mask enforcement from the local counties to the state. The Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation will be responsible for inspections across the 88 counties. If a business receives more than one violation, it will have to close for 24 hours. “We must do this to protect our front-line workers,” DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of people hospitalized with confirmed and probable coronavirus in the state shattered the previous one-day record by nearly 200 on Wednesday, and more than 2,100 new cases were reported, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The department reported 1,248 hospitalizations to surpass the previous record of 1,055 set last Thursday. The department reported 2,177 new cases and 19 additional deaths since Tuesday for totals of 142,334 cases and 1,470 deaths since the pandemic began in March. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day average of the percentage of people who tested positive has risen from 9% to nearly 16% in Oklahoma, and the average number of new cases each day increased from 1265.8 per day to 1,947.3.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown and state health officials warned Tuesday of the capacity challenges facing hospitals as COVID-19 case counts continue to spike. The Oregon Health Authority recorded a record 285 confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospitals Tuesday – a 57% increase in just the past week and an 83% increase in the past four weeks. “There are limitations to what Oregon’s health care system can handle,” said Dana Hargunani, the health authority’s chief medical officer. “Even with regional planning and the hard work of all of our hospital partners, we cannot handle ever-growing high daily case counts and widespread hospitalizations.” Currently out of Oregon’s 703 listed intensive care unit beds, 27% are available, and about 18% of non-ICU adult hospital beds in the state are available, based on data on from the health authority’s website. “Our fear that this virus would spread out of control as the colder months set in is now becoming a frightening reality,” Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city’s public school students will continue to attend classes virtually for the foreseeable future, district officials announced Tuesday. The announcement came on the same day Philadelphia public health officials saw a peak in confirmed virus cases and increased hospitalizations. The school district had planned to begin bringing back younger students for a hybrid in-person instruction model starting Nov. 30, with plans to phase in instruction for students with complex instructional needs and then older students next. “We hope to see these students back in school before the spring,” Philadelphia district Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said, adding that it would ultimately depend on health experts and infection trends. About one-third of parents with students who would have been eligible to return had opted for in-person, part-time instruction that would have put students in classrooms two days a week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Employees of the state Senate are being told to work from home after three workers tested positive for the coronavirus, state officials said. The Senate’s roughly 50 workers were instructed to start working remotely Monday after three staffers tested positive over the weekend, The Providence Journal reports. They were told to work remotely for two weeks. The directive came from Gov. Gina Raimondo. Senate spokesman Greg Pare said the Senate president is “following that guidance and wants to do all he can to keep Senate staff members safe.” The House said it has no plans to shift to remote work. The new cases in the Senate were reported as the General Assembly looks for ways to gather for its first full sessions since July. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio previously said he is exploring whether meetings can be held at the Rhode Island Convention Center.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials in the state’s largest school district say the number of students who received an F in at least one class tripled this year, as the district adjusted learning because of the coronavirus pandemic. First-quarter report cards show a little more than 16,000 students in Greenville County Schools had an F. That compares to roughly 5,300 students with at least one failing grade in the first quarter last year. The pandemic has limited in-person teaching for the district’s 75,000 students, and Associate Superintendent of Academics Jeff McCoy said that likely was a factor in the jump in Fs. He also cited the stress of the crisis on families and the emergency shutdown of schools in the spring. Still, the district wasn’t expecting such a big increase in the number of struggling students. McCoy said the report cards show a much larger proportion of virtual students are receiving failing grades compared to in-person students.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The mayor cast the tie-breaking vote that defeated a proposed mask mandate in the state’s largest city Tuesday night. After more than two hours of public comment, Mayor Paul TenHaken rejected the mandate after the City Council tied 4-4 on the ordinance. The mandate would have required face coverings to be worn by people in most indoor public places where 6-foot social distancing was not achievable. Violations carried a $50 fine. “I believe the small uptick we’ll see in compliance is not worth the community division that this will create,” TenHaken said as he ended debate. Councilor Greg Neitzert said he did not want to live in a city where people are calling the police because someone isn’t wearing a mask. “It’s not just about health,” Neitzert said. “We also have to look at principles.” The Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce opposed it. Several faith leaders in the city supported the mandate.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that he’s looking to include “meaningful” teacher pay raises in next year’s budget despite facing financial crunches brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee had originally proposed funneling an additional $117 million to K-12 teacher salaries earlier this year before the virus outbreak began rippling across the state. If approved, the starting minimum annual salary for teachers would have increased from $36,000 to $40,000 over the next two years. Yet months later, Lee was forced to strip the teacher funding boost, as well as many other budget initiatives, as officials braced for funding shortfalls. However, Tennessee’s revenues have come in slightly higher than originally projected over the past three months, allowing Lee’s administration to remain slightly optimistic that it will be able to fund some new measures rather than have to dip into rainy day funds.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state has become the first with more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases as the nation continues to face a surge of infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University early Wednesday. The nation’s second-most populous state has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases with 19,337 deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to the count on the Johns Hopkins website. Texas recorded 10,865 new cases Tuesday, setting a new daily record that surpassed by 74 cases an old mark set July 15, state officials said. According to state figures Tuesday, an estimated 132,146 cases are active, the most since Aug. 17, and 6,170 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, the most since Aug. 18. There were 94 new deaths Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Meanwhile, cases of the coronavirus are surging in the Laredo area, health officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A group of teachers has organized an event to encourage educators across the state to call in sick and use the day off to get tested for the coronavirus amid a surge in confirmed infection cases. “There are no testing requirements for teachers or students currently,” Granite School District teacher Lindsay Plummer said. Some teachers believe the “test out” planned for Thursday will prompt state leaders to do more to limit the spread of COVID-19 and increase safety protocols in classrooms, FOX13 reports. Plummer said the group was inspired to act following remarks made by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert on Sunday, when he put in place a statewide mask mandate. “The goal of doing something like this is we want to push them to do more,” she said. The Utah Education Association said it is aware of event but is urging teachers to be patient. Herbert’s office has said all teachers have universal access to testing.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state on Tuesday suspended a program that allowed people from across the Northeast to visit Vermont without quarantining if they come from a county with a low rate of coronavirus infection. Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that the number of counties eligible – listed on a map that uses red, orange and green to indicate eligibility – has continued to shrink. As of Tuesday only two counties between Maine and Ohio were listed as green. “The fact is, along with social gatherings, travel to and from other states without the proper quarantine continues to be one of the common denominators in our rising case counts,” Scott said. Essential travel – such as work, school, medical care, personal safety, shared child custody or buying groceries – is not affected, but people should only do what they need to do and then return home, he said. Vermont determined eligible counties as those with virus rates of less than 400 cases per million residents.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday announced plans to significantly increase statewide testing capacity and to launch a media campaign in southwest Virginia, which has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past month. The moves came three days after Virginia reported 2,103 new cases – its biggest single-day increase in new cases since the start of the pandemic. On Tuesday, the state reported 1,435 new cases. The state’s seven-day moving average of new cases is 1,462. The seven-day testing positivity rate has also climbed from just under 5% a few weeks ago to 6.2% on Tuesday. Since the start of the pandemic, the state has recorded a total of 194,192 cases, with 3,726 deaths. Northam said he is focusing on mitigation efforts and continuing to encourage people to wear masks and practice social distancing. He said he is not currently considering ordering new restrictions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two hospitals near the city are struggling with COVID-19 outbreaks within the facilities. The Auburn Medical Center reported at least five employees and eight patients tested positive for the coronavirus, after an outbreak on a fourth-floor unit. The hospital said in a statement Tuesday that one patient died after the outbreak was detected late last week, The Seattle Times reports. The MultiCare hospital system, which owns the hospital, tested all 40 patients in the unit and 212 staffers who had worked there in the two-week period before the first positive test was reported, officials said. At St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton, at least six people have been infected since early November. CHI Franciscan, the hospital system that owns St. Michael, announced Tuesday that four patients and two employees have been infected to date. State health officials have reported 350 outbreaks in health care settings, including hospitals, since Oct. 24, a statewide outbreak report said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new high of 642 coronavirus cases Wednesday and seven deaths as the pandemic continued its march into rural enclaves. There are 277 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, slightly down from the peak of 290 last week. A total of 553 deaths have been linked to COVID-19. Virus-related deaths have increased 45% in the past month. The daily positivity rate is up to 5.9%, the highest it has been in about two months. “The enemy is at our borders, and the enemy is coming at us right now,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a press briefing. Twenty-five counties had the most severe designation of virus spread, with 25 or more cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said all options are on the table for bringing new travel and business restrictions, but nothing is planned yet. “Legally, I can’t go out and start arresting people” for not wearing masks, Justice said in urging people to follow guidelines and get tested for the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers renewed his pleas Tuesday for people to stay home to avoid the coronavirus in an unusual prime-time speech hours after the state set new records for infections and deaths. The governor announced he was advising people to stay in their houses and businesses to allow people to work remotely, requiring masks, and limiting the number of people in stores and offices. He said projections show that if nothing changes, deaths could double to 5,000 by January. Evers has been imploring people to stay home and wear masks for months during twice-weekly afternoon news conferences to little avail. This time his office streamed his remarks live on his Facebook page and YouTube channel. “So I want to be clear tonight: Each day this virus goes unchecked is a setback for our economic recovery,” Evers said. Republicans and their conservative allies have worked to block every Evers initiative to stop the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The son of a state representative who opposed COVID-19 public restrictions said his father was positive for the coronavirus when he died. Roy Edwards, 66, died Nov. 2 at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper after being hospitalized for more than a week with illness that was not immediately disclosed, The Gillette News Record reports. Edwards continued to oppose public restrictions resulting from the pandemic during his recent campaign to retain his House seat. He was reelected the day after he died. Mitch Edwards said his father initially experienced minor virus symptoms. He was told by a medical professional that he had sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinuses, and did not need to be tested for COVID-19. Roy Edwards was not advised to quarantine, but he did so as a a precaution, Mitch Edwards said. His symptoms worsened, and he had trouble breathing Oct. 23, when he again sought medical attention.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/us/five-things-august-31-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for August 31: Mar-a-Lago, Flooding, Heat waves ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’ve gotten up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

State authorities are now scrambling to begin distributing water to 180,000 residents, according to Gov. Tate Reeves. “Please stay safe. Do not drink the water,” Reeves said, explaining that untreated water from the reservoir is being pushed through the pipes. The state is expected to call in the National Guard to help distribute drinking and non-drinking water as crews work to get the treatment plant back online. On Monday evening, Jackson residents were dealing with the aftermath of record-setting rain that resulted in the Pearl River cresting at a dangerously high level.\n\n2. Capitol riot\n\nIn the wake of the deadliest US school shooting in nearly a decade, the National Rifle Association is set to hold its 2022 annual convention in Houston, Texas, today. Several notable conservatives, including former President Donald Trump, are scheduled to speak at the meeting. Some other speakers have canceled their planned appearances, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who will instead attend a news conference in Uvalde, according to his spokesperson. Several musicians who were set to sing in a concert at this weekend’s convention have also canceled their performances. The annual meeting is only open to NRA members. The organization currently has over five million members, according to its website.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Iraq\n\nThe Biden administration is preparing to approve sending an advanced long-range rocket system to Ukraine, multiple officials say. Senior Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have pleaded in recent weeks for the US and its allies to provide the Multiple Launch Rocket System. The US-made weapon systems can fire a barrage of rockets hundreds of kilometers – much farther than any of the systems Ukraine has – which the Ukrainians argue could be a game-changer in their war against Russia. The administration is leaning toward sending the systems with a larger package of military and security assistance to Ukraine, which could be announced as soon as next week. This comes as Ukrainian officials today reported heavy fighting across several fronts, including in the Luhansk region where a local military chief describes “fierce battles” are currently taking place.\n\n4.

Delta, however, isn’t the first airline to trim its summer schedule due to operational issues and decreased staffing. JetBlue announced in April that it would cut 8% to 10% of its summer schedule due to “continued industry challenges.” Alaska Airlines also reduced its schedule by about 2% through June to match “pilot capacity.”\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nEllen DeGeneres says goodbye to show that ‘forever changed my life’\n\nA woman used her smartwatch to call 911 after getting stuck in an interesting position at the gym.

ANDREWS, Scotland - Rory McIlroy had said all the right things in his post-round news conference and with those duties complete, he slumped into a four-passenger golf cart and buried his head into wife Erica's left shoulder and all the emotions came flooding out.\n\nThe 150th Open Championship, the one McIlroy labeled his Holy Grail earlier in the week, was his to win or lose. After sharing the 54-hole lead with Viktor Hovland, McIlroy had built a two-stroke lead with nine holes to go.

McIlroy hit every green in regulation in the final round and had a wonderful sense of speed with his putter, but he picked a bad time for it to go cold. He didn't make a single putt of consequence.\n\n\"I felt like I didn't do much wrong today, but I didn't do much right either,\" he said. \"It's just one of those days where I played a really controlled round of golf. I did what I felt like I needed to just apart from capitalizing on the easier holes - around the turn, 9, 12, 14. If I had made the birdies there from good positions, it probably would have been a different story.\"\n\nThis one will hurt because McIlroy knows he had every chance to stop Smith, but with every birdie by Smith, his confidence grew and the pressure on McIlroy tightened.\n\n\"I can't be too despondent because of how this year's went and this year's going,\" he said. \"I'm playing some of the best golf I've played in a long time. So it's just a matter of keep knocking on the door, and eventually one will open.\"\n\nBut despondent is what he looked like as he hid his face in his wife's embrace. He finished second at the Masters, eighth at the PGA Championship, T-5 at the U.S. Open, and third at the Open - a banner-type year for Rickie Fowler in 2014 but for McIlroy it is close but no cigar. The end result is a failure and like Vesuvius he has to wait until April to begin the quest of pushing the ball up the mountain again.\n\nIt hurt because he admitted that he had dreamed of winning the 150th and allowed himself moments to look ahead and think about what it might be like to hold the trophy and be celebrated on the 18th green as the Champion Golfer of the Year.\n\n\"I'm only human. I'm not a robot. Of course, you think about it, and you envision it, and you want to envision it,\" he said. \"My hotel room is directly opposite the big yellow board on 18 there right of the first. And every time I go out, I'm trying to envision McIlroy at the top name on that leaderboard and how did that feel? At the start of the day, it was at the top, but at the start of tomorrow, it won't be.\"\n\nIt's enough to make even one of the greatest golfers in the world bury his face in his wife's warm embrace.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/politics/biden-campaign-trail-age/index.html", "title": "This is the bar Joe Biden will have to clear in 2024 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nJoe Biden still hasn’t made up his mind about whether or not to run for president in 2024.\n\n“Look, my intention as I said to begin with is that I would run again,” the President said last month in an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes.” “But it’s just an intention. But is it a firm decision that I run again? That remains to be seen.”\n\nLet’s say, for the sake of argument, that Biden does decide to run for another term in two years time. The challenge before him will be simple but profound: Prove to the American people that he can campaign all over the country for the entirety of the campaign.\n\nThat’s according to the latest column from The Washington Post’s Megan McArdle, who writes:\n\n“You need only watch video from 10 years ago to see that the president now appears slower than he used to be. That doesn’t mean he’s unfit to be president; he will not be asked to resolve a foreign policy crisis by solving crossword puzzles at high speed. But whether it’s a policy problem, it is a political problem.”\n\nMcArdle’s argument – if I extrapolate it somewhat – goes like this:\n\n1. In the early primary and caucus states where a premium was put on hand-to-hand campaigning, Biden was crushed.\n\n2. He was saved by the endorsement of South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn and the strong support of Black voters in the Palmetto State.\n\n3. After that win in South Carolina, the primary campaign effectively ended because the country went into lockdown over Covid-19.\n\n4. The general election campaign, similarly, wasn’t much of a campaign. Biden held very few in-person events and the ones he did hold were with small numbers of people.\n\n5. By the time the 2024 campaign rolls around, the pandemic will be in the rearview mirror (Biden says it already is) and politics will return to normal again. Which means Biden will have to do something he hasn’t done in years – actively campaign.\n\nAgain, McArdle:\n\n“Whether Republicans nominate Trump or someone else, his opponent is going to be out there on the stump, whipping up voter enthusiasm and proving they have the stamina for the job. If Biden doesn’t follow suit, he will be conceding them an edge — especially since they will not be shy about using that fact to raise questions about his fitness.”\n\nWe know from oodles of polling that there are real and persistent questions among the electorate – including a decent-sized chunk of Democrats – about whether Biden should run again, with his age being a prime driver of those doubts.\n\nWhether you agree with McArdle or not, she raises a provocative and important point: Given Biden’s age and snafus like the one last week involving the late Rep. Jackie Walorski, people are going to be keeping a close eye on how he carries himself as a candidate in 2024.\n\nThe Point: Biden, assuming he runs in 2024, will be 81 years old on the campaign trail – the oldest person to ever seek a second term as president. (He was also the oldest person ever elected to a first term.) His ability to handle the rigors of a campaign will be a major hurdle he needs to clear in the eyes of many voters.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/trump-policy-speech/index.html", "title": "There is no such thing as a Donald Trump policy speech | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor the first time since January 2021, Donald Trump returned to Washington on Tuesday to deliver a speech at a summit hosted by the America First Policy Institute.\n\nCoverage in the run-up to the address focused on how it would be policy-heavy, laying out Trump’s vision for America (and, presumably, setting the stage for him to run for president again in 2024).\n\n“What I’d ask you to do is to lay out a hopeful agenda for America. Tell us how we can make chips without spending all this money. Tell us how we can be safer, you don’t have to worry about your kids as much as you do today,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said in remarks at the AFPI conference in advance of Trump’s speech. “You did it once, you can do it again.”\n\nWhich, well, let me just stop you there.\n\nThe notion being put forward by Graham, that Trump has a) given a serious policy address and b) painted a “hopeful” vision for America is simply false.\n\nGo back to Trump’s two most famous/infamous speeches: The one to kickoff his 2016 presidential campaign and the one he delivered at his 2017 inauguration.\n\nThe first is defined in the public’s mind by Trump’s insistence that “when Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. … They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”\n\n(In that same speech, Trump blasted his opponents for their lack of understanding about air conditioning, bragged about his crowd size and called the US as a “dumping ground for everybody else’s problems.”)\n\nHopeful!\n\nThen there was Trump’s inauguration speech, which is remembered for Trump’s evocation of “American carnage” in describing the current state of the country.\n\nUplifting!\n\nThe simple fact is that Trump’s appeal has NEVER been about policies or a hopeful vision. It’s always been totally and completely about Trump himself – and the roiling sense of grievance, nostalgia and score-settling that sits at the center of his personality.\n\nSure, there have been issues that embodied that sentiment. Trump voters rallied behind his call to build a border wall – and make Mexico pay for it – because it sounded tough and freaked out liberal elites. His foreign policy stances appealed to voters who wanted America to go back to the take-no-prisoners approach they remembered from decades ago. (That such an American foreign policy stance never existed was besides the point for these folks.)\n\nTrump’s ever-shifting views on, well, most things, was the clearest evidence that his winning campaign – and the four years he spent in the White House — weren’t about advancing some broader theory of the case. They were about Trump doing whatever felt good at the moment – and the cult of personality that grew up around his many maneuvers. (In 2017, the New Yorker wrote a great piece about conservative intellectuals who tried to put an ideological framework around Trumpism. Which, well, ha!)\n\nNow to Trump’s speech on Tuesday.\n\nHe said the country was “on the brink” and the weakest that it has been since the Civil War. (Trump cited Newt Gingrich as the authority on that second claim.) He said we have “very little” public safety. He said that there is an “invasion” of immigrants coming into the country. He said, “Our streets are riddled with needles and soaked with the blood of innocent victims.” He decried “drugged-out lunatics” and “sadists” who he insisted are taking over the country. “Our country is now a cesspool of crime,” said Trump.\n\nHis policy solution? “It has to stop and it has to stop now.”\n\nWhich, well, color me unsurprised.\n\nThe Point: The appeal of Trump to voters has never, ever been about a policy or a set of policies.

Katheryn Houghton/KHN\n\nThe transaction took less than 10 minutes. It was the third hotel Piccolo had visited that hot July day in Livingston, a mountain town of roughly 8,000, where, as in much of the nation, health officials are worried about a recent rise in the use of the synthetic opioid fentanyl.\n\nIt was the first time the local health department offered door-to-door training and supplies to prevent overdose deaths. The underlying strategy was forged during the pandemic when public health officials distributed rapid tests and vaccines in high-risk settings.\n\n“We learned this from covid,” said Dr. Laurel Desnick, the county’s public health officer. “We go to people who may not have time to come to us.”\n\nDr. Laurel Desnick, public health officer for the Park City-County Health Department in Montana, prepares to deliver boxes of Narcan to local hotels. The free distribution of Narcan, the brand name of the drug naloxone, which can reverse opioid overdoses, is one public health strategy borne out of the covid-19 pandemic. Katheryn Houghton/KHN\n\nThe pandemic laid bare the gaps and disparities in the U.S. public health system, and often resulted in blowback against local officials trying to slow the coronavirus’s spread. But one positive outcome, in part fueled by a boost in federal dollars, is that health workers have started adapting lessons they learned from their covid-19 response to other aspects of their work.\n\nFor example, in Atlanta, where the county health department planned to mail out at-home kits to test for diseases, a program modeled on the distribution of covid rapid tests. In Houston, health officials announced this month they’ll begin monitoring the city’s wastewater for monkeypox, a tactic broadly used to gauge how far and fast covid spread. And in Chicago, government agencies have tweaked covid collaborations to tag-team a rise in gun violence.\n\nSome of these adaptations should cost little and be relatively simple to incorporate into the departments’ post-pandemic work, such as using vans purchased with covid relief money for vaccine delivery and disease testing. Other tools cost more money and time, including updating covid-borne data and surveillance systems to use in other ways.\n\nSome public health workers worry that the lessons woven into their operations will fall away once the pandemic has passed.\n\n“When we have public health crises in this country, we tend to have a boom-and-bust cycle of funding,” said Adriane Casalotti, with the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nSome federal pandemic relief funding is scheduled to last for years, but other allocations have already run dry. Local health workers will be left to prioritize what to fund with what remains.\n\nMeanwhile, historically short-staffed and underfunded health departments are responding to challenges that intensified during the pandemic, including delayed mental health treatment and routine care.\n\n“You’re not just starting from where you were 2½ years ago, there’s actually a higher mountain to climb,” Casalotti said. “But places that were able to build up some of their systems can adapt them to allow for more real-time understanding of public health challenges.”\n\nIn Atlanta, the Fulton County Board of Health has offered to mail residents free, at-home tests for sexually transmitted diseases. The state has historically had some of the highest rates of reported STDs in the nation.\n\n“This program has the power to demonstrate the scalable effects of equitable access to historically underserved communities,” Joshua O’Neal, the county’s director of the sexual health programs, said in a press release announcing the kits.\n\nThe changes go beyond government. University of Texas researchers are trying out a statewide program to crowdsource data on fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses. Those working on the project are frustrated the national effort to track covid outbreaks hasn’t extended to the overdose epidemic.\n\nDr. Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said her team is expanding the covid data-driven approach to track and report neighborhood-level data on opioid drug overdoses. Nonprofits and city agencies that have worked together through the pandemic now meet each month to look at the numbers to shape their response.\n\nArwady said the city is trying to use the pandemic-driven boost in money and attention for programs that can last beyond the covid emergency.\n\n“Every day, we’re having these debates about, ‘How much do we continue on? How big do we go?’” Arwady said. “I feel like it’s such a moment. We’ve shown what we can do during covid, we’ve shown what we can do when we have some additional funding.”\n\nThe city also opened a new safety center modeled on its covid-response base to counter gun violence. Employees from across city departments are working together on safety issues for the first time by tracking data, connecting people in highest-risk areas to services, and supporting local efforts such as funding neighborhood block clubs and restoring safe spaces.\n\nSeparately, neighborhood-based organizations created to handle covid contact tracing and education are shifting focus to address food security, violence prevention, and diabetes education. Arwady said she hopes to continue grassroots public health efforts in areas with long-standing health disparities by using a patchwork of grants to retain 150 of the 600 people initially hired through pandemic relief dollars.\n\n“The message I’ve really been telling my team is, ‘This is our opportunity to do things that we have long wanted to do,’” Arwady said. “We built some of that up and I just, I’m gonna kick and scream before I let that all get dismantled.”\n\nBack in Montana, Desnick said not every change relies on funding.\n\nWhen flooding destroyed buildings and infrastructure in and around Yellowstone National Park in June, the Park County health department used a list of contacts gathered during the pandemic to send updates to schools, churches, and businesses.\n\nDesnick posts regular public health video updates that began with covid case counts and broadened to include information on flood levels, federal cleanup assistance, and ice cream socials for people to meet first responders.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nPiccolo, the county’s health director, spent roughly an hour on that day in July going to hotels in Livingston’s core to offer opioid overdose response training and supplies. Three hotel managers took the offer, two asked her to come back later, and one scheduled an all-staff training for later that week. Piccolo plans to extend the program to restaurants and music venues.\n\nIt’s that kind of adaptation to her job that doesn’t require the continuing flow of covid aid.

Liz Cheney is a villain on Fox today.\n\n“The voters are saying they’ve had enough – and that it’s time to bury the tragic Bush-Cheney era once and for all,” Fox’s 10 p.m. host Laura Ingraham said Tuesday night, around the same time Cheney conceded to Harriet Hageman in the GOP primary in Wyoming.\n\nCheney was a punching bag and punchline all across GOP-aligned media as the primary results came in. Many right-wing commentators repeated the same points they had made for months: That Cheney’s condemnation of former president Donald Trump and her collaboration with Democrats on the House select committee investigating January 6 made her an enemy.\n\nOn Fox, the tone was quite personal and bitter, and an extraordinary turn for a network that once celebrated the Cheney family dynasty. Back in 2012, Liz Cheney was even a paid Fox commentator. And when she left the network in 2013 to run for Senate in Wyoming, Sean Hannity endorsed her.\n\nBut she crossed Trump, and thus Fox’s biggest stars. On Tuesday night Tucker Carlson mocked her public stance in defense of democracy, which stemmed from Trump’s 2020 plot to overturn the election result, and derided media outlets that have taken her seriously. He predicted that she will soon “be writing a column for National Review and will be releasing a book from Simon and Schuster called ‘Democracy.’”\n\nOne hour later, Hannity opened his show by calling Cheney “the most obsessive Trump hater in the country.” He pooh-poohed talk of a potential Cheney presidential run, saying that “if she can’t win Wyoming, she’s not going to win any other red state that I can think of.”\n\nIn the 10 p.m. hour, Ingraham’s program showed about five minutes of Cheney’s concession speech, then cut away to guests who ridiculed Cheney. CNN and MSNBC aired the speech in full.\n\nFox’s coverage did include Cheney telling supporters that she could have easily won the primary – “the path was clear” – but “it would’ve required that I go along with President Trump’s lie about the 2020 election. It would’ve required that I enable his ongoing efforts to unravel our democratic system and attack the foundations of our republic. That was a path I could not and would not take.”\n\nNewsmax did not show any of Cheney’s speech. Instead, 10 p.m. host celebrated the fact that “Liz Cheney is gone.”\n\nNumerous right-wing commentators portrayed Hageman’s win and Cheney’s loss as a perfect example of democracy in action, implying that it undermines Cheney’s warnings about threats to democracy.\n\nBut unlike Trump, Cheney didn’t deny that she lost the race, or encourage people to believe she won, or incite supporters to block Hageman’s victory from being certified.\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter.

While nothing is more powerful than real physical human connection, the digital virtual tech-driven world was the big story for media and entertainment in 2021.\n\nIn particular, 2021 marked the coming out party for the blockchain – a kind of transformational decentralized Web 3.0 world. In the world of media, the headline blockchain story took its form in so-called non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Will the blockchain’s adoption in media accelerate in 2022?\n\nMy Magic 8-Ball says “Signs point to ‘YES’.”\n\n►What's an NFT:A guide to what they are and why someone spent $69 million for one\n\nHere are 10 predictions for the coming year in which we hope that we finally get COVID under some kind of real long-term control.\n\n1. Blockchain blows up in 2022\n\nAfter early experimentation in 2021, 2022 will mark the year creators truly begin to embrace and leverage the power of the blockchain at scale. Just like iPhones ushered in a whole new mobile-first world of content 15 years ago, so-called Web 3.0 ushers in a whole new transformational world for originators of intellectual property, or IP, to directly reach and monetize their audiences. In the process, creators take back at least some of the power of mega tech platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Apple that built their trillion-dollar-plus valuations on their backs.\n\n2. NFTs a new venue for fans\n\nAnd 2022 will mark the year superfans will use their collective decentralized power to fuel creativity from their favorite artists via blockchain-related opportunities. Most in the entertainment world still focus on Beeple’s $69-million digital art NFT as being the blockchain’s poster child.\n\nBut instead they should be thinking of NFTs as new direct and directly monetizing channels of super-fandom – opening up membership into exclusive new clubs. If few in the world of media now know of CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club and DAOs in general (decentralized autonomous organizations), that changes in 2022. The blockchain, NFTs and DAOs are no momentary fads. They are long-term game-changers. Like it or not, the Los Angeles-based Staples Center’s new “Crypto.com Arena” moniker is here to stay. Hey, brands out there, you better claim your \".eth\" web address now. (Here's why.)\n\n►Decoding the lingo:10 cryptocurrency terms people use every day\n\n►Crypto tithes:With fewer young parishioners carrying cash, more churches accept bitcoin as offering\n\n3. Big action to come against Big Tech\n\nThe new mega-media platforms of Facebook (or Meta, actually), Google, Apple, and Amazon face a more immediate threat than the blockchain and related new decentralized social platforms in 2022, as big government finally takes big action against big tech in advance of 2022’s mid-term elections. Facebook and Zuckerberg are first to feel the pinch, as the Feds force Facebook to shed Instagram (and perhaps set some real rules to limit unbridled ad and AI-driven algorithmic devastation, both on young people and society itself). These “unlockings” of tech conglomerates will unlock more content innovation across more competing tech platforms.\n\n►The Facebook Papers:Facebook fed posts with violence and nudity to people with low digital literacy\n\n4. Apple leads the way to the metaverse\n\nFaced with these threats, Facebook tries to run and hide with its new Meta moniker (the quintessential “lipstick on a pig”), but real metaverse innovation comes from others, including Apple. Yes, Apple’s AR glasses ultimately will drive some of that innovation. But Apple already sports the ultimate wearable – AirPods (now a $20-billion business by itself). AirPods will become the first major gateway into the metaverse – outside of the games industry – much like Apple drove mass consumer adoption in the mobile world with the iPhone. Expect micro-cameras to be incorporated into higher-end, extremely expensive versions of AirPods that will enable visual experiences. I can see you lining up at your local Apple store already.\n\n►What is the metaverse anyway? Everyone wants to own the metaverse including Facebook and Microsoft\n\n5. Games + crossovers = metaverse magic\n\nSpeaking of games, that industry will continue to lead all other categories of entertainment content by an order of magnitude and increasingly show the way for artists and creators to emerge and build audiences. Before the tragedy of Astroworld, Travis Scott broke out into the metaverse in 2020 via \"Fortnite\" to the tune of 50 million viewers who drove a No. 1 hit. Ariana Grande shattered those numbers this past year, and the marriage of games and music grows stronger in 2022 as music licensing for games becomes a massive new revenue stream.\n\n►From Facebook to Fortnite:The metaverse is calling. Are we ready?\n\n6. Get paid to play\n\nMedia and tech business models will continue to fundamentally evolve, particularly in light of the havoc wreaked by ad-driven business models from the two major culprits of Facebook and Google. We’ve already seen the shift from single transactions to subscription-based recurring revenue bundles (Amazon Prime, Apple One, Disney+). That will accelerate in 2022. And move over “free to play” business models in the world of games. Now, thanks to the blockchain, welcome to an entirely new “play to earn” model that literally pays players to play (and gives them fractional ownership in the games they play). Why work when you can play? Other parts of the entertainment industry will continue to look to the world of games for inspiration and innovation, because that’s where it’s happening.\n\n7. In battle for screen dominance, Disney beats Netflix\n\nDisney+ will grow more rapidly than Netflix – and begin to close the gap in terms of global paid members – as the Mouse House begins to unlock significantly more dollars to produce originals. And don’t forget Disney’s “special sauce” that Netflix can’t touch – Disney’s priceless crown jewels of content – i.e., the Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Avengers, and Disney Princess franchises. Just imagine the NFTs Disney can (and will) create with those timeless characters (which, in turn, will drive more Disney+ subscriptions/memberships). Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple will also quietly raise their own originals ante as they too accelerate their media ambitions – but for decidedly different ends. Amazon and Apple use content as marketing and to drive customer loyalty – to draw us in and create an ongoing customer relationship so we spend more time (and cash) in their walled gardens. And in the thirst for new content, expect more media production company acquisitions in 2022. The big buy in 2021 was Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine. Indie idol A24 will be the big prize for 2022.\n\n8. Musicians to harness the power of NFTs\n\nMusic will continue its double-digit growth – fueled by accelerating streaming via broader global broadband connectivity, entirely new royalty-paying platforms (Facebook, TikTok, Peloton), the growing ubiquity of smart speakers and, yes, transformational blockchain-fueled opportunities like NFTs. Perhaps most notably – and most notably absent in the minds of most executives still today – superfans will directly drive significantly more dollars into the pockets of their favorite artists. Billions have been left on the table in the past. Not any longer.\n\n►Making music and history:In her return, singer Shontelle deploys NFTs in song of empowerment\n\n9.You could help finance the next big Hollywood entertainment project\n\nExpect the retail market – that's you and me, the superfans – to directly finance and even buy fractional pieces of content from our favorite artists. In a world of content increasingly being “king,” private equity has pumped billions of dollars into the world of music acquisitions for the likes of Stevie Nicks and Bob Dylan. But that kind of content ownership will not be just for the “big boys” in 2022. NFTs will help fuel the way. And superfan-fueled crowd-funding and IP ownership aren’t just for the world of music. The retail market will open up an entirely new world of financing for producers of film and television. Hey, Hollywood, check out “The Chosen.” If you don’t know about it, you should.\n\n10. Live entertainment is back, but forever changed\n\nMusic festivals and other mega-live entertainment experiences will continue to open up in 2022 due to pent up demand for real, physical interaction and lasting shared experiences in our increasingly heads-down digital, virtual world. But these large-scale live events are forever changed as a result of the twin tragedies of COVID and Astroworld. Crowd control, mitigation and broader safety and security efforts and focus will transform overall planning and execution – not to mention the overall “festival experience” for those who attend.\n\nThere you have it – 10 predictions for our increasingly tech-driven world of media and entertainment in 2022.\n\nPeter Csathy is the chairman of CREATV Media & Deep Cuts Media, a media, entertainment & tech-focused business development, M&A and advisory firm.

And even looked up a little bit to try and get the lay of the land … I’m saying, ‘How did all that happen in just those few seconds?’ It didn’t make any sense. Like, I just don’t understand it.”\n\nHarris died just days before the 50th anniversary of the catch, and the Steelers had planned to retire his No. 32 jersey during halftime of their game against the Raiders on Saturday.\n\nThe NFL Network in 2019 named the Immaculate Reception the top play in the 100 years of the league.\n\nThe play was not without controversy: There were no convincing replays to determine who deflected the ball when two opposing players collided and whether the ball actually hit the ground when Harris caught it.\n\nIn the interview, Russo said some believe that the nose of the football hit the turf, “But you’re saying that’s not the case, correct?”\n\n“I have no idea, I have no idea,” Harris said. “I remember nothing. That’s what baffles me…”\n\nRusso noted Harris was “a long way away from where the ball ricocheted.” If another Steeler had touched the ball, Harris’ catch would not have been legal.\n\n“I have no recollection of seeing the ball at all,” Harris said. “I have no visual of the ball. I have no recollection. But look at … how fast it came back.”\n\nHarry Cabluck/AP\n\n‘You don’t practice stuff like this’\n\nLooking at the film, Harris says, “I’m thinking that it could only have been” Raiders defender Jack Tatum “that the ball bounced off of” before Harris made the shoestring catch. Tatum had collided with Steelers fullback Frenchy Fuqua.\n\nIn explaining how he made the play, Harris noted that he “always had great reflexes but you don’t practice stuff like this. … So it kind of blows my mind.”\n\nThe Steelers won the game 13-7 for the team’s first-ever playoff victory but lost their next game. Still, the team went on to dominate the 1970s, winning four Super Bowls.\n\nRusso, the host, opened the interview by asking, “How are you today, OK pal?” It was likely the last interview Harris did before his death was announced on Wednesday. His cause of death was not provided.\n\n“Doing great. Fantastic,” Harris said, though he was coughing here and there. “And, like as you said, 50 years ago, and, and it still feels brand new.”\n\nHarris then went on to talk about the game-winning drive, how it started off poorly and left the Steelers in a desperate spot.\n\n“So, things didn’t go too well on those first three plays, as you know. And then it gets down to fourth down. A long way to go. 22 seconds.\n\nAnd I go into the huddle and I tell myself, ‘Franco, this will probably be the last play of the season. It was a good season. Just play it till the end.’\n\nAnd (the coach) called that 66 halfback option.”\n\nHarris’ assignment was to stay in and block.\n\nHe recalled that “there wasn’t much … adrenaline” in the huddle.\n\nWe were winning the whole game and right at the end (the Raiders) scored. It seemed more of a letdown than anything.”\n\nHarris joined the Seattle Seahawks in 1984. Barry Sweet/AP\n\nRusso noted that Harris “did block well” on the play and noticed that quarterback Terry Bradshaw was scrambling under pressure from the defense.\n\n“My thought was to release to be an outlet pass,” Harris said. “And Bradshaw, being as, you know, big and as strong as he is, you know, guys trying to bring him down, he’s able to fight them off and get the ball into the air.”\n\nHarris said when the ball was in the air, “I tell myself, right, I tell myself ‘Go to the ball, go to the ball.’”\n\nHarris said that was his instinct because that was what he was taught as a running back in college, under Joe Paterno at Penn State University.\n\n“That’s what Joe preached to us all four years at Penn State. You know, always go to the ball … And so I start taking some steps to the ball and I remember nothing after that… which blows my mind, that I have no visual, no recollection of anything until I am stiff arming (Raiders defender) Jimmy Warren, going into the end zone.”\n\nSome old-time Raiders still salty\n\nHarris noted how important it was that he didn’t dive for the ball. In those days when a player hits the ground while possessing the ball, he was officially down and could not advance it.\n\n“How lucky am I that I was conscious that, you know, catch it that low without diving for it,” Harris said.\n\nHarris said that after the players collided and the ball deflected into the air, some of the Raiders started to clap and celebrate.\n\n“And the Raiders stop, just for a few seconds, and that few seconds that they stopped gave me the head start to get into the end zone.”\n\nAll these years later, when some old-time Raiders still assert that the catch wasn’t a legal catch, Harris says he pays it no mind.\n\n“As a matter of fact,” Harris said, “I feel good that they’re still sulking about that.”", "authors": ["David J.

Grand View football coach Joe Woodley rises from his chair and walks to the end of the row of desks in the team’s facility at Williams Stadium in Des Moines. The final seat in the row belonged to his defensive line coach. It's just the way Tom Barnabo left it the last time he was in the office. It still has the coach’s jacket draped across his chair and a pair of shoes, socks and sandals sitting under the deck he used. \"There’s stuff everywhere,” Woodley said. “He’s got papers from 2010. But, that’s just 'Barn.' He always thought he had to keep that stuff around just in case.” Barnabo was popular wherever he went, but especially in this building, where he spent over a decade working as an original member of the school’s first football staff.

Joan Bauer died of COVID-19 on Sept. 26, 2020, in Omaha at the age of 86. She was a powerful woman in her family, church and community, having raised eight children largely on her own. Olivia Sun/The Register Born on a farm in 1934, Joan Bauer desperately loved her family, which grew to include eight children, 18 grandchildren and 37 great-grandchildren. But Joan wasn’t the type of “warm and fuzzy” grandparent who oozed sympathy, her granddaughter Angie Pfannkuch said. If you went to her with a problem, you had better have a solution. Joan’s toughness came from her upbringing in the Great Depression, coping with the pain of early-onset rheumatoid arthritis and parenting eight children largely on her own. “Grandma didn’t see roadblocks,” Angie said. “She was someone that thought, either through prayer or time, you could figure anything out.” Click here to read Joan's story.

Her Mother, retired Judge Ruth Klotz passed away from COVID-19 earlier this year. Zach Boyden-Holmes/The Register When Ruth Klotz finally decided to hang up her robes after more than 30 years as a probate judge in Polk County, her colleagues made her a vow. If ever faced with a difficult problem on the bench, they’d ask themselves a simple question: “What Would Ruth Do?” Co-workers even handed out bracelets displaying the slogan at the then-90-year-old’s retirement party in 2013 — a small way to remind them of Ruth's sage advice and calm presence. For almost six decades, Ruth made an indelible impact on Iowa’s legal community, former colleagues said.

Sanford Naiditich served in the Army's 517th field artillery in World War II. Zach Boyden-Holmes/The Register Sanford Naiditch always wore his World War II veteran hat — except for when he saw another soldier. Then, he would calmly remove his cap, approach the GI and say, \"Thank you for your service.\" Taking his hat off was important to Sanford, who worked Army field artillery in Japan and the Philippines, because he wanted to offer his gratitude without making the receiver feel obligated to thank him in return. Years ago, when asked how he wanted to be remembered, Sanford answered: \"Patriotism and being a good family man.\" Indeed, no two traits better encapsulate the 97 years Sanford lived. Born in 1923 in Chicago, Sanford spent most of his life in Minneapolis, where he and his wife, Sylvia, raised their two children, Ira and Linda. Sanford and Sylvia filled Ira and Linda's childhoods with everything from horseback riding to skiing to rollerblading.

The views expressed here are solely the author’s own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nAs Darren Aronofsky’s “The Whale” – which has been in select theaters – opens in theaters around the country this week, the film could become a powerful empathy generator. Just perhaps not in the way it was intended.\n\nSara Stewart Todd Thompson\n\nThe film, which has garnered significant praise even as it’s prompted notable controversy, stars Brendan Fraser as Charlie, a 600-pound gay man slowly eating himself to death. It’s adapted from a play of the same name by Samuel D. Hunter, and one of its most-discussed features has been the fat suit Fraser wears.\n\nThe film has been a flashpoint for controversy since it debuted at the Venice Film Festival this summer. While critics and the public seem nearly unanimous in their desire for nice guy Fraser to get all the awards for his dedicated performance, a mounting chorus has described the film’s tone and content as fatphobic.\n\nI have not yet seen “The Whale,” as I’m not located in one of the two cities it’s been playing in prior to its expanded release this week. Given the acclaim the film’s received and my desire to see Fraser thrive after what he’s been through, I had originally planned to see it when I could. But after spending some time reading and listening to how harmful fat people say the portrayal is to them, I’m taking another look.\n\nThe fat suit isn’t the same as a lived experience\n\nBy many accounts, the film plays Charlie’s weight as an absolute tragedy and a visual horror show.\n\n“Aronofsky turns up the foley audio whenever Charlie is eating, to emphasize the wet sound of lips smacking together. He plays ominous music under these sequences, so we know Charlie’s doing something very bad indeed,” wrote Katie Rife in Polygon. “In case viewers still don’t get that they’re supposed to find him disgusting, he recites an essay about ‘Moby-Dick’ and how a whale is ‘a poor big animal’ with no feelings.”\n\nFrom the beginning, the film apparently humiliates Charlie abjectly: He’s shown nearly dying from a heart attack while masturbating to porn. “It was crystal clear that Mr. Hunter and Mr. Aronofsky considered fatness to be the ultimate human failure,” asserted Roxane Gay in the New York Times, “something despicable, to be avoided at all costs.”\n\nSo maybe it’s a good occasion to devote some effort to listening to, reading and amplifying voices from the fat community regarding their thoughts on “The Whale.”\n\nIt’s not like there’s any dearth of commentary about how bad being fat is, from official government warnings to comedians like Ricky Gervais who’ve made it one of their pet subjects. In a more novel development, though, early news of “The Whale” this year coincided with an uptick in discourse around both fat acceptance and open criticism of Hollywood’s history of generally horrific portrayals of fatness, most prominently in its use of the fat suit. Earlier this year, Sarah Paulson and Emma Thompson came under fire for wearing prosthetic body suits, the former as Linda Tripp in “Impeachment: American Crime Story,” and the latter as Miss Trunchbull in Netflix’s “Matilda.”\n\nHunter, who also wrote the film, told Entertainment Weekly, “I understand why people have some of those reactions because, look, the history of portraying people suffering with obesity in cinema is not good,” but argued that the film is an “invitation” to “be with” Charlie. For viewers who “do take that invitation and go inside,” he said “I think you’ll find that this is the diametric opposite of the way obesity has traditionally been portrayed and dealt with in cinema.”\n\nTo me, the best thing that could come out of all the publicity surrounding “The Whale” is the centering of the opinions of fat people on the film. Are they planning to see “The Whale”? What are other people saying to them about the movie? How will this affect them, and the way we all think about fatness? And shouldn’t those of us who haven’t had that lived experience maybe just… shut the F up?\n\nA lot of us need to listen to these voices\n\nAubrey Gordon, author of the forthcoming book “‘You Just Need to Lose Weight’ and 19 Other Myths About Fat People” and co-host of the excellent podcast “Maintenance Phase,” has been a crucial voice on the subject. In a 2021 episode of the show, she examined the obesity epidemic, including the ways in which research data has been misused over the past two decades to gin up a moral panic about fatness.\n\nFor me, Gordon and her co-host, Michael Hobbes, have been instrumental in evolving the way I process stories and information (and misinformation) about weight, “wellness,” and the loudest cultural voices speaking about health and lifestyle. Their episode on Dr. Oz is a smart, hilarious jumping-in point.\n\nIn discussing the discourse around “The Whale” on Twitter, Gordon pointed to another Hollywood movie that involved a fat suit: 2001’s “Shallow Hal,” the Farrelly brothers comedy whose running gag is that a guy (Jack Black) is hypnotized into believing a very fat woman (Gwyneth Paltrow, wearing the suit) is beautiful.\n\nWhen accused of being fatphobic, the filmmakers of “Shallow Hal” said that the “movie’s heart is in the right place.” That, said Gordon on Twitter, is beside the point. “It’s deeply telling & extraordinarily disheartening that so many people take thin creators saying ‘we didn’t mean to hurt fat people’ as saying they somehow DIDN’T or CAN’T hurt fat people. It’s deeply telling & extraordinarily disheartening that, after 20+ yrs, that still works.”\n\nIn the release of “The Whale,” she continued, “so much of the discourse this time around consists of fat people saying ‘this is going to make life harder for me’ and the response from people who aren’t fat is largely ‘no, it’s humanizing you.’ I would argue that’s our call to make.”\n\nGuy Branum, an actor, TV host and comedian who had a role in the recent romantic comedy “Bros,” has also been outspoken about his objections to “The Whale” and its portrayal of fat people. In an interview with NPR’s Glen Weldon, he noted Aronofsky’s citing health risks on set as his reason for putting an actor in a fat suit, rather than just casting a bigger actor. “I desperately pleaded with Nick Stoller, the director of ‘Bros,’ to take out a full page ad in Variety attesting to the fact that he had worked with me for four months,” he told Weldon, “and I did not explode once on set from fatness.”\n\nBranum has also shared his experience of reading the play the film is based on: “Part of me hoped it might be good, insightful about a life like mine. Instead it was a sad, pathetic story of a sad, pathetic man. I got sad for the main character, Charlie, and how little the author’s imagination offered his life, trapped in a bad apartment, eating fried chicken endlessly,” Branum wrote on Instagram, following it up with a description of taking the play on trips with him so it might enjoy a little happiness for a change.\n\nCritic Sean Donovan, who identifies as fat and queer, wrote movingly of his experience watching the film, particularly his dismay at its “soap opera” plotting around Charlie’s martyrish refusal to seek medical treatment so he can leave all his money to his daughter (Sadie Sink), who hates him.\n\nAs Donovan pointed out, there are other, more plausible reasons a man like Charlie might avoid hospitals: “The shame felt in medical spaces is a real danger to queer and fat populations, causing us to avoid them precisely when they are the most needed. These contexts never come up in ‘The Whale,’ to its detriment, as they could have invested the film with the breath of true challenges and barriers facing queer and fat people in the world.”\n\nAnti-fat bias has real-world casualties\n\nDonovan’s assertions are backed up by Scientific American, whose weight stigma reporter Virginia Sole-Smith has covered the many ways in which medicine is tainted by anti-fat bias, from doctors who admit they’re “disgusted” by overweight patients to the “obesity paradox,” which refers to findings that in some cases, “fat people [are] not dying of heart disease like we’re always told they will,” and that in fact being physically active is more important for heart health than how big your body is.\n\nIt’s in Aronofsky’s failure to engage any of these viewpoints – and he’s done a lot of talking about the movie since its release – that he makes clear how little connection there is between “The Whale” and living, breathing fat people.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nSo instead of seeing this film I’m making plans to read and listen to writers who are working to change the perception and portrayal of fat people. In addition to Gordon’s book and podcast, there is critic Clarkisha Kent’s memoir “Fat Off, Fat On: A Big Bitch Manifesto,” coming out next March, and journalist and author Evette Dionne’s new book “Weightless: Making Space for My Resilient Body and Soul.” Also worth a read: “Shrill,” by Lindy West (which later became an Aidy Bryant-starring TV show), a memoir that became an instant classic when it published in 2016.\n\nI think West should have the last word here, from her 2011 essay on fat-shaming, “Hello, I Am Fat.” Her words describe why, despite whatever may be great about “The Whale,” I don’t want to see it.\n\n“This is what’s behind this entire thing—it’s not about ‘health,’ it’s about ‘eeeewwwww.’ You think fat people are icky. Eeeewww, a fat person might touch you on a plane. With their fat!… And sorry, I reject your eeeeeewwww.”", "authors": ["Sara Stewart"], "publish_date": "2022/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2017/05/27/man-who-reinvented-meth/330877001/", "title": "The Man Who Reinvented Meth", "text": "Thomas Gounley\n\nNews-Leader\n\nJohn Cornille had been with the Drug Enforcement Administration for seven years. Yet he couldn't wrap his head around what his informant was describing.\n\nIt was November 1992, and the man was talking about a visit to a home in Reeds Spring, Missouri. He said he'd been forced at gunpoint to use methamphetamine manufactured there. But something was off. The informant didn't mention beakers, flasks, Bunsen burners — none of the complex glassware Cornille was taught were part of meth labs.\n\nInstead, the informant reported an unusual scene: Black trash bags stuffed with empty boxes of cold medicine. A mason jar full of kerosene, with something resembling a hockey puck settled at the bottom. Starter fluid. And a cookie sheet in the oven, with a yellowish cake on it.\n\nCornille, like other DEA agents, had made meth himself, under controlled circumstances, as part of his official duties. It was standard practice; the agency knew it meant he'd have more credibility when he asked a court for a search warrant or filled out a probable cause statement recommending criminal charges. It was important that prosecutors see him and other agents as experts on the manufacturing of illegal drugs.\n\nAs Cornille sat down to request a warrant for the Reeds Spring home, he couldn't be that authoritative. He needed another source, someone who could credibly link common household items with the production of meth, a highly-addictive substance known for its energy boost. He called a chemist working for the DEA in Chicago.\n\n“I still remember what he said, because I wrote it down word for word,\" Cornille recalled in a recent interview. \"He said, ‘There’s a basis for such a formula in literature, but it’s not been seen in the United States.\"\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since the investigation, but that's not the only comment that remains lodged in Cornille's memory.\n\nAt some point, as the informant was describing the unusual lab in Reeds Spring, Cornille asked him if the meth was any good. If the answer was no, he figured, the situation might not be that big a deal. Low-quality stuff was unlikely to spread.\n\nThe informant, however, had five words for him:\n\n\"Best dope I ever had.\"\n\nThree months later, in Springfield, Cornille sat across from a recently-arrested 49-year-old man.\n\nWith a voice recorder rolling, Cornille introduced himself for the record, then moved on to his guest.\n\n“With me today is Mr. Bob Paillet,” Cornille said, according to a transcript. “Mr. Paillet has agreed to talk to me and explain to me different methods of manufacturing methamphetamine. One using the sodium metal and anhydrous ammonia and then a couple others.”\n\nCornille told Paillet — pronounced “Pie-ay” — that he wanted \"just to sit down and talk to you about those different methods.\"\n\n\"How you discovered them, and so forth,” Cornille said.\n\nPaillet began by saying he'd always been interested in chemistry and physics and that he'd \"just played around with my chemistry set.\" Then he got detailed. He talked about molecules, replacement reactions and acetic acid, about catalysts, synthesis and hydroxyl groups. Scientific terms flowed with minimal prompting.\n\nAbout halfway through the conversation, Paillet made a remark that fell somewhere between a suggestion and a prediction.\n\n“You’re gonna have to send all your agents back to school and learn chemistry … There’s people out there that are going to great lengths to avoid getting caught,” he said.\n\nCornille responded. “Well, see I went to school to learn how to manufacture methamphetamine and to …”\n\nPaillet cut him off.\n\n“All the old ways,” he said.\n\nCornille joined the DEA in 1985 after serving on the local police force in Washington D.C. He spent the remainder of the decade in the nation's capital, fighting the crack epidemic. In 1990, he was transferred to southwest Missouri. At that point, Cornille recalls now, meth ranked about third on the agency's local priority list. Cocaine and marijuana were much more prevalent.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, however, the number of meth labs seized by the authorities drastically increased, first in Missouri, and gradually in other communities around the country. Before the decade was out, as the public and the media sought answers as to how the drug shifted from a problem to a crisis — how it grew powerful enough to ravage entire communities — law enforcement would point to Paillet by name.\n\n\"He brought it to life for this area,\" Springfield police Cpl. Dan Schrader told the News-Leader in 1998.\n\nPaillet essentially converted the process of producing meth from a complex formula — one that required the so-called \"cook\" to have a chemistry background — to a simple recipe that could be followed by the masses. DEA and court records indicate Paillet taught his method to others, who in turn taught it within their own respective circles. The man behind the unusual meth lab in Reeds Spring learned the method from one of Paillet's friends, Cornille said.\n\nPaillet wasn't a drug lord; he didn't control a network of associates. In fact, he did the opposite, spawning a generation of cooks by unintentionally democratizing an illegal industry. One textbook released in 2014 called Paillet \"arguably the Johnny Appleseed for the spread of local meth production throughout the Midwest.\" Journalist Frank Owen, in his own book released in 2007, wrote that Paillet “effectively decentralized the local meth trade … broadening the appeal of the drug.\"\n\nIn other words, Bob Paillet reinvented meth.\n\nHow did he do it? The story he told law enforcement revolves around the Springfield campus of Missouri State University, which at the time was known as Southwest Missouri State.\n\n“Bob claims he went to SMS’ library, and in a research manual he found this method of converting pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine using sodium metal as one of the catalysts,\" Cornille said. \"He claimed that at the top of the page was a swastika.”\n\nThus the moniker: The new process was the \"Nazi method.\" The new stuff, \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“I really believe that his method, here in Springfield, was the bounce to get meth spread throughout the rest of Missouri and the United States,\" said Nick Console, who ran the DEA's Springfield office from the mid-1990s through the early 2000s.\n\nDespite Paillet's pioneering role in an American drug epidemic, relatively little has been known about him. In the later years of his life, he appears to have avoided public scrutiny, as well as further trouble with the law. He died in Texas, age 72, on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nPaillet's death and the passage of time have obscured some details. Other key elements — like his recipe's alleged connection to the Third Reich — have taken on the characteristics of urban legend.\n\nCourt documents obtained by the News-Leader shed light on his arrest and the early spread of the Nazi method. Interviews with family members and a key associate, none of whom have previously spoken publicly, paint a picture of a man with an obsession who left public officials scrambling to respond for years.\n\nThe probable cause statement used to charge Paillet, written by Cornille, traces his arrival on law enforcement's radar to Jan. 24, 1993 — just over a week before he was arrested.\n\nThat day, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office arrested two Springfield residents, Christopher Fricks and Kimberly Lee Duncan, for possession of a controlled substance and possession of a short-barreled shotgun.\n\nIt's not clear from court documents how or why Paillet's name came up as the two were taken into custody. What is clear is that they told deputies of two places where Paillet stored materials he used to make meth.\n\nThe first was a room in a house Fricks was renting in Joplin. Authorities searched it on Jan. 28. The second was a property near the small town of Morrisville, where Paillet previously lived. One of his ex-wives allowed law enforcement on the property on Feb. 1. Both tips were substantiated.\n\nThen, on Feb. 2, a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper and Polk County deputies headed to Paillet's apartment on West 3rd Street in Battlefield. Paillet wasn't home, but his current wife was, and she began speaking to the men. She mentioned her husband would sometimes disappear for up to three weeks at a time, telling her he was working in Kansas City.\n\nMidway through the conversation, Paillet drove up in a tan 1983 Chevy Cavalier. He walked inside, and set an unzipped black duffel bag on the floor. The grip of a pistol stuck out from the top, and the trooper quickly moved to secure the gun. It was loaded: Nineteen rounds, one in the chamber. Paillet said he'd traded for it.\n\nThe trooper and the deputies asked Paillet to talk outside. He said sure.\n\nThey walked out and the officers read Paillet his Miranda rights. According to court documents, Paillet “stated he was glad to see them and glad that it was over.”\n\nThen he began to talk.\n\nStanding outside his Battlefield, Missouri, home with a state trooper and several sheriff's deputies, Bob Paillet gave the men consent to search his vehicle.\n\nHe knew why they were there. Before they could open the door of his Chevy Cavalier, he told them what they'd find: methamphetamine, inside a small white pill bottle in the trunk. Once the drugs were retrieved, Paillet led the officers back inside and pointed out the two sawed-off shotguns under a bed.\n\nThe same day — Feb. 2, 1993 — the trooper and the Polk County deputies drove Paillet to the Missouri State Highway Patrol's regional headquarters on Kearney Street. There they were joined by John Cornille, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent based in Springfield.\n\nAuthorities found a note in Paillet's pocket, with a chemical formula written out. They also found two receipts, from trips to Walmart.\n\nShortly before dusk, after speaking with investigators, Paillet led the men to Room 431 of the American Inn Hotel in northeast Springfield, where he showed them the meth-making materials he had stashed there. Then they all drove across town to a storage facility in Battlefield, where he kept a second stash.\n\nThe News-Leader reported the bust two days later, with the headline \"Police nail 'Nazi Dope' laboratory in Battlefield.\" The authorities said chemical disposal workers wearing special suits and protective gloves spent about three hours clearing the storage unit. They estimated disposing of the chemicals would cost the federal government $35,000.\n\nThe story noted that, nationwide, the number of meth lab busts had declined in recent years. But it also quoted the head of a local drug task force, with a premonition that would turn out to be spot on.\n\n“This Nazi dope is definitely new to this area, and it could be the first in the U.S.,” said Steve Whitney, also the sheriff in nearby Christian County. “I still think we may see this more and more.”\n\nAlthough credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of producing meth — and opening the door to an era of amateur meth labs across the Midwest — Paillet himself has remained something of a mystery.\n\nNews stories and a handful of books published in the decades since his 1993 arrest have presented scant detail: He moved from California to Missouri in the 1980s and, upon finding meth was more expensive than he was used to out west, set out to make it himself. He researched chemistry at the library at Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was arrested. He moved to Texas.\n\nThat narrative covers just a portion of his life.\n\nBorn on March 4, 1943, Robert Paillet was 72 when he died Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nHe left behind two daughters. In an email to the News-Leader, the oldest offered a theme for his biography:\n\n\"My father is a classic case of what PTSD does to a brilliant mind.\"\n\nSpeed. Crank. Dope. Ice. Zip. The poor man's cocaine.\n\nWhatever you call it, meth is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system.\n\nIt's odorless, typically white and can be found in powder and crystal forms. In the United States, it has for decades been a schedule II substance, which means it has some very limited accepted medical uses — for conditions like attention deficit disorder and obesity, under the trade name Desoxyn — but also a high potential for abuse, as well as psychological or physical dependence.\n\nOne of the things that sets meth apart from other illegal substances is its means of production.\n\n\"Unlike other major drugs of abuse, methamphetamine is a synthetic drug, and as such, is manufactured in a laboratory,\" the DEA wrote in a 2016 report. \"Methamphetamine does not rely on a plant as its main source and is not affected by drought, flooding, growth cycles, or other natural elements that affect production. Instead, methamphetamine production relies on the ability of traffickers to obtain precursors and other essential chemicals.\"\n\nMeth is most commonly smoked, snorted or injected. Its use causes an increase in energy and alertness and a decrease in appetite. Meth also produces an intense euphoric rush, and can make users hypersexual. Cornille said the high from crack cocaine lasts for a matter for minutes. With meth, the high lasts for hours.\n\nMeth can cause increased heart rate and blood pressure, tremors and convulsions and — particularly with repeated use — depression and motor and cognitive failure. Users also tend to not sleep for extended periods, which leads to additional detrimental effects.\n\nBob Paillet's death certificate lists his birthplace as San Diego. His oldest daughter, now 48, said her father was actually born on Canada's Vancouver Island, although his parents had previously lived in California.\n\nLisa Paillet — who spoke to the News-Leader on the condition that her real first name not be used — said Bob's father, Francis \"Fred\" Paillet, was a Vermont native and worked as a carpenter and master gardener. His mother, Quebec native Louise Marie Paillet, was a maid and cook.\n\nThe family moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, when Bob was in junior high, then to the small town of Exeter, Missouri, about 60 miles southwest of Springfield, several years later. After graduating from Exeter High School in 1961, Bob enlisted in the Navy and was sent to California's Bay Area. He was taking forestry classes at the University of California-Berkeley when, in 1964, he was deployed to Vietnam on the aircraft carrier USS Ranger.\n\nLisa said her father returned to the United States with \"debilitating migraines and a jaundiced view of the world,\" after a commanding officer \"rode one of his crew members so hard\" that he committed suicide. She believes Bob had post-traumatic stress disorder, although he was never formally diagnosed. For the most part, Lisa said, her father avoided talking about his time at war.\n\nUpon his return home in 1965, Bob Paillet married Lisa’s mother, whom he met in Berkeley prior to his deployment. They briefly lived in Oakland before embarking on a year-long trip around the United States, ultimately ending in Kansas City. Over the next five years, Bob and his wife bounced back and forth between there and the Bay Area. Bob never returned to college.\n\nLisa was born in California in 1968. She said her father had an assortment of jobs over the years. Sometimes he flipped houses, or built new ones. He liked to purchase and restore antique cars, a lifelong passion of his, for resale. He wasn't always self-employed, however. When Lisa was born, he worked as a lineman for the phone company.\n\nAround 1970, the family of three was living in Kansas City, where Bob worked for a fiberglass company. One day, he saw a friend and co-worker get electrocuted. It's a moment that \"damaged\" her father, Lisa said.\n\nThe family moved back to California, where Bob reconnected with a friend who was using meth. At some point, Lisa said, the friend got hold of a bad batch and became sick.\n\n\"So my father went to the Berkeley public library and the university library and started researching chemistry books,\" Lisa said.\n\nWhy chemistry books? Bob \"wanted him to have clean drugs.\"\n\n\"That’s my father’s logic,\" she said. \"Not get him off the drugs — but make them better.”\n\nWithin a few years, Lisa said, Bob became \"really flaky and moody.\" Around 1973, at Bob's request, Lisa's mother gave her husband a year to travel and find himself. He took two. When Bob came back, the couple divorced.\n\n\"After that, I saw him off and on for camping trips, hiking, or things like roller skating,\" Lisa said. \"It was a good compromise. I got to see him when he was in the mood to play. If he was not, he was not around. This basic relationship carried us through life.\"\n\nThe extent to which Bob used or produced meth in the ensuing years is unclear. Sometime during the two-year break, Lisa said, Bob met the woman who would become his second wife. His youngest daughter, Gena Paillet, was born in the Springfield area in 1978.\n\n\"I can remember I grew up terrified of him, because he would be one happy person one minute and literally in a second go to this terrifying person,\" Gena said.\n\nBy the time he was arrested with methamphetamine in the trunk of his car in 1993, Bob Paillet was on his third marriage.\n\nHe had fathered two children, born 10 years apart, in different states, to different women. The lives of his daughters, to this day, have had relatively little overlap.\n\nBoth women, however, have memories of living with their father on a plot of rural land along Highway JJ, not far from Morrisville, Missouri. The town of about 400 is 25 miles north of Springfield.\n\nThe remote venue in the anonymous rolling hills of the Ozarks appears to have been one place where Paillet refined the work that would later turn the meth trade on its head.\n\nGena Paillet, Bob's youngest daughter, lived there in the mid-1980s. She and her father had recently moved back to Missouri from California. Her mother, Bob's second wife, stayed behind in the Golden State for a year to work. Gena and her father lived in a modified school bus while Bob began building a house.\n\nIt was a simple setting. The bathroom for a time was an outhouse. But the property gave Gena, who says she grew up fearing her father, what she calls \"some of the best memories of my life.\" There were dense woods to explore, and the property abutted the Little Sac River.\n\n“We’d go swimming in that all the time and catch crawdads, things like that,\" Gena said. \"I’ve thought about going back to that property.\"\n\nWithin a couple years, however, Bob and his second wife separated. Gena said her father was unfaithful and verbally abusive. She and her mother went to live in Morrisville.\n\nNot long after, in 1987, Bob's oldest daughter, a product of his first marriage, arrived at the property.\n\nLisa Paillet — the first name is a pseudonym — grew up in California, where she was born in 1968. She saw her father only occasionally, but at times felt his presence even when he wasn't around. In high school, Lisa said, adults would sometimes show up and \"imply that they knew my father and were supposed to watch out for me.”\n\nLisa came to live with her father as she prepared to attend Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was footing the bill.\n\nThree decades later, Lisa remembers the property as a place where her father experimented. Bob never said exactly what he was doing, and Lisa sensed it might be best if she didn't exactly know. She recalls helping her father hook together motors and going on shopping trips to Walmart to buy cold medicine.\n\n\"He would buy tons of that stuff, and he said it was easy for him to break down to get the chemicals he wanted,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob coached Lisa not to give her name to people. If somebody came looking for her father, she was supposed to deny that she knew him. Instead of guard dogs, the property near Morrisville had guard geese. The animals tend to raise a racket when they're disturbed.\n\n\"If you heard the geese and it was dark outside, you hit the lights and you hit the floor,” Lisa said.\n\nThere is some overlap in Lisa and Gena's memories. Both recall a room on the property where they weren't supposed to go. Gena distinctly remembers hiding behind a tree one day, on a weekend visit sometime after her parents separated, and watching her father go inside.\n\n\"I just remember seeing this one huge table ... with beakers and pots and things smoking and, you know, tubes going from one to the other,\" she said. \"I didn’t know what it was, but I knew he was up to something. And by his behavior becoming much more erratic, we knew something was wrong. We just didn’t know what.”\n\nBy the 1980s, the U.S. meth trade — both manufacturing and distribution — was largely run by outlaw motorcycle gangs. In some places, it was the Hell's Angels. In Texas, it was the Bandidos.\n\nNick Console, a Louisiana native now living in Ash Grove, joined the DEA in 1983, and was soon working out of the agency's Houston office.\n\nIn an interview, Console said that meth labs back then were primarily located in out-of-the-way, rural areas, so the rotten egg smell produced during a cook wouldn't give the operation away. They were full of glassware, not unlike a scene from the hit TV series \"Breaking Bad.\" The labs churned out batches of the drug measured in pounds.\n\nBusts by the authorities would sometimes lead to shoot-outs. At times, cleaning up a lab consisted of dumping the chemicals in the nearest ditch, Console said. The Environmental Protection Agency had yet to sound the alarm. Nobody thought to wear a respirator.\n\n“These labs, they were out in west Texas, they might be out in the boonies in an old mobile home, but everything in that mobile home was a lab,\" Console said.\n\nMeth was big business for the bikers, and it required a specialized workforce, he said. The gangs employed their own chemists, who generally used what is known as the P2P method, in reference to its incorporation of phenylacetone, a chemical often used for industrial cleaning or photo processing purposes.\n\nBack then, Console said, “you had to be a chemist to make meth.”\n\nThe meth trade's biker era bled into southwest Missouri. In 1987, Glennon Paul Sweet, a local member of the Hell's Angels-affiliated Galloping Goose motorcycle club, gunned down Highway Patrol Trooper Russell Harper during a routine traffic stop just outside Springfield. It was later determined Sweet, who was ultimately put to death, was transporting meth.\n\nThe wooded hollows of southern Missouri once attracted moonshiners. By the late 1980s, the region's rural nature and sparse law enforcement presence were seen as ideal for making meth. DEA officials reported that manufacturers were buying or leasing farmhouses and converting them into P2P labs. Still, they were few and far between; Cornille said agents typically came across a couple of labs per year.\n\nAfter being transferred from Houston, Console worked for the DEA overseas in Turkey, then in San Francisco. In the fall of 1994, about a year and a half after Paillet's arrest, he arrived in Springfield as the DEA's new resident agent in charge.\n\n“When I got here, it was the beginning of the spike in meth labs,\" he said.\n\nLisa Paillet doesn't believe her father was ever in a motorcycle gang. But Bob definitely associated with some shady types.\n\n\"I know that when I was in circles of people that I would consider very bad people, he was known in California,” she said.\n\nLisa also said her father \"would have hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash sometimes, and then he would have nothing.\"\n\nEither way, Paillet had no prior criminal record when, in January 1993, he became a person of interest to law enforcement agencies in southwest Missouri. The authorities had encountered a new type of meth lab — using what became known as the \"Nazi method\" — in the town of Reeds Spring just a couple months earlier.\n\nIn DEA records reviewed by the News-Leader, Paillet said he was the one who discovered the new process, but never specifically stated when that happened. Evidence suggests, however, that it was years before his arrest.\n\nThe Reeds Spring lab wasn't the first of its kind. A Nazi method-style lab was found in 1988 in a trailer park in Vacaville, California, according to a 1990 article in the Journal of Forensic Sciences. Authorities later came to believe Paillet was behind the lab — a conclusion that appears supported by his numerous connections to the state.\n\nThe Nazi method starts with the compound pseudoephedrine, which, chemically speaking, is one oxygen atom removed from methamphetamine. Pseudoephedrine is the active ingredient in cold medicines sold under brand names such as Sudafed.\n\nHere’s how a former DEA chemist described the ensuing process:\n\nTo make meth, the manufacturer pulverizes the pseudoephedrine pills in a coffee grinder, creating a fine powder that is placed in a coffee filter. Methyl alcohol, in the form of something like windshield washer fluid, is poured over it, and then evaporated out.\n\nThe cook then adds ether, anhydrous ammonia - a compound commonly used by farmers as fertilizer – and sodium metal or lithium metal, which can be stripped from commercial batteries. That produces a liquid called meth oil.\n\nMore ether is added, and the solution is put through another coffee filter. A bubbler is then used to convert rock salt and other material to hydrogen chloride gas, which converts the meth oil into a white powder. Meth.\n\nThe Nazi method is also sometimes referred to as the Birch method because it builds upon the Birch reduction, a reaction first reported in 1944 by the Australian chemist Arthur Birch.\n\nThe significance of the Nazi method was how simple it was. When DEA agent John Cornille gave talks to community members, he'd compare it to baking a cake.\n\n“Bob made meth a recipe anyone could follow,” he said.\n\nThe Nazi method produced small amounts of the drug, not the big batches typically cooked up in rural \"superlabs.\" But unlike previous manufacturing methods, Nazi dope didn't require an open heat source. It involved fewer steps, and took less time.\n\n\"From start to finish, you could probably do it in an hour,\" Cornille said.\n\nAdditionally, the chemicals involved were legal, and often easy to obtain. It takes hundreds of pseudoephedrine pills to make a half ounce of meth. But purchasing cold medicine in vast quantities didn't raise eyebrows in the early 1990s.\n\n\"At that time, if someone came in and bought 10 boxes of pseudoephedrine, Walgreens was happy,\" Cornille said.\n\nBob Paillet ordered a pecan waffle with extra butter and a glass of milk, then settled into the booth at a north Springfield Waffle House. He was wearing a wire.\n\nAfter being arrested on Feb. 2, 1993, the Springfield-area resident told the authorities that he'd taught his new recipe for methamphetamine — the so-called \"Nazi method\" — to a friend. Now, less than 24 hours later, Paillet, 49, was killing time reading the newspaper, waiting for that man to arrive. Drug Enforcement Administration agent John Cornille and a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper were listening from a van parked nearby.\n\n\"Hey, late as usual,\" Paillet said as Mike Poplawski, 34, arrived.\n\nA transcript of the conversation that took place over breakfast — obtained from the DEA under the Freedom of Information Act — is heavily redacted, with Poplawski's comments completely blacked out.\n\nBy the time they parted ways, however, Poplawski had given Paillet 279 milligrams of meth, according to court documents. The wire caught everything.\n\nThe next day, Cornille and the trooper showed up at Poplawski's home on South Newton Street.\n\nPoplawski was cooperative. He invited the officers in, and, when told there was an ongoing investigation that involved him, admitted that he cooked meth, according to court documents. He showed the trooper a baggie of the drug inside his wallet, and then took them to another apartment where he stored lab equipment and precursor chemicals.\n\nLater, at the DEA office, Poplawski confirmed he'd been taught by Paillet how to make meth using the Nazi method.\n\nIn a recent interview, Poplawski, now 59, said he first met Paillet in 1979.\n\nRollerskating was the thing to do back then, and \"we were both hotdoggers,\" Poplawski said, using a term for those fond of showing off. The pair — 35 and 21 years old — met at a north Springfield rink. Poplawski said they were among the first in the city to purchase jogger skates, basically tennis shoes with big, brightly-colored wheels.\n\nPoplawski said he believes Paillet might've smoked a little pot back then, and he drank, but he didn't do anything harder. Then Paillet left for California. When he returned, he was into meth. And Poplawski was, too.\n\nHe attempted to describe his relationship with Paillet back then.\n\n\"Friend?\" he said. \"No. Associate. Close associate.\"\n\nIt's unclear from court records when Paillet taught Poplawski the Nazi method. Poplawski declined to clarify the timeline.\n\nPoplawski did state that, sometime in 1992, there'd been what might be called a misunderstanding between the pair. Paillet asked Poplawski to stop giving meth to a mutual friend of theirs. Poplawski complied. The friend complained to Paillet, who by that point had forgotten his earlier directive and became angry at Poplawski. The two stopped talking.\n\nThen six or eight months later, there was a phone call. And a request to meet at the Waffle House along North Kansas Expressway. From Poplawski's perspective, it seemed an effort to repair the rift.\n\nSitting in the living room of his east Springfield home, Poplawski briefly looked over the redacted transcript of the conversation that day. Some of it was small talk, he said. Mostly, Paillet was \"crying about hurting, wanting some speed.\"\n\nIt's been nearly a quarter century since the conversation, and Poplawski doesn't have a single positive thing to say about Paillet.\n\nThe man was chauvinistic, he said. A shorter guy with \"a big man's want for power,\" someone who walked around \"like a bantam rooster.\" A guy who \"hit on every woman that he come across, no matter what.\" And a man whose defining obsession — all speeders have one, Poplawski said — was \"his process,\" the way he made his dope.\n\n\"He experimented on people,\" Poplawski said. \"He’d change the formula a little bit and then give it to junkies he knew’d take it and ask no questions, and then watch their reactions. This is the guy that DEA worked with.\"\n\nAs Poplawski looked at the transcript, he wouldn't even agree with Paillet's remark that he showed up to the Waffle House late.\n\n“I’m more on time than anybody I know,” he said.\n\nThe authorities didn't stop with Poplawski.\n\nShortly after 9 p.m. on July 26, 1993, Cornille and three other law enforcement officers parked their vehicles in rural Webster County, with a barn in sight. They were investigating the latest appearance of Nazi dope. Cornille remembers hearing coyotes howl.\n\n\"Having moved from D.C. to here, it was a bit of a change for me,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, an informant told a Springfield police detective that a man named Frank Wright was planning to cook meth at the barn, which was owned by an associate, Gary Davis. The men would start once the sun went down, the informant said, to take advantage of lower humidity levels. The informant indicated Wright drove a green Dodge van. It was parked by the barn.\n\nInvestigators would later learn that, earlier that afternoon, Davis heard that a friend with a similar vehicle was stopped by the DEA. Davis became nervous and told Wright to \"burn the barn\" if agents showed up.\n\nAround 10 p.m., the van started up. It drove off the property, headed west. Cornille and the others followed and initiated a traffic stop.\n\nWright agreed to a search. The van was clean. But the officers found a cigarette pack with a small amount of meth on Wright himself. They read him his rights.\n\nWright admitted to the authorities that he was planning to cook meth, and said he was placing supplies inside the barn. It was to have been something of a trade, court documents indicate. Davis, in exchange for providing the setting for the cook, was to receive two \"eight balls\" — the term for an eighth of an ounce — and be allowed to assist in production, so as to learn the new method himself.\n\nWright was arrested. The barn, by all accounts, escaped unharmed.\n\nDavis contacted the DEA a week later. He admitted to knowing about plans for the cook and said he'd participated in an earlier one.\n\nWright, in turn, contacted the DEA in mid-August. He said he'd been introduced to meth about 18 months prior when he was at Poplawski's home. Paillet showed up to deliver the drug. Wright said he started doing work on Paillet's vehicle, and his involvement gradually grew, until he was loading and unloading chemicals and driving Paillet around while he distributed meth.\n\nWright told the DEA that Poplawski taught him to make meth. He described it as a somewhat formal process that entailed assisting with three cooks. (Poplawski, in a recent interview, denied ever teaching anyone the Nazi method).\n\nThe hardest ingredient to obtain was sodium metal, Wright told the DEA, so he figured out a way to manufacture it himself, using lye, an electric stove, jumper cables and a 12-volt car battery.\n\nHow did Wright come up with the workaround? Perhaps his time with Paillet influenced him.\n\n\"In late June, 1993, or early July, 1993, Wright did research into the manufacture of sodium metal at Southwest Missouri State University,\" court documents say.\n\nPaillet, Poplawski, Wright and Davis were indicted by a federal grand jury on Oct. 8. 1993, along with two others, Kenneth and Sybil Allen. Court documents say Poplawski sold meth to, and purchased meth from, the couple. The charge against Sybil Allen was later dropped.\n\nNone of them were rich, at least as far as the court knew. Financial affidavits indicate that Poplawski was the only one employed in a traditional sense, bringing home $280 a week. Paillet and the others were listed as self-employed or unemployed, with minimal assets.\n\nThree of the men had a record. Poplawski had been convicted in 1978 of felony robbery in Phelps County. Two others had stealing and drug offenses.\n\nThe men all initially pleaded not guilty and bonded out of jail. Dates were set for jury trials. Behind the scenes, however, negotiations were being made for plea agreements.\n\nBetween mid-December and early January 1994, all five pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth. In exchange, additional charges against some of them, for physically manufacturing or possessing the drug, were dropped.\n\nWith Paillet and his co-conspirators rounded up, the authorities could have been excused for thinking they'd nipped the nascent meth-making boom in the bud. But they were soon disappointed. The recipe for Nazi dope was no longer a secret.\n\nThe inaugural class of those involved with \"Nazi dope\" was sentenced in Springfield in the spring of 1994.\n\nThere was Bob Paillet, who told authorities he was the pioneer behind the new meth labs popping up in southwest Missouri; Mike Poplawski, to whom Paillet taught his new method; Frank Wright, who said he learned it from Poplawski; Gary Davis, who arranged to learn it from Wright; and Kenneth Allen, who bought meth from, and sold meth to, Poplawski.\n\nAllen, who tested positive for using drugs while on bond, was sentenced to three years probation.\n\nDavis also used meth while on bond and traveled without permission out of the state. He was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nPoplawski was sentenced to nearly six years in prison.\n\nIf the sentencing guidelines at the time were followed, Wright would've faced something similar — between six to seven years behind bars. Prosecutors, however, told the judge he provided \"substantial assistance\" in the prosecution of Poplawski. So he was sentenced to about three years in prison, followed by a similar amount of probation.\n\nThen there was Paillet, who received the best deal of them all.\n\nUsing the sentencing guidelines, prosecutors calculated Paillet's \"total offense level\" to be 31. That would correspond with nine to 11 years behind bars. The prosecutors, however, wrote that \"defendant agreed to fully cooperate with the government.\" He was credited with assisting in obtaining the guilty pleas of the others: Poplawski, Allen, Wright and Davis.\n\nAdditionally, the prosecutors wrote that Paillet \"provided significant information concerning the origin of this particular method of making methamphetamine.\"\n\n\"Defendant fully admitted that he first devised this method of making methamphetamine, and it was through him that the method was related to other 'cooks' in the southwest Missouri area,\" they wrote.\n\nPaillet was sentenced to five years of probation. He also attended a drug treatment program. While there, he received a letter from his oldest daughter, living in California.\n\n\"Surprise, Surprise,\" she wrote. \"If I would have known you could do things like that I would have asked for help with my chemistry homework.\"\n\nNearly a quarter century later, Poplawski doesn't understand how Paillet didn't spend a day in prison.\n\n“This was the man that experimented on people, and the DEA worked with him,\" Poplawski said. \"I’m a little burnt about that, still. It still rises my anger a bunch. Not that I was interested in working with them myself, don’t get me wrong, and not that I wasn’t involved, don’t get me wrong there. But I was not the man on top. I was not the man to hit for the heavy sentence.”\n\nPoplawski was implicated when Paillet wore a wire to their meeting at a north Springfield Waffle House. Poplawski told the News-Leader the pair never spoke after that day, except for one comment when they found themselves in the same courtroom.\n\n\"No hard feelings,\" Paillet told the man who had once been his friend. Poplawski, flabbergasted, didn't respond.\n\n\"If I could’ve shot lightning out of my eyes, he’d have been a pile of flesh, a pile of ash, in a heartbeat,\" Poplawski said. \"He just cost me five years. He cost me five years.”\n\nThere's something about calling a drug recipe the \"Nazi method\" that attracts attention.\n\nA few days after Paillet was arrested in February 1993, the News-Leader wrote about the bust. A spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration was quoted saying that \"people give their drugs all kind of names.\"\n\n\"Just because it was made by German soldiers during World War II and now is called 'Nazi drugs' has no meaning to us,\" the spokeswoman said. \"It's a nothingness. It only means that the producers don't have to use the usual ingredients, that they can make it without the regular methods. It's dangerous, no matter what you call it or how you make it.\"\n\nThere's a problem with the spokeswoman's response — one that's been replicated in many subsequent discussions of the Nazi method. It implied there's a direct link between Paillet's recipe and the Third Reich. But is there? After reviewing the available evidence, the News-Leader found the connection, while compelling, is tenuous.\n\nResearchers have delved into German use of meth during World War II. Temmler, a Berlin-based pharmaceutical company, introduced meth in pill form under the brand name Pervitin in 1938, according to a 2005 report in the news magazine Der Spiegel. By 1940, millions of pills were being shipped to the front lines, resulting \"in a Blitzkrieg fueled by speed.\"\n\nGermany wasn't alone in exploiting new substances with minimal consideration for side effects. The United States and British supplied service members with tablets of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, during the same period. Both were viewed as particularly valuable for pilots, who needed to remain alert on long bombing raids.\n\nThe large-scale manufacture of Pervitin pills in German factories, however, stands in stark contrast to Paillet's method, which resulted in small amounts of a powdered version of the drug. Which raises the question: If the method wasn't the same, how did meth produced in southwest Missouri end up referencing a fascist state?\n\nIn an interview, DEA agent John Cornille said that Paillet told him he learned the Nazi method by researching in the library at what was then Southwest Missouri State University. Cornille said Paillet indicated he came across a book or a document with a swastika on it.\n\nThose two particular claims aren't found in the hundreds of pages of federal court and DEA records reviewed for this story. The DEA records, which were heavily redacted, do include one conversation in which Cornille asked Paillet if he looked \"this stuff up in a book or something.\" The response, however, contradicts the notion that there was one all-important document.\n\n\"OK, I have a lot of books,\" Paillet said. \"I have gone through the library, many libraries and read lots of books, hundreds of 'em. Ah, involving many phrases of chemistry.\"\n\nCornille asked what books \"originally kinda gave you this idea that maybe this thing could work.\"\n\n\"I can’t say that it was any one in particular,\" Paillet responded.\n\nCornille told the News-Leader he believes most of the backstory Paillet gave regarding his discovery. However, he said the DEA tried to determine the exact book that contributed to Paillet's breakthrough, but came up empty-handed.\n\n“I believe he found it in a book at SMS,\" Cornille said. \"But the swastika thing — they looked far and wide.”\n\nThe man who did the searching says it's a little more complicated than that.\n\nTerry Dal Cason retired from a 40-year-career as a forensic chemist with the DEA in 2011. He told the News-Leader that, back in the mid-1990s, his colleagues in the world of meth lab analysis didn't talk vaguely about a cook in southwest Missouri coming across a book or document with a swastika on it, as Cornille does now.\n\nInstead, Dal Cason said, they specifically mentioned a \"Nazi patent.\" Some of his colleagues stated as fact that the cook came across a patent that contained the exact recipe for Nazi dope. But Dal Cason wanted proof.\n\n\"People kept talking about this patent, and I was trying to get a copy of it,\" he said.\n\nDal Cason ended up with two theories. In 1997, he laid them out in an article for a little-known DEA publication called Microgram.\n\nTheory one:\n\nDal Cason wrote that \"one of the earliest groups\" to make Nazi dope compiled packets of documents that included instructions for the method, and hid them away from their lab sites. If the lab was busted, the hidden packets insured they'd still have a written copy of the recipe somewhere, Dal Cason wrote.\n\nWhat does that have to do with the name? \"The top page of the synthesis 'packets' was a photocopy of a drawing from the cover of a video cassette case of the Third Reich propaganda film, 'Triumph des Willens,'\" Dal Cason wrote.\n\n\"Triumph of the Will,\" the English translation of the title, was commissioned by Hitler. The drawing Dal Cason referred to shows an eagle clutching a wreath containing a swastika.\n\nDal Cason wrote in 1997 that \"it is relatively easy to postulate how the seizure of these packets could present an opportunity to misinterpret a relationship between the most recognizable of NAZI symbols and the Li (or Na)/NH3 reduction procedure contained in the packets.\"\n\n\"From this point it is easy to imagine a 'word of mouth' genesis of the 'Nazi patent' myth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe documents and court records reviewed by the News-Leader do note materials seized in connection with the investigation of Paillet and his associates, but don't mention the German propaganda film. Dal Cason told the News-Leader he didn't recall the specific individuals who apparently hid the packets. The footnotes of his Microgram article reference cases filed in federal court in 1996, years after Paillet was arrested and the Nazi dope moniker was first used.\n\nTheory two:\n\nDal Cason also asked a colleague in the United Kingdom to search German patents. Those published from 1932 to 1945 were topped with the \"Imperial Eagle,\" a coat of arms depicting an eagle perched on wreath containing a swastika (similar, but not identical, to imagery on Triumph Des Willens).\n\nLeslie King, head of the Forensic Science Service's Drugs Intelligence Laboratory, wrote Dal Cason in October 1996, and said he failed to find a patent for the technique Paillet used.\n\nThere were, however, patents that were somewhat related. Dal Cason said the packets mentioned in his first theory contained not just a recipe for the Nazi method, but also instructions for another process using methcathinone.\n\nDal Cason said King found a German patent from 1936 which provided techniques for synthesizing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine using methcathinone.\n\n\"The chemical names 'Ephedrinen' and 'Pseudoephedrine' are easily recognized among the German wording of the patent,\" Dal Cason wrote. \"Misinterpretation of the patent's content, combined with a clandestine laboratory having chemicals appropriate for the Li(Na)/NH3 method, might easily lead to the assumption that this process was described in the patent.\"\n\nTo be clear, however, the patent wasn't describing the method Paillet used. And to Dal Cason's knowledge, no one ever found a copy of the German patent in connection with a lab bust — it's something for which Dal Cason had to search.\n\nThe audience for Microgram, where Dal Cason's article appeared, was largely limited to law enforcement. An editor's note attached to the piece read: \"If anyone has hard evidence that a 'NAZI' patent does exist, please contact the Microgram editor.\" Dal Cason never heard from anyone.\n\nPoplawski, for his part, offered a third theory.\n\nIn an interview, he said Paillet \"wasn't smart enough to invent\" the method, and that he must have gotten the recipe from someone else. Poplawski also said he never heard Paillet or any of his associates use the phrases 'Nazi method\" or \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“The first time we heard it the DEA threw it out there, and we had no idea what they were talking about,” he said.\n\nWhy does all this matter? Words stir emotion. Dan Viets — a defense attorney based in Columbia, Missouri — told the News-Leader that, by the late 1990s, prosecutors were brandishing the Nazi method moniker \"as a weapon\" in front of juries, taking advantage of the average person's extreme dislike of Nazis.\n\nViets considers the term \"obviously prejudicial,\" particularly given the the lack of an established connection between Paillet's method and actual Nazis.\n\n\"The cops liked to say that as many times as they could in a courtroom,\" he said.\n\nThe sentencing of Paillet and his associates didn't stop use of the Nazi method.\n\nInstead, the opposite occurred. The small-scale labs began to proliferate.\n\nAt first, most state and local officials, such as the average rural county sheriff's office, didn't have the training to safely deal with meth labs. Instead, they'd call the DEA. As the 1990s progressed, Cornille says he began feeling like a firefighter, rushing from small blaze to small blaze without time to investigate their causes. Instead of fires, of course, it was meth labs — although the explosions the labs sometimes prompted could end up blurring the distinction.\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol, contacted by the News-Leader this fall, could only find records regarding the number of meth lab incidents in the state annually dating back to 1996. That year, according to the patrol, there were 121 labs found.\n\nThat figure increased to 319 in 1997. Then 480 in 1998. Then 615 in 1999.\n\n\"Once everything got rolling, it spread like wildfire,\" said Nick Console, who led the DEA's Springfield office for about a decade starting in 1994.\n\n(A meth lab doesn't have to be operational when it is discovered to be counted in state or federal tallies of \"meth lab incidents.\" Those tallies generally also count situations when authorities seize materials used to make meth, or find sites where lab waste material has been discarded.)\n\nCornille said he recalls Paillet telling him that he taught five people his method for Nazi dope.\n\n“My initial thought was if we could get those five, we could make an impact,\" Cornille said. \"But it didn’t work. Maybe we didn’t get one or we didn’t get to them fast enough.”\n\nConsole said he spent the mid-to-late 1990s trying to warn DEA leadership in Washington D.C. that what was happening in southwest Missouri was a serious situation, one that could get worse if unchecked. He says the leaders didn't feel a sense of urgency.\n\n\"We’re trying to tell them — it’s not heroin, it’s not cocaine,\" Console said. \"It’s not a major organization, like a biker gang, that’s producing large amounts of methamphetamine. It’s Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith down here, and the Johnsons over here, making a half ounce. In their eyes, that wasn’t a problem. That was a local problem. It wasn’t a national problem.\"\n\nThe spread of the Nazi method meant that a drug once manufactured in large quantities by \"superlabs\" situated away from populated areas was now being produced on a small scale within towns and cities.\n\nConsole said he can tell stories all day about unusual busts.\n\nThere was the time agents executed a search warrant and noticed bullet holes in the ceiling of a bedroom. When they asked the home's resident why, the man said he knew the agents were monitoring him from his attic, so he shot at them while he laid in bed. The agents hadn't been to the house previously.\n\n“Think about being up without sleep for seven days,\" Console says. \"Think about it. Where would your mind be, where would your body be? So they’d become very paranoid.”\n\nThere was the man in Joplin whose lab exploded, the force of it enough to embed sodium metal in his skin. Sodium metal reacts when it comes in contact with water. When someone went to clean the man's body with a saline solution at the hospital, the sodium metal exploded — the \"pops\" sounding like a miniature fireworks display.\n\nThen there were the deformed chickens. Agents responded to a farm in Christian County where large tanks of anhydrous ammonia were buried in the barn. The stuff wasn't being used as fertilizer.\n\n\"He had chickens with double beaks, he had chickens that were a foot growing out of another foot,\" Console said. \"All the chemicals they were using — they were making meth there for a long time — were being dumped all over the area where the chickens were being raised.\n\nIn 1998, the man credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of methamphetamine production was contacted by a News-Leader reporter.\n\nBob Paillet had moved to Texas from southwest Missouri several years prior, not long after being sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute the drug. He was still on probation.\n\nIt appears to be Paillet's only published interview. He expressed regret to reporter Laura Bauer.\n\n\"I never thought it would spread like this,\" he said. \" ... I don't travel in those circles anymore.\"\n\nIn the years after his arrest, Paillet also wrote several letters to — and once spoke on the phone with — John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated him.\n\n\"I can remember him expressing remorse that he had started 'this mess,' as he referred to it,\" Cornille said.\n\nBy the turn of the new millennium, Nazi dope was no longer a Missouri-specific phenomenon.\n\nIn north Texas, the commander of an 11-county narcotics task force told a magazine in 2001 that the unit came across its first Nazi lab three years prior. By the following summer, the task force was busting one every week.\n\n\"It has exploded on the scene so quick, it's so easy to do, and there are so many people involved in manufacturing it, that it has completely overtaxed our capabilities,\" the commander said.\n\nIn Illinois, a state police representative said in November 2000 that meth labs were \"getting to the epidemic stage.\" He cited the fact that the state was on track to have 400 lab busts by the end of the year. Within four years, Illinois would be logging more than 1,500 labs annually.\n\nIn California, the Modesto Bee reported in 2000 that officials in the Central Valley had encountered eight labs using the Nazi method, and that \"five of them were traced to a man from Missouri who had moved into a trailer park near Fresno and was teaching this method.\"\n\nOfficials in numerous other communities around the country reported a version of the same thing.\n\nNick Console, the former head of Springfield's DEA office, said top agency officials did little to respond to the growth in small-scale labs in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, he said, that began to change, as politicians representing affected communities began putting pressure on the agency.\n\n“It took ‘em a good eight to 10 years,\" Console said. \"And the damage was already done, it’d already spread.”\n\nThe Nazi method didn't just spread cook to cook. Its rise coincided with the early days of the modern internet and anonymous forums like The Hive, where users traded information about illegal substances.\n\n\"There were a number of really good dope sites,\" said Terry Dal Cason, a retired DEA forensic chemist who investigated the origins of the Nazi method moniker.\n\nSince 2002, the DEA has published an annual report called the \"National Drug Threat Assessment,\" which details the prevalence of illegal drugs in the United States.\n\nEach year, the agency asks various state and local law enforcement agencies what they consider the \"greatest drug threat\" in their community. In 2003, 33.1 percent of agencies selected cocaine. Methamphetamine was second, with 31 percent.\n\nThe report stated that meth was widely available in the western and central United States and gradually becoming more available in the eastern United States. It concluded, however, that “despite the rising threat, methamphetamine is not likely to surpass the overall threat posed to the United States by powder cocaine and crack in the near term.”\n\nTwo years later, it did.\n\nThe 2005 report read: \"According to state and local law enforcement agencies, the threat associated with methamphetamine trafficking and abuse has increased sharply since 2002 and now exceeds that of any other drug.\"\n\nTo be clear, the Nazi method wasn't the only way meth consumed in America was produced. In its annual reports, the DEA largely focused on other sources.\n\nFirst, there was the foreign supply; meth was smuggled into the United States from Mexico and, to a much lesser extent, southeast Asia.\n\nThen there were the domestic \"superlabs\" — those capable of producing 10 pounds of meth in a single day. In 2001, federal authorities seized 303 of them, two-thirds of which were located in California. The California labs alone likely produced more meth than all other domestic laboratories combined, the DEA wrote.\n\nThere was regional variation, however. In 2002, the agency wrote that \"local independents account for as much as 80 percent of retail methamphetamine distribution in some areas of the country,” specifically the central United States. The Nazi method was a key process used, but there were also other recipes, like the \"Red-P\" method named for the required red phosphorous.\n\nThe DEA struggled to accurately detail the problem. In 2004, the agency wrote that meth use and distribution in the Midwest was \"very high\" in rural and suburban areas, but \"less so in metropolitan areas, where most drug consequence data are collected.\"\n\n\"Therefore, available drug consequence data for methamphetamine use in the Central States likely under-represents the problem, perhaps significantly,\" the agency wrote.\n\nSmall labs accounted for much of the drug's impact on communities, which was felt in burn units and mental health clinics, courtrooms and cemeteries. While the Nazi method simplified meth production, it didn't make it foolproof. The more labs, and the more cooks, the more opportunities for something to go wrong, and the greater the cost of cleanup.\n\nIn 2003, there were 361 reported fires and explosions at meth lab sites, and 255 law enforcement officers were injured responding, according to the DEA. The agency spent $16.3 million on laboratory cleanup that fiscal year, eight times more than it spent less than a decade earlier.\n\nThat same year, the DEA reported that 893 children were present when meth labs were seized. About two-thirds tested positive for toxic levels of chemicals in their bodies. The agency said \"child neglect and abuse are common within families whose parents or caregivers produce or use methamphetamine.\"\n\n“The devastation and the damage to kids … I understand why Bob had regret,\" Cornille said.\n\nNationwide, meth lab busts peaked in 2004, when there were nearly 24,000 seizures.\n\nAlmost 3,000 of them were in Missouri. Two years earlier, the number of meth lab busts in the state passed those in California — the birthplace of the methamphetamine industry — for the first time. Since then, Missouri has led the nation most years, never dropping below third in annual busts. In some parts of the country, the area code for southwest Missouri, 417, is said to be slang for meth, or a particular type.\n\nCornille and Console both acknowledge that if Paillet hadn't introduced the Nazi method, someone else might have done so a short time later. Just like any legal industry, there is a steady pace of innovation in the world of illegal drugs, typically in response to some government crackdown.\n\nTo combat meth in the early 2000s, laws were implemented requiring medications containing pseudoephedrine to be sold from behind the counter. In 2007, fewer than 7,000 meth labs were seized across the country.\n\nBut makers and users adjusted, developing what became known as \"one-pot\" or \"shake-and-bake\" meth production, in which just a couple of pseudoephedrine pills are mixed in a 2-liter soda bottle for smaller batches. The new method led to another spike — 15,000 national meth lab busts in 2010.\n\nConsole said he views these newer methods as just continued innovation. The Nazi method was the truly critical shift, he said — the one that turned meth consumers into producers.\n\nAfter they were sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth, those indicted alongside Paillet struggled to stay on the right side of the law.\n\nKenneth Allen, who was given three years probation, ended up behind bars after he repeatedly tested positive for meth; he was also arrested for driving with a revoked license and failing to support his dependents.\n\nMichael Poplawski, sentenced to nearly six years in prison, later completed community service for patronizing a prostitute in the early 2000s, according to online court records. He pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, with intent to distribute, in 2012.\n\nGary Davis, sentenced to five years in prison, briefly escaped in August 1994 from the Kansas facility where he was incarcerated. His sentence was later reduced for aiding in the prosecution of two others, but he ultimately ended up back behind bars. Davis is currently serving time in a federal penitentiary in Texas for, among other things, stealing explosive materials and conspiring to use them to rob a bank, according to a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nCourt records indicate that Paillet never violated parole. There is no evidence he got in trouble with the law during the rest of his life.\n\nPaillet found work after he moved to Texas in the mid-1990s. His youngest daughter said he was a CNC programmer, developing the programs that run automated machining equipment. His oldest daughter, however, said Paillet did sales and technical installations for a company.\n\nBy the end of the decade, health problems prompted him to go on disability, and he talked about having dystonia, a neurological disorder characterized by uncontrollable and sometimes painful muscle spasms.\n\nCourt records indicate Paillet divorced his third wife in 2008. He spent the final years of his life living with another woman in a trailer park in Sherman, a city of about 40,000 an hour north of Dallas.\n\nIn 2014, Stephanie Denton, 37, moved into the unit next to Paillet. Within a few months, she and Paillet — now in his early 70s — were drinking coffee together every morning.\n\nDenton was having issues in her relationship, and her son was having legal troubles; Paillet encouraged her to be more positive, she said. From what Denton could tell, her neighbor didn't really have close friends.\n\nPaillet didn't talk about his past very much, Denton said. She knew he was a Vietnam vet — Paillet talked about the war being pointless — and that he'd been involved with drugs to a degree. She said he claimed he'd sold drugs to raise money for a school for disabled kids.\n\nPaillet was more inclined to talk about the government, with a bent more paranoid than partisan. Denton said he repeated a well-known conspiracy theory that claims the Federal Emergency Management Agency plans to imprison citizens in camps after the imposition of martial law. Paillet's minimal online presence included posts about a group advocating for the secession of the state of Texas.\n\nPaillet also had an extensive rock collection and talked and posted online about searching for gold on a claim in Colorado. He appears to have become obsessed with the process, not unlike his days of manufacturing meth.\n\n“He first really started talking about gold mining after he was arrested,\" his oldest daughter Lisa Paillet said. \"One of the things that he was really very interested in doing was separating gold from rock, so not mining in the river, but using chemistry to remove gold from rock without requiring massive amounts of water.\"\n\nLisa said her father's health issues worsened during the final years of his life, and that he appeared to be struggling with dementia at times. In what would end up being her last conversation with her father, he talked about his will.\n\nBob Paillet didn't leave a suicide note.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of Jan. 1, 2016, the 72-year-old drove his red Dodge truck from the mobile home park where he lived in Sherman, Texas, to a nearby hospital. It was a little over a mile. Then, he took a gun — \"he had a lot of guns,\" said his daughter Gena — walked to the front of the vehicle, and shot himself in the head. He died minutes later in the emergency room.\n\nPaillet's family held a memorial service after his death. To the outside world, however, the only acknowledgement of his passing can be found on the website of a Denison, Texas, funeral home. It's not really an obituary, just a name and a pair of dates.\n\nThere's a guest book option on the site. One person — Paillet's second wife, Gena's mother — has left a message: \"We had a lot of happy years together. You will be missed. Your pain is over, ours now begins.\"\n\nOtherwise, there was nothing in the public record acknowledging that the man credited with reinventing methamphetamine production in the U.S. was dead. All in all, it probably turned out about how Paillet would have wanted it.\n\nIn 1998, he spoke briefly with a News-Leader reporter, the only time he was ever quoted in the media. At the time, meth lab busts were drastically increasing across the central United States. Authorities were blaming the phenomenon on the ease of the \"Nazi method,\" and said Paillet pioneered it while living in the Springfield area.\n\nIn that interview, Paillet expressed regret, as well as a wish regarding his future.\n\n\"I hope my name is forgotten or it's put in the back of people's minds,\" he said.\n\nPerhaps Paillet found some measure of peace. In an interview, Gena said that, while growing up, she was not allowed to talk or ask about the concept of a God around her father. In his later years, however, Bob Paillet softened on that view.\n\nIn 2008, he wrote on online message boards that \"I was an atheist, then agnostic, and now I believe that there is a God.\" He also said that he believed in evolution, and expressed a degree of incredulity that there are individuals who do not.\n\n\"He was still a scientific man, but he found his version of God,” Gena said.\n\nGena, 38, came of age in a world that her father helped create.\n\nGrowing up in Morrisville, she \"never really fit in,\" she said, and started drinking at an early age. When Gena and her mother moved to Springfield, she \"immediately just fell in with the wrong crowd.\" She graduated from Springfield's Parkview High School in 1996.\n\n\"A lot of people believe that addiction is genetic,\" Gena said. \"I am my father's daughter, not just in that way, but every way that there is.\"\n\nGena said she used meth for the first time at age 15. Two years later, she met Steven Joseph Brown, the man who would become her husband.\n\n\"He used needles, and he shot me up for the first time with heroin, and it was pretty much over from there,\" she said. \"It was always either that or meth. There was like a two-year period where I probably never slept. It’s been a struggle for me ever since.\"\n\nBrown — who died in February 2016 — was 16 years older than Gena. Prior to meeting her, he gave Gena's father precursor chemicals in exchange for meth, she said. At one point, he was even arrested by John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated Bob.\n\n“My husband kind of ended up learning my dad’s recipe,\" Gena said. \"Not anywhere near as good as my dad.”\n\nGena, who said she grew up fearing her father, first got in trouble for drugs when she was 17. She thought her father was going to kill her. Instead, she said, he \"became my best friend ever, because we understood each other.\"\n\n\"My mom — I love my mom — she’s never done a drug in her life,\" Gena said. \"She’s had maybe one speeding ticket, and I think she even got that dismissed. Really this connection grew between him and me that was just amazing. I could really do no wrong in his eyes.”\n\nGena said that between her late teens and late 2015, she was only \"clean\" for extended periods twice, when she became pregnant. \"But I always went pretty much right back.\"\n\nIn late December 2015, Gena said, she overdosed on heroin. Gena's mother, who she lived with at the time, kicked her out of her house. Gena called her father, who paid for a motel room for a week, and indicated she should come live with him in Texas.\n\n\"He said, 'I want you to go to your parole officer and start getting everything transferred down here and I want you to come back here,' and he said, 'I will get you through this,'\" Gena said.\n\nTwo days later, she got the call that her father was dead.\n\nGena said she traveled to Texas to attend her father's memorial service, but got in a dispute with the woman Bob was living with at the time of his death, and ended up leaving beforehand (Lisa Paillet described her half-sister as \"high as a kite\" at the time). Gena expressed regret that she didn't receive something her father wanted her to have — \"this metal container thing that his very first successful batch of stuff was made in.”\n\nIn August, Gena said she put herself through treatment after returning from Bob's memorial service. She said she had been clean since Jan. 25.\n\n\"It really hurts me that my dad never got to see me get my life together,\" she said.\n\nBy November, however, Gena was back in a three-week rehab program. She attributed the relapse to her depression, and said she \"wasn’t managing it with medication like I should have been.\" In early May, she said she had stayed clean since completing the program.\n\n\"It’s still hard a lot of days,\" Gena said. \"And it’s hard to stay away from the people that kind of want to push it on you.”\n\nLisa Paillet, who asked that her first name be changed for this story, graduated in 1991 from then-Southwest Missouri State University with a degree in theater — which she said her father \"paid for, I’m pretty sure, with drug money.\"\n\nShe returned to California, where she grew up, and gradually drifted away from theater-related work. When her father, then on probation in Texas, found a job that made machining equipment, he paid for her to go to school to get a machinist's certification. She was hired by a company she described as being in the military aerospace research sector, which paid for her to get a bachelor's degree in engineering.\n\n“That’s when our conversations about science really took off, and we would talk for long periods of time,” she said of her father.\n\nRegarding her sister, she said Gena's \"world is very, very different from mine.”\n\n“He and Gena had a very, very different relationship than he and I had ... I think he treated her far more like a child than he ever treated me,\" Lisa said. \"And because he didn’t really raise me, he didn’t have rules for me … I think even though I went down his road a little bit when I was very young, I think my upbringing with my mother definitely was not the same.”\n\nLisa said her father's decision to take his own life wasn't entirely unexpected. Suicide was something he mentioned casually over the years, she said.\n\n\"He knew he was going to commit suicide if he ever got too sick, and I knew it a long time ago,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob Paillet's parents died in the 1980s. They are buried in a cemetery in Exeter, Missouri, where they lived and where Bob spent his high school years.\n\nLisa said her father, who became obsessed with gold mining in the later years of his life, requested his ashes be scattered at his gold claim. However, she's has been unable to find it. When Lisa called Colorado, she was told he didn't have a claim in the state.\n\nThough Paillet appears to have avoided run-ins with the law late in life, the process he pioneered continued to occupy authorities.\n\nSome states responded to the rise in small-scale meth labs by requiring prescriptions for purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine.\n\nMissouri didn't, but over time dozens of communities within the state instituted their own prescription laws. City leaders in Springfield debated doing the same in 2013, but the effort wasn't without controversy.\n\nThat fall, Councilwoman Cindy Rushefsky — a former prosecutor who supported the measure — asked Springfield's police chief to provide monthly reports detailing meth lab activity in the city. She pitched it as a way for council to stay informed on the issue. Councilman Doug Burlison, a libertarian who opposed the prescription requirement, described it as \"an attempt to educate us to have different opinions.\"\n\nThen a funny thing happened. The police chief's monthly reports consistently described fewer and fewer meth labs being found in the city. In July 2014, the prescription bill was tabled indefinitely.\n\nThe situation wasn't unique to Springfield. The number of small meth labs seized in the United States has declined in recent years, from about 15,000 in 2010 to about 4,500 in 2016.\n\nIt's not that the drug has lost its presence in the United States. Last year, when state and local law enforcement agencies were asked to name the greatest drug threat in their area, heroin received the most votes. The agencies that selected it, however, were strongly concentrated in the Great Lakes and northeast regions of the United States. In the western part of the country, more agencies chose meth.\n\nMost of that meth is produced in Mexico and smuggled across the border.\n\nIn a 2016 report, the DEA attributed the decline in domestic labs to the wide availability of high-purity, high-potency meth from Mexico, as well as the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, a federal law enacted in 2006 which placed restrictions on the meth precursors ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.\n\nNick Console, who spent about a decade as the top DEA official in Springfield, said Paillet's Nazi method may have prompted the cartels to become more involved with production of meth.\n\n\"Why? Because you had a huge addiction problem here in the United States to methamphetamine,\" he said. \"Supply and demand.”\n\nConsole retired to a farm in Ash Grove. John Cornille, the DEA agent most involved with investigating Paillet, still works for the agency.\n\nMike Poplawski — who was taught the Nazi method by Paillet himself — has served his prison sentence. He understands how the statute of limitations works, double jeopardy and all that.\n\nAsk him about the early days of Nazi dope, however, and he chooses his words carefully. He's convinced that saying certain things could get the DEA interested in him again. He says he's been at the same job for 15 years, together with his wife for 25 years.\n\n\"I’ve got grandkids that love me, step-kids that love me, extended family that love me,\" he said. \"You look from the other side — the law enforcement side — I’m a bad man.”\n\nIn an interview in his Springfield home, Poplawski, 59, said the people he considers meth's Nazi dope generation are \"all in jail or dead,\" and that those currently involved with the drug aren't self-starters. He voiced frustration at seeing \"bangers shooting each other, shooting up neighborhoods, doing dope and falling asleep in their cars with the kids in the cars and s---- like that.\"\n\n\"I want to go around with a .22 starter pistol and start capping people,\" he said. \"I can still find the houses. They’re not the same houses. But a speeder can always recognize another speeder.\"\n\nAsked about his own actions, Poplawski said \"if I knew then what I knew now, I would’ve done things different.\"\n\n\"I like to think that I had the ability to make a change,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, he said, \"there's always going to be an addiction.\"\n\n\"The hole’s always there,\" Poplawski said. \"And once it got filled by meth, we had the meth crisis ... Now you’ve got [a] prescription drug crisis and you’ve got [a] heroin crisis hard. Meth’s bad. I don’t think heroin’s an improvement.\"\n\nReached at a federal prison in Texas, Gary Davis — the only other individual indicted alongside Paillet still living — declined to be interviewed without compensation. In a brief email, he did include one comment.\n\n\"Meth is a scourge on society,\" Davis wrote. \"I wish I would have never messed with it.\"\n\nPaillet expressed similar sentiments years before his death.\n\n\"I wish I never started it,\" he told a News-Leader reporter in 1998. \"I would never do it again.\"\n\n\"I caused a lot of trouble with a lot of people.\"\n\nHow we reported this story\n\nReporter Thomas Gounley began working on this story in the wake of Bob Paillet’s death in January 2016.\n\nThe events leading to the arrest of Paillet and his co-conspirators are detailed in federal court records. Additional information regarding Paillet was obtained from the Drug Enforcement Administration through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nInterviews with Paillet’s family members and one-time associates, along with current and retired law enforcement personnel, were conducted between August 2016 and May 2017. One of Paillet’s daughters, citing concerns regarding how this story could affect future job prospects, agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her first name be replaced with a pseudonym. Editors agreed to that request.\n\nThe photos of Bob Paillet in this story were provided by his daughters. Booking photos of those indicted alongside Paillet were obtained from the Greene County Archives and Records Center. Center staff said they did not have a booking photo of Paillet himself.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/vermont/2020/04/16/vermont-coronavirus-vt-covid-19-frontlines-pandemic/2979259001/", "title": "Coronavirus in Vermont: Frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic in VT", "text": "FREE PRESS STAFF\n\nThe coronavirus entered our daily vocabulary in early March with announcement of the first sick Vermonters.

Fay and his crew are serving breakfast and lunch to about 1,000 kids daily — 2,000 meals a day.\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\nCultural liaison supports English Learner students and their families during school closure\n\nFirst thing in the morning, any one of Noor Bulle's students can expect a call from him.\n\nOr more precisely, they can expect their parents to come barging into their room and hand them the phone so Bulle can remind them to get out of bed and ready for their virtual class sessions.\n\n\"When I call in the morning, they already know why I'm calling,\" Bulle joked.\n\nAs a multicultural liaison for the Burlington School District, Bulle supports students and families who speak Somali and Maay Maay, in which he is fluent, as they navigate the education system. Much of the job leans on Bulle's and other liaisons' established roles in their communities, serving as a \"cultural broker\" between the school and home.\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\n'What got me through it was knowing I was not alone': Winooski man has gone from three jobs to none\n\nTwo months ago, Sean Hood worked at Barrio Bakery in Burlington, ran the sound board at The Monkey House near his Winooski home and was preparing for a run of shows with his band, Eastern Mountain Time.\n\nThen COVID-19 and the resulting stay-at-home orders hit. All three part-time jobs disappeared. He said he’s relying on unemployment insurance he started receiving after \"two weeks of hell\" trying to reach the swamped state Department of Labor.\n\n“I had gotten to a point,” Hood said, “where I had next month’s rent and that was it.”\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\nHairstylist in Winooski 'blessed' by surge of support during coronavirus lock-down\n\nHow's it going at Wild Flower Studio, over in Winooski?\n\nHairstylist and owner Sunnie Palker's short answer: \"Tough times.\"\n\nGive her a minute or two, and Palker, who is 32, sings the praises of her clients and neighbors who have supported her through the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPalker went solo with her career of 14 years in August.\n\nShe closed the salon March 14, in accordance with statewide Stay Home, Stay Safe orders.\n\n\"I was thinking I'd be closed maybe a couple of weeks,\" said Palker on Monday. That scenario went south in a hurry.\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\n'This has changed everything': Bus driver strives to protect others\n\n\"I'm usually not a clean freak,\" says Farhan Ahmed, a bus driver and dispatcher for Green Mountain Transit. \"But now I am.\"\n\nOn a personal level, the new coronavirus doesn't perturb Ahmed, 28. He says his immune system is \"off the charts;\" he rarely gets sick.\n\n\"But this has changed everything,\" he explains at the GMT maintenance depot in Burlington between shifts last week, \"especially when you've got people who are depending on you.\"\n\nThat list includes his wife, his two sons, aged 3 and 1; his passengers; and his colleagues at work.\n\nSome of the older drivers have opted to take unpaid time off rather than become exposed to what could be a life-threatening illness, says Ahmed, who is also a union shop steward.\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\n'It's awful lonely' at iconic Burlington diner Handy's Lunch during COVID-19 service\n\nThe 25 stools around the U-shaped counter of Handy's Lunch have sat vacant for more than a month.\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nThe South End staple is still cranking out plates to go seven days a week — just without the kitchen-table camaraderie and conversation that helped make it a Burlington landmark. Some days, it's just Earl Handy in the kitchen and a radio to pierce the silence imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"That's the hard part, missing the back and forth, the conversations, being able to shoot the breeze with someone while they're eating breakfast or eating lunch,\" said Handy, 45, the third generation of his family to run the Maple Street eatery.\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\nHow one woman works to keep people experiencing domestic violence safe during coronavirus\n\nAna Burke's work revolves around helping Vermonters who are experiencing domestic violence. That process looks different for her during the new coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBurke has served as the interim executive director for Steps to End Domestic Violence, based in Burlington, since November.\n\nIn light of COVID-19, the administrative office is closed, in-person support groups are no longer available and new individuals aren't moving into the shelter. But people can still reach the organization through the hotline or an online chat platform.\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\nWilliston police officer's coronavirus scare drives home heightened risk during pandemic\n\nEarlier this month, Williston Police Officer Sarah Bell thought she had been exposed to the new coronavirus while on the job.\n\nShe immediately went home from work when she developed a fever, and her doctor soon gave her a referral to get tested for COVID-19.\n\nWhile she waited for those results to come back she and her significant other — also a police officer — lived at opposite ends of their small home. She said she sanitized everything she touched to prevent him from getting sick and spreading it to his department in Milton.\n\nBell, 27, also started mentally retracing her steps on the days and hours leading up to her suspected exposure. It was a \"nerve-wracking\" few days until she received her results showing she was negative.\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\n'I refuse to get the virus': Curbside can-collector in Burlington not worried\n\nLionel Persinger, 62, has noticed an uptick in hard-liquor consumption in Burlington during the coronavirus-related lockdown.\n\nPersinger should know: He collects curbside cans and bottles on recycling pickup days.\n\n\"I'd say liquor is up about 80 percent,\" he estimated on Wednesday while working a stretch of South Winooski Avenue. \"It's amazing. It's because people are staying at home.\"\n\nIn contrast, Persinger hasn't strayed much from routine these days, working alone, blue bin to blue bin.\n\nHe still works an eight-to-10 hour day. He still totes a jumbo-sized garbage bag.\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\nTattoo artist predicts slow customer return to Burlington studio in re-opening\n\nWhen the risk of coronavirus subsides and Burlington tattoo studio Onyx Ink finally re-opens, artist and owner Alisha Dykema will be raring to go.\n\nSo will fellow artists and employees Haley Zaleski and Nicole Christman, whom she had to lay off when the shop closed on March 17 as part of a statewide shutdown.\n\nThe trio is taking the off-time to develop new designs, to find new sources of inspiration.\n\nBut will tattoo-inclined folk flock back?\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\n'I can't go near my grandchildren.' Coronavirus isolates retired Brattleboro nurse\n\nTo her five-year-old granddaughter, Beth Kiendl is Minga. Her husband is Ebu.\n\nKiendl has no idea where the nonsensical names came from, other than her granddaughter Grace's fertile imagination, then a one-year-old girl who was talking early.\n\nKiendl's daughter, Kate, also has an 18-month-old son, Jake. Kate is a nurse like her mother was. Kiendl, 70, spent 43 years tending to the addicted, the suicidal and the mentally tortured at Brattleboro Retreat.\n\nNow the coronavirus pandemic has hit. Jake is oblivious, as 18-month-olds are. But Grace understands social distancing all too well. It means she can no longer hug and kiss Minga, who lives in Brattleboro, just 10 minutes down the road from her home in Dummerston.\n\n\"Grace and I are very tight,\" Kiendl said. \"That's been tough, tough, tough.\"\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\n'Heightened sense of the reality of mortality': Priest gives last rites to COVID patients\n\nThe Rev. Dallas St. Peter can’t be with Catholic parishioners during the COVID-19 lockdowns, with one exception:\n\nWhen they’re dying.\n\nThe pastor at St. Mark Parish in Burlington has administered last rites to about a dozen people diagnosed with COVID-19.

The Williston contractor and a couple of coworkers had cold symptoms.\n\nThat changed March 28.\n\n“I woke up Saturday morning,” he said, “and it was like I was hit by a train.”\n\nHe spoke with a friend on the phone and had to take a deep breath after every sentence. His next call was to his doctor, who recommended a COVID-19 test.\n\nHe spent that weekend on the couch, barely moving. “It felt like I had run a marathon just to get up and go to the bathroom,” said Townsend, 38.\n\nTest results March 30 showed he had COVID-19.\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\nSidelined by the coronavirus pandemic, sports broadcaster George Commo tries to stay busy\n\nGeorge Commo says put the blame on him for the coronavirus shutdown.\n\nOf course, the legendary Vermont sports broadcaster is kidding, but naturally, the Burlington native is superstitious.\n\nThe long-serving radio play-by-play man for Norwich men's hockey, Commo booked his hotel accommodations for the Division III Frozen Four in Buffalo before the top-ranked Cadets even finished the regular season.\n\nThen the COVID-19 pandemic hit Vermont and the nation, and sports everywhere came to a dramatic halt. That included Commo's main source of income.\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\n'I really don't want to lose it': Shelburne gym owner fights for his business amid outbreak\n\nJoey Besl picks up the padlock and turns his key.\n\nHe tugs at the stainless steel chain coiled around the door to his gym, Premier Strength & Performance, and pulls it loose.\n\n\"I’ve got a lot to lose here and I really don’t want to lose it,\" said the 33-year-old.\n\nBesl spent the last eight years methodically scaling up the business, adding clients, buying equipment. He worked three jobs — training athletes, tuning skis and bouncing at a bar — to get Premier off the ground.\n\nStatewide restrictions on fitness centers intended to combat the COVID-19 pandemic mean his life's work has, since March 23, been reduced to a very expensive private gym.\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\nFormer gubernatorial candidate Christine Hallquist shares story of battle against COVID-19\n\nChristine Hallquist received an order to hunker down in New York after she tested positive for the coronavirus in early April.\n\nHallquist, a gubernatorial candidate for Vermont in 2018, announced via Twitter that she received a positive test for COVID-19, the official name of the disease related to the coronavirus that first started to affect people at the end of 2019.\n\nHallquist made headlines a few years ago when she became the first transgender person in the United States to secure a major-party nomination for governor. She had traveled to New York to care for her 88-year-old mother, who she said has Alzheimer's and is dying of cancer.\n\n\"The irony is I actually caught it in her retirement community,\" she said.\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\n'We have to all come together': Essex Junction store owners donate masks to give back to community\n\nShannon and Tan Tran were brainstorming ways to give back to the community the same week they planned to close their jewelry store.\n\n\"What can we do as a small business owner to help out the community that has been supporting us,\" said Tan Tran, co-owner of Shannon's Fine Jewelry with his wife, Shannon.\n\nThey settled on using their connection to overseas manufacturers to purchase essential items such as hand sanitizer, gloves and masks.\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\n'If I could have avoided it, I would have': Vermont inmate on life in COVID-19 isolation\n\nLance Mason spends 24 hours per day locked in a cell by himself, and he has no idea when it's going to end.\n\nMason, 49, is one of more than two dozen inmates who tested positive for COVID-19. They were all moved from the St. Albans correctional facility to isolation cells in St. Johnsbury.\n\nTwo days after Mason was moved, he officially learned why. He says he had a hunch at that point.\n\nMason has been petitioning to get out of jail since before he was diagnosed. Normal mitigation measures, such as social distancing, are nearly impossible in the correctional facilities.\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\n'Not being able to see anyone and share the fun and joy of pregnancy...is so sad'\n\nFor Marikje Shelmandine this pregnancy hasn't been anything like her first.\n\nThe Jericho native has endured sleeping troubles, a much bigger baby, Braxton-Hicks (false labor) pains, and discomfort from the baby's position aggravating her hip dysplasia.\n\nAnd, her dad is not here.\n\nHer father, who passed nearly two years ago, was the \"biggest baby whisperer,\" according to Shelmandine. When her daughter was born 3 1/2 years ago, \"we had to ask him to leave because he wouldn't share the baby with anyone.\" To this day a picture of her father holding her newborn daughter adorns their walls — it is blown up poster size and is one of their favorites because \"the joy on his face is palpable.\"\n\n\"We not only don't have him, but we don't have anyone,\" Shelmandine said of how restrictions of social distancing in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic have changed the pregnancy experience.\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\nUVM student Willow Yager helps with patient overflow in first job as LNA during pandemic\n\nWillow Yager was a fixture on the field hockey, basketball and lacrosse teams at South Burlington High School. Playing sports, she said, helped form structure and create balance in her life.\n\nNow a sophomore at the University of Vermont, a determined Yager worked to become a licensed nursing assistant, through the Center for Technology in Essex, and received her certification this past fall.\n\nYager started a job in January at the University of Vermont Medical Center. She works on a general surgery and trauma floor. While it's not a designated unit for COVID-19 patients, Yager remains part of a dedicated group of health care workers who are on or near the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic on a daily basis.\n\nFor the full story, click here.\n\nPlease consider supporting local journalism by subscribing to the Free Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/2015/07/03/rest-summer-events-preview/29657775/", "title": "Rest of your summer events preview", "text": "Gregory J.

After an inauspicious start in Bahrain back in March, he has won race after race, comfortably seeing off an early challenge from Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc.\n\nSpeaking after Sunday’s race at Autodromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City, Mexico, Verstappen looked forward to more success.\n\n“An incredible result. It’s been an incredible year so far. We’re definitely enjoying it and we’ll try to go for more,” the Dutch driver said.\n\nSeven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton finished in second place, some 15 seconds behind the Dutchman, and Red Bull’s Sergio Perez came in third.\n\nMax Verstappen celebrates his 14th victory of the season.

Chris Graythen/Getty Images\n\nThe punishment amounts to a fine of $7 million, a 10% reduction in cost limits for RBR’s aerodynamic testing for next year, and responsibility for the costs incurred by the Cost Cap Administration, who were responsible for investigating the breach.\n\nIn the FIA statement, the Cost Cap Administration noted that RBR “acted cooperatively throughout the review process” and that “there is no accusation or evidence that RBR has sought at any time to act in bad faith.”\n\n“The more draconian part is the sporting penalty, which is a 10% reduction on our ability to utilise our wind tunnel and aerodynamic tools,” team boss Christian Horner said in a press conference, according to ESPN.\n\n“That represents anywhere between 0.25 seconds and 0.5 seconds of lap time. That comes in from now, it has a direct effect on next year’s car and it will be in place for a 12-month period.”\n\nTwo races remain on the F1 calendar for Verstappen to add to his record tally with the Brazilian Grand Prix scheduled on November 13 and the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on November 20.", "authors": ["Homero De La Fuente Issy Ronald", "Homero De La Fuente", "Issy Ronald"], "publish_date": "2022/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/motorsport/max-verstappen-win-record-red-bull-us-grand-prix-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Max Verstappen equals single-season win record at US Grand Prix ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMax Verstappen fought back after pit-stop drama to win the US Grand Prix on Sunday, handing Red Bull the constructors’ championship on an emotional weekend for the team.\n\nThe Dutchman’s victory came just one day after it was announced that owner and co-founder of Red Bull, Dietrich Mateschitz, had died aged 78.\n\nAs well as turning his energy drink into a market leader, the Austrian billionaire founded the racing team which has gone on to dominate the sport in recent years.\n\n“That one was for Dietrich,” Verstappen said after racing over the finish line in front.\n\nThe 25-year-old wrapped up the drivers’ title with relative ease in Japan two weeks ago, but was made to work for his win in Austin, Texas, which leveled the record for number of race wins in a season, a record he now shares with Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel with 13.\n\nVerstappen had started second on the grid behind Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz but raced ahead after a slow start from the Spaniard.\n\nThings only got worse for Sainz after he spun out after contact from George Russell on the first corner, eventually having to retire from the race altogether.\n\nNow in front, Verstappen looked in control but his lead disappeared altogether after a botched pit-stop during the 36th lap of the 56-lap race.\n\nThe stop lasted over 11 seconds with Red Bull mechanics scrambling for a replacement wheel gun after Verstappen’s front left tire was not tightened sufficiently.\n\n“Beautiful,” said Verstappen sarcastically, returning to the track in sixth and setting about regaining his position.\n\nThe world champion didn’t mess around and retook the lead with six laps to go as he used his car’s impressive handling and straight line speed to overtake familiar foe Lewis Hamilton.\n\nVerstappen poses with the Red Bull team to celebrate winning the constructors' championship.

Peter Fox/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images\n\n“I think the positive thing for Mercedes is that if you look at where they started at the beginning of the season and where they are now, they’ve made huge gains in terms of ultimate performance,” Barretto explains.\n\n“So, obviously, they’re still not on par with Red Bull and Ferrari, but they’ve shown that once they’ve got a problem and understand it, they can then cure it and make some gains and get lap time.”\n\nVerstappen vs. Hamilton\n\nThe emergence of Verstappen as a challenger – and then successor – to Hamilton’s crown has been without question one of the biggest contributing factors to the power shift at the top of the sport.\n\nWith both drivers being daring and ruthless and backed by teams with little love for each other, last season gave fans the kind of title race they had been craving since Rosberg edged Mercedes teammate Hamilton to the title in 2016.\n\nHaving only just turned 25, Verstappen’s peak is still likely ahead of him, while at 37 years of age it is reasonable to question – as has happened at times this season – whether Hamilton’s best years as a driver are behind him.\n\n“I don’t think that Lewis Hamilton’s got any worse, I think that he has been faced with a car that is so difficult to drive that he isn’t used to that,” Barretto says. “2013 was probably the last year in which he had a car that he couldn’t really compete at the front with.\n\n“He was also the driver who had the more dramatic, risky set ups at the start of the year as they were trying to understand what was wrong with the car.\n\n“I don’t think Lewis is any slower than he’s been. If he had the car to win, I think he would have been fighting for the world title this year.\n\n“There’s been enough races this year where we’ve seen him deliver the kind of qualifying laps or the race performance to suggest he’s still got it – it’s the car that’s been the biggest issue.\n\n“I do think he’s made mistakes this year, but mistakes happen when you’ve got a car that you’re having to hustle or you’re trying outdrive or get more lap time out than it’s capable of doing.”\n\nHamilton also seemed confident in the aftermath of the Japanese GP that Mercedes would be competitive once again next season.\n\n“I think for us, we know what the problems are with this car,” Hamilton told Sky Sports. “I believe that we as a team, we’ve not gone from being world champions to not being able to build a good car. I have no doubts we’ll build a better car next year.\n\n“Whether or not we rectify the issues from this year, we’ll find out when we get there.”\n\nGiven the complications teams face with making improvements since the cost cap came into effect in 2021, that may be easier said than done with an number of issues hampering the Mercedes car this season.\n\n“I think the problem for them is that the budget cap is going to limit the way you accelerate performance going from one year to the next,” Barretto says.\n\n“We’ve got relatively stable regulations from now until 2026 and we’ve also seen in history that actually, when you’re trying to play catch up, every gain you make is great, but it’s such a small amount of lap time each time you do that, that it could take months – if not years – to catch back up.\n\n“Red Bull are going to keep pushing ahead because they’ve got this concept at the moment where they feel like they haven’t got near to the very best of what they can do, but they’re on the right path and so for them, it’s not about trying to cure problems, it’s just about trying to understand the package more.\n\n“It’s going to be very difficult for Mercedes and, to an extent, Ferrari to catch Red Bull, at least in the interim, next year and in the next two years, but as the regulations mature and the ceiling gets closer, I think they will they will start to close the gap.”\n\nHamilton, who won his second title by the age of 29, is less than a year removed from the kind of form that saw him take the title race down to the final day, so it seems an improvement in the car rather than his driving ability will be the key factor in Mercedes returning to the top of F1 next season.\n\nHamilton says he is confident Mercedes will bounce back next season. Clive Mason/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images\n\nThe other contenders\n\nOf the other 18 drivers on the starting grid, less than a handful have the skill and the car to challenge Verstappen and ensure he doesn’t go on to create F1’s newest dynasty.\n\nGiven how well the Red Bull car has performed this season, Sergio Pérez no doubt has the machinery to challenge for the title, but the Mexican is yet to show the consistency necessary to win a championship, currently sitting more than 100 points behind teammate Verstappen.\n\nCharles Leclerc is widely considered the best young prospect in F1 besides Verstappen, racking up five wins and 22 podiums by the age of 24, but his Ferrari team has failed to consistently match either Red Bull or Mercedes for pace and reliability.\n\nThe Monegasque driver boasted a 34-point lead after the first three races of the season, but three DNFs and some patchy form saw his title aspirations gradually vanish.\n\nGeorge Russell, Hamilton’s Mercedes teammate, will likely be another name to watch out for at the top of the standings in the years to come, in particular if Mercedes can fix its struggling car, but the young Briton still has a long way to go to prove he can match Verstappen and Pérez in F1’s new generation of stars.\n\n“Mercedes, because of their run of form in recent years and their run of success, I think they are still well-placed because when they’ve got a car that is capable, everything else is so strong operationally, development rate, driver quality, they’ve got everything there,” Barretto says.\n\n“In the next couple of years, it’s probably Ferrari that have got the best chance of really pushing Red Bull and I say that because they’ve got that younger, more exciting future spec lineup and they’ve got a car that, if they can tighten things up strategically, learn how to get the best out of the package more efficiently, they do offer a greater threat.\n\n“But they are so unpredictable as a team, it’s so difficult to to put all your eggs in their basket year-on-year because you don’t really know what version of Ferrari you’re going to get that year, so I think it will be interesting.”", "authors": ["Matias Grez"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/28/motorsport/max-verstappen-belgian-gp-win-f1-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Max Verstappen comes from starting 14th to win Belgian Grand Prix ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMax Verstappen came from 14th position on the starting grid to win the Belgian Grand Prix on Sunday at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps.\n\nDespite being fastest in qualifying, the Red Bull driver started towards the back because of a grid penalty for using too many engine parts.\n\nHowever, Verstappen produced some excellent, attacking driving to weave his way through the pack, showing the speed and quality driving to win the race for the second year in a row.\n\nThe Dutch driver finished 17.8 seconds ahead of his Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez, with the Mexican driver comfortably finishing second ahead of Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz in third.\n\nThe win is Verstappen’s ninth grand prix victory of the season, meaning the reigning champion stretches his lead atop the Formula One driver’s championship to 92 points. Perez moved to second in the table, surpassing Charles Leclerc, who could only finish fifth.\n\nAfter the race, Verstappen praised the work of the whole Red Bull team, as well as looking ahead to his home race, the Dutch Grand Prix, which takes place next week.\n\n“It was a really hectic first lap, to stay out of trouble, but after the safety car, the car was on rails,” Verstappen explained.\n\n“After that, once we were in the lead, it was just about just managing everything.

From the seventh lap, he was already up to fifth.\n\nAnd after the first round of pit stops, Verstappen had the lead and looked comfortable from then on, barely having to fend off any challengers throughout.\n\n“Amazing Sunday guys, car was a rocket ship all weekend,” Verstappen said on his team radio having crossed the finish line.\n\nElsewhere, it was another afternoon of struggles for seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, who crashed out of the race during the first lap having collided with Fernando Alonso.\n\nHamilton collides with Fernando Alonso.

Clive Mason/Getty Images\n\nThe rain fell all afternoon in Suzuka, and spray streamed out the back of the cars when they started for the first time.\n\nOut front, Leclerc challenged Verstappen for pole into the first corner but the defending world champion held his line around the outside to remain in the lead.\n\nBehind them, Ferrari’s Sainz aquaplaned off the road, into the advertising boarding and out of the race, while Williams’ Alex Albon suffered a gearbox failure and was also forced to retire.\n\nAlpha Tauri’s Pierre Gasly picked up debris from Sainz’s crash recovery truck and pitted for a new front wing.\n\nCatching up with the field, he drove past a recovery truck on the track, evoking memories of Jules Bianchi who died after his car hit a recovery truck on this track eight years ago, and prompting anger from drivers and teams alike.\n\n“No respect for the Life of the driver no respect for Jules memory incredible (sic),” Bianchi’s father Philippe said on Instagram.\n\nGasly later received a 20-second penalty and two penalty points for speeding under red flag conditions.

Following his win in Mexico, Verstappen now has a better win percentage (70%) than Vettel had in 2013 (68%), said Guinness World Records. And if he wins the remaining two races of the season, in Brazil on 13 November and Abu Dhabi a week later, he will also beat Schumacher’s 72% win percentage.\n\nSpeaking after the race, Verstappen revealed that he was not interested in statistics. But he knows “enough about them to understand the magnitude of what he achieved” yesterday in Mexico, said Andrew Benson on BBC Sport.\n\n“It is just an incredible season for the team,” Verstappen told reporters. “I never thought I’d be able to win 14 races in a year. I was never really interested in stats. I just live in the moment.”\n\nAs well as beating Schumacher and Vettel’s race win total, he also now has the record for the most points in a season. Hamilton scored 413 points in 2019, but Verstappen now has 416. And with two grands prix still to come the 25-year-old could further extend his record totals.\n\n‘Unstoppable missile’\n\nAmid Verstappen’s “superiority” this year, it’s “easy to forget” the “disastrous” start to his title defence, said Lewis Larkam on Crash.net. Having retired twice in the opening three rounds of the season, due to Red Bull’s “early reliability issues”, Verstappen was 46 points behind in the championship standings. However, his response after the DNF in Australia was “phenomenal”, as he went on to win the following three races.\n\nDescribed as the “unstoppable missile of the year” by Jonathan McEvoy in the Daily Mail, Verstappen’s victory in Austin on 23 October also handed Red Bull the 2022 constructors’ championship. It was “a tonic” after a week in which the team suffered consid­erable controversy for breaching the sport’s cost-cap.

Charles Leclerc, who had held third off the line, closed in on the battling duo and threatened to turn the race into a brawl.\n\n\"They have a lot of top speed,\" Verstappen said, his voice suddenly agitated.\n\nAgain and again Sainz returned the Dutchman's volleys, perfectly placing his car to neutralize the threat. It wasn't until the Spaniard made a small lock-up into he first turn on lap 15 that Verstappen finally got his chance.\n\nVerstappen got the better line through the chicane to get a great exit and take Sainz side by side through Curva Grande. Sainz was later on the brakes into the Roggia chicane, but he'd been forced onto the outside line.\n\nNow Verstappen was perfectly placing his car.

Surrounding me were 11 mandirs, small shrines, each intricately carved by artisans from India, each containing a deity in colorful attire surrounded by gold decorations and offerings of food and flowers.\n\nThe floor was decorated with intricate, brightly colored designs called rangoli (rang is “color” in Hindi). Sweet-smelling incense, the chiming of bells and the taste of almonds offered to me by one of the four temple priests as part of puja (a worship ceremony) completed the sensory feast.\n\nI had come to the temple to learn about Diwali (“row of lights” in Sanskrit), the Hindu festival that celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. A national holiday in India, where it is the biggest festival of the year, Diwali is celebrated in October or November, its date based on the lunar calendar. This year it falls on Thursday, Oct. 19.\n\nGreeting me to teach me about the holiday were four local women, all former or current temple board members: temple president and founding member Susmita Acharya (who gave me a tour of the temple), Subhadra Parasu of Brookfield, Vasundhara Sekhar, and rangoli artist Shefali Vallecha of Pewaukee, all attired in beautiful saris for my benefit. We spent a delightful few hours talking, laughing and drinking tea.\n\nThe women all grew up in India where, they explained, schools and businesses close for Diwali, and much of the celebrating is done at home. Preparations begin weeks ahead, when houses are cleaned and often whitewashed, new clothes are purchased and floors and sidewalks are decorated with rangoli.\n\nLakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and good fortune, is central to the holiday, and ceremonies are performed in her honor. Many families set up special shrines to her, where food, flowers and other objects are offered to honor her and receive her blessings.\n\nThis happens here as well as in India. Vallecha, for example, places her art supplies in front of the deity. “Local business owners might put their account books there to ensure a successful year,” she added.\n\nLights and fireworks\n\nDiyas (small, clay oil lamps with wicks) are displayed both inside and outside homes to light the way for Lakshmi, so she can bring good fortune to each dwelling. In India, whole buildings and neighborhoods glitter with light.\n\nAt the temples, statues of gods are cleaned and adorned with new clothes, diyas and garlands of flowers, and given offerings of water and food. The foods must be vegetarian, contain no onion or garlic and be freshly prepared each day with special utensils by trained ritual cooks.\n\nPrayers are said at home and at temples, festive meals are eaten, and money and gifts are given. The day concludes with sparklers and fireworks.\n\nIn India, Acharya recalled, fireworks are “spectacles of light and color with very little sound.” She described them as “fountains of color” that were often homemade. Her uncle and cousin began making fireworks two to three weeks before the festivities, mixing ingredients to produce an array of colors. Contests were held to determine whose were best. All four of the women had fond memories of entire neighborhoods turning out for fireworks and sparklers.\n\nIn Milwaukee there is less time to prepare for Diwali, as schools and businesses remain open during the holiday.\n\nAnother difference: In India, different gods and goddesses might be worshipped in different parts of the country, and each might have his or her own temple. Here, there is one temple to which Hindus come from all over the metro area, so it contains shrines to many gods to accommodate everyone’s beliefs.\n\nWorshippers come and go as they wish, or they may attend scheduled ceremonies for specific gods.\n\nMuch of the celebration is held at the temple, including the pujas, a festive meal and an elaborate fireworks display. Diyas are lit at the temple, and in many homes tea lights and strings of electric lights are used to welcome Lakshmi. “Many Hindus leave the Diwali lights up through the (December) holiday season,” Parasu said.\n\nSweets rule the day\n\nAlthough multicourse vegetarian feasts are enjoyed with friends and family, when it comes to specific holiday foods, Diwali is all about mithai, or sweets.\n\nPopular mithai for the holiday include ball-shaped ladoos and fudge-like burfis, both of which come in a variety of flavors; crispy jalebis, which are reminiscent of funnel cakes dipped in syrup; kheer, or Indian rice pudding; and deep fried, syrup-soaked gulab jamuns, sometimes described as Indian doughnuts.\n\nVallecha confessed that she is often too full of sweets to consume the feast.\n\nBoth here and in India, some women gather to make sweets together, while others purchase sweets, which are widely available in shops, packed in elaborate boxes. According to Sekhar, “some Milwaukee-area Hindus buy their mithai from Chicago or order them from India.” Family and friends visit each other’s homes, where the sweets are served and exchanged.\n\nOne recent week, I joined a group at Parasu’s home in Brookfield for an afternoon of sweets-making and eating.\n\nThe women said that Indian sweets are not baked, but are fried or cooked on the stove and then formed into balls or patted into pans and cut into shapes. This is because, in the past, many homes in India had no ovens.\n\nNeither eggs nor leavening agents are used. Common ingredients include various types of milk (condensed, coconut, etc.), sweeteners, a variety of nuts, coconut, ghee (clarified butter) and flours such as chickpea and semolina. The flours are frequently browned/toasted in a pan before they’re added to other ingredients. Cardamom and saffron are popular flavorings.\n\nFor this gathering, the women brought recipes given to them by their mothers. Parasu made badam burfi, a burfi made with ground almonds. It’s soft, sweet, slightly chewy and redolent with cardamom. Her mom’s recipe called for milk, which has to be cooked and carefully stirred until it thickens, a time-consuming process. Parasu substituted heavy cream to shorten the stirring time.\n\nAfter sugar, saffron and ghee were added, and her mixture reached the desired consistency, she spread it into a pan to cool, then cut it into diamond shapes.\n\nRECIPE:Badam (Almond) Burfi\n\nSekhar’s recipe of choice was rava ladoo. Ladoo can be made with a variety of ingredients including coconut, dried fruit, nuts or sesame seeds. Rava ladoo is made with rava (also called soji or cream of wheat), which Sekhar toasted briefly in a pan. Sugar syrup provided sweetness, while ghee added richness.\n\nWhen all of the ingredients were combined, she shaped the cashew- and raisin-studded dough into sugary, buttery, crumbly balls with a hint of cardamom.\n\nRECIPE:Rava Ladoo\n\nVallecha’s mom’s recipe for coconut ladoo couldn’t be easier: It requires only two ingredients — coconut powder and sweetened condensed milk — and one bowl, resulting in sweet coconut confections that resemble mini-snowballs.\n\nRECIPE:Coconut Ladoo\n\nTo make kheer, Acharya brought milk to a boil, added soaked rice, sugar, nuts and raisins and cooked it to a creamy consistency. Cardamom and a pinch of saffron provided its distinctive flavor. A garnish of cashews and raisins and a sprinkle of pale green powdered pistachios completed this festive-looking, inviting dessert.\n\nRECIPE:Kheer\n\nWe ended the afternoon with an array of sweets accompanied by milky, lightly sweetened tea. It was interesting to learn that the word chai is the Hindi word for tea, and not the flavored beverage that we’ve come to expect in the U.S.\n\nSpecialty treats to buy\n\nFor those who find making their own sweets too daunting, a visit to Bombay Sweets may be in order. An enormous glass case at the full-service vegetarian restaurant and shop at 3401 S. 13th St. is filled with an impressive variety of sweets and snacks.\n\nJay Kumar, whose parents, Narinder and Babita Kumar, founded the establishment in 1999, said that demand for sweets is highest during Diwali and that several specialties are sold only for the holiday.\n\nA sweet called jamun acquires a whole new holiday persona with the addition of a cream filling. Burfis, which usually contain coconut, almonds or pistachios, flaunt chocolate, strawberry or tutti frutti, their special Diwali flavors.\n\nJay's favorite sweet, available year-round, is rasmalai, a sweet cheesecake-like ball soaked in thickened, cardamom-flavored milk and topped with almonds or pistachios.\n\nIf you go\n\nInterested in joining the Diwali festivities?\n\nThe holiday falls on Oct. 19. The Hindu Temple of Wisconsin in Pewaukee will celebrate Diwali both on that day and on Saturday, Oct. 21. The celebration will include 45-minute ceremonies called pujas starting at 5 p.m., festive lights (diyas), fireworks (at 8:30 p.m.) and a meal (starting at 6 p.m.). The event is free (there is a charge for the meal) and open to the public.\n\nFor more information, check the temple website, ourhtw.org, or call the temple at (262) 695-1200.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/coachella/2023/04/20/coachella-2023-weekend-2-live-updates-set-times-frank-ocean-traffic/70134404007/", "title": "Coachella Weekend 2 updates: Blink-182 saves the day; Christine ...", "text": "Weekend 2 of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival features most of the same artists as Weekend 1, of course.\n\nBut it's far from a carbon copy: Frank Ocean is out as Sunday headliner and he'll be replaced by Blink-182, who a week ago was the surprise guest act.\n\nYet, Blink-182 won't close out the festival Sunday — that honor will go to a newly added trio of DJs.

After the band's surprise guest performance in the Sahara tent last weekend, the pop-punk trio delivered another exceptional set as replacement headliners to round out Weekend 2.\n\nThe trio, featuring frontman and guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, was 10 minutes late and came out to the theme of \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" They arrived onstage amid an explosion of pyrotechnics before starting with “Family Reunion.”\n\nAlthough the set list was almost the same as Weekend 1, one of the major differences between that performance and Weekend 2 was the power of the Coachella Stage’s video production capabilities. The band was able to feature more colorful visuals, an impressive light show and more pyrotechnics on the bigger, open-air stage.\n\nRead reporter Brian Blueskye's full review here.\n\nChristine and the Queens puts on a full theatrical production\n\nI’d heard of Christine and the Queens before his Sunday evening set, but nothing I’d skimmed online prior could properly prepare me for the visceral experience of hearing the French singer-songwriter and his band live. Christine and the Queens is the stage name of Héloïse Adélaïde Letissier, aka Redcar, aka Chris (but we'll stick with Chris for this writing), a queer artist whose work explores gender and its fluidity. The beginning of his early Sunday evening set in the Mojave started with Chris wearing a pantsuit-esque black number with large white angel wings. After a dramatic and heartfelt opening, he then shed the wings to reveal a fitted red vest underneath - a symbolic move that foreshadowed the theatrical performance to come.\n\nIt's hard to fully describe what the next 40 minutes or so entailed, but the best I can describe it as a play of sorts. Chris never addressed the crowd directly - just like an actor typically wouldn't - but rather took breaks in between songs as a chance to recite what felt like pure poetry, including lines like \"To live my life as a man is to stand in the truth of information\" and \"There is something glorious inside your emotions. Don't deny.\"\n\nBut other than the beautiful words he was reciting, I was captivated by Chris' majestic voice and avant-garde dance moves. In a way I can only describe as perfectly French, Chris moved across the stage with a mix of ballet, modern and street dance techniques. One moment he seemed to embody the likes of Michael Jackson, and the next he was twirling like someone who MUST have had some basic ballet training as a child. All I can say is, I completely agree with the young woman next to me who, moments after Chris took a final bow, said \"Well ... I'm a fan now.\"\n\n― Niki Kottmann\n\nSurprise guest Steve Lacy joins Fousheé\n\nFor her second-to-last song Sunday at Coachella, Fousheé pulled a guy seemingly out of the crowd to join her on stage. Immediately the assembled crowd surged toward the front of the stage. It was Steve Lacy, who hopped up to sing his song “Sunshine” which he co-wrote with Fousheé.\n\nCell phones sprang to life as everyone tried to get a pic of Lacy, the singer, songwriter, producer and now, Grammy winner. Lacy’s album “Gemini Rights” won the 2023 Grammy for Best Progressive R&B Album.\n\nIt was a surprise for the Weekend 2 crowd as Lacy did not make an appearance during Weekend 1.\n\nIt was an exciting cap to a power-packed set by Fousheé who alternates between showing off those Mariah Carey-esque high notes and flat out scream-singing. With temperatures nearing 100 during her afternoon set, she quickly ditched her black trench coat, and she was frequently spraying the crowd with her water bottle, which she called the Fousheé Sprinkler system.\n\n― Shad Powers\n\nLos Fabulosos Cadillacs rock out in the heat\n\nLos Fabulosos Cadillacs brought their unique mix of ska, reggae, mambo, salsa, samba and rock to the Outdoor Theatre on the last day of Coachella 2023. This special combination of sounds helped the Argentine band get established in the 1980s and has cemented it as a legend in the music world ever since.\n\nDespite the lack of shade by the stage and rising temperatures, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs got people swaying their hips, pumping their fists and even moshing throughout their afternoon set.\n\nAmong the crowd, Paulina Mandujano stood out with her bright-red Fabulosos Cadillacs tee. The fan said she traveled from Mexico to see the group.\n\nTowards the end, the band played its iconic hit \"Matador,\" and I personally got to reminiscing about being a teen, thinking I was so cool for listening to these old-school rockers. Now I know I was.\n\n― Eliana Perez\n\nCrowd gets groovy at Sonora tent for Los Bitchos' set\n\nThe London-based band Los Bitchos hit the Sonora tent early Sunday, and the four-piece group performed a set that brought psychedelic vibes mixed with surf rock and cumbia. Most of their songs were instrumental and some had an occasional chant from the keyboard player.\n\nAs the crowd settled in, people began swaying side-to-side. The electrifying guitar and sporadic, energetic sounds from the drums soon caught on with audience as they proceeded to jump up and down.\n\nLos Bitchos' guitar player and bass player picked up a drum as well during the set, for a high tempo mirage of percussions. As the momentum carried, the crowd had a synchronous chant of their own: \"Hey, hey, hey,\" they yelled.\n\n― Kevin Caparoso\n\nMeet Sleaford Mods, the anti-Coachella band\n\nIn the mood for some music that calls out phonies, narcissists, and anyone obsessed with image? You would love Sleaford Mods. Reporter Brian Blueskye called the band's Sunday special guest-less set \"anti-Coachella,\" so if that's enough to intrigue you, read his full review.\n\n― Niki Kottmann\n\nArtistic mediums collide in \"The Messengers\"\n\nEach of Sri Lankan visual artist Kumkum Fernando's three figures that make up \"The Messengers\" are 65 to 80 feet tall, and are accompanied by a poem to supplement the visual work. Arts and entertainment reporter Brian Blueskye spoke with Fernando to gain some insight into his artistic process, and what figures they're inspired by that he observed at many Hindu temples across India as a child.\n\n― Niki Kottmann\n\nCalvin Harris goes sans guests\n\nEllie Goulding (not-so-shockingly) decided it wasn’t worth staying in the desert just to sing one song with DJ Calvin Harris this weekend to close out his Saturday night set. Unlike Weekend 1 when Goulding stepped out to sing their latest collab, “Miracle,” Harris went without any special guests (in a move that surely disappointed the fans hoping to see Dua Lipa, Florence Welch or even Rihanna, to name a few of his dozens of collaborators) and played right up until curfew Saturday night.\n\n― Niki Kottmann\n\nCalvin Harris starts late again\n\nCalvin Harris appears to pay no mind to the fine his past-1 a.m. set incurred for breaking curfew last weekend, or he just plans to shorten his set tonight after starting 25 minutes late. Only time will tell if his delay will cause a repeat issue for Goldenvoice ...\n\n― Niki Kottmann\n\nLabrinth brings out Sia, talks mental health; Zendaya joins the stage\n\nLabrinth served up several of his rhythmic scoring from the hit series \"Euphoria\" to a receptive crowd on Saturday.\n\nHe also shared the stage with Australian singer Sia and called her his \"bestie.\" He thanked her for helping him through depression when he was breaking into the music industry.\n\nSoon after, Labrinth brought \"Euphoria\" actress Zendaya out on stage to sing \"All For Us\" amid roars and cries from the crowd.\n\n― Eliana Perez\n\nRemi Wolf lays ground rules for her set\n\nCalifornia singer Remi Wolf wanted her Saturday audience in the Mojave tent to have a good time, but she had a few rules before they could groove with her.\n\nRule No. 1: If you knew the lyrics to her songs, you needed to scream the words as loudly as possible.\n\nRule No. 2: The crowd had to get their hips nice and loose so they could twerk to her songs.\n\nRule No. 3: Whatever substances (legal or not) festivalgoers were on, she wanted them to sink in so that they could have the best day of their lives.\n\nAfter getting everyone on board, the 27-year-old got everyone on their feet and singing along to her songs \"Disco Man,\" \"wyd,\" \"Liquor Store\" and \"Sexy Villain.\" Throughout her set — wearing a yellow beanie, flowy white tunic with a dog on it and jean shorts — she was strutting across the stage, owning every minute of her time in the Mojave tent, and the crowd was loving it back.\n\nThe loudest sing-along came when the former American Idol contestant sang her own version of Gotye's \"Somebody I Used to Know,\" with the audience overtaking her mic-up vocals at times.\n\n― Ema Sasic\n\nRosalía has some surprising guests\n\nSpanish singer Rosalía had perhaps the most surprising guests of Coachella so far when she hopped off stage and let two fans sing (one was actually screaming) into her mic. They offered very different versions of her song “La Noche de Anoche,” which normally features Bad Bunny.\n\nShe also invited Dominican rapper Tokischa to the Coachella Stage to sing \"Linda\" with her.\n\nRosalía was not immune to the desert heat, pointing it out before and after she doused her hair with a bottle of water.\n\n“And I’m wearing latex,” she added.\n\n― Eliana Perez\n\nSo THAT'S what The Linda Lindas sound like\n\nThere was a nice bit of redemption in the Sonora tent on Saturday for the Linda Lindas.\n\nLast week, their 40-minute set was almost entirely marred by microphone problems. I'm not sure there was a single song where everyone's mic was working properly. That's why it was nice to come back and see them again this weekend. And I'm happy to report it was a problem-free set, at least during the five songs I was able to see after the line to get in slowly cycled through.\n\nIt was gratifying to see the four-girl rock band from Los Angeles at maximum joy. The band members' ages range from 12 to 18, and watching them grind through last week's performance with smiles on their faces, while everything was failing around them, left me both heartbroken and impressed. They were true pros, but you just knew inside they were crestfallen.\n\nThis week, they could just focus on singing and jumping and laughing and rocking. They deserved that moment, they got it and they made good use of it, delighting a full Sonora tent with their energetic set.\n\nAnd now I know what they sound like. Bonus!\n\n― Shad Powers\n\nDestroy Boys rock the Sonora tent\n\nA Coachella rookie, I was strolling around to get the lay of the land when I heard what sounded like the Nirvana classic “Drain You” thumping from a tent in front of me. I had to check it out.\n\nThe band that took me back to high school and early ’90s alt-rock was Destroy Boys, a Sacramento garage-rock group whose founders weren’t even alive then.\n\nI still don’t know if they’d mixed a Nirvana cover into their set, because that track was over by the time I snaked through the line into the Sonora tent.\n\nBut the rest of their songs had just as much energy, full of crunching guitar and melodic angst, as you’d expect from a band started in the mid-2010s by teenagers.\n\nTo be honest, I could barely understand a word — and if you’re of a certain age, you remember your parents saying the same thing about Kurt Cobain. (Or, well, Mick Jagger.)\n\nBut that didn’t matter: Sometimes rock ’n’ roll is even better when you don’t know what they’re singing.\n\nThe rock-focused Sonora feels a bit like an indoor club within an outdoor festival, as The Desert Sun’s Brian Blueskye reported in a recent article.\n\nThe band pumped up the crowd, with guitarist Vi Mayugba taking the lead on one song and prefacing it with life advice: “No one can tell you who you are!”\n\nLead singer Alexia Roditis led into the closing song with what seemed like a meditation exercise but turned into primal scream therapy.\n\nTelling the crowd to take a deep breath in and slowly let it out, “Ahhh,” she grew louder with each repetition until the exhale became a scream: “AAAAAHHHHH!”\n\n— Eric Hartley\n\nFlo Milli brings all the swag\n\nThere was no lack of enthusiasm throughout Flo Milli’s Saturday afternoon set at the Sahara tent. The rapper entered the stage with purple hair and all the swagger. Her one-hour set was jam packed with hit songs “Roaring 20s” and “In The Party.”\n\nShe effortlessly went back to back on songs throughout her performance, hardly losing her breath in between verses. Her love for the festival was evident when she took out her phone after concluding one song, and the crowd yelled the profane opening line of “In The Party” as she recorded a video of them.\n\n― Kevin Caparoso\n\nBratty, who also played at Indio's Chella, brings it\n\nMexican singer-songwriter Bratty, another entry on the significant list of Latin artists at this year’s Coachella, had the Sonora tent swaying with her mellow garage pop jams Saturday afternoon. The 22-year-old from Culiacán, Sinaloa, who also played at the free mid-week concert called Chella in Indio, said on Twitter that this trip to California was her first ever to the United States.\n\nHer entire festival set was in Spanish, and she gave multiple shoutouts to her fans from Mexico in the crowd, but even the non-Spanish speakers in the crowd, myself included, were getting caught up in her vibe. To loosely describe her sound, I'd say she put me in mind of Lisa Loeb: poppy but powerful.\n\nShe used a red guitar on Saturday, which she revealed on social media was a special gift from Fender. The famous guitar manufacturer included Bratty in its \"Next Class of 2023.\" The guitar was sent to her with a note that read, in part, \"We couldn't be happier to be joining forces to amplify you and your music! As one of the few artists selected for Fender Next you'll have our support from gear to marketing collaborations as we work together to drive culture and guitar forward.\"\n\nBratty was extremely appreciative and later joked that she was mostly happy about it because the Fender guitar is lighter than hers and doesn't hurt her back.\n\n― Shad Powers\n\nSaturday kicks off with blazing temps, sparse crowd\n\nThe crowd for day two of Weekend 2 seemed to still be recovering from staying up for Bad Bunny the night before. The festival grounds looked less packed even around 2 p.m., and attendees said entry was speedier then.\n\nThe heat could also be a factor: Indio was a whole 3 degrees hotter Saturday afternoon, at 96, than on Friday. And temperatures are expected to reach 98 degrees on Sunday.\n\n― Eliana Perez\n\nA bunny, some gorillas and other icons take the stage\n\nPuerto Rican reggaetonero Bad Bunny made time ahead of his headlining act on Friday to join Gorillaz for Weekend 2. They performed their joint song \"Tormenta.\"\n\nGorillaz was also joined by rapper Yasiin Bey (formerly known as Mos Def) to sing their collab \"Sweepstakes,\" by South African musician Moonchild Sanelly to perform \"With Love to an Ex,\" and Beck for \"The Valley of The Pagans.\"\n\n― Eliana Perez, Niki Kottmann and Ema Sasic\n\nLadies and gentlemen ... H.E.R.\n\nThe Outdoor Theatre audience went wild Friday night when Haitian-Canadian DJ and music producer Kaytranada brought Grammy Award winning R&B singer H.E.R. to the stage. The pair sang their collaboration \"Intimidated\" for the packed crowd (and the equally excited press tent). A few songs later, the DJ brought out singer/actress Tinashe for another collab.\n\nTo round out his set, Kaytranada also brought out rapper (singer, songwriter, music producer and drummer) Anderson .Paak, who sported overalls, ski goggles and a black wig that created quite a buzz on Twitter.\n\n― Niki Kottmann\n\nThis year marks Jocelyn Leone’s first Coachella. Though the Atlanta, Georgia, native is no stranger to music festivals - Leone has been to Lollapalooza in Chicago and Rolling Loud in Miami - she said Coachella has exceeded her expectations. Leone came to Coachella with a nine-person group, but decided to take a seat in the grass while her group members split up to see different acts. She coordinated her seating location to be in between the Gobi tent and the Outdoor Theatre to be able to hear Yves Tumor (in the Gobi tent) as she waited for Kaytranada to perform at the Outdoor Theatre.\n\n― Kevin Caparoso\n\nBecky G remembers Selena\n\nEarly in her set, Becky G told her Weekend 2 audience she was changing things up from last week. This time, she shared the stage with Afrobeats singer Libianca for a rendition of \"People\" and got the crowd dancing with the following medley of Selena songs:\n\n\"Como La Flor\"\n\n\"La Carcacha\"\n\n\"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\"\n\n\"Baila Esta Cumbia\"\n\nBefore returning to her own hits, Becky G praised the deceased Mexican American singer for paving the way for other Latina artists, like herself. \"Representation is so important to me,\" Becky G said.\n\n― Eliana Perez\n\nLax security evident at the beer gardens\n\nThe lax security this weekend is noticeable at the beer garden close to the Coachella Stage. The area's grassy, open space that is blocked off by a fence is not fully occupied, while there are plenty of people walking around the grounds with drinks in hand — which is allowed at Stagecoach, but not this weekend.\n\nThe beer gardens — one of the few designated areas that allows alcohol during Coachella — is usually the place where people grab a drink and sit on the grass while enjoying a long-distance view of main stage. As of now, this spot is sparsely utilized except by those grabbing food from one of the stands inside.\n\n― Kevin Caparoso\n\nPusha T's set has technical difficulties\n\nPusha T’s set had some technical difficulties on Friday. The music started cracking and came to a pause while the rapper was mid-song. “I need an extra minute, these wires ain’t right” the rapper said to the crowd.The crowd was patient and cheered while they waited for him to begin again. The delay only took about 5 minutes and Pusha T was back.“We going to pick it up like this,” he said to introduce the song “Mercy.”\n\n― Kevin Caparoso\n\nMerch lines remain excessive ... is it worth it?\n\nI got to the merch line about 10 mins after the gates opened, which was at noon. At that point, people had filled all the lanes of the organized line. I decided it was a ‘now or never’ moment to take on this tedious task because the line would only get longer throughout the day. While in line, I noticed many people gave up on securing their precious Bad Bunny merch. The woman in front of me looked up and said aloud “I can’t do this” as she proceeded to exit the labyrinth of a line.\n\nThe desert dust was also relentless and claimed a couple victims as quite a few people in line sneezed and wiped their noses.It took me over 2 hours to get to the merch tables and buy the Blondie t-shirt I promised my father, along with a Coachella tote bag for myself.\n\n― Kevin Caparoso\n\nCoachella special guest: Jaden Smith jumps onstage ― late ― with ¿Téo?\n\nFans of Colombian-American singer ¿Téo? got a special treat early Friday afternoon when Jaden Smith, the musical son of the now-infamous Will Smith, jumped up as a special guest artist. We noticed, however, that Jaden almost didn't make it. Desert Sun photographer Jay Calderon just happened to snap a shot of the singer running to get to the stage, clearly late for his appearance. Have no fear, however, because he made it just in time to sing the pair's 2018 collaboration \"Uno Dos\" for the hyped crowd.\n\nMore:Coachella 2023: Jaden Smith appears during ¿Téo? and says he's 'proud' of the singer\n\n― Niki Kottmann\n\nFestivalgoers chill at the Heineken House\n\nFestivalgoers made their way to the Heineken House early Friday before artists started performing on the main Coachella stages. Once they get their 21 and older bands and scan their official wristbands to get inside , they can get down on the dance floor, lounge on swings or cabanas and, of course, enjoy some ice-cold Heineken.\n\n― Ema Sasic\n\nCoachella Weekend 2 gets started on time\n\nAfter making early birds wait more than a half hour for the worm last weekend, Coachella decided to open the gates at the scheduled time, noon, to kick off Weekend 2 today. Several people were already lined up by 11:40 a.m. at the blue path checkpoint, with some groups opting to rotate friends in and out so some could sit in the shade along the fence while others kept their spot.\n\n― Niki Kottmann\n\n5 must-see Coachella acts that blew us away Weekend 1\n\nSometimes finding a band or artist to fall in love with at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is a volume game. The more artists you see, the greater your chances of finding your new favorite, even if you have to wade through a few auditory disappointments.\n\nTeam Desert Sun was doing some of that work for you during Weekend 1. We scoured the grounds listening to new acts and long-time favorites, and have come up with a clunker-free list of the best thing we saw. Read about why we suggest Chromeo, The Chemical Brothers, Charli XCX, MUNA and Dominic Fike.\n\n― Shad Powers\n\nCoachella Weekend 2 set times are in: Blink-182, Skrillex will close out Sunday\n\nFestivalgoers anxiously await the set times release from Goldenvoice each year, each weekend.\n\nFor Weekend 2 of the 2023 edition, this announcement held special anticipation, as Sunday headliner Frank Ocean pulled out of the festival after Weekend 1 citing an ankle injury, and savvy fest-watchers expected to learn who the replacement would be when set times dropped.\n\nNot quite, but it didn't take much longer.\n\nAlthough organizers' official announcement listed the Sunday headliner as \"tba,\" the news soon broke in multiple media outlets that the closing slot would go to EDM star Skrillex, along with fellow DJs Fred Again and Four Tet. The festival later made the news official.\n\nThe set times also confirmed Blink-182 would come back for an encore to its surprise Weekend 1 set. And, confusingly to those not fluent in the language of Coachella, they're being billed as the headliner even though they're not the closing act.\n\nIt's yet to be seen how all this news will affect ticket sales and the resale market. In the meantime, read all about the Weekend 2 set time changes:\n\nMore:Coachella 2023: Weekend 2 set times are here, Blink-182 returns, Sunday headliner TBD\n\nThere’s actually a band called TBA. No, they're not Sunday’s mystery Coachella act\n\nGoldenvoice first announced a mysterious artist “tba” will take Sunday’s closing slot in place of Frank Ocean, who dropped out of Weekend 2.\n\nBefore the news about Skrillex, Fred Again and Four Tet broke, rumors were swirling about who that “to be announced” artist might be.\n\nFunny enough, there is a band called TBA with music on Spotify. Let’s just say the trio is not getting anywhere near the Coachella Stage. The hip hop, trap group has 727 monthly listeners around the world, and after tolerating 1 minute of their top song “Loony Toony,” I can assure you that I will not be the 728th.\n\n― Jonathan Horwitz\n\nFor those with FOMO, you can still book your Coachella 2023 trip\n\nDid watching your social media feeds fill up with images from Coachella Weekend 1 have you second-guessing your decision to forgo the festival this year? It's not too late. Desert Sun arts and entertainment reporter Brian Blueskye checked around, and not only can you still buy GA and VIP passes for Weekend 2 directly from Goldenvoice, there are PLENTY of hotel rooms still available for Friday-Monday stays in the Coachella Valley.

But the festival continues to be plagued by some irritating problems: Sound glitches and trash. So. Much. Trash. And crowds. Will Weekend 2 be different? Well, on the crowd front, passes are still available so festivalgoers might find they have a bit more elbow room.

Well, a daydream for some is a (expensive) reality for others. Desert Sun environment reporter Erin Rode has the scoop on the private jet and helicopter services that ferry the 1% to the festival.

Others include DeLand, Hallandale Beach, Palatka and Tarpon Springs, with documentation posted online.\n\nAnnual Mayfaire by-the-LakeHarrison grad's futuristic swan chosen as poster art for Mayfaire festival in Lakeland\n\nPublic commentsLake Wales City Commission leaves rules for meetings mostly unchanged\n\nRelated to algae bloomsHealth alert still in effect for Scott Lake as water sample finds trace level of toxins\n\nLakeland City Manager Shawn Sherrouse said the city regularly receives requests for \"celebratory\" proclamations. These requests are submitted via written letters, emails, phone calls and even sometimes submitted to the city's Communications Department. The requests can cover everything from milestone birthdays to wedding anniversaries and business recognitions.\n\n\"It's the mayor's prerogative,\" he said. \"He can sign off on proclamations in some instances and it won't include the entire commission.\"\n\nMayor Bill Mutz can sign off on these celebratory proclamations independently, while larger public proclamations presented by the full commission are reviewed by all. He signed a proclamation recognizing \"Kailasa\" on December 13, 2021.\n\nMutz was out of the country on Friday and could not immediately be reached for comment by The Ledger.\n\nBartow Mayor Steve Githens said the city has a similar process for proclamations where residents and organizations can request one for special events. Recently, Bartow has honored SYFY Bartow and the American Red Cross for its help in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian.\n\nGithens said he remembers the request coming in from Kailasa.\n\n\"It was the strangest thing,\" he said. \"I remember showing it around.\"\n\nGithens said there isn't any specific review process used, that requests are usually fulfilled in recognition of the individual or group, and should not be misconstrued as a sign of support.\n\n\"We try to be good citizens, good neighbors when someone reaches out to use for recognition,\" he said. \"It was a courtesy.\"\n\nThe proclamation was likely voted on as part of Bartow commission's consent agenda, Githens said, as the organization wasn't local and there was no expectation of someone picking it up. More personal proclamations are usually printed, signed and mailed out.\n\nSherrouse said Lakeland received numerous requests asking for further recognition of Kailasa and an offer for a \"sister city\" arrangement that were not acted on. The city manager said the process of becoming sister cities undergoes more strict review than a proclamation.\n\n\"When you start getting multiple requests from the same entity but also requests for a sister city type arrangement, there is more research done and we won’t go far without getting the entire commission involved,\" Sherrouse said.\n\nLakeland does have five sister cities, starting with Richmond Hill, Canada, in 1990. It often accepts international students from its sister city of Imbari, Japan.\n\nBartow does not have any sister cities, Githens said, and to his knowledge did not receive any request to establish such a relationship with Kailasa.\n\n\"You can rest assured I'll be looking closer at requests that come across my desk in the future,\" he said.\n\nSara-Megan Walsh can be reached at swalsh@theledger.com or 863-802-7545.

But 75 years since the end of the British Raj, many Indian commentators gleefully pointed out how times have changed.\n\n“Indian son rises over the empire. History comes full circle in Britain,” an NDTV headline said.\n\n“From Age of Empire to Rishi Raj as Sunak moves into No 10,” thundered The Times Of India.\n\n“India was [once] under the governance of Britain. Now, an Indian-origin man has become the Prime Minister of England,” a Zee News anchor said.\n\nOthers were more blunt about what they saw as the symbolism behind Sunak’s appointment, news of which emerged on Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.\n\n“Another Diwali gift to the country. Indian-origin Rishi to rule the whites,” said India’s largest Hindi-language newspaper, Dainik Bhaskar, which has a circulation of nearly 5 million.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak makes a statement outside No. 10 Downing Street after taking office on Tuesday, October 25.

Aaron Chown/AP In pictures: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Prev Next\n\nTrading places\n\nTo some, Sunak’s appointment is just the latest in a series of events to highlight the contrasting fortunes of a rising India and the recent economic woes of Britain, its former colonial ruler.\n\nIn the wake of Britain’s exit from the European Union, London has repeatedly looked to its former colony for a boost; wooing it in search of a free-trade deal and granting more visas to Indian nationals than any other country.\n\nAnd now, just weeks after the United Kingdom ceded to India its title of the world’s fifth largest economy, it is former finance minister Sunak that London is turning to in the hope of repairing the economic carnage wrought by the policies of his short-lived predecessor, Liz Truss, which roiled markets and crashed the pound.\n\nGiven Britain’s actions during the colonial period – when Indians were excluded from top jobs in their own country and barred from many institutions – it’s perhaps not surprising that there might be a sense of Schadenfreude.\n\nBut experts say it would be wrong to suggest this is the only emotion in India. Many in the nation of 1.3 billion see the moment as a reason to celebrate progress in both countries, and hope Sunak can act as a bridge between India and Britain by ushering in a new era of ties.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested as much in a tweet welcoming Sunak’s appointment.\n\n“Special Diwali wishes to the ‘living bridge’ of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership,” the Indian leader tweeted Monday.\n\nOthers see Sunak’s triumph as reflective of a growing role in British politics for people of South Asian descent.\n\n“For a long time, the question was asked whether Britain was ready for Sunak to be Prime Minister,” said Harsh V. Pant, vice president of studies and foreign policy at the New Delhi-based think thank Observer Research Foundation.\n\n“And the fact that he is indeed now, is an enormous tribute to British democracy and to the role the South Asian diaspora has played in British politics.”\n\nMoving relations forward\n\nThe relationship between Britain and India is complicated, given the history of inequality and exploitation during the colonial era.\n\n“Some people are still perplexed about why Rishi Sunak’s race matters. It matters because of the imperial context,” tweeted Sathnam Sanghera, author of “Empireland: How Imperialism Has Shaped Modern Britain”.\n\nMany Indians have not forgotten the chaos that followed the country’s independence in 1947 and its subsequent bloody partition during which between 500,000 and 2 million people were killed and an estimated 15 million uprooted.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Who is Britain's next prime minister? 03:02 - Source: CNN\n\nPant said that until relatively recently it would have been “unimaginable” for a person of Indian origin to rule Britain, but Sunak’s appointment was the latest piece of evidence that the relationship today is “much more about the 21st century than about the past. And that has allowed both to take it forward in a much more productive manner.”\n\nEconomic considerations are at the heart of this more modern relationship, with London looking increasingly to India and its $3 trillion economy for opportunities in the post-Brexit era.\n\nBritain remains one of the largest investors in India with British companies employing close to 800,000 people in the country, according to a 2017 report, and politicians in both countries hope economic ties will grow under Sunak.\n\nAmong the biggest prizes on offer is a highly anticipated free-trade agreement, aimed at more than tripling bilateral trade, from $31 billion to $100 billion by 2030.\n\nWhen then-British prime minister Boris Johnson visited India in April, the two leaders agreed to sign that deal by Diwali. That deadline has been missed but there is renewed hope an agreement can be resurrected under Sunak.\n\n“Whether Sunak will sign the deal will be an important marker,” Pant said. “And it is an important benchmark for how far India-UK relations are willing to go.”\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak lights a candle for Diwali in Downing Street on November 12, 2020 in London. Leon Neal/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nWhat it means for Indians in India, and in the UK\n\nWhile Sunak’s face has been plastered across newspapers and televisions in India, the mood on the ground has been harder to judge. The streets of Delhi have been quiet as Indians celebrated Diwali – the most important holiday on the calendar for Hindus, who make up about 80% of the country’s population.\n\n“It is good to see someone whose family is originally from India take the top job and that too on Diwali, which is like a blessing,” said Rajesh, a chemist in the Indian capital. “But it doesn’t mean that things between India and the UK will automatically improve.”\n\nFor some, his appointment is little more than a foreign news story.\n\nA shopkeeper, Arjun, said Sunak’s appointment “didn’t make a difference” to Indians. “Yes, he is Indian but he is still from there,” he said.\n\nOthers say the significance of Sunak’s appointment is that it underlines the success of the Indian diaspora, particularly in the UK, where about 7% of the population is of South Asian origin, according to a 2011 census.\n\nBritain’s Home Secretary Suella Braverman also has Indian roots, while London mayor Sadiq Khan was born to a working-class Pakistani family.\n\nSunak’s parents came to Britain from East Africa in the 1960s. His father was a doctor while his mother ran a pharmacy in southern England – something Sunak says gave him his desire to serve the public.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback The uphill economic battle facing new UK PM Rishi Sunak: Analysts weigh in 15:55 - Source: CNN\n\n“British Indian is what I tick on the census, we have a category for it. I am thoroughly British, this is my home and my country, but my religious and cultural heritage is Indian, my wife is Indian. I am open about being a Hindu,” Sunak said in an interview with Business Standard in 2015.\n\nWhen he took his parliamentary oath in 2019, Sunak clutched the Bhagavad Gita, the Hindu holy book. He made history a year later when he lit Diwali candles outside 11 Downing Street, the official residence of the UK chancellor.\n\nNow he is at the pinnacle of power – and that, analysts say, is the epitome of the diaspora’s success.\n\nPant, from the Observer Research Foundation, said Sunak’s appointment symbolizes how people of South Asian descent have “cut across political parties in the UK,” adding Sunak “will shape the political trajectory” of Britain.\n\n“I think there is a certain comfort level that people of the Indian diaspora have in these democracies,” Pant said. “And that is reflective of the largest success of India globally.”", "authors": ["Rhea Mogul"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/world/gallery/photos-this-week-october-20-october-27/index.html", "title": "Photos this week: October 20-27, 2022 | CNN", "text": "Rishi Sunak became the United Kingdom's latest prime minister this week, replacing Liz Truss — the country's shortest-serving leader of all time.\n\nSunak is the first Hindu and the first person of color to lead the UK.

Over 300 people were registered and more were expected as the three-hour event continued into the afternoon. Some came from as far away as Staten Island to get in on the fun.\n\nOnce the DJ started spinning the Bhangra music it didn’t take long for the colorful powder packets to get ripped open and flung around. The field behind Ridge Elementary School was quickly awash in red, yellow and blue powder. Event-goers applied it to their faces and tossed the light powder at anyone who came within reach. No one was safe.\n\n\"This is such a happy occasion,\" said Jennie Wilson, a member of the Ridgewood Board of Education who attended.\n\nRidgewood Mayor Susan Knudsen was also there having fun, and she quickly managed to get covered in different colors.\n\n\"We have fun,\" Knudsen said. \"We love it.

However, now it is widely celebrated across India by people of various religions.\n\nGandhi said the event is also known as the Festival of Colors and is normally celebrated in late February or March in India.

They used a spread sheet and watched more than 100 trailers to make sure they would see the best possible films every day.\n\nSCIENTIFIC METHOD: Snowbirds investigate film lineup\n\nGoing into this final weekend, one of the super fans was still too busy watching films to identify her favorite movies. Another’s comment about the festival was, “I thought PSIFF is supposed to show only films that are not yet in wide release, right? I saw ‘Elle’ in D.C. two weeks ago.”\n\nJust for the record, the festival often shows films in distribution when it can combine a screening with a personal appearance that can expand the public's appreciation of a film, as Isabelle Huppert obviously was capable of doing at the screening of “Elle” on Friday night.\n\nTwo other super fans had a favorite film that also was a favorite of mine. “I Am Not Your Negro,” by Raoul Peck, is one of 15 films that made the Shortlist for Best Documentary Oscar nominations, and it was singled out by Artistic Director Michael Lerman as a doc to watch more than a month before the festival started.\n\nSTAFF PICK: Docs the staff suggested watching\n\n“‘I Am Not Your Negro’ is a riveting documentary exposé of race relations and how white America marginalized and mistreated its black citizens, from slavery to the recent police shootings of black men,” wrote Joel Greene of Olympia, Washington. “The story is told through the words of James Baldwin, both archival television footage and the initial writings from a book proposal he made to profile three slain civil rights leaders: Medgar Evers, Malcom X, and Martin Luther King Jr. The documentary makes a compelling plea for white Americans to understand their role in cementing American racism and to work to change the future of black white relations.”\n\nGreene also selected “Sparrows” and “Frantz” as his festival favorites.\n\n“‘Sparrows’ tells a compelling story about a teenage boy trying to grow up and make sense of an adult world filled with alcohol, sex and drugs in a desolate rural village in Iceland,” he said. “‘Franz’ is a post-World War I story about a young German widow who meets a young, psychologically tortured French soldier involved with the death of her true love, a young German soldier. The film, mostly (but not all) filmed in black-and-white, has numerous unanticipated twists and turns. Beautifully filmed, and even more beautifully acted, you care about the characters and grieve and mourn with them as the story unpredictability unfolds.”\n\nBob Guldin, a retired editor from Takoma Park, Maryland, also selected “I Am Not Your Negro” as one of his three favorite festival films.\n\n“Excellent portrait of James Baldwin,” he said. “I didn't realize he was so eloquent. Plus, the subject matter on race in America is still spot on.”\n\nHis other favorites were “The Distinguished Citizen” (“Great commentary on fame, memory, world-weariness and you can’t go back home-ness”) and “Clash” (“Very insightful, personal look at clash of cultures, religion in the Arab and Muslim worlds”).\n\nAcademy voting for Oscar nominations ended Friday and the announcements will be made Jan. 24.\n\nScouting report\n\nI’ve only had time to interview one industry pro-scouting the festival for product so far, and her report isn’t positive. The Newport Beach Film Festival usually finds several films at Palm Springs for its event in April, but not this year, said Festival Director Riki Kucheck.\n\n“Anything you had, I had already locked down, that I’m using anyway,” she said, “and that was weird because normally there’s something I had missed that you guys have and I can come away with a couple that I’ll grab. This year, not. There was nothing. To be honest, I almost felt it was a waste of my time and money to have come down there this year.”\n\nFestival programmers like Kucheck have to pay for an industry pass, which is $250. Then, of course, they must pay for accommodations.\n\nKucheck said there were films she wanted to see toward the end of this week, but she wasn’t able to attend their screenings because she was only in Palm Springs for “the first four or five days.” She’s planning to attend the Sundance Film Festival beginning next week.\n\nOther reports\n\nThe programmers and filmmakers were thrilled with the many sold-out screenings over the past 10 days.\n\nN. Padmakumar of India said his film, “A Billion Colour Story,” sold out screenings on Friday and Saturday. He got the same reaction from ticket buyers at the Busan International Film Festival in South Korea and the BFI London Film Festival, which he said, “is amazing.”\n\nHe just finished the film in September and said he hasn’t even begun attending to the business end of getting it distributed. The film, which contains a message about the value of diversity in India, is about a Muslim-Hindu married couple and their idealistic 10-year-old son.\n\n“I never really intended to make a statement in any artistic form,” said Padmakumar, who calls himself a poet first and foremost. “It was just a story I wanted to tell and it really is about communal disharmony, especially in the age we live in: prejudices, divisions – India is full of all those. So I wanted to make a film about that and I wanted people to get in touch with the better side of themselves.\n\n\"The film really is about the poetry of India, which I define as the fact that people of so many different cultures and backgrounds and religions and communities can actually live together and find a common way of living. So the film is, in a sense, a lament that that poetry is fading away.”\n\nHe notes that India has a polarized partisan government, “not unlike the one that is coming to power in America.”\n\nWith similar governments coming to power in England, Italy and around the globe, this film may be ripe for distribution.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/14/india/india-independence-day-75-years-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "title": "India Independence Day 2022: Modi pledges to turn India into a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nStanding in front of the historic Red Fort in Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday pledged to transform India into a developed country in the next 25 years.\n\n“The way the world is seeing India is changing. There is hope from India and the reason is the skills of 1.3 billion Indians,” Modi said. “The diversity of India is our strength. Being the mother of democracy gives India the inherent power to scale new heights.”\n\nModi’s words came as millions celebrated 75 years of Indian independence since the stroke of midnight on August 15, 1947 that ended nearly 200 years of British colonial rule.\n\nAt the time, India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru said the country was on a path of revival and renaissance.\n\n“A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new,” Nehru said. “When an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.”\n\nSeventy-five years later, the India of today is almost unrecognizable from that of Nehru’s time.\n\nSince gaining independence, India has built one of the world’s fastest growing economies, is home to some of the world’s richest people, and according to the United Nations, its population will soon surpass China’s as the world’s largest.\n\nBut despite the nation’s surging wealth, poverty remains a daily reality for millions of Indians and significant challenges remain for a diverse and growing nation of disparate regions, languages, and faiths.\n\nWomen in traditional attire participate in a rally to mark the 75th anniversay of India's Independence Day in Mumbai, India, on August 14, 2022.

The country’s GDP was $20 billion, according to scholars.\n\nFast forward three-quarters of a century and India’s nearly $3 trillion economy is now the world’s fifth largest and among its fastest growing.

And the Indian diaspora has spread far and wide, studying at international universities and occupying senior roles in some of the world’s biggest tech companies, including Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Twitter boss Parag Agrawal.\n\nMuch of this transformation was prompted by the “pathbreaking reforms” of the 1990s, when then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao and his Finance Minister Manmohan Singh opened the country to foreign investment after an acute debt crisis and soaring inflation forced a rethink of socialist Nehru’s model of protectionism and state intervention.\n\nThe reforms helped turbocharge investment from American, Japanese and Southeast Asian firms in major cities including Mumbai, the financial capital, Chennai and Hyderabad.\n\nThe result is that today, the southern city of Bengaluru – dubbed “India’s Silicon Valley” – is one of the region’s biggest tech hubs.\n\nAt the same time, India has seen a proliferation of billionaires – it is now home to more than 100, up from just nine at the turn of the millennium. Among them are infrastructure tycoon Gautam Adani, whose net worth is more than $130 billion, according to Forbes, and Mukesh Ambani, founder of Reliance Industries, who’s worth about $95 billion.\n\nBut critics say the rise of such ultra-wealth highlights how inequality remains even long after the end of colonialism – with the country’s richest 10% controlling 80% of the nation’s wealth in 2017, according to Oxfam. On the streets, that translates into a harsh reality, where slums line pavements beneath high-rise buildings and children dressed in tattered clothes routinely beg for money.\n\nBut Rohan Venkat, a consultant with Indian think tank Centre for Policy Research, says India’s broader economic gains as an independent nation shows how it has confounded the skeptics of 75 years ago.\n\nSlums line the shore near the up-market neighborhood of Cuffe Parade, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. Education Images/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\n“In a broad sense, the image of India (post independence) was that it was an exceedingly poor place,” said Venkat.\n\n“Certainly the image of India (to the West) was heavily overlaid by Orientalist tropes – your snake charmers, little villages. Some of these were not entirely off the mark … but a lot of it was simple stereotyping.\n\nSince then, India’s trajectory has been “exceptional,” Venkat said.\n\n“To witness the largest transfer (of power) from an elite ruling the state, to now becoming a complete universal franchise … we are looking at an incredible political and democratic experiment that is unique.”\n\nRise of a geopolitical giant\n\nFor years after independence, India’s international relations were defined by its policy of non-alignment, the Cold War era stance favored by Nehru that avoided siding with either the United States or the Soviet Union.\n\nNehru played a leading role in the movement, which he saw as a way for developing countries to reject colonialism and imperialism and avoid being dragged into a conflict they had little interest in.\n\nThat stance did not prove popular with Washington, preventing closer ties and marring Nehru’s debut trip to the US in October 1949 to meet President Harry S. Truman. During the 1960s the relationship became further strained as India accepted economic and military assistance from the Soviets and this frostiness largely remained until 2000, when President Bill Clinton’s visit to India prompted a reconciliation.\n\nToday, while India remains technically non-aligned, Washington’s need to balance the rise of China has led it to court New Delhi as a key partner in the increasingly active security grouping known as the Quad.\n\nIndian Border Security Force soldiers hold the national flag during a motorbike rally ahead of the 75th anniversary of country's independence at the India-Pakistan border outpost in Panjgrain, about 60km from Amritsar on August 10, 2022. Narinder Nanu/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe grouping, which also includes Japan and Australia, is widely perceived as a way of countering China’s growing military and economic might and its increasingly aggressive territorial claims in the Asia Pacific.\n\nIndia, meanwhile, has its own reasons for wanting to counterbalance Chinese influence, not least among them its disputed Himalayan border, where more than 20 Indian troops were killed in a bloody battle with Chinese counterparts in June 2020. In October, the US and India will hold a joint military exercise less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from that disputed border.\n\nAs Happymon Jacob, an associate professor of diplomacy and disarmament at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, put it: “India has been able to assert itself on the world stage because of the nature of international politics today and the political and diplomatic military capital that has been put in place by previous governments.”\n\nPart of India’s growing geopolitical clout is due to its growing military expenditure, which New Delhi has ramped up to counter perceived threats from both China and its nuclear-armed neighbor, Pakistan.\n\nFollowing their separation in 1947, relations between India and Pakistan have been in a near constant state of agitation, leading to several wars, involving thousands of casualties and numerous skirmishes across the Line of Control in the contested Kashmir region.\n\nIn 1947, India’s net defense expenditure was just 927 million rupees – about $12 million in today’s money. By 2021, its military expenditure was $76.6 billion, according to a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute – making it the third highest military spender globally, behind only China and the US.\n\nAmbitions on the world stage\n\nOutside economics and geopolitics, India’s growing wealth is feeding its ambitions in fields as diverse as sport, culture and space.\n\nIn 2017, the country broke a world record when it launched 104 satellites in one mission, while in 2019, Prime Minister Modi announced that India had shot down one of its own satellites in a military show of force, making it one of only four countries to have achieved that feat.\n\nLater that year, the country attempted to land a spacecraft on the moon. Though the historic attempt failed, it was widely seen as a statement of intent.\n\nA child touches a model of Indian mission to the moon. Pallava Bagla/Corbis News/Getty Images\n\nLast year, the country spent almost $2 billion on its space program, according to McKinsey, trailing the biggest spenders, the US and China, by some margin, but India’s ambitions in space are growing. In 2023, India is expected to launch its first manned space mission.\n\nThe country is also using its growing wealth to boost its sporting prospects, spending $297.7 million in 2019 before the spread of Covid-19.\n\nNeeraj Chopra at the medal presentation ceremony after winning the gold medal in the men's javelin competition during Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games on August 7th, 2021. Tim Clayton/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThe Indian Premier League – the country’s flagship cricket tournament launched in 2007 – has become the second most valuable sports league in the world in terms of per-match value, according to Jay Shah, secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, after selling its media rights for $6.2 billion in June.\n\nAnd Bollywood, India’s glittering multibillion dollar film industry, continues to pull in fans worldwide, catapulting local names into global superstars attracting millions of followers on social media. Between them, actresses Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone have almost 150 million followers on Instagram.\n\n“India is a strong country. It’s an aggressive player,” said Shruti Kapilla, a professor of Indian history and global political thought at Cambridge University.\n\n“In the last couple of decades, things have shifted. Indian culture has become a major story.”\n\nChallenges and the future\n\nBut for all of India’s successes, challenges remain as Modi seeks to “break the vicious circle of poverty.”\n\nDespite India’s large and growing GDP, it remains a “deeply poor” country on some measures and that, consultant Venkat said, is a “tremendous concern.”\n\nAs recently as 2017, about 60% of India’s nearly 1.3 billion people were living on less than $3.10 a day, according to the World Bank, and women still face widespread discrimination in the deeply parochial country.\n\nViolence against women and girls has made international headlines in a country where allegations of rape are often underreported, due to the lack of legal recourse for alleged attackers through a legal system that’s notoriously slow.\n\n“Many of India’s fundamental challenges remain what they were at the time of independence in some ways, at different parameters and scale,” Venkat said.\n\nIndia is also on the front line of the climate crisis.\n\nRecent heat waves – such as in April when average maximum temperatures in parts of the country soared to record levels and New Delhi saw seven consecutive days over 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) – have tested the limit of human survivability, experts say.\n\nAnd it’s the country’s poorest people who are set to suffer the most, as they work outside in oppressive heat, with limited access to cooling technologies that health experts say is needed to contend with rising temperatures.\n\nAnd as the heat rises on the land, political pressure has grown with fears that the secular fabric of the country and its democracy are being eroded under the leadership of Modi, whom critics accuse of fueling a wave of Hindu nationalism that has left many of the country’s 200 million Muslims living in fear.\n\nMany states run by his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have introduced legislation critics say is deeply rooted in Hindutva ideology, which seeks to transform India into the land of the Hindus. And there has been an alarming rise in support for extremist Hindu groups in recent years, analysts say – including some that have openly called for genocide against the country’s Muslims.\n\nAt the same time, the arrests of numerous journalists in recent years have led to concerns the BJP is using colonial-era laws to quash criticism. In 2022, India slipped to number 150 on the Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders – its lowest position ever.\n\n“The challenges now are about India’s nature of democracy,” Kapilla said. “India is going through a major, contentious change at the fundamental political level.”\n\nSeventy-five years on, Nehru’s observation that “freedom and power bring responsibility” continue to ring true.\n\nIndia’s first 75 years ensured its survival, but in the next 75 years it needs to navigate immense challenges to become a truly global leader, and not just in terms of population, said Venkat, from the Centre for Policy Research.\n\n“Although (India) may end up being the world’s fastest growing major country over the next few years, it will still be miles behind its neighbor in China, or getting close to what it had hoped to achieve at this point, which was double digit growth.”\n\n“So the challenges are immediate and all over the place, chief among them being how to ensure its prosperity,” Venkat said.", "authors": ["Rhea Mogul"], "publish_date": "2022/08/14"}]}

Meet the seven from Maricopa County:\n\nRosanne Carlson\n\nCarlson, a third-grade teacher at Porter Elementary School in Mesa Public Schools, has 28 years of experience that includes kindergarten through fourth grades, and as an English-language development teacher for first and second graders. Carlson, who has bachelor's and master's degrees from Arizona State University, is a co-chairwoman for the school's child study team and member of the site-improvement team.\n\nOn learning from a mentor\n\n\"One of my ASU professors told me that teaching is not a job or a profession that you will go to every day. It is a gift and a passion you have inside you, and you need to share it with others. I always remember this on my successful and unsuccessful days. One last thought she shared with me, after she told me about sharing my passion, was always be ready and prepared for your students.\"\n\nOn engaging students\n\n\"Students come into my classroom with a wide variety of learning styles each year. I use direct instruction, cooperative learning, hands-on activities, partner learning, small groups and peer buddies to keep my students engaged and motivated. The students use the smart board and computers as well. I always like to make real-life connections with them so they can tie something into their own learning. Most importantly, I make a connection with my students so I know their interests, and their different learning styles along with their uniqueness.\"\n\nBragging rights\n\n\"My classroom is my home away from home: a warm and comfortable environment where the students feel welcome, safe and loved. In this environment, they are treated with respect, which encourages my students to learn and become responsible for their own success. My students amaze me each year with their hard work and perseverance: They learn to be problem solvers, and they learn from each other. We are cheerleaders for each other and celebrate small successes, as well as great gains. I am so proud to teach at my school and in my community.\"\n\nMartha Daniels\n\nDaniels, who teaches at Saddle Mountain Unified School District's Ruth Fisher Elementary School, has spent 10 years as a middle school math teacher, including teaching advanced students for high-school credit options. She helped develop the district math curriculum, has coached volleyball for nine years, and is a member of the school leadership team. Daniels has a bachelor's degree from ASU and a master's degree from Grand Canyon University.\n\nOn engaging students\n\n\"Building a working relationship with the students is the best way for me to keep my students engaged. Making math applicable to their world is one way I build this relationship, along with letting the students know that I, too, am human.\"\n\nA tip for parents\n\n\"One tip I would like to give parents is that communication with their child about school is so critical. When you ask your child what they did at school, do not accept 'nothing' as an answer. Have them show you or teach you or name the concept. I learned this as a parent as well as a teacher. It helps the student summarize their learning and helps the child communicate with the parents, in turn building a stronger relationship.\"\n\nOn making data-driven decisions\n\n\"Analyzing and evaluating data helps me to see gaps and successes in the students' mastery. Using this data can help drive instruction through reteaching as well (as) enriching the students academically. Through this data, I can create and develop stronger lessons that are student-focused and more individualized to what each student needs to be successful.\"\n\nZenaida Estrada\n\nEstrada, currently at Phoenix's Mitchell Elementary School in the Isaac Elementary School District, has taught second grade for five years and previously taught kindergarten for three years.\n\nShe is a member of the school's leadership team and the English-language development/education leadership collaborative team. Estrada is bilingual certified and has a bachelor's degree in elementary education with an emphasis on bilingual education.\n\nOn making data-driven decisions\n\n\"Having data allows for good decisions to happen. I constantly assess and use data to help me guide instruction in the classroom. Data from multiple sources such as common formative assessments, observations, class work, district assessments, and summative assessments help me gain deeper understanding of my students' learning. I can use data to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my class as a whole, as well as for each student. Data allows me to reflect on my teaching and the delivery of the lesson, providing an opportunity for me to modify my instruction. Data also allows me to create small groups based on specific students' needs and also create work for those students that have mastered the concept. Data is essential to me as well as for my students; it allows them to receive feedback and create learning goals.\"\n\nA tip for new teachers\n\n\"One tip I would give to new teachers would be to take time to build a relationship with every single student. Data from assessments will give you academic results. However, there are no assessments that will help you know and understand your students personally and socially. Take time to talk about life at home, about their weekends, about their birthday parties. Students need to know that teachers care about them as people.\"\n\nOn learning from a mentor\n\n\"One lesson I learned from a mentor is to always expect the best of every student. Create high expectations and never settle for anything less. Sometimes we underestimate our students, but it's amazing what they are capable of accomplishing if we push them.\"\n\nJennifer Hollenbeck\n\nHollenbeck teaches second grade at Phoenix's Westwood Primary School in the Alhambra Elementary School District. She has worked in education for seven years, including four years as a second-grade teacher and three years as a third-grade teacher. She has served on multiple school- and district-level committees, including the district's Arizona College and Career Ready Standards adoption committee. Hollenbeck has a bachelor's degree from University of Arizona and a master's degree from Northern Arizona University.\n\nOn learning from a mentor\n\n\"Sakeenah Smith has served as a mentor to me. From her, I learned the importance of a meaningful relationship. Sakeenah taught according to the saying, 'No significant learning can occur without a significant relationship.' She believed in the importance of building relationships with students, parents, co-workers and the community to provide the best possible education. I observed the power of a significant and meaningful relationship and continue to value that lesson.\"\n\nA tip for parents\n\n\"One tip I would give to parents to help their children be successful in school is emphasizing the power of education. When children know their parents are invested in their education and believe in the importance of a quality education, it can have a lasting effect on the child. Parents can do this by becoming 'teammates' with the teacher, maintaining open communication and visiting the classroom to ensure that everyone is working toward a common goal of academic and social growth for the child.\"\n\nOn collaborating for student success\n\n\"As teachers, the main focus of our job is the students. The idea that 'it takes a village to raise a child' is true when it comes to education. Westwood emphasizes the importance of collaboration through weekly grade-level planning meetings where teams come together to strategically plan meaningful lessons by looking at standards, pacing guides and student work. We collaborate vertically amongst grade levels to understand what our students should know when they come to us and what they will be expected to do in the next grade.\"\n\nStephanie Lund\n\nLund, a teacher at William C. Jack Elementary School in the Glendale Elementary School District, has spent her eight-year career teaching third grade. She also has coached and mentored student teachers and previously served as a member of district math, reading and writing committees. She currently is a mentor teacher and member of the school leadership team. Lund has a bachelor's degree in international studies and gender and women studies from the University of Denver, a master's degree in education from ASU and currently is pursuing an Ed.D from ASU.\n\nOn engaging students\n\n\"Research shows that student intrinsic motivation is promoted through autonomy, competence and relatedness. I work tirelessly to create an environment that gives students choices, builds their confidence, and meets them at their ability level. Currently, I've invested time in project-based learning, which focuses on student-driven lessons resulting in meaningful projects. Most recently, we studied threats to the monarch butterfly and built a way station at our school to create safe passage on their 2,000-mile journey.\"\n\nA tip for new teachers\n\n\"Make learning active! Kids love to move, so create multiple learning spaces in your classroom for whole-class learning and group learning. Model together on the carpet, move students to their desks for group work, and end at your read-aloud spot for closure. Design lessons that allow students to engage with one another and spend your time supporting each group. Learning should be loud, active and fun.\"\n\nA tip for parents\n\n\"You are your child's best advocate. You know them better than anyone. If you think there is something wrong, or that their learning environment is not working for them, talk to their teacher. Work together to create a plan that enables true learning to occur. Learning effectively at home and at school allows for the development of true learners.\"\n\nSylvia H. Miller\n\nMiller, a fifth grade teacher at Phoenix's Western Valley Elementary School in the Fowler Elementary School District, has spent 11 years in education, including teaching third, fourth and first grades. She currently serves as the site leader for the fifth-grade team, a member of the Academic Parent Teacher Team, and helps provide staff with yearlong professional development. Miller has a bachelor's degree from ASU and a master's degree from Grand Canyon University.\n\nOn learning from a mentor\n\n\"I learned early on that it only takes one person to believe in you to help you begin to believe in yourself. I appreciated the trust and support that I received from my mentor. One lesson that I learned from one mentor is to never underestimate a student's ability and desire to learn. Every student can learn.\"\n\nA tip for new teachers\n\n\"I have a deep respect for any individual who chooses a career in education. It demonstrates their love for children and a strong commitment to impact the future leaders of tomorrow. One tip I would want to give any new teacher is to stay organized and manage your classroom just like if you were running a small business. Also, don't hold back from seeking out a colleague that you can trust and turn to for guidance and support.\"\n\nOn engaging students\n\n\"Each day is a new opportunity to reach all your students through the use of lessons that incorporate technology, creative use of student dialogue, and student-led learning. Help your students reach the point where they receive instruction and are given the opportunities to guide and direct their own learning. Kinesthetically speaking, students should be given the opportunity to learn in ways that promote a high level of learning. Differentiating instruction will challenge and support each student's learning style and help them reach their individual goals.\"\n\nNancy Rhodes Francque\n\nFrancque, a sixth grade special education teacher at Phoenix's Palomino Intermediate School in the Paradise Valley Unified School District, has spent all of her eight years in education teaching special education, as a teacher and instructional assistant. Before she became a teacher, she worked as a legislative liaison for Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar, specializing in environmental legislation and policy. She has bachelor's and master's degrees from UA in business and public administration, respectively, and a master's degree from ASU in education.\n\nOn engaging students\n\n\"I incorporate current events, social studies and science content into my reading, math and writing lessons. Our students do not benefit from the exposure that children in other schools often take for granted. Many have never traveled outside of Phoenix or regularly watch the news. By introducing and exploring the world in the context of our lessons, my students are not only engaged, but continue to make connections long after the lesson has ended.\"\n\nA tip for new teachers\n\n\"Never expect to stop learning. Each year will bring new experiences, new colleagues and new instructional resources. Seek them out and your teaching will evolve. Bring the world into your classroom, include current events into your curriculum, and constantly revise and adjust your practice to meet the needs of your students.\"\n\nOn learning from a mentor\n\n\"My mentor, Rodel Exemplary Teacher Tipton Coffman, taught me that it is not only acceptable but critical to be passionate about my students. I must show each student on a daily basis how proud I am of their achievements, that I have invested in their success, and that I truly care about each one of them as individuals.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/11/27"}]}

In recognition of just how global business has become, Fortune decided to merge its domestic and international lists of top corporate women leaders.\n\nStill, in some ways, this year’s top 10 list is similar to last year’s with a few exceptions.\n\nComing in at No. 1 for the second year running is CVS Health president and CEO Karen Lynch, who is leading the highest-ranking Fortune 500 and Global 500 company ever run by a woman. On her watch – she took the helm in February 2021 – the company’s revenue jumped 9% and its share price gains (up 42%) well outpaced performance of the S&P 500. CVS, meanwhile, continued to be a central player in the fight against Covid, and Lynch implemented a mental health program to help prevent suicide among its Aetna members.\n\nRanking close behind Lynch once again are Julie Sweet, chair and CEO of Accenture (No. 2); Jane Fraser, CEO of Citi (No. 3); and Mary Barra, chair and CEO, GM (No. 4).\n\nBut the No. 5 spot went to Jessica Tan, co-CEO and executive director of Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd, which is the 25th largest company in the world. Fortune notes that despite China’s Covid lockdowns and “skittish consumer sentiment,” Ping An under Tan’s leadership beat profit expectations in the first half of 2022 and aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.\n\nAlso new to the top 10 relative to Fortune’s domestic list last year is Emma Walmsley, CEO of global drugmaker GSK. She spun off her company’s $13 billion consumer health unit. “That leaves the now exclusively pharma-focused GSK with a pile of cash to invest in promising drug and vaccine candidates,” Fortune notes.\n\nTwo executives, meanwhile, fell out of the top 10 from last year: Thasunda Brown Duckett, president and CEO of TIAA; and Ruth Porat, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Alphabet. But neither fell far, ranking as No. 11 and 12, respectively.\n\nHere are the top 10 women executives on Fortune’s 2022 Most Powerful Women list:\n\n1.

It is a nation largely run by women.\n\nThis is the culmination of a national push for gender equity that started even before Finland’s independence in 1917.\n\nIn 1906, Finland, then a duchy of Russia, was the first country to give women full political rights to both vote and run for office. A year later, the 19 women elected to the Finnish parliament were the first female parliamentarians in the world.\n\nToday, roughly half of the nation’s legislative and ministerial positions are held by women.\n\nIndeed, Finland has much to be proud of this International Women’s Day, ranking second in last year’s World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap report, just behind fellow Nordic country Iceland.\n\nIn the same report meanwhile, our own birth nations of the United States and Japan held the positions of No. 30 and No. 120 respectively, out of 156 countries.\n\nIn 2015 we got a first-hand look at Finland’s gender progress, moving there with our then-eight-year-old son from New York City to the rural North Karelia district. William to teach graduate school and study the world-renowned Finnish childhood education system as a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Eastern Finland, and Naomi to explore the local foods, culture and nature of Europe’s most forested nation.\n\nWe wound up admiring the people and society of Finland so much that we’ve been returning to North Karelia and to the capital city of Helsinki for extended visits ever since.\n\nContrary to the stereotypical image of Finnish people as being reserved, Naomi was instantly “adopted” as a long-lost sister by the exuberant, highly accomplished women of the Martha organization – a volunteer community service group – and by a wide range of local mothers, professional women and university professors.\n\nIn Finland, we found a fiercely egalitarian and modest society that is much the opposite of what we were used to in the US. Schoolchildren learn through play and joyful discovery, enjoy multiple outdoor daily recess periods and have highly respected teachers and fairly-funded public schools. Parental leave is generous, public hospitals are first-rate, and the full participation of women in political leadership and many professions is accepted as routine.\n\nWe’ve found Finland’s gender progress to be one of the most inspiring features of this forest nation at the top of the world, and we wanted to find out how it happened. So we asked the leader who was ranked as the nation’s most inspiring woman in a 2021 poll by public broadcaster YLE: a basketball-playing, cat-loving, 77-year-old grandmother named Tarja Halonen, who served as the nation’s first female president, from 2000 to 2012.\n\n“Finland is a small nation,” former President Halonen explained to us last year from her home in the working-class Helsinki district where she grew up.\n\n“For 700 years we were a part of our western neighbor (Sweden). Then the king of Sweden started a war against Russia and he lost it. Then we were 100 years a part of Russia – luckily as an autonomous part. Now our independence has lasted a little more than 100 years.” In that time, she said, “we have had one civil war and two wars and many difficulties.”\n\n“We have learned to be very independent and stubborn and hardworking. Perhaps somehow it has been easier for us to realize that you need both men and women for a society to function at 100%. Here in the North (of the globe) we have a long tradition of strong women in society. The women have to be strong in order to survive and in order to help their families and their fellow citizens,” said Halonen.\n\nGender progress in Finland was forged by womens’ and labor organizations and by many enlightened women and men. One such pioneer was Miina Sillanpää, a former child laborer and maid who was elected to parliament in 1907 and served there for 38 years.\n\nShe became the nation’s first cabinet member in 1926, and led the national association of servants and household workers for 50 years. Sillanpää helped start an organization of shelters for single women and their children and fought to improve the lives of the elderly and disadvantaged.\n\nA Finnish business executive recently told us of an “ethos of equality” that is “culturally embedded” into the nation. She explained that “this happens in fundamental social services like health care and high-quality education, which are offered to all citizens as an essential, non-negotiable foundation for gender equity in a society.”\n\nThat’s not to say Finland doesn’t have its share of social problems, including alcoholism and sexual harassment. There is domestic violence in Finland, with 23% of 15 to 49-year-old women experiencing intimate partner violence in their lifetimes according to United Nations data. That’s compared for example with 26% in the US, 24% in the United Kingdom, 22% in France, 21% in Sweden, 16% in Italy and 15% in Spain.\n\nRacism is a problem, too. A 2020 report by Finland’s own government Equality Ombudsman found that four out of five people of African heritage have experienced discrimination based on the color of their skin. “Racism runs deep” in Finland, the report declared. “Our ways of thinking and our modes of action are to a large extent racist even if we do not notice it or are unwilling to admit it.”\n\nThis brutally honest admission is especially relevant in light of the fact that the theme of this year’s International Women’s Day is “BreakTheBias”.\n\nBut at the same time, Finland is one of the world leaders in striving to achieve a better life for all its citizens. Its public services and schools are among the best on the globe.\n\nThe strong participation of women in decision-making has helped build a nation that ranks first among the world’s 193 nations in sustainable development, according to a 2021 United Nations report which found that Finland has achieved or nearly achieved the UN’s goals for improving health, education, water, energy, and peace, alleviating poverty and reducing inequality.\n\nAnd far from being a centrally-planned socialist economy, Finland is, in fact, the opposite: a thriving, free-market economy that boasts both the world’s best business environment and the strongest rule of law, according to the 2021 Global Innovation Index.\n\n“Women’s full and equal participation in society has made Finland’s development possible,” Prime Minister Marin said in a speech at last year’s Generation Equality Forum. “One hundred years ago, Finland was a poor and conflict-torn society. It was not possible for us to ignore the potential of half of our population.”\n\nNow, as Finland’s neighbor Russia wages war on Ukraine, Marin and her government are navigating their country’s place in a rapidly-changing modern Europe, including the possibility of joining NATO.\n\nThe more we speak with Finnish people, the more we are struck by how often they emphasize the idea of partnership between women and men, rather than a competition of “women versus men.” We often hear of the collective Finnish desire to care for each and every member of society.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nFinland is not necessarily “better than,” or even directly comparable to, many other nations. But it can serve as an inspiring source of reflection on what may be shining truths in human affairs – when a society strives to truly and humbly make each gender full partners in power and in leadership, and makes a national mission out of striving to care for all its citizens with fairness and compassion, the whole of society thrives.\n\nThe people of Finland are the first to acknowledge that this is still a work in progress – but they are showing the world why it is worth striving for.", "authors": ["Naomi Moriyama William Doyle", "Naomi Moriyama", "William Doyle"], "publish_date": "2022/03/08"}]}

The central bank’s chief economist on Tuesday promised “significant” rate action at its next meeting in November.\n\nThe Bank of England on Wednesday announced an emergency intervention in the government bond market, pointing to recent “dysfunction.” It said it would buy long-dated UK government bonds on “whatever scale is necessary” to “restore orderly market conditions.”\n\nThe government of Liz Truss, who succeeded Boris Johnson as prime minister only three weeks ago, said Friday that it would cut taxes by £45 billion ($48 billion) in a bid to get the UK economy moving again. The package includes scrapping the highest rate of income tax for top earners and a big increase in government borrowing to slash energy prices for millions of households and businesses this winter.\n\nBut many leading economists have described the unorthodox measures as a reckless gamble, and have warned that they will force the Bank of England to slam on the brakes even harder as it tries to tame inflation that is already running near 40-year highs at almost 10%.\n\nUK finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng has shown no signs of backing down, despite the market crash. Carl Court/Getty Images\n\nThe UK Treasury has tried to calm market nerves by saying it will provide more details of its plans on November 23 and is committed to ensuring that debt falls as a share of UK GDP in the medium term.\n\nThe IMF said the planned measures would “likely increase inequality,” and it called on the UK government to use the budget in November as an opportunity “to consider ways to provide support that is more targeted and reevaluate the tax measures, especially those that benefit high-income earners.”\n\nBut that may come too late for businesses, which are already facing a sharp rise in borrowing costs, and hundreds of thousands of mortgage holders who will need to refinance their loans in the last quarter of this year. Hundreds of mortgage products have already been pulled from the market as banks struggle to keep pace with bond market volatility.\n\nYields on 10-year UK government bonds fell sharply after the Bank of England’s announcement on Wednesday but remain elevated. They were last near 4.1%, up from under 2.9% at the beginning of the month. The pound continued its decline, however, sliding 0.4% to below $1.07.\n\n‘Really stupid’\n\nCharlie Bean, former deputy governor of the Bank of England, told CNN Business that the UK government was guilty of “really stupid” decisions, and he described the IMF intervention as “striking.”\n\n“It’s unusual for the IMF to do that, particularly for a G7 economy, and for them to do it so swiftly,” he said. “They might do these sorts of things for an emerging market country that has been on the edge for a while.”\n\nThe IMF has history in Britain. The last time a UK government cut taxes this much, there was rampant inflation, a massive jump in debt and eventually an IMF bailout in 1976. Things aren’t that bad, yet.\n\n“This is not 1976 where we have a currency crisis, a balance of payments crisis, and we go to the IMF cup in hand asking for an emergency loan. But this is a situation where government borrowing costs … are incredibly vulnerable,” Mohammed El-Erian, president of Queens’ College at Cambridge University and an adviser to Allianz, told the BBC on Tuesday.\n\nRatings agency Moody’s slammed the British government’s plans.\n\n“Large unfunded tax cuts will lead to structurally higher deficits amid rising borrowing costs, a weaker growth outlook and acute public spending pressure stemming from the pandemic and a decade of austerity,” it said in a note on Tuesday, adding that the loss of confidence among investors in the government could “permanently weaken the UK’s debt affordability.”\n\n— Julia Horowitz and Anna Cooban contributed to this article.", "authors": ["Mark Thompson Rob North", "Mark Thompson", "Rob North"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/28/investing/bank-of-england-uk-bond-market/index.html", "title": "Bank of England intervenes to buy UK bonds, warns of risk to ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nThe Bank of England said Wednesday it would buy UK government debt “on whatever scale is necessary” in an emergency intervention to halt a bond market crash that it warned could threaten financial stability.\n\nInvestors have been dumping the pound and UK bonds since the government of new Prime Minister Liz Truss on Friday unveiled a huge package of tax cuts and increased borrowing aimed at getting the economy moving and protecting households and businesses from sky-high energy bills this winter.\n\nMarkets fear the plan will drive up inflation, forcing the Bank of England to push interest rates as high as 6% next spring, from 2.25% at present. Mortgage markets have been in turmoil all week as lenders have struggled to price their loans. Hundreds of products have been withdrawn.\n\n“This repricing [of UK assets] has become more significant in the past day — and it is particularly affecting long-dated UK government debt,” the central bank said in its statement.\n\n“Were dysfunction in this market to continue or worsen, there would be a material risk to UK financial stability. This would lead to an unwarranted tightening of financing conditions and a reduction of the flow of credit to the real economy.”\n\nIn other words, the Bank of England is worried that markets could seize up and that the economy — which it believes has already entered a recession — would suffer even worse damage.\n\nTo prevent that happening, the central bank said it would buy long-dated UK government bonds until October 14.\n\n“The purchases will be carried out on whatever scale is necessary to effect this outcome,” it added.\n\nIt reiterated that it would make a full assessment of recent developments at its next scheduled meeting in November and act accordingly.\n\n“The [bank] will not hesitate to change interest rates by as much as needed to return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in line with its remit,” it said.\n\nYields on 10-year UK government bonds fell sharply after the Bank of England’s announcement on Wednesday but remain elevated. They were last near 4.1%, up from under 2.9% at the beginning of the month.

There’s no precedent for that – but there’s also no precedent for more than 50 government officials to resign in two days in order to force a Prime Minister out.\n\nWill Johnson’s resignation trigger a general election?\n\nNo. It starts the Conservative Party process for choosing a new leader of the party.\n\nUK Prime Ministers are not directly elected by the people; Johnson is Prime Minister because he is the head of the largest party in the House of Commons.\n\nThe Conservatives will still be the largest party after Johnson quits, so the new head of the party will become Prime Minister.\n\nHow is the new Conservative Party leader chosen?\n\nLeadership candidates need the support of at least eight lawmakers.\n\nIf there are more than two candidates, Conservative Party lawmakers hold round after round of votes to whittle the number of leadership candidates down to two.\n\nThen Conservative Party members nationwide vote – by mail – between the two finalists.\n\nThe winner becomes leader of the party – and Prime Minister.\n\nShow More - (Show Less)\n\nIs there any way to force Johnson to leave before a new Conservative Party leader is chosen?\n\nConservative lawmakers could, in theory, try to force him out themselves by calling a vote of confidence among Tory MPs. But Johnson survived a vote like that just a month ago.\n\nUnder current party rules, that means there can’t be another party confidence vote in him for 12 months.\n\nThe rules could be changed, but it’s not clear the Conservative Party wants to start that kind of infighting when Johnson has already said he’s going, and when a leadership contest is under way.\n\nCan’t the opposition do anything to force Johnson out?\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer said Thursday that if the Conservatives didn’t push Johnson out immediately, the opposition would call a confidence vote in the government among the entire House of Commons.\n\nIf the opposition won, it could theoretically lead to a general election – but even with all the chaos in the Conservative Party at the moment, they still have a big majority in the House of Commons, and they’re not likely to want a general election at the same time as a leadership election. So the chances of the opposition bringing the government down now are slim.\n\nWhen Johnson does finally leave Downing Street, what happens?\n\nHe submits his resignation to the Queen, in person.\n\nThe Palace will announce officially that Queen Elizabeth II has accepted Johnson’s resignation, and will say who she has invited to become Prime Minister to replace him. That person will then go to meet the Queen to accept the invitation. This is a formality.\n\nDoes the new Prime Minister have to call a general election?\n\nNo. The United Kingdom isn’t scheduled to have another general election until December 2024.\n\nThe new Prime Minister could choose to ask Parliament to vote for an early election, but isn’t required to do so.", "authors": ["Richard Allen Greene"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/football/qatar-2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-human-rights-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Migrant workers helped build Qatar's World Cup tournament, now ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nKamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers, having finished yet another grueling working day, when he and – he says – a few others were arrested this August. Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016.

Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight.

The affirmation of the Aa3 rating is a reflection of the UK’s economic resilience, Moody’s said in a statement.\n\nCredit ratings are essentially credit scores for governments and companies. They express an opinion about the capacity and willingness of large borrowers to repay their debts. Germany, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and the United States have some of the best credit ratings in the world, while Argentina, Nigeria, Pakistan and India have some of the lowest ratings.\n\nThe UK is in the midst of suffering from a string of blows to its economy, which the Bank of England has said may already be in recession. Soaring food costs drove the annual rate of inflation to 10.1% in September, returning it to July’s 40-year high.\n\nThat may prompt the central bank to hike interest rates more aggressively when it meets on November 3 in order to tame rising prices.\n\nPolitical and economic turmoil\n\nOn Thursday, Liz Truss resigned as Prime Minister after six disastrous weeks in office. Truss and former Finance Minister Kwasi Kwarteng’s “mini” budget upended UK financial markets. Investors immediately rejected their plans for unfunded tax cuts, spiking government bond yields, sinking the pound and forcing the Bank of England to make three successive interventions to rescue overstretched pension funds.\n\nWhile most of those measures have since been rescinded by Britain’s new Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt — calming markets and restoring a sense of stability — the government’s credibility has been damaged and volatility could persist.\n\nAs well as driving up borrowing costs for the government and adding pressure to public spending, any credit ratings downgrade would only weaken investor appetite for UK assets.\n\nThe last time Moody’s downgraded the United Kingdom’s credit rating was in October 2020, citing lower than expected growth following Brexit, rising government debt and a weakening of the UK’s institutions that it said had led to a “fractious policy environment.”\n\n— Julia Horowitz and Alicia Wallace contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Hanna Ziady"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/economy/price-controls-inflation/index.html", "title": "Price controls: Should the government control how much food and ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nPeople are paying a lot more for food, gas, cars and services, and inflation isn’t over yet as the pandemic continues to distort the economy. So should governments consider setting the price of essential goods?\n\nIt’s been done before, typically during times of crisis, but for most mainstream economists, the answer to this question is a resounding “no.” Limiting how much companies can charge will distort markets, they argue, causing shortages and exacerbating supply chain problems while only temporarily reducing inflation.\n\n“Price controls can of course control prices — but they’re a terrible idea,” David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, remarked in a survey published earlier this month by the University of Chicago.\n\nAsked whether price controls similar to those used in the United States during the 1970s could reduce inflation over the next year, less than a quarter of economists surveyed said they agree while nearly 60% said they disagree or strongly disagree.\n\n“Just stop. Seriously,” Austan Goolsbee, a professor at the University of Chicago, said in response to the question. Goolsbee previously served as chairman of the Council of Economics Advisers under former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe attitude toward price controls appears to be similar in Washington, where policymakers have shown little enthusiasm for even targeted or temporary measures despite growing pressure on middle class families that feel the pain of price increases more than the rich.\n\nStill, with annual inflation running at a four-decade high of 7% and midterm elections approaching, price controls could feature in future debates about how to reduce prices, particularly if actions taken this year by the Federal Reserve fail to tame inflation.\n\nPeople shop for groceries at a supermarket in Glendale, California, on January 12. Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe problem with price controls\n\nPrice controls can be targeted or imposed on a broad range of goods, setting either a floor or ceiling. The German capital of Berlin, for example, has sought to limit how much rent landlords can charge tenants. In the United Kingdom, regulators limit how much consumers can be charged for energy and some types of rail fares.\n\nEconomists who are skeptical of price controls often point to basic economic concepts.\n\nThey argue that capping prices encourages companies to produce less of a product, while making it more attractive to consumers. Supply goes down, and demand goes up, with shortages being the inevitable result.\n\nBut that doesn’t stop governments around the world from resorting to price controls when inflation gets out of hand. As elections approached late last year in Argentina and annual inflation topped 50%, the government froze the price of over 1,000 household goods.\n\nLast week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he would cut the price of flour, sugar, sunflower oil, milk, pork leg and chicken breast ahead of a national election in April, according to Reuters. He also extended caps on energy, fuel and mortgages.\n\nIsabella Weber, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, argues that price controls have a role to play in the United States, too, as policymakers try to address inflation caused by the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic.\n\n“Price controls would buy time to deal with bottlenecks that will continue as long as the pandemic prevails,” Weber wrote recently in The Guardian, adding that “the cost of waiting for inflation to go away is high.” One key to making the policy a success, she wrote, is to remove price caps gradually to prevent a rapid surge in prices.\n\nFree market or price controls?\n\nThere is plenty of precedent for price controls in the United States, but you have to look a few decades back.\n\nThey were last deployed at the federal level during the 1970s, when former President Richard Nixon established a Cost of Living Council in the summer of 1971 and blocked most wage and price increases for 90 days. The policy was popular with the American public, and inflation slowed temporarily after reaching 5.8% in 1970.\n\nBut Nixon’s subsequent efforts to cap prices were much less successful. The Republican repeatedly tried to freeze prices during the next few years, but inflation surged to 11% in 1974 — exacerbated by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) declaring an embargo on oil shipments to the United States the previous year.\n\nNixon had worked early in his career as an attorney for the Office of Price Administration, which was established during World War II to impose price ceilings on rents and a wide range of products. The price controls were largely effective, but gave rise to a thriving black market. The agency was dissolved in 1947.\n\nLimited price controls are also present in the US economy today. Some cities cap rents or the amount landlords can hike them each year, while government agencies limit the price that some monopolistic utilities charge.\n\nModern politicians tend to put their faith in the Federal Reserve’s ability to control inflation, but the central bank may struggle to address price hikes that are caused by supply chain issues resulting from the pandemic.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has also taken some steps to combat rising prices by targeting corporations and using the power of his office. He has pledged to enforce antitrust laws and crack down on price fixing by meat processors, an industry that is controlled by just a handful of large firms. Biden has also released oil from the country’s Strategic Petroleum Reserves in a bid to reduce energy prices. Meat and energy are both significant contributors to inflation.\n\nPrice controls, it seems, are still a bridge too far.", "authors": ["Charles Riley"], "publish_date": "2022/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/09/success/salary-ranges-pay-transparency/index.html", "title": "Here's what happens when salary is actually included in job listings ...", "text": "Job listings can be extremely detailed, with long lists of responsibilities and required skills, descriptions of company culture and perks, and numerous other reasons for why you might want to work there. But there’s often one glaring omission: the pay.\n\nOnly about 12% of postings from US online job sites include salary ranges, according to Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. And that’s an increase from 8% in 2019.\n\nPart of the reason for the uptick is the stronger job market, Pollak said. “A tightening labor market does appear to have caused more companies to disclose pay rates,” she said.\n\nBut a growing number of companies will soon be required by their local governments to disclose what they’ll pay.\n\nA new law in New York City, for example, requires employers to include a salary range on job listings. The law, which goes into effect in May, applies to employers with four or more employees, and excludes temporary staffing firms.\n\n“Our new law shines a light on pay inequity,” Helen Rosenthal, a former City Council member and sponsor of the bill, told CNN in a statement last month. “Including pay ranges in job postings allows job seekers to determine whether they will be able to support themselves and their family when they apply for a job.”\n\nColorado has a similar law that has been in effect since January 2021, and a few other states, like Rhode Island and Maryland, have legislation that requires employers to provide salary ranges upon request.\n\nWhy the big secret?\n\nLabor costs are a major expense for companies, and staying mum on what they’re willing to pay can enable them to hire candidates for less, said Katie Donovan, founder of consultancy Equal Pay Negotiations.\n\n“Companies don’t want informed consumers … because the more informed the consumer is, the harder it is to negotiate a savings of any kind,” she said. “There’s definitely a mindset that the job of recruiting and hiring is to bring in the best person at not a penny more than needed. And the best way to do that is don’t tell them how much you actually have available.”\n\nKeeping the number under wraps can also be a negotiation strategy. “The person who says a number first loses,” said Donovan.\n\nPublishing salary information also means that competitors and current employees can see what a company is paying.\n\nIn some cases, current employees may discover that they are underpaid, which could lead them to demand more or find a new job.\n\n“That’s the scary part, that is why [companies] aren’t putting it in writing,” she said.\n\nWhy it’s good for employers\n\nBut posting salaries can also be advantageous to companies when it comes to negotiating, said Zoe Cullen, assistant professor of economics at Harvard University.\n\n“Firms that firmly set a price for a particular job have a high degree of bargaining power in the sense that they are announcing to potential job candidates that, ‘if you try to negotiate anything higher than this price, it is going to effect everybody else because I will have to publicly adjust the going rate for this job.’”\n\nSharing salary ranges can also help attract workers.\n\n“When people are searching for work, [compensation] is the most salient concern typically. So if they don’t find the [salary] information they need, they may not waste the time going through the process at all,” said Pollak.\n\nAt the same time, employers can also create a more qualified applicant pool.\n\n“It saves them the time and energy of searching through candidates who are never going to accept the job… people will self-select out when the [salary] is too little,” said Donovan.\n\nShe added that when companies are more upfront about salaries, it can help create trust. “They feel more respected and apply more when there is the information…it’s like ‘OK, they are treating me like a human being.’”\n\nWhy it’s good for job hunters…\n\nFor starters, published salary ranges help job seekers understand what the market is willing to pay for certain positions.\n\n“If you have the ability to know what salary is being offered and know what others are earning, then you are in a position to advocate for yourself,” said Laurie Berke-Weiss, principal attorney at Berke-Weiss, a labor and employment law firm in New York City.\n\nKnowing what a job pays from the start can also make the job-hunting process more streamlined. In the current tight labor market, candidates are being more selective about what roles they apply for, and advertised salary ranges can help them narrow down their options.\n\n“Role descriptions can be made to sound more than they are and [job seekers] can go deep into the process and realize that the salary is significantly lower than what they make right now,” said Rohan Rajiv, group product manager at LinkedIn. He added that LinkedIn job postings that included salary information increased by 50% in January 2022 from January 2021.\n\nLaws requiring salary disclosure, as well as other laws like banning companies from asking about salary history, can also help with pay equity.\n\nStudies show women and people of color tend to be paid less than White men in the same roles. To right the issue would require significant salary increases.\n\n“Mathematically, for a Hispanic women to answer the question: What are you looking to earn in this job? For her to say the same number as a White guy, she would have to increase her current pay by over 100%… just based on statistics,” said Donovan.\n\n...And also for existing employees\n\nPosting salary ranges can be enlightening for current employees as well.\n\n“[If employees] see that they can get a 20% increase just by going to the competition, they’ll start paying attention to their openings,” said Donovan.\n\nSuch transparency can also help existing employees know if they’re underpaid.\n\n“Most people think that the people with longer tenure [at a company] are making more than the new kid that just started. But no, the new kid is probably making more,” said Donovan. “The new kid is getting paid the current market value and your 2% [annual] raise hasn’t kept up with the market rate.”\n\nCullen’s research shows that employers’ public disclosures of pay ranges can reduce a worker’s bargaining power and limit their ability to ask for more beyond the range.\n\nBut there’s more to compensation than what’s on a paycheck. Companies can also offer benefits like signing bonuses, stock options, and other perks that they might not always be required to be disclosed.\n\n“You can have a company that is very openly, publicly committed to pay transparency, but if they really want a candidate who requires more to take the job than they initially offer, they can find ways to make that posted salary range still hold,” said Pollak. “Companies can find all kinds of creative ways to get around these requirements.”", "authors": ["Kathryn Vasel"], "publish_date": "2022/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/economy/uk-economy-what-next/index.html", "title": "UK economy: What next as crisis after crisis hits? | CNN Business", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nThere was good news and bad in Friday’s revised data about the UK economy. It grew — marginally — in the second quarter of the year, rather than shrinking as previously estimated.\n\nBut the latest update from the Office for National Statistics also showed that the United Kingdom is the only G7 economy that has not recovered fully from the pandemic, with GDP still 0.2% smaller than at the start of 2020. And, according to the Bank of England, the economy is most likely already shrinking again, with inflation heading to 11%.\n\n“The important thing [in Friday’s data] was that the UK is struggling to grow and facing a probable deeper recession down the road, and today’s revision doesn’t change that,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda. ​\n\nIt may be a long time before it does recover, given the crisis unleashed by Prime Minister Liz Truss’ decision last week to unveil huge unfunded tax cuts alongside a massive package of energy subsidies. That gamble spooked financial markets and sent borrowing costs for the government, businesses and households soaring.\n\n“You have all these things coming together, that are going to go counter to the government’s objectives of higher growth and lower inflation,” Mohamed El-Erian, bond market expert and adviser to Allianz, told CNN earlier this week. “And again, the situation wasn’t great to begin with. Now, the problems have been amplified.”\n\nAn emergency intervention by the Bank of England on Wednesday calmed markets, and prevented the collapse of some pensions funds. But the Truss plan to boost growth has backfired badly, with investors now expecting that the central bank will have to raise interest rates by 1.25% or even 1.5% by November 2 to tackle its inflationary impact.\n\nWhat’s next for the UK economy\n\nWhat happens next is far from clear. Truss and her finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng insisted Thursday that they would stick with their plan, but they have a very narrow window — perhaps as little as two weeks — to convince investors that they can be trusted with the nation’s finances. The Bank of England’s emergency bond-buying is due to end on October 14.\n\nHaving spent the summer bashing economic orthodoxy, and — in the words of former central bank governor Mark Carney — “undermining” some of the most important UK institutions, Truss and Kwarteng met Friday with one of those key players, the Office of Budget Responsibility.\n\nThe OBR provides an independent assessment of the impact of government budgets on borrowing and growth. Truss and Kwarteng had rejected its offer to provide a draft analysis of last Friday’s fiscal bombshell.\n\nMel Stride, a senior lawmaker from Truss’ Conservative party, said that the OBR was likely to deliver a very uncomfortable message on Friday.\n\n“I suspect strongly that it will be that this circle cannot be squared,” Stride told the BBC.\n\nPromising large unfunded tax cuts with inflation running high and a tight labor market, and expecting reforms to generate the growth to pay for them would not work.\n\n“So there needs to be a rethink and that will be a very difficult conversation,” Stride said.\n\nThe OBR said after the meeting that it will deliver its initial forecasts to Kwarteng on October 7. The Treasury said that it would publish the forecast alongside its medium-term fiscal plan on November 23, resisting calls from lawmakers to release them as soon as possible.\n\nPolitical trouble for Truss\n\nThe big problem for the UK government is that it is caught between having to reassure the markets, and voters who are growing increasingly angry at the spiraling costs of their mortgages.\n\n“Raising, postponing, or abandoning tax cuts will be avoided by Truss at all costs as such a reversal would be humiliating and could leave her looking like a lame duck prime minister,” wrote Mujtaba Rahman and Jens Larson at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group earlier this week.\n\nThe only alternative left to balance the books would be to slash government spending, and that would prove equally politically difficult as a recession looms with its public services under enormous strain and a restive workforce that has shown it’s ready to strike in large numbers over pay.\n\nPoll ratings for the Conservative party have collapsed. British polling agency Survation recorded its largest ever lead for the opposition Labour party over the governing Conservatives this week — 21 points.\n\nThe poll, taken September 28-29, found 49% of respondents said they would vote Labour if an election were held tomorrow, up six points from their showing on September 5, the day before Truss took office. The Conservative party was on 28%, down five points.\n\nA separate poll by IpsosUK, also released on September 29, showed Labour with clear leads over the Conservatives on policies for the economy, managing taxes and public spending and the cost-of-living crisis.\n\n— Jorge Engels, Chris Liakos, Livvy Doherty, Dan Wright, Jorge Engels and Morgan Povey contributed to this article.", "authors": ["Mark Thompson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/957997/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-23-september-2022", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 23 September 2022 | The Week", "text": "1.

His measures could include cutting stamp duty for property purchases, scrapping a planned rise in corporation tax and the end of a cap on bankers’ bonuses. “We will be bold and unashamed in pursuing growth – even when that means taking difficult decisions,” Kwarteng will reportedly say.

The constitutional review, conducted by Gordon Brown, also recommends ceding more economic powers, including the power to control taxes, to Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and a new devolved government for England. The former PM also recommends forming a jury of ordinary citizens who would be empowered to rule on complaints against MPs and ministers through a new integrity and ethics commission.

Rates rise causes ‘financial pain’\n\nIncreasing interest rates will cause “real financial pain for millions of households”, said Sky News. The Bank of England raised rates yesterday from 1.75% to 2.25%, the highest level for 14 years and the seventh rate rise in a row as it tries to tame soaring prices. The bank also said the UK may already in be recession, as it expects that the economy has shrunk between July and September.\n\n4. Referendums held in Ukraine\n\nRussian-occupied areas of Ukraine are voting today on whether to join Russia, in what Emmanuel Macron has described as a “parody” of democracy. Ukraine’s Western allies have dismissed the referendums, which will take place in four regions in which Russia gained ground during its invasion, as a land grab. Although the ballots had been discussed for months, Ukraine’s recent advances have prompted a scramble by officials to schedule them while they still hold the territory.\n\nHow will the Ukraine war end?\n\n5. Cold sore virus could kill cancer\n\nScientists say a new type of cancer therapy that uses a common virus to infect and destroy harmful cells is showing promise in early human trials. One patient’s cancer vanished, while others saw their tumours shrink, said the Institute of Cancer Research. The drug is a weakened form of a cold sore virus that has been modified to kill tumours. Although larger and longer studies will be needed to confirm the results, the development could “offer a lifeline for those living with advanced-stage cancer,” said Sky News.\n\n6. Truss hints at Israel embassy move\n\nLiz Truss has said she is considering relocating the British embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In a meeting at the UN, the new PM told Israel’s caretaker leader, Yair Lapid, about a “review of the current location” of the building, Downing Street said in a statement. The UK has housed its Israel embassy in Tel Aviv for decades despite Israel regarding Jerusalem as its capital. A move to Jerusalem would “follow former US President Donald Trump’s provocative move”, said Al Jazeera.\n\n7. Ten-year-olds ‘involved in hooliganism’\n\nMark Roberts, the chief constable of Cheshire Police and the national lead for football policing, has said his officers have “identified kids as young as ten knocking around with groups” involved in hooliganism. New data showed that in the 2021-22 season, disturbances were reported at more than 400 games, many involving supporters aged 25 and under. The uptick in disorder is being caused by alcohol, cocaine use and the lifting of Covid restrictions after a period without matches, said The Independent.\n\n8. Covid hospitalisations on the up\n\nCoronavirus hospitalisations are rising again for the first time since early July. On Monday, 781 Covid patients were admitted to hospital in England, up from 519 the week before, with the seven-day total rising by 17% in the week ending 19 September. “As it gets colder and we head towards winter, we will start to see respiratory infections pick up – please try to stay at home if you are unwell and avoid contact with vulnerable people,” said Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency.

Northern Ireland census a blow to unionists\n\nCatholics outnumber Protestants in Northern Ireland for the first time. Results from the 2021 census released yesterday showed that 45.7% of the population are Catholic or from a Catholic background compared with 43.5% from Protestant or other Christian backgrounds. The Irish Times said the results will “fire up those pushing for a united Ireland poll and dishearten an already insecure unionist population”. The Guardian said unionists have for decades relied on a “supposedly impregnable Protestant majority to safeguard Northern Ireland’s position in the UK”.\n\nMay 2022: Will Sinn Féin victory lead to a united Ireland?\n\n10.

I hope there was nothing that we did that made it appealing to them. As a parent of a 16-year-old, I’m sorry for them, and I have empathy for them, in terms of what the challenges they’re going through.”\n\nThe company has tried to combat youth use by shutting down its social media accounts and pulling fruity flavors like creme and mango from retailers. So far, that hasn’t stopped criticism. The company’s hometown of San Francisco banned sales of e-cigarettes last month.\n\nE-cigarettes are being marketed to adults to help them quit smoking while still getting their nicotine fix. But they’ve come under fire in recent months for their growing popularity among teens. Federal data shows about 3 million U.S. high school students vaped last year. That is prompting fears e-cigarettes are addicting a new generation of nicotine after decades of cigarette smoking rates plummeting.\n\n'It would always be in my hands'\n\nPam Debono’s daughter Grace picked up a Juul in the summer of 2017. At the time she was 15 and Juul was starting to take off. Debono calls it “the summer of Juul,” when she started finding plastic covers everywhere that she “didn’t really have a clue what they were.”\n\nGrace told CNBC that a friend of hers bought the Juul pods and devices from a gas station. Both girls were 15 at the time. Grace said she would hit her Juul first thing in the morning and would puff on it all day, going through one nicotine pod per day – about as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.\n\n“It would always be in my hands,” she said. “Like, it would always just be with me, you know? And so I would always just, like, hit it ’cause it was just so easy.”\n\nHe was arrested there a year earlier:69-year-old 'anarchist' shot, killed after attacking Washington migrant detention center\n\nStanford pediatrics professor Bonnie Halpern-Felsher said her research team found kids are “more addicted” to Juul than other products because the nicotine level in Juul pods is “astronomically high.” Juul pods contain 5% nicotine, whereas other pods before Juul’s introduction contained between roughly 1% and 2.4% on average, according to the Truth Initiative, a nonprofit dedicated to eradicating tobacco. The company has since introduced lower dosages with 3% nicotine for some of its flavors.\n\nJuul says its products are meant for adults, not minors like Grace. The company supports raising the minimum smoking age to 21 to keep teenagers from buying its e-cigarettes.\n\nYet Juul’s critics point to the company’s initial advertising campaign, which featured bright colors and young looking models, as evidence that Juul fueled the surge in teen vaping. Co-founder Adam Bowen said in retrospect the ads were “inappropriate.”\n\n“When we launched Juul, we had a campaign that was arguably too kind of lifestyle-oriented, too flashy,” he said. “It lasted less than six months. It was in the early days of the product introduction. We think it had no impact on sales.”\n\nHow the FDA is getting involved\n\nGottlieb, the former FDA commissioner, says the surge in teen vaping caught the FDA by surprise. While at the agency, Gottlieb delayed a key deadline that would have forced e-cigarettes to undergo FDA review by now and could have removed some from the market. He now isn’t sure if he made the right decision.\n\n“It’s a good question [whether the delay was a mistake], and it’s a question I get all the time,” Gottlieb said. “And we struggle with it.”\n\nAn alligator attacked his dog:So, the 75-year-old Florida man kicked it in the snout\n\nThe FDA review process calls for the agency to weigh the net public health benefit – meaning it needs to weigh how many adults will benefit from them versus how many teens might be harmed – when deciding whether to allow products to stay on the market.\n\nIn 2017, Gottlieb pushed the deadline to 2022 from 2018. After seeing the surge in teen use this fall, he had a change of heart. One of his last acts before stepping down in April was to move the deadline up by a year.\n\nThe courts may force the agency to work even faster. A federal judge agreed with public health groups that sued the FDA for shirking its public duty.\n\nSome say it’s too early to judge e-cigarettes because there isn’t enough data and they haven’t been around long enough to understand the effects of long-term use.\n\n“Frankly, we don’t know [the impact of chronic vaping] today,” Burns, the Juul CEO, said. “We have not done the long-term, longitudinal, clinical testing that we need to do.”\n\nDespite the unknowns, some researchers say e-cigarettes could help the U.S.′ 34.3 million smokers. Regulators in the U.K. are actively encouraging smokers to give up their cigarettes in favor of e-cigarettes, while the debate in the U.S. proves far more contentious.\n\n“Vaporized: America’s E-cigarette Addiction” airs on CNBC on Monday, July 15, at 10 p.m. EDT.\n\nDisclosure: Scott Gottlieb is a CNBC contributor.\n\n©CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe 118th Congress will begin on Tuesday, bringing in a new era of Republican control of the House and a high-stakes leadership fight that will determine who controls the speaker’s gavel.\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy has the support of a majority of Republicans to be the GOP leader but has so far not secured enough votes to become House speaker.\n\nWhat’s standing between McCarthy and the position he has long sought is a handful of conservative lawmakers. These conservatives, many members of the Freedom Caucus, don’t trust McCarthy and have not yet been convinced by him or those lobbying on his behalf, including former President Donald Trump, that McCarthy will appropriately stand up to Democrats and President Joe Biden.\n\nRepublicans will only have a slim majority – 222 Republicans compared with 212 Democrats – which means McCarthy can’t afford many defections if he is to find the 218 votes needed to make him speaker of the House.\n\nHow the day will unfold\n\nCongress can’t really function until it has a House speaker; the position is filled on the first day of a new Congress, January 3, even before members-elect take the oath of office.\n\nMembers will meet in the morning to tie off loose ends and close the 117th Congress. Then, at noon Eastern time, the clerk of the House will gavel in the new Congress and will call a quorum. The first major order of business will be the speaker election. Democrats will place Rep. Hakeem Jeffries’ name into nomination, and Republicans are set to place McCarthy’s name.\n\nThen the clerk will call the roll and each member will state the name of the person whom they are voting for. If no one amasses a majority of votes cast, it goes to a second ballot. If another ballot is needed, it is not clear if Congress will recess the chamber or if members will continue voting.\n\nMembers can vote for anyone they want\n\nThere’s no rule that the speaker is a House member. Members can vote for anyone, and they can protest by skipping the vote or voting “present.” The vast majority will vote for their party’s leader.\n\nBoth parties met last year to determine their leadership, with Democrats selecting Jeffries and Republicans agreeing to nominate McCarthy, but by a margin that signaled a possible floor fight ahead.\n\nMcCarthy faces a long-shot challenger: hard-right Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona. The challenge highlights the opposition McCarthy is up against and could draw votes away from him.\n\nIf no one wins a majority …\n\nLawmakers will continue voting until someone wins the majority. They can take successive votes on January 3. They can adjourn to horse trade and deal among themselves. But the House does not kick off the new Congress until a speaker is elected.\n\nThis is what people are talking about when they refer to a “floor fight.” It’s when House members require multiple ballots, or votes, to elect their speaker.\n\nIt’s been 100 years\n\nThe chamber of the House of Representatives is seen at the Capitol on February 28, 2022. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nIn the 200-plus years since the first two-year Congress met in 1789, such floor fights have occurred just 14 times, according to the House historian.\n\nAll but one of those multi-ballot speaker elections took place before the Civil War as the two-party system was evolving. Back then, floor fights were routine.\n\nA floor fight has only taken place once since the Civil War, exactly 100 years ago, when it took nine ballots for Rep. Frederick Gillett of Massachusetts to be elected speaker in 1923.\n\nThere is some mystery here\n\nPolitico notes it’s been so long that the exact procedure if no one has a majority is a smidge unclear. A Congressional Research Service brief on electing the speaker simply says that if no one gets a majority, the vote is repeated.\n\nThere have been exceptions to the majority vote\n\nWay back in 1849, the House had been in session so long without being able to elect a speaker – 19 days – that members voted to elect their speaker with a plurality rather than a majority. Members ultimately confirmed the plurality election with a majority vote.\n\nThe epic record for a floor fight\n\nIn 1855 and 1856, it took 133 separate votes for Rep. Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts to be elected, again by a plurality and not a majority.\n\nThe process stretched over more than a month and included a sort of inquisition on the House floor of the three contenders. They answered questions about their view of the expansion of slavery. Read more from the House historian’s website.\n\nIt’s also interesting to read about Banks; his official House biography notes he was elected to office as a Republican, an independent, a member of the America Party and as a Democrat.\n\nIt doesn’t always require 218 votes\n\nOne important thing to remember is that McCarthy does not technically need 218 votes to become speaker. A majority of those present and voting is required to get the speakership, which is usually 218 lawmakers. But if enough people skip the vote or vote “present,” the number of votes required for a majority can drop.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi was elected with 216 votes in 2021.\n\nFormer Speaker John Boehner won reelection to the post with 216 votes in 2015 after beating back a conservative rebellion like the one McCarthy is dealing with now.\n\nMost of the negotiation and arm-twisting happens long before the floor vote. Pelosi got 220 votes in 2019 after turning most of the fellow Democrats who opposed her. She did so by agreeing to serve only another few years as speaker, a pledge she kept by announcing her decision in November to not seek reelection for leadership.\n\nAbility to remove the speaker is a sticking point\n\nConservatives who oppose McCarthy have said they want to reinstate a dormant and arcane power to allow any member to call for a vote to remove the speaker at any time. Read more about the “motion to vacate.”\n\nRepublicans who oppose McCarthy see it as a tool for accountability. McCarthy and his allies see it as a recipe for bad governance if he is constantly at risk of losing the post that’s so difficult for him to attain.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

She then guided Democrats as they rode the waves of popular opinion, seeing their power swell to a 257-seat majority after the 2008 elections, ultimately crash to a 188-seat minority, and then rise once again.\n\nHer political career was marked by an extraordinary ability to understand and overcome those political shifts, keeping conflicting factions of her party united in passing major legislation. She earned the Speaker’s gavel twice – after the 2006 and 2018 elections – and lost it after the 2010 elections.\n\nOf late, she has conducted a string of accomplishments with one of the slimmest party splits in history, passing a $1.9 trillion pandemic aid package last year and a $750 billion health care, energy and climate bill in August.\n\nHer legislative victories in the Biden era cemented her reputation as one of the most successful party leaders in Congress. During the Obama administration, Pelosi was instrumental to the passage of the massive economic stimulus bill and the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which provides over 35 million Americans health care coverage.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the California liberal has been relentlessly attacked by Republicans, who portray her as the personification of a party for the coastal elite. “We have fired Nancy Pelosi,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Fox News on Wednesday, after Republicans won back the chamber.\n\nIn recent years, the anger directed toward her has turned menacing. During the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, pro-Trump rioters searched for her — and last month, a male assailant attacked Paul Pelosi, the speaker’s husband, with a hammer at the couple’s home in San Francisco, while she was in Washington.\n\nPelosi told CNN’s Anderson Cooper this month that her decision to retire would be influenced by the politically motivated attack. Paul Pelosi was released from the hospital two weeks ago after surgery to repair a skull fracture and injuries to his arm and hands.\n\nAfter thanking her colleagues for their well-wishes for Paul, the House chamber broke out into a standing ovation.\n\nDemocrats now look to finally choose Pelosi’s successor\n\nPelosi’s long reign became a source of tension within her own party. She won the gavel after the 2018 elections by promising her own party that she would leave her leadership post by 2022.\n\nMassachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, who previously tried to oust Pelosi, told CNN it’s time for a new chapter.\n\n“She’s a historic speaker who’s accomplished an incredible amount, but I also think there are a lot of Democrats ready for a new chapter,” said Moulton.\n\nBut some Democrats praised Pelosi and said they wished she would remain leader. Asked about her decision, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer clutched his chest and said he had pleaded with her to stay.\n\n“I told her when she called me and told me this and all that, I said ‘please change your mind. We need you here,’” Schumer said.\n\nHouse Democrats appear likely to choose New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, to succeed Pelosi as leader, though Democrats won’t vote until November 30.\n\nAfter her speech, Pelosi wouldn’t tell reporters who’d she support. But House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn announced they would also step down from their leadership posts, and endorsed Jeffries to succeed Pelosi. Hoyer said Jeffries “will make history for the institution of the House and for our country.” Clyburn added that he hoped Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar would join Jeffries in House Democratic leadership.\n\nBefore Pelosi’s announcement, Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, told CNN that she expects her caucus to throw their support behind Jeffries, and help him become the first Black House Democratic leader.\n\n“If she steps aside, I’m very clear that Hakeem Jeffries is the person that I will be voting for and leading the Congressional Black Caucus to vote for,” said Beatty.”I don’t always speak for everybody, but I’m very comfortable saying I believe that every member of the Congressional Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries.”\n\nRetiring North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield, a former CBC chairman, told CNN that Jeffries “is prepared for the moment” if Pelosi steps aside. Butterfield said he thought Jeffries would run.\n\nThe longtime Democratic leader told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday that members of her caucus had asked her to “consider” running in the party’s leadership elections at the end of the month, adding: “But, again, let’s just get through the election.”\n\nAny decision to run again, Pelosi said, “is about family, and also my colleagues and what we want to do is go forward in a very unified way, as we go forward to prepare for the Congress at hand.”\n\n“Nonetheless, a great deal is at stake because we’ll be in a presidential election. So my decision will again be rooted in the wishes of my family and the wishes of my caucus,” she continued. “But none of it will be very much considered until we see what the outcome of all of this is. And there are all kinds of ways to exert influence.”\n\nPelosi is a towering figure in American politics with a history-making legacy of shattering glass ceilings as the first and so far only woman to be speaker of the US House of Representatives.\n\nPelosi was first elected to the House in 1987, when she won a special election to fill a seat representing California’s 5th Congressional District.\n\nWhen she was first elected speaker, Pelosi reflected on the significance of the event and what it meant for women in the United States.\n\n“This is an historic moment,” she said in a speech after accepting the speaker’s gavel. “It’s an historic moment for the Congress. It’s an historic moment for the women of America.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.", "authors": ["Alex Rogers Annie Grayer Manu Raju", "Alex Rogers", "Annie Grayer", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/gallery/kevin-mccarthy/index.html", "title": "Photos: Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy | CNN Politics", "text": "The US House of Representatives voted Tuesday to oust Kevin McCarthy as speaker — a historic moment that threatens to plunge House Republicans even further into chaos and turmoil.\n\nNo House speaker has ever before been ousted through the passage of a resolution to remove them.\n\nThe effort to push McCarthy out comes as a bloc of hardline conservatives have continued to thwart him, voting against key priorities of GOP leadership and repeatedly throwing up roadblocks to the speaker's agenda.\n\nMcCarthy is denying reports that he is expected to step down from Congress before the end of his term — telling reporters on Friday that he still has \"work to do.\"\n\nMcCarthy was elected as speaker in January after a historic stalemate that involved 15 rounds of voting over five days.

Marjorie Taylor Greene called her party’s inability to pick a speaker “embarrassing.”\n\n“I hope it’s over soon because, to be honest with you, I find it embarrassing,” Greene told reporters on her way back to the House floor.\n\nGreene also gave credit to Democrats for being able to work together, saying that she thinks the GOP “should find ways to work together.”\n\n- Sarah Elbeshbishi\n\nCammack says it’s “Groundhog Day” as she nominates McCarthy\n\nGOP Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida called it “Groundhog Day” as she nominated House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy for speaker – his sixth nomination in two days.\n\nShe said the American people don’t care about who’s going to be speaker; they care about getting results to problems, such as the ongoing opioid crisis and “open border.”\n\n“They didn’t send us to be perpetual critics,” Cammack said. “They sent us to get things done.”\n\nIt’s time to unite and do the people’s business, she said.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nQuest for the gavel:Kevin McCarthy was once rejected for a House internship. Now he could become the next speaker\n\nNo change for McCarthy on the fifth ballot\n\nThe fifth ballot went the same as the fourth, according to the official House tally: McCarthy again won 201 votes, well short of the 218 he needs to become speaker.\n\nAgain, 20 Republicans voted for a non-McCarthy alternative, Byron Donalds.\n\nAgain, former McCarthy supporter Victoria Spartz voted \"present.\"\n\nAnd, again, Hakeem Jeffries racked up 212 votes from fellow Democrats.\n\nOn toward a sixth ballot.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nCould Jeffries win the speakership?\n\nJeffries has consistently received 212 votes in each of the ballots—gaining the support of every Democrat in the House and surpassing the number of ballots for McCarthy. But it is highly unlikely that Jeffries would win the speakership.\n\nIt would require a member, or multiple members, of the Republican party to reach across the aisle and cast a ballot in support of the opposite party.\n\nThe last time a lawmaker voted for the opposite political party was in 2001. Democratic Rep. Jim Traficant from Ohio voted for the Republican speaker nominee. The Democratic party stripped him of all committee assignments in response.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWho is Hakeem Jeffries?:What to know about the Brooklyn Rep. nominated for Congress\n\nDonalds: ‘I never came here to try to be speaker’\n\nFlorida Rep. Byron Donalds, who received 20 votes in the last ballot, said he expects the speaker to be elected today, but added that serving in the top leadership position was never his intention. He said he anticipates meeting with McCarthy later today.\n\n“I didn’t come to DC being interested in becoming speaker of the House,” he said, adding, however, that he understands the responsibility of making sure the Republican conference can govern. “I’m going to help do that in any way I can,” he said.\n\n“The time of leadership by acclamation, those days are over,” he said.\n\n-- Rachel Looker\n\nMcCarthy appears to lose fifth vote\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy appears to have lost his bid for speaker a fifth consecutive time, continuing a string of stinging defeats and a tumultuous day in the lower chamber.\n\nMcCarthy lost three times Tuesday and twice so far Wednesday. There could be more votes this afternoon, as no member in either party has motioned to adjourn.\n\nBefore the fifth vote, multiple McCarthy allies worked to end the impasse with his 20 detractors, but the count proved out of their favor.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nWho is McCarthy?:Kevin McCarthy was once rejected for a House internship. Now he could become the next speaker\n\nWho voted present today on the fourth ballot?\n\nOn the fourth ballot for speaker, Indiana Republican Rep. Victoria Spartz opted to vote “present” after backing McCarthy in the previous three ballots, in another blow to McCarthy’s chances of securing the speakership.\n\n“We have a constitutional duty to elect the speaker of the House, but we have to deliberate further as a Republican conference until we have enough votes and stop wasting everyone’s time.” Spartz said. “None of the Republican candidates have this number yet. That’s why I voted present after all votes were cast.”\n\nNo member from McCarthy’s opposition has yet to flip and vote for McCarthy as speaker.\n\n-- Ken Tran\n\nA new Congress with new priorities:What to know on investigations, the fate of Biden's agenda and more\n\nTrump has been calling GOP lawmakers to urge support for McCarthy, Boebert says\n\nGOP Rep. Lauren Boebert in her nominating remarks shook off Trump’s endorsement of McCarthy.\n\n“Let’s stop with the campaign smears and tactics to get people to turn against us,” said Boebert. “Even having my favorite president call us and tell us we need to knock this off, I think it actually needs to be reversed.”\n\n“The president needs to tell Kevin McCarthy, ‘Sir you do not have the votes and it’s time to withdraw.’” said Boebert to cheers from McCarthy’s opposition.\n\n-- Ken Tran\n\nThrowback:Lawmakers sound off on recorded call of Kevin McCarthy saying Trump should resign over Jan. 6\n\nBoebert nominates Donalds\n\nRep.

Warren Davidson, an Ohio Republican who took former Speaker John Boehner’s seat, nominated Rep. Kevin McCarthy Wednesday immediately following the House GOP leader’s fourth loss for speaker.\n\nDavidson pointed out that there may be some members who don’t trust McCarthy, but said there are about 200 members who don’t trust the leader’s 20 detractors.\n\nAfter rattling off a list of concessions he said McCarthy has made to those voting against him, Davidson said, “Kevin McCarthy engaged in that negotiation. He led the Congress to adopt substantive reforms that will make our majority more effective.”\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nRound four: Another loss for McCarthy\n\nThe fourth ballot, the first of Wednesday, went a little worse for McCarthy.\n\nThe struggling speaker candidate officially wound up with only 201 votes, fewer than the numbers he took on the three ballots on Tuesday, according to the House clerk. One of his previous supporters, Victoria Spartz of Indiana, voted \"present\" on Wednesday.\n\nMcCarthy needs 218 votes to win the speaker's job, and he is moving a little farther away.\n\nThis despite a morning endorsement from Donald Trump and heavy lobbying from allies who say all this is making the Republicans look bad.\n\nDespite the pressure, McCarthy opponents who supported Jim Jordan for speaker on Monday backed a new challenger on Tuesday, Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida. He received 20 votes, the same number Jordan got on Tuesday's third ballot.\n\nThe stalemate again allowed Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries to become the top vote getter with 212 Democrats, but without the majority needed to prevail.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhat's happening in the House:Who are the Republicans balking at Kevin McCarthy as a House speaker?\n\nMcCarthy appears to lose fourth ballot\n\nThe outlook for Kevin McCarthy grew dimmer Wednesday afternoon when the House GOP leader appeared to have lost his bid for speaker a fourth consecutive time.\n\nIt was a crucial vote for McCarthy, who after losing three times yesterday worked to find a path forward today. He and his allies have tried to both sway his opponents and also persuade some of them to vote “present,” making it easier for him to win with a lower voting majority.\n\nOn Wednesday, it was evident McCarthy did little to advance when he did not pick up any votes.\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nGallagher nominates McCarthy for speaker\n\nRep. Mike Gallagher. a Wisconsin Republican, nominated House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy for speaker – his fourth nomination in two days.\n\n“I wish we had a bigger majority,” Gallagher said, “but the American people gave us an opportunity.”\n\nMcCarthy is not asking for a vote to keep business as usual, Gallagher said. The leader wants to do the people’s business, he said.\n\nGaetz challenges McCarthy over office space\n\nIt's really gotten personal between aspiring House Speaker McCarthy and conservative critic Matt Gaetz.\n\nGaetz has asked the Architect of the Capitol to investigate McCarthy for moving stuff into the Speaker of the House's suite of offices, even though he failed to actually win the job during three ballots on Tuesday.\n\n\"How long will he remain there before he is considered a squatter?\" the Florida Republican said in a letter to the architect's office.\n\nAnother McCarthy opponent, Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, re-tweeted Gaetz's complaint and amplified the itinerant metaphor: \"McCarthy is squatting in the Speaker’s office.\"\n\nFor his part, McCarthy and his allies have criticized Gaetz for saying he would rather see Democrat Hakeem Jeffries win the speaker's job than McCarthy.\n\nStay tuned for more news about McCarthy's political future – and his office.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMike Pence chimes in, urges House GOP to elect McCarthy as speaker\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence offered his perspective on McCarthy’s battle, urging House Republicans “to support my friend, Kevin McCarthy as the next speaker of the House.”\n\n“@GOPLeader’s (McCarthy's) leadership & vision led to the new Republican majority & I know Speaker McCarthy will lead the House to begin a great American comeback!” Pence tweeted.\n\n-- Ken Tran\n\nAguilar: ‘Crisis of the Congress’\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar of California, the House Democratic Caucus chair, reiterated support for Jeffries Wednesday morning and said he will be nominating Jeffries during the speaker votes this afternoon. All 212 Democrats voted for Jeffries Tuesday during the three ballots.\n\n“This is a crisis of the congress,” Aguilar said of yesterday’s proceedings.\n\nHe added that Democrats have not had any outreach with their colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Ted Lieu said the speakership position has already weakened from the inability of the Republican caucus to unite and select a speaker, noting that Democrats are also at a standstill and can’t appoint members to committees.\n\n“They’ve already weakened that position,” Lieu said of the speakership, referencing McCarthy’s concessions including the motion to vacate.\n\n- Rachel Looker and Sarah Elbeshbishi\n\n'The rest of the world is looking': Biden calls GOP House speaker fight ‘embarrassing’\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Republicans’ fight over electing a new House speaker “embarrassing,” “not a good look” and “not my problem” as he sought to contrast the chaos in House with a focus on governing.\n\n“I hope they get their act together,” Biden told reporters Wednesday, adding that “the rest of the world is looking” and he is focused on “getting things done.”\n\nBiden, speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, was en route to Kentucky. There he will appear with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and other officeholders of both parties to promote bipartanship by showcasing a major bridge project funded by federal infrastructure dollars.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nGaetz: Trump won't change my mind about opposing McCarthy\n\nMatt Gaetz, an outspoken supporter of Donald Trump, is saying Trump's endorsement of McCarthy won't shake his opposition to the latter's candidacy for House speaker.\n\n\"Sad!\" Gaetz said in a Wednesday statement to Fox News Digital. \"This changes neither my view of McCarthy nor Trump nor my vote.\"\n\nIn a Truth Social post hours earlier, Trump hit the all-caps button to say to Republican dissidents: \"VOTE FOR KEVIN, CLOSE THE DEAL, TAKE THE VICTORY.\"\n\nGaetz is especially close to Trump; he once endorsed Trump himself for the speaker's job. If Trump can't change his mind, it's hard to see many of the 20 or so opponents of McCarthy changing theirs.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhat about George Santos?\n\nAs if the GOP didn't have enough distractions.\n\nRep.-elect George Santos, of New York, has been embroiled in controversy after reports found he made up multiple parts of his biography during the 2022 midterm campaign.\n\nThe 34-year-old Republican, who is under investigation by New York prosecutors, admitted he lied about his educational achievements, his ancestry and his employment. He was in the chamber Tuesday for the speaker vote and is expected to be there Wednesday.\n\nOn the first three ballots, Santos voted for McCarthy. Like all other members of the House, he can take part in the vote for speaker though he won't be sworn in until after one is chosen.\n\nTrump calls for members to vote for McCarthy\n\nIn a new Truth Social post Wednesday morning, Former President Donald Trump called on Republican House members to support Kevin McCarthy.\n\n“Vote for Kevin, close the deal, take the victory,” Trump said in all caps.\n\nHe urged Republicans: “Do not turn a great triumph into a giant & embarrassing defeat.”\n\nTrump said it’s time to celebrate, seemingly referring to the GOP’s four-vote majority in the House.\n\n“Kevin McCarthy will do a good job, and maybe even a great job – just watch!” he said in closing.\n\nMcCarthy’s most fervent opponents are some of Trump’s biggest supporters. It remains to be seen if they will be swayed by his endorsement Wednesday morning.\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nWhat to expect today\n\nThe House formally gavels in at noon, but both Republicans and Democrats will be meeting throughout the morning.\n\nOn the Republican side, Rep. Kevin McCarthy and his allies are working on two fronts: they are trying to negotiate with his detractors to sway their votes to his side and they’re also trying to get some members to vote “present” rather than for a named candidate. Voting present would ultimately help McCarthy boost his numbers and lower the threshold for which he needs to become speaker.\n\nOn the Democratic side, House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar and Vice Chair Ted Lieu will hold a press conference at 10:45 a.m. after their closed caucus meeting that starts at 9 a.m. Look for Democrats to take questions on whether they will help Republicans by having some members absent from the chamber today, lowering the overall voting majority and number McCarthy would need to clinch the speakership.\n\nLast night, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said his caucus is focused on having a working partnership with Republicans to pass bipartisan legislation, but they’re not responsible for helping the GOP get organized.\n\nOnce the House gavels in at noon, members-elect could choose to vote again for speaker or adjourn again to allow for more negotiations.\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nWhat changed overnight?\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy is shifting his strategy to become speaker of the House – or at least he’s shifting the way he’s talking about it.\n\nWhen a confident, almost defiant, McCarthy spoke during and after a Republican conference meeting Tuesday morning, he had said he wasn’t making any more concessions to appease the most conservative flank of his party and that he had “earned” the speakership.\n\nBy Tuesday night at the Capitol, after he had lost three votes to become speaker, he said he wanted all views to be represented on House committees and that negotiations were ongoing between his more than 200 supporters and 20 detractors.\n\nMcCarthy also said he had a new path to the speakership. Rather than focusing on the 218 votes needed to win the speakership outright, he mentioned 11 votes last night he needs to flip. A lot of that strategy involves getting some of his 20 dissenters to vote “present” rather than for a named candidate, which would allow him to win the speakership with a lower majority of votes.\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nWhat could happen next?\n\nMembers will continue to vote — again and again potentially when they come back at noon. The vote could last for days, weeks or months until a speaker candidate receives enough votes. This leaves the House paralyzed since no member can be sworn in, no rules can be adopted and no legislative business can be conducted until a speaker is chosen\n\nMcCarthy could drop out of the race for speaker, leaving an opening for another Republican to win the speakership. As of Tuesday afternoon, no McCarthy challengers have come close to gaining enough votes to win the speakership. During the three ballots, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, former New York Rep. Lee Zeldin and New York Rep. Byron Donalds received votes.\n\nAs a last resort, lawmakers could adopt a resolution that would elect a speaker by a plurality or by rank-choice voting instead of a simple majority.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nMore:McCarthy denied, Santos in House: 5 takeaways from the tumultuous first day of a new Congress\n\nMore:What can Congress do about Rep.-elect George Santos, who lied ahead of winning his election?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/01/02/house-speaker-vote-explained/10912271002/", "title": "How the House picks a speaker: What happens after McCarthy loses?", "text": "The first day of the 118th Congress ended Tuesday without a new House speaker. Voting resumed Wednesday – and still no speaker.\n\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy failed to secure enough votes to become speaker of the House on six ballotsover both days, heightening tumult around the new GOP majority. For the first time in a century, the House was unable to pick a speaker on the first vote.\n\nThe speaker is the most powerful role in Congress, in line behind the vice president to succeed the president should the commander in chief be incapacitated. But the more immediate and prominent authority the speaker wields is controlling the agenda and committee assignments that shape legislation in the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nWhen Republicans took the majority in November's midterm elections, McCarthy became the top contender for the speakership after GOP lawmakers elected to keep him last month as head of the caucus. But a faction of the party balked at giving him the support he would need to secure the position.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., challenged McCarthy for the powerful leadership role and earned 10 votes on the first ballot Tuesday. By Wednesday, Biggs appeared to be out of the running for the gavel as did Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, who received 20 votes on the third ballot. Florida GOP Rep. Byron Donalds became the McCarthy alternative, earning 20 votes on the fourth, fifth and sixth ballots.\n\nIn contrast, every one of the 212 elected Democrats voted for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, leader of the House Democrats, in all six rounds.\n\nMcCarthy allies — who outnumber the “never Kevin” bloc — have said they aren’t budging in supporting “only Kevin.”\n\nStay in the conversation on politics: Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nMore:Kevin McCarthy’s race for speaker risks upending the House of Representatives\n\nThe speaker of the House is the only political position in the House elected by all its members. Here's how the election works and what could happen if McCarthy does not reach the vote threshold needed for the speakership.\n\nHow does the speaker vote process begin?\n\nPrior the start of a new Congress, both parties hold a private meeting where they elect the party leadership for the next Congress. This takes place before Jan. 3, the official start of the new term when all House members vote for the speaker.\n\nA candidate only needs a majority of votes from their respective party to win the endorsement in the private meeting for leadership.\n\nEven if a colleague votes against a candidate in the private caucus meeting, the party typically sticks together to back their nominee on the House floor in January, according to Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Government Affairs Institute.\n\nMore:A poor GOP showing in the midterms could hamper Kevin McCarthy's path to be House speaker\n\nHowever, when the whole House votes, anyone can be nominated. And just a few votes in opposition to a candidate from their own party could cost them the speakership if the majority is narrow as is the case with the Republicans: as few as five GOP House members could block the party leader from winning the gavel.\n\n\"Which creates a scenario where people could dissent, a very small faction could stop you from winning on the floor in your own party,\" Glassman said.\n\nHow is the speaker vote held?\n\nThe clerk of the House from the prior Congress gavels in the opening session and presides as speaker until one is elected.\n\nThe clerk first calls for a quorum to establish that enough members are present to conduct business and then proceeds immediately to the speaker election – before the swearing in of newly elected members.\n\nThe clerk calls lawmakers in alphabetical order by last name who then announce their choice for speaker by calling out the last name of the candidate. This differs from the usual electronic voting conducted in the House on legislation.\n\nCandidates for speaker are nominated from the floor by members of their parties. There is always one Democratic nominee and one Republican, but the speaker does not have to be a member of the majority party or even a member of Congress.\n\nHow many votes are needed to be chosen as Speaker?\n\nThe magic number is 218 – kind of.\n\nA candidate requires votes from a majority of lawmakers who are voting to be elected speaker. That means if all 435 members are present and voting, the number of votes needed is 218.\n\nBut lawmakers can decide to skip the vote, or vote \"present,\" which reduces the vote threshold needed to win the speakership. Speakers Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and John Boehner, R-Ohio, both won the speakership without reaching 218 votes.\n\nMore:Kevin McCarthy wants to block three Democrats from committees if he becomes House speaker\n\nIn the new Congress, all 434 members (one fewer than 435 because Virginia Rep. Donald McEachin recently died and a successor has yet to be chosen) can vote. If the results, for example, are: 216 votes for McCarthy, 212 for a Democratic candidate and 6 representatives vote for someone else, the 216 votes would not be the majority of 434 needed for the speakership. McCarthy would come up short.\n\nHowever, if those six representatives do not vote for someone else, they don't count toward the total votes needed. This lowers the threshold to 428, meaning a 216 vote could secure the speakership for McCarthy.\n\nGlassman said this is often used as a tactic by speaker candidates who convince their colleagues to, in essence, abstain as a compromise between voting for another candidate and supporting their candidacy.\n\n\"That's certainly a viable strategy,\" he said.\n\nWhat happens if a candidate doesn't get the majority of votes?\n\nIf the first ballot fails to provide a speaker, lawmakers will continue to vote until a candidate receives a majority. Members can vote for different candidates each ballot.\n\nIt's not common that there is more than one ballot, but it has happened.\n\nIn 1923, it took multiple ballots – nine – to elect a speaker. On three occasions prior to the Civil War, a speaker was not elected on the first ballot. In one instance, it took 133 ballots over a period of two months.\n\nAs a last resort, lawmakers can adopt a resolution that would elect a speaker by a plurality or by rank-choice voting instead of a simple majority.\n\nGlassman said McCarthy needs at least 213 votes because the 212 House Democrats are likely going to all back their party leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Of the remaining nine GOP lawmakers who have expressed reservations about supporting McCarthy, the California Republican will need some combination of votes for him, \"present\" vote or no votes.\n\n\"The important thing functionally is nothing else happens in the House until they have a speaker,\" Glassman said, adding that the House won't be able to adopt rules, assign committees or consider legislation until the speaker is chosen.\n\nHow do members typically vote?\n\nLawmakers traditionally vote for their party's nominee, but some in recent years have chosen to vote \"present\" or not vote.\n\n\"This is sort of a modern thing in the last 10 years,\" Glassman said. \"We've had members of the majority party threatening not to vote for their party's nominee on the floor.\"\n\nHe cites one reason as the current media environment where outliers realize they can gain attention from opposing a speaker nominee and separate themselves from the leadership to appeal to voters.\n\nMore:Nancy Pelosi's legacy: 'A troublemaker with a gavel' leaves her mark, from health care to impeachment\n\n\"It's a way to stand out,\" he said.\n\nThe last to vote for the opposite political party was Democratic Rep. Jim Traficant from Ohio. He voted in 2001 for the Republican speaker nominee and faced severe consequences: Democrats stripped him of his committee assignments.\n\nHow will this play out for McCarthy?\n\nA two-month speakership election is not likely.\n\nMcCarthy won the closed-door vote leadership election, and by wide margins, after facing challenger Biggs, the Republican of Arizona and a member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe votes on Tuesday and Wednesday, which included all members of the House and not just the Republican party, have yet to put McCarthy – or anyone else – over the vote threshold to win the speakership.\n\nThe speaker vote could play out in a few ways.\n\nMembers will continue to vote for days, weeks or months until a speaker candidate receives enough votes, which means no other legislative business will be conducted and members will not be officially sworn in.\n\nOne option for McCarthy is to continue to try to bargain with his colleagues to gain enough votes, though that hasn't worked so far. He could also drop out of the race for speaker, leaving an opening for another Republican to win the gavel.\n\nDespite the repeated ballots, no McCarthy challengers have come close to gaining the majority of votes for the gavel.\n\n\"If none of those things happen, then you're in for a real chaos situation because then you have to try to find candidates somewhere in the party who weren't even on the radar screen,\" Glassman said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2023/10/09/historic-mccarthy-ouster-leaves-house-speaker-position-empty-whats-next/71051433007/", "title": "Chaos and uncertainty: What's next for the speaker of the House race?", "text": "The U.S. House of Representatives has plunged into chaos and uncertainty after the historic ousting of Rep.

Andy Biggs of Arizona, a conservative hardliner who is challenging McCarthy to be the most powerful member of Congress, doubled down on his commitment to stop the California Republican’s ascension.\n\n“I’m not bluffing,” Biggs told CNN on Thursday when asked if he would drop out.\n\nWith the increasing likelihood that the speaker’s race could go to multiple ballots – something that hasn’t happened since 1923 – McCarthy’s allies and foes alike are starting to quietly game out the next steps if he can’t get the necessary 218 votes on the first round and they move into uncharted territory.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Bash asks Pelosi if McCarthy has what it takes to be House Speaker. See her response 02:37 - Source: CNN\n\nMcCarthy’s supporters are vowing to keep voting for him on multiple ballots, and GOP sources said there are early discussions about a floor strategy for that potential scenario, including whether to recess the House or let the votes keep rolling – no matter how long it takes.\n\nTo prevent that from happening, McCarthy and his team have been engaged in serious talks with a group of conservatives, including over potentially giving them influential committee assignments and more power to drive the legislative process. GOP sources said those negotiations are still early in the process and could ultimately end up giving the group some aspect of what the hardliners desperately want: additional power to seek a sitting speaker’s ouster with a vote on the floor.\n\nAsked if he would drop out of the race if he doesn’t get 218 votes on the first ballot, Biggs refused to say.\n\n“I’m not going to talk about hypotheticals,” said Biggs, who lost his conference’s nomination to become speaker last month after securing 31 votes.\n\nBut in the case of a doomsday scenario – where neither McCarthy nor Biggs can get 218 votes on January 3 and neither drops out – some pro-McCarthy Republicans are signaling support for a different approach. Some said they would be willing to work with Democrats to find a moderate Republican who can get the 218 votes to clinch the gavel – a long-shot idea that underscores the uncertainty looming over the speaker’s race.\n\n“Our initial plan is vote for Kevin and let him fight this out repeatedly. … But if they think they’re going to use this to infinity to drive him out, well, we’re not going to bend to their will,” said Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican.\n\nBacon added if GOP hardliners don’t bend, then he would be willing to work with Democrats to find another more moderate Republican to secure the 218 votes to become speaker.\n\n“If a small group refuses to play ball and be part of the team, then we’ll work across the aisle to find an agreeable Republican,” Bacon said. “But I hope we don’t get there.”\n\nMcCarthy’s detractors don’t buy it.\n\n“There are very significant rules, changes being discussed that would open the House up, that would be transformative, that would give us the ability to actually legislate and represent our constituents,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Republican from Florida who said he’s a “hard no” on McCarthy. “And whoever is speaker is going to have to agree to those rules, I think. And I don’t think that person will be Kevin McCarthy because Kevin McCarthy won’t have 218 votes.”\n\nGaetz added: “I think the person who is ultimately going to be the speaker isn’t even the candidate yet.”\n\nIndeed, the small group of Republicans known as the “Never Kevin” movement – confident that Biggs could not win a majority of the House – has been trying to recruit a viable alternative, and claim “several” Republicans have privately told them they would be interested in running if McCarthy drops out. Their goal with voting for Biggs is to show that McCarthy is weak on the first ballot, which they hope would inspire other candidates to jump in.\n\n“How many members vote for someone else will show the strength (of the anti-McCarthy group),” Rep. Bob Good, a Virginia Republican who is a “hard no” on McCarthy, told CNN. “I think the second ballot is going to have more candidates. … There are already Republicans letting us know they’d like to be considered.”\n\nEven House Republicans who are supporting McCarthy predicted that a number of lawmakers would run if McCarthy withdrew his name, with some saying that House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, McCarthy’s top deputy, would emerge as the front runner in that case.\n\n“If at some point, if Kevin did take his name out, then you would have good people (running). Scalise would probably be the guy,” one GOP lawmaker said.\n\nScalise has repeatedly vowed to support McCarthy and refused to speculate on whether he would jump into the race if the GOP leader can’t get the votes.\n\n“No, I’m not going to get into speculation,” Scalise told CNN. “Obviously, our focus is on getting it resolved by January 3. And there’s a lot of conversations that everybody has been having, Kevin, surely, with the members who have expressed concerns.”\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, the conservative set to become the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, went even further, ruling out jumping into the race even though Gaetz and other hardliners have urged him to seek the speakership.\n\n“No,” Jordan said when asked if he’d run if McCarthy couldn’t get the votes. “I want to chair the Judiciary Committee.”\n\nMcCarthy’s weighs more concessions\n\nWith 222 GOP seats next year, McCarthy can only afford to lose four Republican votes and still win the speakership. But he and his team are still hopeful he can win on the first round as he has been working both publicly and privately to win over holdouts. So far, at least five Republicans have promised to oppose him on the floor – but in a positive sign for McCarthy, one of them has shown he’s gettable.\n\n“I will vote for Andy for speaker, subject to what we’re discussing,” said Rep. Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican after leaving a meeting in McCarthy’s office on Wednesday. He later added: “All this is positive. We’re having good change, regardless of what happens. And you’ll see more of it.”\n\nIn addition to those five, a new group of seven Republican hardliners on Thursday laid out a list of conditions to earn their vote, although they did not specifically threaten to vote against McCarthy if their demands aren’t met.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback GOP lawmaker explains why he won't vote for McCarthy to become House Speaker 03:08 - Source: CNN\n\nTheir list of demands – which shows the work McCarthy needs to do to get to 218 – includes a promise that leaders won’t play in primaries, restoring the motion to vacate the speaker’s chair, placing more conservatives on key committees, giving members at least 72 hours to read bill text before a vote, and committing to using the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip to demand more spending cuts, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN.\n\nMcCarthy has already begun brokering some rules changes to empower rank-and-file members, created a new select committee on China, vowed to boot some Democratic lawmakers from their committees, and sketched out in greater detail his investigative plans – including a potential impeachment inquiry into Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nBut McCarthy still has additional levers he could pull. Conservative hardliners are pushing for more representation on the powerful House Rules Committee, a leadership-aligned panel that decides how and when bills come to the floor. In one private meeting with a member of the House Freedom Caucus, McCarthy was urged to take a harder public stance on the coming policy issues for next year, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAnd the anti-McCarthy group is also still pressing for a process that would allow any single member to hold a floor vote on ousting the sitting speaker, which was wielded over former Speaker John Boehner before he was forced out of the job by the far right in 2015.\n\nMcCarthy has been adamantly opposed to restoring the “motion to vacate the chair,” and a majority of the House GOP voted against the idea during a during a closed-door meeting last month. When asked by CNN on Thursday if he would visit the issue, McCarthy laughed and refused to answer.\n\nBut McCarthy’s detractors said it’s an issue very much still on the table and think he may end up needing to embrace it if he still doesn’t have the speaker votes by January 3. GOP sources told CNN there’s potential room to negotiate to give members more power to call for a vote to oust the speaker – perhaps by allowing the vote to occur if a certain number of members call for one, rather than allowing a single lawmaker to call for a vote as the hardliners want.\n\n“A competent secure leader is not threatened by (the motion to vacate),” Good said. “And so, yeah, that I think that’s central to many members.”\n\nYet others said what Good and his allies are seeking is a recipe for chaos — and are calling on their colleagues to fall in line.\n\n“I think that’s one of the reasons that we didn’t see a red wave … the idea that people are sick and tired of the noise, and they’re sick and tired of the fighting,” Rep. David Joyce, an Ohio Republican, said of the impact of a January 3 floor fight. “And I know I get that wherever I go in my district is, ‘why can’t you guys just get things done?’”\n\nAs McCarthy scrambles to lock down speaker’s votes, he also delayed the GOP’s internal elections for committee chairmanships. There was some speculation that one of the members competing for a gavel, Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida, may retire early if he doesn’t win, which would make McCarthy’s math problem even tougher. But Buchanan vehemently disputed the notion.\n\n“It’s ridiculous, laughable,” he told reporters. “I’m doing everything I can to help get Kevin to 218.”\n\nMcCarthy could also try to convince Democrats or his GOP detractors to vote present or not show up to the floor proceedings, which would lower the threshold he needs to become speaker. But McCarthy promised his GOP colleagues he would not court Democratic votes.\n\nCould Democrats join Republicans and select a speaker?\n\nIn recent weeks, part of McCarthy’s pitch to his critics has been warning that if they don’t unify, then Democrats could theoretically band together and peel off a few Republicans to elect the next speaker.\n\nSome Democrats have said they would entertain the idea, including Rep. Henry Cuellar, a moderate Democrat from Texas who told CNN some of his GOP colleagues have approached him “informally” about it.\n\nJoyce also said some members have reached out to him about potentially running, but he dismissed it. “At the end of the day, Kevin’s going to be the new speaker.”\n\nNew York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the next House Democratic leader, said, “there are no behind-the-scenes conversations” that he has had with Republicans to put up an alternative candidate. But he refused to rule out a scenario where his caucus would help elect the next speaker if McCarthy couldn’t get the votes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear if Hakeem Jeffries would be willing to help Kevin McCarthy 02:25 - Source: CNN\n\n“Democrats are in the process of organizing the Democratic Conference,” Jeffries told CNN on Thursday. “Republicans are in the process of organizing the Republican Conference. Let’s see what happens on January 3.”\n\nSome of the potential consensus picks that have been floated included retiring Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan and John Katko of New York, who both voted to impeach Donald Trump for inciting the Capitol insurrection; Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus; and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, a veteran lawmaker and incoming head of the House Rules Committee.\n\nBut that would require agreement from every single Democrat and the help of five Republicans – no easy feat. Upton said he has no plans to be in Washington that day, telling CNN: “I’ll be skiing.”\n\nAnd progressives like Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York said they would never vote for a GOP speaker candidate, no matter how moderate.\n\n“No,” Bowman said, indicating he’d be voting for Jeffries on every ballot on January 3. “It’s going to be Hakeem.”\n\nBut Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman said this has happened before – nearly a decade ago in his state where minority Democrats in the Arkansas legislature joined forces with a handful of Republicans to elect a GOP speaker of their choice. Westerman privately made this case to his colleagues at a closed-door meeting this week.\n\n“I’m concerned about January 3 getting here and us not being able to form a Congress and organize committees and getting delayed in pushing the policy objectives that we want to push,” Westerman said.\n\nWesterman added that the discussion over changing House rules is good for the party. But he added: “I’m not really excited about any type of destructive movement.”", "authors": ["Manu Raju Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/01/05/who-byron-donalds/10990464002/", "title": "Who is Byron Donalds?

Here's what you need to know about his views and political profile.\n\nLive updates:'Groundhog Day': House voting in round six for speaker after Kevin McCarthy loses again\n\nWho is Byron Donalds?\n\nRepresentative Byron Donalds serves District 19 in Southwest Florida.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, he moved to the Sunshine State for college, originally attending Florida A&M before transferring to Florida State University where he graduated with a degree in finance. Post-grad Donalds worked at TIB Bank, CMG Life Services and Moran Wealth in Naples.\n\nHe was elected to the Florida State House of Representatives in 2016, then later to the House in 2020. During that race, Donalds beat out six better-funded Republican opponents in his primary, securing a narrow victory.\n\nOne of two Black Republicans in the House, 44-year-old Donalds would make history were he elected, becoming the first Black speaker of the house.\n\nWhat are Byron Donalds political views?\n\nDonalds is a fierce conservative, known for his strong views on the importance of small government. Upon his election to Congress, Donalds aligned himself with what he called the 'Freedom Force' -- a conservative cadre seemingly formed in contrast to the Democrat's progressive 'Squad.'\n\nDonalds is a staunch supporter of the second amendment, stating on his website: \"I have proudly stood against misguided gun control legislation that infringes upon your rights throughout my public service career.\"\n\nDonalds has also championed school choice over the years, making it a key issue during both his time in the state and national legislatures.\n\nHe falls squarely in the pro-life camp and has been vocal in his opposition to abortion. \"Every life is valuable, from conception to natural death, and I will fight to protect the life of every unborn child without exception,\" his campaign materials read.\n\nThough Donalds had demonstrated fealty to former President Donald Trump in the past, even earning an endorsement during his 2020 campaign, some speculate he may not be a MAGA purist as he did not endorse Trump for a presidential run in 2024.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/politics/andy-biggs-running-for-speaker/index.html", "title": "Andy Biggs: Arizona Republican announces run for House speaker ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy’s bid for the speakership grew more complicated on Tuesday after a hard-right Republican announced his bid for the gavel next month, a move that could set off a messy floor fight and leave their party without a candidate who can win the 218 votes needed to become speaker.\n\nDespite losing the House GOP Conference’s nomination to be speaker last month, Rep. Andy Biggs, the hard-right Arizona Republican and one-time leader of the House Freedom Caucus, announced he will be a candidate for the speakership when the full House votes on January 3.\n\n“I’m running for Speaker to break the establishment,” Biggs wrote on Twitter. “Kevin McCarthy was created by, elevated by, and maintained by the establishment.”\n\nTo become elected speaker, McCarthy can only afford to lose four votes when the House meets next month. Last month when he defeated Biggs for his party’s nomination, McCarthy lost 31 votes despite winning 188. Now with Biggs’ candidacy, McCarthy detractors can vote for an alternative to run the new House, which will have 222 GOP seats.\n\nIf McCarthy can’t win 218 votes on the first ballot, it will go to multiple ballots until someone does – something that hasn’t happened in about a century.\n\nSteve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, told CNN he won’t speculate about the possibility that he could emerge as a candidate for speaker on January 3 if McCarthy can’t get 218 votes to win the gavel.\n\n“No, I’m not going to get into speculation,” Scalise said. “Obviously our focus is on getting it resolved by January 3. And there’s a lot of conversations that everybody has been having, Kevin, surely, with the members who have expressed concerns.”\n\n“I think this is all theatrics,” said Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas, a McCarthy supporter.\n\nThe move comes as the speakership fight has begun to overshadow their party’s plans in the majority, even as some in his conference have called on McCarthy to take a firmer stand on how he would run the House – including over raising the national debt limit – and as the California Republican on Tuesday night sketched out in lengthy detail on his website investigative plans for when Republicans get committee gavels and subpoena power next year.\n\nIn a closed-door meeting on Tuesday, House Republicans engaged in a back-and-forth over the speaker’s race, with McCarthy and his allies calling for the conference to come together over the speaker’s vote and his detractors pushing back, according to multiple GOP sources.\n\nEven the time limits imposed at the microphones became an issue, as House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia had an exchange over the matter, according to a source in the room.\n\nAfter the testy back-and-forth, Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee attempted to bring some levity to the moment by joking that the only woman he lets disrespect him is his wife. He added that conference meetings are a waste of time and no one learns anything from them, a sentiment met with a round of cheers, sources said.\n\nAfter the meeting, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – a controversial conservative and close ally of former President Donald Trump – confirmed she spoke up in favor of McCarthy and said she is “sick and tired” of the so-called “Never Kevin” movement, even though some of them are her friends. She urged them to back down, saying they’re going to look foolish if the floor fight delays their majority.\n\nYet some Republicans were not persuaded.\n\nIn the meeting, Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina told Republicans he wouldn’t be instructed over how to vote and that he would take the next 28 days and decide on his own, according to GOP sources. Norman confirmed his closed-door comments.\n\n“It should be testy,” Norman told CNN. “We’re getting to elect the No. 1 job in the country.”\n\nRep. Chip Roy, the Texas Republican, defended the effort by hardline Republicans to extract concessions from McCarthy and potentially send the House speaker’s race into multiple ballots on January 3. Roy has not said how he would vote.\n\n“It’s nothing new in our history,” Roy said. “This is normal, we’re having a debate, just like, by the way, the Democrats did last time, remember?

Andy Biggs, according to multiple sources in the room. It was a secret ballot, and McCarthy only needed to earn a simple majority of the conference.\n\nWhile Biggs’ challenge was always viewed as a long shot, the number of Republicans who voted for him underscored the level of frustration with the Republican leadership following the 2022 elections. In January, McCarthy must win 218 votes, a majority of the entire House, to wield the speaker’s gavel.\n\nThree House Republicans — Kat Cammack of Florida, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania — nominated McCarthy for leader, arguing that he has worked harder than anyone, and that party unity is the only path to victory. McCarthy received a standing ovation after his election.\n\nBiggs, a former chair of the House Freedom Caucus, announced on Newsmax on Monday night that he would run against McCarthy, while acknowledging it would be “tough” to beat someone who has “raised a lot of money” to elect his colleagues.\n\n“This is not just about Kevin,” Biggs said on Monday. “I think it’s about institutional direction and trajectory.”\n\nBiggs was nominated Tuesday by Texas Rep. Chip Roy and South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, who asserted that the House GOP conference needs to change the way the House operates.\n\nOther roles in House GOP leadership were also decided. The No. 2 House Republican, Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, won his election to serve as House majority leader without facing any opposition.\n\nAnd Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, the National Republican Congressional Committee chair, defeated Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana and Drew Ferguson of Georgia to be the House majority whip.\n\nBefore Biggs’ announcement, McCarthy and Scalise attempted to quell the tensions vibrating within the party on Monday. McCarthy met with several members of the House Freedom Caucus, and Scalise apologized at a meeting to Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz for privately criticizing him in the immediate wake of January 6, 2021, according to sources in the room.\n\nIdaho GOP Rep. Mike Simpson said he’ll support McCarthy for leader, noting the GOP gained House seats the last two elections. “He’s done a good job,” said Simpson.\n\n“There were factors beyond what Kevin McCarthy could deal with that affected this election,” he added.\n\nSome members of the far-right appeared assuaged.\n\n“If we don’t unify behind Kevin McCarthy, we’re opening up the door for the Democrats to be able to recruit some of our Republicans,” said Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nEven before Biggs jumped in the ring, House members predicted that McCarthy would face a challenger who would expose that the California Republican does not currently enjoy enough support to become speaker next year.\n\nMcCarthy makes pitch behind closed doors\n\nDuring a closed-door leadership candidate forum on Monday, Virginia Rep. Bob Good, a McCarthy critic, complained that a Super PAC aligned with McCarthy opposed some pro-Trump candidates, and criticized McCarthy for not calling to congratulate him when he won his primary, according to a source in the room. McCarthy replied that he directed $2 million to Good for his race. Good had to be gaveled down in order to cut him off from speaking so they could move to the next question, the source said.\n\nAt the private intraparty meeting, McCarthy also received a standing ovation from his colleagues. McCarthy promised that he would strip away power from Democrats, saying, if elected, he would kick Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar off the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and California Reps. Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff off the House Intelligence Committee, according to a source in the room. And he underscored his role in returning Republicans to power.\n\n“They don’t give out gavels in small, medium, and large – we have the majority and we have the gavels,” McCarthy said at the meeting.\n\nAt one point, Gaetz asked McCarthy if he would try to solicit or accept speaker votes from any Democrats. McCarthy told him “no.”\n\nBut McCarthy’s allies have recently attempted to convince moderate Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar to switch parties in hopes of padding their slim margins, according to two sources familiar with the conversation. Cuellar flatly rejected the idea. (McCarthy’s spokesman said the GOP leader was not involved if these conversations took place and said this is not in any way part of their strategy for the majority or for his speakership bid.)\n\nGaetz, Good and Texas Rep. Chip Roy said on Monday that McCarthy does not have the votes he needs to become speaker.\n\n“What I can tell you as I stand here right now is that Kevin McCarthy does not have 218 votes to become speaker,” said Gaetz. “I don’t think he has 200.”\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments Tuesday.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Alex Rogers Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona", "Alex Rogers", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}]}

As speakers from March For Our Lives addressed the crowd she sat on the capitol steps cheering.\n\nMcClain has written, texted, and emailed every legislator at both the state and federal level.\n\nShe said she can't explain to her own 9-year-old grandson why he lives in a world where people in positions of power act so irresponsibly.\n\n\"I cant fathom a world where our legislators will say, 'We're with you, our thoughts and prayers are with you, we're here to assist if we can - and they do nothing!\" Said McClain. \"They do absolutely nothing, they're not here to assist us. They're here to fill their pockets and to support the NRA and to support laws that by any imagation are irrational and unfathomable!\"\n\nMcClain struggled to speak about her grandson.\n\n\"How do I tell him, 'You dont have to be afraid to go to school next year?'

Thousands attended the rally. MNPS spokesperson Sean Braisted said they will not receive disciplinary consequences if they work with their parents and school to follow attendance or checkout procedures.\n\nBattle also said she appreciated the students who attended the Capitol rally, and that the vast majority appeared to do so by working with the parents and schools to follow protocols.\n\n“While most students aren’t of age to vote, their voices in this conversation matter greatly, and I hope lawmakers and officials will listen and hear their calls for action and change as we work to build a safer society for all,\" Battle said.\n\nWilson County Schools protest Covenant Shooting\n\nWilson County Schools spokesperson Bart Barker said about 200 students from Green Hills High School walked out Monday. There were around 25 students from Mt.

Justin Jones, D-Nashville, and Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville. On Thursday, Jones and Johnson, along with Rep. Justin Pearson, D-Memphis, interrupted a debate about an education bill to lead protesters in calling for gun control. Pearson does not serve on any committees.\n\nThe three House Democrats approached the podium without being recognized to speak — breaching the chamber’s rules of procedure.\n\nWith a bullhorn, the three led protestors in the galleries in several chants calling for gun reform. At no point did any demonstrators make their way onto the House floor.\n\nSexton immediately recessed the chamber, halting legislative business for nearly an hour before it resumed, and ordered security to clear the House galleries.\n\nSexton said other sanctions, including expulsion, will be considered.\n\nThe last time the House expelled a sitting lawmaker was in 2016 when the chamber voted 70-2 to remove then-Rep. Jeremy Durham, R-Franklin, from the House for alleged sexual misconduct. At the time, it was the first expulsion since 1980 and only the second since the Civil War.\n\nLast year, for the first time in its history, the Tennessee Senate voted to expel a senator, stripping Sen.

THP reported no arrests or damage on Friday.\n\nBy Monday, Sexton backtracked, writing on Twitter his Thursday comparison to Jan. 6 was directed at three Democrat lawmakers, not the peaceful crowd of protesters.\n\nHume-Fogg student loud and proud\n\nJasmyn Milliken, a senior at Hume-Fogg and an organizer of the protest said they heard of the protest being organized by March For Our Lives and wanted to participate.\n\nThey were told that if they participated they would be suspended or face other disciplinary action such as having diplomas held and after school detention.\n\nThey organized the protest to begin off of school property as a way to abide by the rules.\n\n\"We're going to be loud we're not going to be silenced.\" She said. \"We're hoping to send the message that youth stands for gun reform, we want to live to see the future, we want our loved ones to see the future.\"\n\nVanderbilt professor, MNPS board member speak out at protest\n\nEric Dyson, a Vanderbilt professor a media personality, stepped up to the microphone during the protest. “Guns are weapons of mass destruction, especially AR 15's which needs to be banned,\" he said. \"Don’t ban books. Ban the idiotic, white supremacist, right-wing ignorance.”On Monday, Dyson suspended his own class at Vanderbilt's Divinity School so students could attend the protest, not just to talk about God, but to talk about justice.Cheers erupted from the audience as he blamed toxic masculinity and transphobia.\n\nAbigail Tyler, a Metro Nashville Public School's board member, parent and former teacher, asked students to raise their hands if they remember a time before lockdown drills. Hardly anyone raised their hand.“I am so sorry … but we’re here to remind them that you are worth protecting,” she said.She urged people to vote and to find out what candidates support “common sense gun laws” and support them.\n\nStudents protest in Cordell Hull\n\nDozens of students entered Cordell Hull and are now staging a sit in outside the office of House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville.\n\nThey screamed “Kids are dying, do you care” as Tennessee Highway Patrol shut the office doors.\n\nThey’re joined by Rep. Justin Jones, D-Nashville, who is facing sanctions as severe as expulsion for leading protest chants from the House floor on Thursday.\n\nThe students began pounding on the floor in time with their chant.\n\n\"Blood on your hands,\" they yelled. \"Blood on your hands.\"\n\nMNPS student: 'I'm tired'\n\nAt least 1,000 students and staff packed into the gym at Martin Luther King Jr. Magnet High around 11 a.m. Student speakers took to the podium in front of six chairs with white bows on them — one for each victim of the Covenant shooting.\n\nAs student Trey Madison read a poem he wrote, students took turns lighting six candles.\n\n\"I'm tired,\" Madison's began. \"I'm tired of turning on the news and seeing another bloody massacred that could've been stopped.\"\n\nMadison expressed exhaustion, anger and hope alike as at those gathered sat with silently with somber faces. Some had their heads in their hands, some had arms around each other, others wipe away tears as a few sniffles rippled through the crowd.\n\n\"The ball is in our court for as long as the bullet is still in the chamber,\" Madison said. \"Do not let those precious children have died for nothing. Do not let those selfless teachers have died for nothing.\"\n\nMadison continued to press for a call to action as the poem ended.\n\n\"We are the future. It's time to take it back,\" Madison said. \"I'm tired. I'm angry. I'm hopeful. I'm done.\"\n\nNashville college students join the debate\n\nMore protestors from Belmont and Vanderbilt universities arrived at the Capitol doubling the size of the crowd. Many of them also wore red and held signs denouncing gun violence.As they ascended the steps of the Capitol building, they chanted.\n\n“What do we want? Gun control,\" they yelled. \"When do we want it? Now!”\n\nOthers slowly passed through security inside the Capitol and started chants in the rotunda.\n\nSeveral young people stood at the top of the steps inside, overlooking the line of protestors waiting to pass through security.\n\n“Do your job!” they chanted at lawmakers passing by.\n\nStudents walk-out to protest at Capitol\n\nStudents from Nashville area schools walked out Monday to protest at the Capitol in the wake of the Covenant School shooting last week. High schoolers from Hume-Fogg walked the half-mile to the Hill chanting and carrying signs.\n\n“Hey Hey, Ho Ho, the NRA has got to go,\" they said.\n\nState Rep. Justin Jones joined in with the crowd as hundreds gathered outside the Tennessee Capitol in misting rain to demand gun reform from state lawmakers. The lawmaker last week interrupted House proceedings to demand actions as protestors chanted in the rotunda outside the chamber doors.\n\nAt 10:13 a.m., the same time the first 911 call came in about the shooting, protestors sat for a moment of silence. Some bowed their heads and clasped their hands together in prayer.\n\n\"No one here, no one in that building should be able to do their job. No one in that building should be able to vote on anything else or even bills that regard this without thinking about the lives that have been lost last week, last year or for the many years this has been happening and nothing has been done about it,\" a student said at a bullhorn on the steps of Legislative Plaza.\n\nHillsboro High School students: #ProtectOurStudents\n\nAbout 16 students sat on stage in the Hillsboro High School auditorium. Many of them were involved with student government and helped to plan the rally in support of The Covenant School.\n\nAt 10:13 a.m., students began streaming into the auditorium and filling the seats. A PowerPoint presentation was projected on the stage showing the message: #ProtectOurStudents.\n\nMany students, both on stage and in the audience, wore bright red shirts for the six victims of The Covenant School shooting.\n\nHillsboro is home to more than 1,200 high school students grades 9-12.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. Magnet High School hold \"walk-in\"\n\nAbout a dozen students who had parental permission to walk out gathered near the main office of Martin Luther King Jr. Magnet High School at 9:53 a.m.Over the loud speaker, a woman’s voice read: “Hallie Scruggs, age 9.”The remaining students gathered in their advisory rooms, where they met with teachers who track with them for their entire career through high school.The school had plans through the morning for a “walk-in” as an alternative to the walk-out, including a rally.\n\nThe names of the other victims were read over the PA as students settled into their rooms. A special video address by MNPS Director Adrienne Battle was shown as the walk-in events got underway.Sophomores inside Cindy Montgomery’s classroom were each given a piece of a red paper heart to write their feelings and thoughts in the wake of the shooting. A few worked to tape the heart together as others finished writing their messages.“Wish you’d listen,” one read.“Students should never fear for their safety,” another said.Another message elaborated more: “The government should care more about the lives of 9-year-olds than the rights of gun owners. Will I be next? Those kids had so much life ahead of them. It’s not fair. Ban assault weapons.”\n\nCommunity Foundation fundraiser exceeds $600k\n\nThe Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee established the Caring for Covenant Fund to manage donations to the school \"because of the outpouring of love from our generous and thoughtful community,\" CEO Hal Cato said last week.\n\nAs of this morning, the foundation has raised about $601,860 from 3,840 donations, an average of about $156 per gift.\n\nDonations can be made at www.cfmt.org/covenant.\n\nHume-Fogg Academic Magnet High School students: 'We demand action'\n\nStudents at Hume-Fogg Academic Magnet High School began their planned walk out with a demonstration outside of the school Monday.\n\nA small group of about 30 students gathered behind the school about 9 a.m. Many of them wore red as a way to honor the victims of The Covenant School.\n\nOne student organizer, Wyatt Bassow, took his shirt one step further adding the phrase “I don’t want to be your statistic,” and added a target on his back.“Student and teachers are filled with the fear of losing their lives yet they do nothing … They don’t care about us, so we have to make them care. We demand action,” one of the student speaker's said.“In our age range the number once cause of death is not car accidents but homicides by guns … I’m afraid to be out here and going to school in this country where guns are so easy to access,” student Nathan DeWitt said.\n\nWalkouts against gun violence expected Monday\n\nMarch For Our Lives, a prominent national nonprofit advocating against gun violence, is organizing a student walkout for Monday morning. The organization is encouraging area students to walkout of classrooms at 10:13 a.m. and meet at the Capitol at 10:45, where demonstrators will call on legislators to support gun reform.\n\nAhead of the student walkout, Students at Hume-Fogg Academic Magnet High School are planning a demonstration outside the school starting at 9 a.m. The demonstration will lead into the March For Our Lives walkout. Hume-Fogg students are planning the demonstration ahead of time so they don't walk out of classes and potentially face discipline, according to an Instagram post.\n\nOrganizers of the Hume-Fogg event ask students to not step on Hume-Fogg's grass, stairs or upper parking lot. Also, speakers who are already signed up will not speak about Metro Nashville Public Schools or potential discipline related to the walkouts. \"This is focused on gun reform,\" an organizer said on Instagram. Participants are encouraged to wear red.\n\nA rally for elementary-age kids and families is also planned at the State Capitol later on Monday starting at 4 p.m. \"Our goal is to remind lawmakers of the lives that are at stake if they do not take action,\" said a post advertising the rally. \"This is a peaceful rally with singing and chanting.\" Clergy and teachers are also welcome, and participants are encouraged to wear orange.\n\nDemonstrators gathered Thursday at the State Capitol and on Saturday in Franklin to protest gun violence.\n\nComfort kits for Covenant School\n\nKris Wylder, a local Realtor and social-media personality, set out with a simple plan after the shooting at Covenant School — take care of those families.\n\nWhat began as comfort kits for one Covenant class turned into $30,000 raised. Now, she hopes to schedule therapy dog and equine therapy sessions for Covenant School students and staff.\n\n\"It just kept growing and growing,\" she said. \"Once a month we will check in with the families to provide anything that can offer comfort.\"\n\nWylder is still accepting donations via her Venmo account: kris-wylder7. She's reachable on Instagram @running.wylder.\n\nRutherford County Schools closed Monday for safety review\n\nThe Rutherford County Board of Education announced Saturday that all schools in its jurisdiction will be closed Monday for security reviews.\n\nDirector of schools Jimmy Sullivan said principals, teachers and support staff will use Monday to \"debrief the situation that occurred in Nashville and review all safety procedures before students return,\" in a message to parents, students and staff.\n\nLast Monday's shooting prompted questions from parents and staff, Sullivan said, so his staff made the decision to extend Spring Break by a day to review those practices and policies.\n\nWho were the victims of The Covenant School shooting?\n\nPolice identified the victims of the shooting on Monday afternoon as:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/25/us/st-louis-school-shooting-tuesday/index.html", "title": "St. Louis school shooter had an AR-15-style rifle, 600 rounds of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe 19-year-old gunman who killed two people and wounded several others at his former high school left a note saying his struggles led to “the perfect storm for a mass shooter,” St. Louis police said.\n\nOrlando Harris graduated from Central Visual and Performing Arts High School last year and returned Monday with an AR-15-style rifle, over 600 rounds of ammunition and more than a dozen high-capacity magazines, St. Louis police Commissioner Michael Sack said.\n\nHarris died at a hospital after a gun battle with officers.\n\nInvestigators found a handwritten note in the car Harris drove to the school. Sack detailed some of the passages:\n\n“I don’t have any friends. I don’t have any family. I’ve never had a girlfriend. I’ve never had a social life. I’ve been an isolated loner my entire life,” the note said, according to Sack. “This was the perfect storm for a mass shooter.”\n\nGiven the gunman’s extensive arsenal, the tragedy could have been “much worse,” the police chief said.\n\nAuthorities credited locked doors and a quick law enforcement response – including by off-duty officers – for preventing more deaths at the school.\n\nBut the shooter did not enter a checkpoint where security guards were stationed, said DeAndre Davis, director of safety and security for St. Louis Public Schools.\n\nDavis also said the security guards stationed in the district’s schools are not armed, but mobile officers who respond to calls at schools are.\n\n“For some people that would cause a stir of some sort,” Davis said Tuesday. “For us, we thought it’s best for our officers, for the normalcy of school for kids, to not have officers armed in the school.”\n\nA talented dancer and a heroic teacher were killed\n\nMourners set up a memorial in honor of Alexandria Bell, who was killed weeks before her 16th birthday. CNN\n\nStudent Alexandria Bell, 15, and teacher Jean Kuczka, 61, were gunned down in the attack.\n\nOne of the teacher’s colleagues, Kristie Faulstich, said Kuczka died protecting her students.\n\nDuring the rush to evacuate students from the school, “One student looked at me and she said, ‘They shot Ms. Kuczka.’ And then she said that Ms. Kuczka had put herself between the gunman and the students,” Faulstich said.\n\nJean Kuczka Courtesy Jean Kuczka family\n\nKuczka was looking forward to retiring in just a few years, her daughter Abigail Kuczka told CNN.\n\nAlexandria was looking forward to her Sweet 16, her father Andre Bell told CNN affiliate KSDK.\n\n“It’s a nightmare,” Bell said. “I am so upset. I need somebody – police, community folks, somebody – to make this make sense.”\n\nHe joins a growing list of parents grappling with the reality of their child being killed at school.\n\nAcross the country, at least 67 shootings have happened on school grounds so far this year.\n\nStudents will be able to return to the school as early as Thursday to retrieve their belongings and will attend online classes until the school reopens, St. Louis Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Kelvin Adams said.\n\nIt could take up to two months before the school will be ready for in-person classes, he said.\n\nAdams also said the district is planning to add gun safety to its curriculum.\n\n“The gun safety initiative, quite frankly, was a plan put together to try to address the kind of issues that happen outside of our school district, outside of our school buildings, in terms of the number of students who have been shot in the city of St. Louis, and that die, quite frankly, as a result of incidents that happened outside of the school environment,” he said.\n\n‘How did that man get inside the school?’\n\nStudents grieve near Central Visual and Performing Arts High School, where two people were killed. David Carson/AP\n\nBell, the father of the slain teen, said he’s struggling to get answers about what happened.\n\n“I really want to know: How did that man get inside the school?” he told KSDK.\n\nAuthorities have said the doors were locked. But the St. Louis police commissioner declined to detail how the shooter got in.\n\n“I don’t want to make this easy for anybody else,” Sack said.\n\nThe gunman didn’t conceal his weapon when entering the school, Sack said.\n\n“When he entered, it was out … there was no mystery about what was going to happen,” the commissioner said. “He had it out and entered in an aggressive, violent manner.”\n\n‘Miles Davis is in the building’\n\nFaulstich said school’s principal came over the intercom and used the code phrase “Miles Davis is in the building” to let faculty know an active shooter was in the building.\n\n“I instantly but calmly went to lock my door and turn off the lights,” the teacher said. “I then turned to my kids and told everyone to get in the corner.”\n\nWithin a minute of locking her second-floor classroom door, Faulstich said, someone started “violently jostling the handle, trying to get in.”\n\n“I absolutely commend my students for their response,” Faulstich said. “Even in the moments when they were hearing gunfire going on all around they stood quiet and I know they did it to keep each other safe.”\n\nAdrianne Bolden, a freshman at the school, told KSDK that students thought the school was conducting a drill – until they heard the sirens and noticed their teachers were scared.\n\n“The teacher, she crawled over and she was asking for help to move the lockers to the door so they can’t get in,” Bolden said. “And we started hearing glass breaking from the outside and gunshots outside the door.”\n\nSophomore Brian Collins, 15, suffered gunshot wounds to his hands and jaws. He escaped by jumping from a classroom window onto a ledge, his mother VonDina Washington said.\n\n“He told me they heard an active shooter notification over the intercom so everyone in the class hid,” Washington said. According to her son, the gunman then came into the classroom and fired several shots before leaving.\n\nAfter the gunman left the third-floor classroom, Washington said another student opened a classroom window, and some of them jumped.\n\nBrian has numbness in his hands and trouble moving some of his right-hand fingers.\n\n“He’s really good at drawing,” Washington said. “He went to CVPA for visual arts, and we’re hoping he’ll be able to draw again.”\n\nMath teacher David Williams told CNN everyone went into “drill mode,” turning off lights, locking doors and huddling in corners so they couldn’t be seen.\n\nHe said he heard someone trying to open the door and a man yell, “You are all going to f**king die.”\n\nA short time later, a bullet came through one of the windows in his classroom, Williams said.\n\nHis classroom is on the third floor, where Sack said police engaged the shooter.\n\nEventually, an officer said she was outside, and the class ran out through nearby emergency doors.\n\nOfficers rushed in about 4 minutes after the shooting started\n\nSecurity personnel were at the school when the gunman arrived, St. Louis Public Schools Communications Director George Sells said.\n\n“We had the seven personnel working in the building who did a wonderful job getting the alarm sounded quickly,” Sells said.\n\nThe commissioner did say the school doors being locked likely delayed the gunman.\n\n“The school was closed and the doors were locked,” Sack told CNN affiliate KMOV. “The security staff did an outstanding job identifying the suspect’s efforts to enter, and immediately notified other staff and ensured that we were contacted.”\n\nAfter widespread controversy over the delayed response in confronting school shooters in Uvalde, Texas, and Parkland, Florida, Sack said responding officers in St. Louis wasted no time rushing into the school and stopping the gunman.\n\n“There was no sidewalk conference. There was no discussion,” Sack said. “There was no, ‘Hey, where are you going to?’ They just went right in.”\n\nA call about an active shooter at the high school came in around 9:11 a.m., according to a timeline provided by the commissioner.\n\nPolice arrived on scene and made entry four minutes later.\n\nOfficers found the gunman and began “engaging him in a gunfight” at 9:23 a.m. Two minutes later, officers reported the suspect was down.\n\nAsked about the eight minutes between officers’ arrival and making contact with the gunman, Sack said “eight minutes isn’t very long,” and that officers had to maneuver through a big school with few entrances and crowds of students and staff who were evacuating.\n\nPolice found the suspect “not just by hearing the gunfire, but by talking to kids and teachers as they’re leaving,” Sack said.\n\nAs phone calls came in from people hiding in different locations, officers fanned out and searched for students and staff to escort them out of the building.\n\nOfficers who were at a church down the street for a fellow officer’s funeral also responded to the shooting, the commissioner said.\n\nA SWAT team that was together for a training exercise was also able to quickly load up and get to the school to perform a secondary sweep of the building, Sack said.\n\nSome officers were “off duty; some were in T-shirts, but they had their (ballistic) vests on,” the commissioner said. “They did an outstanding job.”\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story gave the wrong age for 15-year-old Alexandria Bell, who was killed in the shooting.", "authors": ["Holly Yan Rebekah Riess Nouran Salahieh", "Holly Yan", "Rebekah Riess", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/20/us/colorado-springs-shooting-gay-nightclub/index.html", "title": "Gunman kills 5 at LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs before ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA 22-year-old gunman entered an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado, just before midnight Saturday and immediately opened fire, killing at least five people and injuring 25 others, before patrons confronted and stopped him, police said Sunday.\n\nThe suspect in the shooting at Club Q was identified as Anderson Lee Aldrich, according to Colorado Springs Police Chief Adrian Vasquez.

Kevin Mohatt/Reuters In pictures: Mass shooting at LGBTQ club in Colorado Prev Next\n\nIn a statement on social media, Club Q said it was “devastated by the senseless attack on our community” and thanked “the quick reactions of heroic customers that subdued the gunman and ended this hate attack.”\n\nClub Q posted earlier in the day that its Saturday night lineup would feature a punk and alternative show at 9 p.m. followed by a dance party at 11. The club also planned to hold a drag brunch and a drag show on Sunday for Transgender Day of Remembrance. The club’s website now says it will be closed until further notice.\n\nGov. Jared Polis ordered flags lowered to half-staff at all public buildings statewide to honor the victims of the mass shooting beginning Monday until Saturday, according to a news release from his office.\n\n“Flags will be lowered for 5 days to remember each of the 5 individuals who lost their lives in this senseless tragedy,” the release read. “To further honor and remember the victims and those injured in this tragedy, the Polis-Primavera administration will also be flying the Pride flag at the Colorado state capitol for the next five days.”\n\nThe shooting came as the calendar turned to Transgender Day of Remembrance on Sunday and is reminiscent of the 2016 attack at an LGBTQ nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in which a gunman who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State killed 49 people and wounded at least 53.\n\nColorado has been the site of some of the most heinous mass shootings in US history, including the 1999 shooting in Columbine High School and the 2012 movie theater shooting in Aurora. Colorado Springs was the site of mass shootings at a Planned Parenthood in November 2015 that left three dead and at a birthday party last year that left six dead.\n\nAccording to data from the Gun Violence Archive, there have been more than 600 mass shootings in the United States so far this year, defined as an incident in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nJoshua Thurman told CNN affiliate KOAA he was inside the club dancing when he heard gunshots and saw a muzzle flash.\n\n“I thought it was the music, so I kept dancing,” he said. “Then I heard another set of shots, and then me and a customer ran to the dressing room, got on the ground and locked the doors and called the police immediately.”\n\nThurman said he heard the sounds of more gunshots, people crying and windows being shattered. When he came out, he saw bodies lying on the ground, broken glass and blood, he said.\n\nThe violence lasted just minutes. Police received numerous 911 calls starting at 11:56 p.m., officers were dispatched at 11:57 p.m., an officer arrived at midnight and the suspect was detained at 12:02 a.m., police said. A total of 39 patrol officers responded, police said, and Fire Department Captain Mike Smaldino said 11 ambulances went to the scene.\n\nA gunman killed at least five people at a LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs before patrons confronted and stopped him, police say. Rosa Flores/CNN\n\nAuthorities initially said 18 people were injured but later adjusted that total up to 25. Nineteen of the 25 injured had gunshot wounds, Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers told CNN’s Jim Acosta Sunday. Based on communication with medical personnel, Suthers said he expects the injured victims to survive and the community is “crossing our fingers” for no more fatalities.\n\nThe suspect is being treated at a hospital, police added. Officers did not shoot at him, police said.\n\nJoseph Sheldon told CNN affiliate KRDO he visited the club Saturday night to drop off a friend about 10 minutes before the gunman opened fire.\n\n“This is a bar I’ve gone to multiple times in my life since I became the age of 18. A lot of these people at the bar are friends, they are family, a lot are people I’ve become close to,” he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Colorado Springs mayor says 'heroic' individuals subdued shooter with his gun 01:04 - Source: CNN\n\n“Whether it’s a hate crime or not, it’s hard to see that this is going on, that this happened in my community, that this happened at a place that I’ve gone to and felt safe, that this happened at a place where if I stayed 10 more minutes, I would have been right in the middle of it.”\n\nClub Q was safe space for LGBTQ community\n\nA general view of Club Q as police respond to a mass shooting there on November 20, 2022. Kevin Mohatt/Reuters\n\nColorado Springs, the state’s second-most populous city with just under 500,000 residents, is home to a number of military bases and is the headquarters for Focus on the Family, the conservative Christian group that says homosexuality and same-sex marriage are sins.\n\nClub Q opened in 2002 and was, until recently, the only LGBTQ club in the city.\n\n“Proudly queer Club Q has stood as a bastion of the LGBTQ community where others have fallen,” 5280 magazine reported in a story last year. “It’s where LGBTQ folks go for drag performances, dance parties, and drinks, and it supports the community with event sponsorships, pride celebrations, charity drives, and more. While the club has recently shifted to offering more low-key ‘dinner and a show’ vibes before 10 p.m., it’s still known as the place for queer young adults to go and get their dance on.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Bartender tried to escape club. He unexpectedly saw gunman on the ground 01:24 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a July 2020 interview with Colorado Springs Indy, Club Q owner Nic Grzecka explained why he and his business partner opened the establishment.\n\n“The whole idea of this place (Club Q) is to have a safe place – to get a permanent one in the city,” Grzecka said.\n\nHe and his business partner toured other successful LGBTQ spaces and noted a common theme: “They were gay as hell,” Grzecka told the outlet. “They had go-go dancers and drag queens and bartenders in jockstraps. We knew we had to be gay as hell (to survive).”\n\nThe venue also hosts events for people of all ages, including brunch and planned an upcoming Thanksgiving event.\n\nBouquets of flowers and a sign reading \"Love Over Hate\" were left near Club Q on Sunday, November 20, 2022. Jason Connolly/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLifelong Colorado Springs resident Tiana Nicole Dykes called Club Q “a second home full of chosen family.”\n\n“I’m there every other week if not every single week. This space means the world to me. The energy, the people, the message. It’s an amazing place that didn’t deserve this tragedy,” Dykes told CNN on Sunday. “Something like a mass shooting at an LGBT+ safe space is damaging beyond belief. There’s feelings of disrespect, disbelief, and just pure shock. Nobody ever thinks it’s gonna happen to them, and sometimes it does.”\n\nTim Curran, a copy editor for CNN’s “Early Start,” is a regular at Club Q with his boyfriend when he visits his family in Colorado Springs.\n\n“It’s a very warm, welcoming space, definitely a big step up for diversity in the Springs,” Curran told CNN.\n\nJewels Parks, who has been in the Colorado drag scene for over a year and performs under the drag name Dezzy Dazzles, said Club Q was a community, a family and a space where the outside world’s cruelty was not welcome.\n\n“Club Q, along with all of the other LGBTQIA+ bars, represent a safe space for a community that has felt unsafe and rejected for most of their lives,” Parks told CNN. “In a world that can be so dark and so angry, it’s that one place that feels like home. We’re able to unwind, forget about our troubles with work, family, society. Because of Club Q, we’re able to make friends that turn into family and be accepted for our true selves.”\n\n“The LGBTQIA+ community has undergone so much bigotry and hatred already. To have our safe place ripped from us and to lose members of our community is a whole other type of hurt,” Parks added.\n\nAntonio Taylor, a drag queen who was born and raised in Colorado Springs, told CNN they discovered Club Q in 2020, when they saw their first drag show. Taylor, who recently came out as bisexual, said a whole new world opened up for them – a world where they were not only safe, but truly loved.\n\n“The people there made me feel like I was a part of a family. Seeing so many people out and proud about themselves definitely influenced me to be my true self,” Taylor told CNN, adding that Club Q and its community helped them feel ready to come out.\n\n“This was one of the places where I didn’t have to worry about looks or people hating me for who I am,” they said. “I’m sick to my stomach that the one place where I knew I was safe has been made unsafe.”\n\nShenika Mosley, a 14-year patron of Club Q, said the shooting took away the nightclub’s “good energy.”\n\nMosley has frequented Club Q since 2009 and would find herself on its doorstep “anytime I wanted to get away and go have fun. It just had good energy … never bad energy. We’ll never be able to have that ever again.”\n\nLily Forsell had a similar sentiment, saying she had been celebrating her 18th birthday at the club and left just before shots rang out. She said she remembers the scene on the dance floor as she was leaving: dozens of people laughing, singing and dancing.\n\n“Looking at that dance floor is going to be a completely different feeling, now that we know what happened to 30 people on that floor,” Forsell told CNN. “I keep all of the drag queens in my heart. They made it out safely, but two of them, who I had first met last night, had to walk out of the building past the horrific scene, their friends injured or killed on the ground.”\n\nPolice investigating suspect’s past\n\nAldrich was arrested in June 2021 in connection with a bomb threat that led to a standoff at his mother’s home, according to a news release from the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office at the time and his mother’s former landlord.\n\nTwo law enforcement sources confirmed the suspect in the nightclub shooting and the bomb threat were the same person based on name and date of birth.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Club Q shooting suspect was previously arrested, police revealed 03:45 - Source: CNN\n\nVideo obtained by CNN shows Aldrich surrendering to law enforcement last year after allegedly making a bomb threat. Footage from the Ring door camera of the owner of the home shows Aldrich exiting the house with his hands up and barefoot, and walking to sheriff’s deputies.\n\nAldrich was arrested that month on charges of felony menacing and first-degree kidnapping, according to the El Paso release.\n\nSheriff’s deputies responded to a report by the man’s mother that he was “threatening to cause harm to her with a homemade bomb, multiple weapons, and ammunition,” according to the release. Deputies called the suspect, and he “refused to comply with orders to surrender,” the release said, leading them to evacuate nearby homes.\n\nSeveral hours after the initial police call, the sheriff’s crisis negotiations unit was able to get Aldrich to leave the house, and he was arrested after walking out the front door. Authorities did not find any explosives in the home.\n\nLeslie Bowman, who owns the house where Aldrich’s mother lived, provided CNN the videos. Bowman said Aldrich’s mother rented a room in the house for a little over a year. Aldrich would “come by and visit his mom and hang out in her room,” Bowman said. She described Aldrich as “not very sociable.”\n\nOne time, Bowman said, Aldrich got angry at her during an argument about a bathroom toilet not working, and slammed a door in her face.\n\n“That was the only time he was aggressive or angry towards me,” she said.\n\nAttempts by CNN to reach Aldrich’s mother for comment were unsuccessful.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the bomb threat case was resolved, but the Colorado Springs Gazette reported that the district attorney’s office said no formal charges were pursued in the case. The district attorney’s office did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n\nAldrich also called the Gazette in an attempt to get an earlier story about the 2021 incident removed from the website, the newspaper reported. “There is absolutely nothing there, the case was dropped, and I’m asking you either remove or update the story,” Aldrich said in a voice message, according to the Gazette.\n\nPoliticians offer support to LGBTQ community\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat and the nation’s first openly gay governor, issued a statement Sunday calling the attack “horrific, sickening and devastating” and offered state resources to local law enforcement.\n\n“We are eternally grateful for the brave individuals who blocked the gunman likely saving lives in the process and for the first responders who responded swiftly to this horrific shooting,” he said. “Colorado stands with our LGTBQ community and everyone impacted by this tragedy as we mourn together.”\n\nPolis told CNN’s Jim Acosta there are only two gay bars in Colorado Springs, and Club Q was one of the main venues.\n\n“Everyone knew it. I knew it, knew this venue. It’s just shocking. That’s still setting in for people. But I know we’re going to bounce back. We’re showing love for one another. We’re showing healing for one another,” the governor said.\n\nColorado’s two US senators, both Democrats, offered condolences in statements and said more should be done for the LGBTQ community.\n\n“We have to protect LGBTQ lives from this hate,” Sen. John Hickenlooper said.\n\n“As we seek justice for this unimaginable act, we must do more to protect the LGBTQ community and stand firm against discrimination and hate in every form,” Sen. Michael Bennett said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden also issued a statement saying he was praying for the victims and their families.\n\n“While no motive in this attack is yet clear, we know that the LGBTQI+ community has been subjected to horrific hate violence in recent years. Gun violence continues to have a devastating and particular impact on LGBTQI+ communities across our nation and threats of violence are increasing,” Biden said in the written statement.", "authors": ["Eric Levenson Michelle Watson Andy Rose Amir Vera", "Eric Levenson", "Michelle Watson", "Andy Rose", "Amir Vera"], "publish_date": "2022/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/04/05/nashville-shooting-nationwide-student-walkout-gun-safety/11608207002/", "title": "Thousands participate in national school walkout after Nashville ...", "text": "Thousands of students walked out of classes across the country Wednesday to demand lawmakers take action on gun safety following the mass shooting at an elementary school in Nashville, Tennessee, last week.\n\nAdvocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, which coordinated the walkouts through Students Demand Action, said there were more than 300 demonstrations across 41 states and Washington, D.C., to kick off a \"week of action\" by advocates and gun violence survivors.\n\nRyley Collins, 15, a volunteer with Students Demand Action who helped lead a walkout at Jasper High School in Plano, Texas, said she and her classmates wanted to \"make sure our lawmakers understand that we want more than just thoughts and prayers.\"\n\n\"We want to be safe in our schools and we want them to take action to protect our lives, not the gun industry's profits,\" Collins said.\n\nUSA TODAY confirmed thousands of students walked out of classes through local media reports, estimates from school districts and USA TODAY Network reporters on the scene.\n\n'They're begging us to do something:' Nashville lawmaker calls for gun reform as hundreds protest after Covenant shooting\n\nIn Uvalde, Texas, dozens of high school students left classes, local news outlets reported.

Bob Freeman, D-Nashville, has struggled to find the words this week as his district, and the city at large, reels from the deadliest school shooting in state history that left three children and three staff dead on Monday.\n\nFreeman grappled with the tragedy as an elected official and as a father, as his young daughter attended the same Sunday school class as one of the Covenant School victims.\n\n\"What's the right way to help a child grieve the loss of a friend and the loss of innocence?\" Freeman asked his House colleagues.\n\n\"Parents dropped their kids off on a beautiful spring morning with no idea their lives would forever be changed at a moment of senseless gun violence.\"\n\nNashville school shooting:What we know about the shooter, motive in Covenant School attack\n\nFor more than a thousand people on Thursday morning, their response to the Covenant shooting led them up the steps of the Tennessee Capitol and into its halls, where they crowded into its marble rotunda and lined the chamber galleries.\n\nAs their chants for \"gun reform now\" rang out, Tennessee Highway Patrol members were forced to hold open paths for lawmakers and staff to get into the House chamber, which eventually erupted in an unprecedented confrontation sparked by two freshman lawmakers.\n\nInside, Freeman stood with his Democratic colleagues calling for \"common-sense reforms\" including red flag laws and background. Freeman addressed his Republican supermajority colleagues, who in recent years have relaxed gun laws in the state and show little indication they will support tightening gun regulations despite the school shooting.\n\n\"Our children, our teachers and our neighbors were killed by a weapon of war obtained legally by someone that should never have had the ability to carry out this type of violence against our community,\" Freeman said.\n\nFreeman urged his colleagues to listen to the crowd waiting outside the House doors.\n\n\"They're out there right now. They're begging for us to do something,\" Freeman said.\n\n'Rogue' gun dealers revealed:What to know as ATF names gun shops that flout federal laws\n\nEven as the crowds continued to chant outside, the House moved on to its lengthy Thursday agenda, which included bills delayed on Monday when lawmakers chose to pause floor debates hours after the Covenant shooting.\n\nBut the House floor descended into chaos later in the morning, after House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, repeatedly gaveled down members of the public in the gallery and two outspoken freshman Democrats who continually called for colleagues to address gun reform.\n\n\"I'm asking you to do your job,\" one woman screamed from the gallery. \"There is blood on your hands. Do your job.\"\n\nAfter butting heads with Rep. Justin Pearson, D-Memphis, and Rep. Justine Jones, D-Nashville, Sexton called all leadership up to the dais. As leaders of both the Republican and Democratic caucuses engaged in heated discussions, Pearson and Jones took over the House chamber well.\n\nThe pair, flanked by Rep.

Bill Lee, Senate speaker Lt. Gov. Randy McNally this week called for increased school security measures in response to the Covenant shooting.\n\n\"While these changes would come with a cost, I believe it is important for us to have a conversation about how to increase and modernize security at schools in Tennessee,\" McNally said. \"Much like the institution of fire codes has decreased the amount of school building fires, I believe we can come up with something similar for school safety.\n\nMcNally pointed to the Covenant shooter's access of the school by shooting through glass doors at a side entrance vestibule, calling for securing windows and glass with \"bullet proof or resistant\" film.\n\nMcNally also called for magnetic locks on doors to ease first responder access to building doors that might be locked down in an emergency, in addition to \"centralized and modernized camera systems.\"\n\nThe speaker also called for an armed guard at every public and private school.

Juliet began with a lone bagpipe player standing in front of the clock tower.\n\nFor an hour, city leaders, including Mayor James Maness, Police Chief James Hambrick and several church pastors, prayed and offered their condolences to The Covenant School and the entire Nashville community.\n\nA couple hundred people attended the vigil. They huddled together in groups with bowed heads and joined together in prayer.\n\nAt one point, teachers were asked to raise their hands, and others placed their hands on them and prayed over them.\n\nGov. Bill Lee's wife 'best friends' with one of the victims\n\nOn Monday night, Tennessee's first lady Maria Lee was set to have dinner with one of her best friends, Cindy Peak, an old colleague from her teacher days who planned to spend the day as a substitute teacher at The Covenant School.\n\nBut Peak never arrived home on Monday. The 61-year-old was one of six victims slain in one of the deadliest school shootings in Tennessee history.\n\n\"What happened at Covenant School was a tragedy beyond comprehension,\" Gov.

Do something,'\" Patton said.\n\nPatton called the Suicide Prevention Helpline minutes after reading the messages. The helpline recommended that Patton call police, which she did.

Drake spoke to President Joe Biden, who was planning to reach out to the responding officers this week.\n\nAudrey Hale was being treated for 'emotional disorder' before Monday's shooting\n\nFollowing extensive interviews with the parents of Audrey Hale, Metro Police were able to determine that Hale was “under doctor care for an emotional disorder,” and Hale's parents believed Hale did not have any firearms at the time of the shooting, Drake said Tuesday.\n\nDrake confirmed that law enforcement were previously unaware of Hale or about his treatment. Drake said that had it been reported to police that Hale was suicidal, MNPD would have intervened.\n\nPolice also confirmed that there is “no motive” at this time—the previously found manifesto in Hale’s vehicle on scene had “talks about the school, a map, a drawing of entry points and assaults that would take place.”\n\nDrake added that no specific student or faculty member was targeted in the attack. According to Drake, Hale appeared to have “some training to shoot from a higher level,” and knew to stand “away from the glass so (he) wouldn’t be an easy target.”\n\n'A WAKE UP CALL':Channel 4 reporter 'immediately was taken back' to school shooting she witnessed in 2010\n\nNashville police chief: Shooter legally purchased 7 guns, used 3 during shooting\n\nAudrey Hale legally bought seven weapons from five different gun stores, three of which were used yesterday during Monday's shooting, Metro police chief John Drake said during a Tuesday press briefing.\n\nDrake said that Hale suffered from some type of emotional disorder although it is unknown exactly what. Hale's parents believed that due to Hale's emotional state, Hale should not have owned weapons.\n\nCandlelight vigil set for Wednesday evening at Public Square Park\n\nA candlelight vigil will be held Wednesday night at Public Square Park to honor the victims of Monday's shooting.\n\nThe vigil will start at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday at 1 Public Square Park in Nashville.\n\nNashville Mayor John Cooper, MNPD chief John Drake, Metro Council member Russ Pulley and State Rep. Rev. Harold Love Jr. will speak at the event.\n\nNashville police chief: Shooter planned other targets, including a mall\n\nIn an interview with CBS Mornings on Tuesday, Metro Nashville police chief John Drake said there were other targets, including a mall, outlined in materials obtained at Hale's residence following Monday's shooting.\n\n\"We think (Monday's shooting) was targeted and planned,\" Drake said.\n\n\"… We strongly believe there were going to be other targets, including maybe family members and one of the malls here in Nashville.\"\n\nDrake said that Hale, who attended Covenant School, had \"some history\" with the school which may have played a role in the motive for Monday's shooting.\n\n\"What detectives have said so far is there is possibly some resentment for having to go to that school. There's a connection with that family.\"\n\nHow school shooting survivors cope in the following days\n\nHaving responded to mass shooting at Virginia Tech, Orlando’s Pulse Night Club and the mass shooting in Las Vegas, Jeff Gorter, vice president of clinical crisis response with R3 Continuum, said finding a return to routine is a great coping mechanism strategy for adults.\n\n“We will respond with resilience to these events, but we are called to be a little more intentional and specific in how we cope with them,” Gorter said.\n\nFor young children, Gorter said they will have powerful reactions to trauma.\n\n“It’s important they attend to the basic comfort need, be present with their children.”\n\nScenes from the Covenant School, the day after the shooting\n\nAround 9 a.m. Tuesday, a makeshift memorial was set up at the main drive that leads to Covenant School, which was otherwise blocked off by police. Media tents lining the sidewalk across the street stretch for blocks. A set of flags at an office building down the road flew at half mast.\n\nA few people trickled in to lay flowers against the stone wall where the memorial was set up. Balloons, stuffed animals, notes and candles also lined the wall. One woman dropped to her knees as she laid a bouquet of flowers down, burying her head in her hands and wiping tears from her eyes.\n\nThe scene was muted Tuesday morning, especially compared to the swarm of emergency vehicles and helicopters that descended upon the school just after 10 a.m. the day before. A steady stream of traffic continued to roll down Burton Hills Boulevard under overcast skies.\n\nHow Woodmont Baptist Church sprung into action\n\nAt the same time staff at Woodmont Baptist Church saw the news of the shooting, they learned they were going to also serve as the reunification site.\n\n\"As Christians I think we’re always ready to help play our part in bringing back that which has been not unified to unification,\" Pastor Nathan Parker told The Tennessean. \"That reunification work is really gospel work that we were honored to be a part of God’s plan in that moment.\"\n\nStaff began ushering parents, the earliest of whom arrived about 11 a.m., to the sanctuary where they gave their information and student's information to officials. Church staff passed out water, directed parents to the bathrooms and took out the trash.\n\n\"I never saw any of our staff sit down,\" Parker said. \"I couldn’t be prouder of their character in that moment.”\n\nExperts: Nashville police moved fast, saved lives\n\nPolice response to mass casualty incidents are increasingly under scrutiny after a shooter killed 19 students and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas while officers stood outside. A top Texas law enforcement official later said there were enough armed police officers wearing body armor to halt the shooting three minutes after it began.\n\nNashville was different.\n\nTodd McGhee, a 24-year veteran with the Massachusetts State Police, said MNPD's response is a prime example of how a swift response can save lives.\n\n\"I would say that under extreme circumstances, they went above and beyond,\" said McGhee, who trains defense tactics and gun safety. \"Those first responding officers were the model response in how active shooter response should be.\n\n\"It could have been as bad as Uvalde, based on what Hale had for firepower.\"\n\nPolice release body camera footage\n\nPolice released a six minute compilation video of officers Rex Englebert and Michael Collazo body camera footage.\n\nThe video begins when Englebert arrived on scene where a staff member outside the school directed officers to the second floor of the school. Police quickly worked through the first floor clearing classrooms and encouraging each other to move faster.\n\nAs Englebert moved to the second floor, eight gunshots can be heard down the hallway. The officer rounded the corner and fired four shots. Officers approached Hale, who was laying on the ground next to a wide window overlooking the parking lot. Hale is visible in the video but is partially obscured by a blurred box.\n\nAbout the four-minute mark, the video cuts to Collazo's body camera. As he ascends the stairs to the second floor, an officer ahead of him looks left out.\n\n\"We've got one down,\" he says before turning right down the hallway.\n\nCollazo follows closely behind Englebert, then moves to the right of him firing four shots at Hale.\n\n\"Suspect down, suspect down,\" Collazo calls over the radio.\n\nDaughter of Covenant Presbyterian Church's lead pastor among victims\n\nHallie Scruggs was a student at the Covenant School. Hallie was the daughter of Chad Scruggs, who is the lead pastor at Covenant Presbyterian Church, according to a statement from his former church in Dallas.\n\n“We love the Scruggs family and mourn with them over their precious daughter Hallie,\" Mark Davis, senior pastor at Park Cities Presbyterian Church, said in a statement. \"Together, we trust in the power of Christ to draw near and give us the comfort and hope we desperately need.”\n\nPediatric surgeon recalls leaving school moments before shooting\n\nBritney Grayson was moments away from the shooting Monday.\n\nShe and her husband Micah Wilfong were speaking to students Monday morning about their mission trip to Kenya. After the talk, they left the school. Britney, a pediatric surgeon, pulled out her phone and answered a few text messages sitting in her car.\n\nAudrey Hale was already in the parking lot.\n\nGrayson pulled out of the parking lot about 10:12 a.m., she said.\n\nAt 10:13 a.m., Hale fired the first shot inside the school.\n\n“As a pediatric surgeon, my first thought was, if I had still been there, could I have rendered immediate aid to these victims,” Grayson said. “It’s hard, because if I had been there, maybe I could have been shot.”\n\n'Evil is very real'\n\nZion Presbyterian Church Senior Pastor Paul Joiner, who spoke slowly, deliberately and somberly, said many of church members were close to fellow congregants at Covenant Presbyterian Church \"up the road.\" The Zion community, mirroring the Covenant community, also houses a school, Zion Christian Academy, serving over 520 students in grades Pre-K-12.\n\n“This one hits close to home,” Joiner said. “We have become aware of the reality that we spend most of our lives wanting to deny, that this world is not safe. Evil is very real. Evil people do evil things. For some of us, these are our friends.”\n\n“The senior pastor lost a daughter today,” he said. “This is another PCA church school just up the road.

Police said Hale drove to the campus, parked and entered after shooting out the glass in a set of double doors.\n\n\"The police department response was swift,\" Aaron said. \"Officers entered the first story of the school and begin clearing it. They heard shots coming from the second level; they immediately went to the gunfire.\"\n\nAs officers approached, Hale fired upon them from a second story window, MNPD said. Police said Hale was armed with \"significant ammunition.\"\n\nHale was fatally shot by a five-member police team around 10:27 a.m. in a second floor lobby.\n\nWatch: Nashville police release footage from school shooting\n\nHale shot multiple rounds into glass doors to make entry into the school.

They say it's another example of a long history of poverty and neglect and question if the response would have been different if the party took place in an affluent, white-majority neighborhood.\n\nPolice have said the event was not permitted. Baltimore Police Commissioner Richard Worley said in July the police weren't aware the event was taking place until hours before the shooting unfolded.

The response to the attack in which 19 children and two teachers were killed has been denounced as an “abject failure” with enough blame to be spread widely.\n\nThe school police chief was fired and now seven DPS officers are being investigated for what they did – or did not – do. CNN has uncovered exclusively that Elizondo is one of those officers being investigated. A source close to the investigation also confirmed that to CNN.\n\nShe no longer works for DPS. During the summer, she was hired as a police officer for the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District, where her role is to protect some of the very same children who survived the Robb Elementary shooting.\n\nElizondo declined to speak with CNN in person, on the phone or by direct message.\n\nFollowing this CNN report, the school district issued a statement announcing her termination effective Thursday.\n\n“We are deeply distressed by the information that was disclosed yesterday evening concerning one of our recently hired employees, Crimson Elizondo,” the statement from the district said. “We sincerely apologize to the victim’s families and the greater Uvalde community for the pain that this revelation has caused. Ms. Elizondo’s statement in the audio is not consistent with the District’s expectations.”\n\n“Regarding the remaining UCISD Police Department employees, we continue to make personnel decisions based on verifiable information. An independent investigation is underway to evaluate the actions of the current officers on May 24, 2022. Additionally, we are awaiting results of a management and organizational review of the UCISD Police Department that will aid the district in taking informed actions to further ensure the safety and security of our schools,” the statement added.\n\nHowever, the Uvalde School District Police were informed as early as July 28 that Elizondo was subject to investigation by the department’s Office of Inspector General for actions “inconsistent with training and department requirements,” according to documents obtained by CNN in a public records request.\n\nIt is not clear from the letter which actions were subject to investigation.\n\nParents recognized her\n\nCrimson Elizondo was clearly visible on body camera footage from Uvalde police released by the mayor. Much other footage has not been made public. City of Uvalde\n\nUvalde CISD has said it wanted to recruit 10 more officers after the May 24 attack. It did not specifically announce the hiring of Elizondo over the summer, though the names and photos of her and four other police officers, one lieutenant and one security guard are on its website, under the banner “KEEP U.C.I.S.D. SAFE.”\n\nSuperintendent Hal Harrell told a special town hall meeting in August that at least 33 DPS officers would also be deployed around the district’s eight schools. After initial concern by residents that officers who failed to stop the killing would be tasked with school security, parent Brett Cross told CNN he had been assured the deployed DPS officers would not have been responders to the shooting.\n\nIn her new position, that restriction does not apply to Elizondo. Children and parents walked past her as they headed into the school year at Uvalde Elementary, the new home for the younger students who survived the Robb bloodshed.\n\nAnd some parents, including those who lost children in the massacre, recognized her from the body camera footage released by the mayor, family members told CNN.\n\n“We are disgusted and angry at Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District’s (UCISD) decision to hire Officer Crimson Elizondo. Her hiring puts into question the credibility and thoroughness of UCISD’s HR and vetting practices,” according to a statement from family representatives.\n\nIt made them feel uneasy, CNN has learned, yet another reminder of the deadly day in a town that is full of such reminders.\n\nBut they did not know that she was under investigation.\n\nIt’s also unclear if the school district knew of the investigation when she was hired.\n\nThe statement from family representatives calls for all department officers to be suspended pending a third-party investigation, and its results “must be released” to the public as well as families of the victims.\n\n“Our children have been taken from us. We will not stop fighting until we have answers and we ensure the safety of the children in our community is the top priority,” the statement said.\n\nCross, the legal guardian of Uziyah Garcia, one of the children killed at Robb Elementary, says he is “disgusted” by what the district has done.\n\n“I’m absolutely appalled,” he told CNN’s Anderson Cooper and says the school board met with him and offered to pull such officers to off-campus roles. He says he will continue to hold a vigil outside the school board offices until all officers are suspended.\n\nThe district and its staff have not responded to emails and calls and a personal approach from CNN about this story.\n\nSecret scrutiny\n\nTexas DPS, the state body that helps local law enforcement in major incidents, announced an internal review into its employees who responded to Robb.\n\nSources familiar with the investigation confirmed to CNN that Elizondo is one of seven officers whose conduct is being investigated by DPS, but neither their names nor their actions or inactions have been made public.\n\nIn a redacted internal memo to the organization’s director obtained by CNN, DPS cited “actions which may be inconsistent with training and requirements” as the reason for the officers being referred for investigation.\n\nSources familiar with the inquiry told CNN that Elizondo was not properly equipped and said to investigators that she was not comfortable going inside the school without her gear.\n\nElizondo was briefly inside the hallway while the attack was ongoing but was not wearing body armor. City of Uvalde\n\nFootage from police body cameras and those of other officers seen by CNN show Elizondo arriving at the outskirts of the school as one of the first officers to respond to the report of an armed man at Robb Elementary.\n\nShe gets out of her official vehicle but does not retrieve any tactical body armor or her long rifle, as officers are trained to do.\n\nShe does not approach the school but stays with officers from other agencies outside the fence until a call comes over the radio, “Shots fired inside the building!”\n\nElizondo runs with other officers to the eastern end of the building that housed connecting classrooms 111 and 112. Soon after, the responding officers are told that the shooter is contained in a room on the west side.\n\nAfter that, there plays out on the recordings the more than one hour of confusion and delay before anyone goes to help the trapped staff and students in rooms 111 and 112, the catalog of errors that has become part of the Uvalde tragedy.\n\nElizondo walked inside the building briefly but mostly stood outside.\n\nAs officers prepared for what became the final breach, she offered to help a colleague and went to gather supplies for him. She was away from the school when the gunman was shot and killed.\n\nWithin moments, the body camera recordings show, the hallway where so many had stood became a scene of carnage as officers got students out of the classrooms and assessed their injuries.\n\nElizondo was soon there, urging students to “go, go, go” if they were able, and not to look at their injuries or the blood on the floor. She comforted one boy as an officer checked his wounds, telling him time and again that she was there with him, that he would be OK and that his parents would soon be told.\n\nThe footage showed she traveled to the hospital in a school bus with students who were shot and traumatized, again helping to take care of them.\n\nDPS director Col. Steven McCraw said in August: “Every one of our officers will undergo scrutiny by the DA and an internal investigation – just because they didn’t violate the law, doesn’t mean they acted appropriately based on our policy.”\n\nTwo weeks later official notes of a meeting showed McCraw telling captains, “No one is losing their jobs.” McCraw told CNN he had been misquoted in the minutes and vowed “no one gets a pass.”\n\nElizondo, on the right in her new UCISD uniform, declined to talk to CNN. CNN\n\nHe said he would release all the information when he could, but the local district attorney has asked him not to do so until the criminal investigations are completed, a process he has acknowledged could take years.\n\nProsecutor Christina Mitchell Busbee will charge anyone who has committed a crime at Robb Elementary, including law enforcement officers, she’s said.\n\nCNN reached out to the Department of Public Safety, which declined to comment for this story.\n\nA coalition of news organizations including CNN is suing the DPS for records relating to the investigation that have been withheld from the media and public.\n\nSo far, the only person known to have lost their job over the response to the shooting has been school police chief Pedro “Pete” Arredondo, who was fired by the school board in August. Arredondo became the figurehead of the failed response, though he has said he did not consider himself the incident commander and has called to be reinstated.\n\nElizondo earned a base salary of $59,715 at DPS, according to a database compiled by The Texas Tribune, reflecting a 12% raise a year ago. She joined the department in 2018.\n\nHer new salary is not known, but a job posting for a similar role has a lower salary range, from $41,584 to $59,158.\n\nThat posting lists mental and physical demands of the position, including an “Ability to effectively deal with personal danger which may include sudden exposure to armed persons … under intense threatening conditions.”\n\nOn May 24, as she rode the school bus back to Robb Elementary from the hospital, she told another officer: “Nothing could prepare you for what they brought out.

More than 500 people sheltered throughout campus buildings, including in libraries and classrooms, he said.\n\nMonday classes at the university were canceled. The school canceled classes Tuesday to “to give “students the opportunity to reflect, mourn and gather with each other,” according to a news release. A family and community assistance center has also been set up on campus to provide UVA community members with mental health services, according to UVA Emergency Management officials.\n\nClasses were also canceled Monday at Charlottesville City Schools, the K-12 district said in a letter to families. A UVA men’s basketball game scheduled for Monday evening has also been canceled, the university said.\n\nIn a statement, an attorney for Perry’s parents thanked the communities in both Charlottesville and South Florida – Perry was originally from Miami, the university said – for “the outpouring of support during this impossibly tragic time.\n\nHappy and Sean Perry would not speak publicly at this time about their son’s death, attorney Michael Haggard said, out of respect for the university community, which “has been terrorized by another mass shooting in the United States.”\n\nSuspect had been known to campus police\n\nJones had come to campus authorities’ attention in September, when authorities found out Jones “had made a comment about possessing a gun” to someone “unaffiliated with the university,” Longo said at Monday’s news conference. But that person never actually saw the gun in question, he said.\n\nChristopher Darnell Jones Jr. University of Virginia Police\n\n“Through the course of the threat assessment team’s investigation, we learned of a prior criminal incident involving a concealed weapon violation that occurred outside the city of Charlotteville in February of 2021,” Longo said, adding the suspect was required to report that incident to the university but never did. The school’s judicial council took over the case, and the results are pending.\n\nJones was also involved in a hazing investigation on campus that was closed because witnesses would not cooperate, Longo said.\n\nIt is “important to share that information with you,” he said, “to let you know that he had been called to our attention.”\n\nJones is listed on UVA’s athletics website as a football player in 2018 who as a freshman did not participate in any games. He attended Varina High School and Petersburg High School, where he played football as a linebacker and running back, according to his university athletics bio. While in high school, Jones was Key Club president and a member of the National Honor Society and the National Technical Honor Society, the bio says.\n\nA UVA spokesperson told CNN Jones had a pre-existing injury that prevented him from playing on the football team in 2018. Jones went through medical treatment and rehabilitation during his time with the team and was only a member of the team for one season, the spokesperson says.\n\nThe spokesperson would not give details on Jones’ injury.\n\nFederal prosecutors working with local authorities\n\nBefore the lockdown was lifted, UVA students early Monday were told to “take the shelter in place commands seriously as the situation remains active,” vice president and chief student affairs officer Robyn Hadley said in an email to UVA’s student body.\n\n“We have all received several shelter in place texts, and they are frightening,” Hadley said, adding several police jurisdictions were working to find the suspect. “I am on grounds like many of you; I am sheltering in place and in direct touch with University leadership and UPD … If you are not inside and safe, immediately seek safety.”\n\nTwo UVA students who told CNN they were at the scene of the shooting Sunday night and saw part of it unfold described hearing faint popping noises and watching people flee the bus.\n\nThe students – both of whom are 21 and did not want to be identified – said they were walking to the gym when they saw the charter bus, still in motion. It was just after 10 p.m. when they heard the popping noises, the students said, but they didn’t think anything of it. The bus was going over a speed bump, they said, but then they saw it stop and saw emergency lights turn on.\n\nThe bus doors opened, the students said, and they saw people running out. The students told CNN they saw one fall to the ground.\n\nThe students hid behind a brick wall in front of the nearby band building before calling 911 around 10:17 p.m., they said. The call wasn’t answered, the students said, but they hung up when they heard sirens in the distance and saw law enforcement arrive.\n\nState and federal prosecutors are helping local agencies in the investigation, according to a joint statement from the US attorney for the Western District of Virginia and commonwealth’s attorneys for Charlottesville and for Albemarle County. The officials pledged to support the investigation and “bring possible charges in the appropriate jurisdiction,” the statement said.\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Monday called the shooting a “horrific tragedy” and praised the work of law enforcement for taking the suspect into custody, according to a tweet. “While there are still many details to uncover, let us lift up the entire community in prayer.” The governor earlier had said Virginia State Police were “fully coordinating” with school and local police.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris spoke on the shooting shortly after swearing in a new ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago on Monday.\n\n“It’s tragic,” Harris said. “Of course, our prayers are with the families of the victims and it’s just yet a constant reminder that we have to do better in terms of gun safety laws in our country.”\n\nMeantime, another US campus – the University of Idaho – is reeling after police announced a homicide inquiry after officers Sunday discovered four people deceased in a home just outside Moscow campus grounds. The deceased were students, and the cause of their deaths is not yet known, the university confirmed, adding the threat has ended.\n\nSeparately, Charlottesville Police arrested a man in connection to “threatening social media posts” against UVA on Monday, but said they don’t believe the threats were tied to the earlier shooting.\n\n“We understand the fear this caused in our community and acted swiftly to resolve this investigation,” a Charlottesville police news release said.\n\nSunday’s shooting is the University of Virginia’s latest high-profile run-in with violence: White nationalists in August 2017 marched across campus carrying torches and chanting racist slogans. A day later, demonstrators protesting Charlottesville’s plan to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee clashed with counterprotesters, one of whom was killed when a man drove his car into a crowd; that driver is serving life in prison.\n\nA UVA lacrosse player five years earlier was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison for the 2010 killing of his ex-girlfriend, Yeardley Love, in her off-campus apartment.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Dakin Andone Michelle Watson Carolyn Sung", "Amir Vera", "Dakin Andone", "Michelle Watson", "Carolyn Sung", "Federal Prosecutors Working With Local Authorities"], "publish_date": "2022/11/13"}]}

Democrats, in no hurry to resolve the GOP stalemate, tried to block the effort but failed.\n\nA voice vote was too close in a House currently without rules, and Democrats shouted for the clerk to hold a recorded vote. Members filed up to the rostrum to cast their votes, as others stood behind them and anxiously looked up at the House scoreboard.\n\nThe GOP, which ultimately has a four-vote majority in the House, won the debate 216-214, with at least two Republicans siding with Democrats.\n\nAfter six votes in two days, Wednesday night ended without a speaker in the House. A seventh vote likely blocking McCarthy, who is more than a dozen votes shy fo what he needs, would have ensued if the House had not adjourned. It's been 100 years since a speaker's election took more than one ballot.\n\nThe House reconvenes at noon Thursday, when McCarthy will resume his prolonged fight for speaker.\n\nThe situation, which has dragged on since Tuesday, has left Congress paralyzed, since no member of the House of Representatives can be sworn in and no rules can be adopted until a speaker is chosen.\n\nThe House remained stuck after McCarthy was nominated, several times, for the top job in that chamber. He appears to have failed again to have secured that job - for now.\n\nOn Tuesday, McCarthy was denied the 218 votes he needed by a cadre of Republican hardliners in three separate ballots.

Months\n\nNot since 1923 has a speaker’s election gone to multiple ballots.\n\nThe longest and most grueling fight for the gavel started in late 1855 and dragged out for two months, with 133 ballots, during debates over slavery in the run-up to the Civil War.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nTrump power? Ex-president hasn't moved the needle on McCarthy – and many Republicans noticed\n\nSo far, not a single Republican opponent of Kevin McCarthy has changed his or her vote after former President Donald Trump urged them to back McCarthy and move on.\n\n\"Currently on full display: how DEEPLY weakened Trump is,\" tweeted Alyssa Farah Griffin, an aide in the Trump White House. \"Even his staunchest allies aren’t afraid to defy him & his endorsement did nothing to get McCarthy more votes.\"\n\nMany Republicans pointed out the comments of Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., who said her \"favorite president\" asked her and other members of the anti-McCarthy faction to \"knock this off,\" but he should instead call McCarthy and tell him \"'you do not have the votes, and it's time to withdraw.'\"\n\nAfter that comment, Republican strategist Scott Jennings said: \"Not only are they disregarding Trump but they are now ORDERING HIM AROUND. Unbelievable!\"\n\nTrump has faced rising criticism since the November elections; many Republicans blamed the ex-president for the party's disappointing showing, not to mention the many investigations swirling around him.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPreviously:Republican support for Trump's 2024 bid falls amid political, legal setbacks\n\nGOP: Lack of speaker means lack of security clearances\n\nA group of GOP members-elect said without a speaker, they lack access to secure facilities where they receive daily briefs related to the nation's security.\n\nFollowing McCarthy's sixth failed attempt at speaker, Wisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher said during a press conference that he was supposed to meet with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs to talk about matters in the Indo-Pacific, but was informed by House security that he does not have a clearance.\n\n“My point is we have work to do that we can’t do right now,” Gallagher, who is a member of the Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, said.\n\nMichigan Rep.

McCarthy also fell short in three votes on Tuesday; he needs 218 to prevail, and it's unclear how he can get there.\n\nA group of 20 conservatives again voted for Byron Donalds on the sixth ballot, as they did on ballots four and five.\n\nA former McCarthy supporter, Victoria Spartz, voted \"present.\"\n\nDemocratic leader Hakeem Jeffries remained the top vote getter, with the support of 212 Democratic colleagues.\n\nThe House then adjourned until 8 p.m.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nDay two of Congress:As Santos fiddles with his phone, investigators circle, speaker votes are cast\n\nMcCarthy appears to lose sixth House speaker vote\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy lost a sixth vote in his bid for speaker, putting an exclamation point on two long days that have not gone in his favor.\n\nRep. Kat Cammack of Florida described his sixth nomination as “Groundhog Day” and urged fellow Republicans to unite and get things done for the American people.\n\nBut an opposition group within his own party, largely led by conservative Reps.

Here's how the process works.\n\nJeffries nominated for the sixth time\n\nWith little movement so far on who will become speaker, Aguilar nominated Jeffries again for the sixth time.\n\n“Democrats are united behind a speaker who will build safer communities,” said Aguilar, referring to Democratic priorities on gun control legislation. “A leader who has a track record in actually getting things done.”\n\n-- Ken Tran\n\nPreviously:Hakeem Jeffries elected House Democratic leader, making history as first Black lawmaker to lead a major party in Congress\n\nTaylor Greene: House speaker vote 'embarrassing'\n\nAs the House moved to a sixth ballot to determine who will win the speaker’s gavel, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called her party’s inability to pick a speaker “embarrassing.”\n\n“I hope it’s over soon because, to be honest with you, I find it embarrassing,” Greene told reporters on her way back to the House floor.\n\nGreene also gave credit to Democrats for being able to work together, saying that she thinks the GOP “should find ways to work together.”\n\n- Sarah Elbeshbishi\n\nCammack says it’s “Groundhog Day” as she nominates McCarthy\n\nGOP Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida called it “Groundhog Day” as she nominated House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy for speaker – his sixth nomination in two days.\n\nShe said the American people don’t care about who’s going to be speaker; they care about getting results to problems, such as the ongoing opioid crisis and “open border.”\n\n“They didn’t send us to be perpetual critics,” Cammack said. “They sent us to get things done.”\n\nIt’s time to unite and do the people’s business, she said.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nQuest for the gavel:Kevin McCarthy was once rejected for a House internship. Now he could become the next speaker\n\nNo change for McCarthy on the fifth ballot\n\nThe fifth ballot went the same as the fourth, according to the official House tally: McCarthy again won 201 votes, well short of the 218 he needs to become speaker.\n\nAgain, 20 Republicans voted for a non-McCarthy alternative, Byron Donalds.\n\nAgain, former McCarthy supporter Victoria Spartz voted \"present.\"\n\nAnd, again, Hakeem Jeffries racked up 212 votes from fellow Democrats.\n\nOn toward a sixth ballot.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nCould Jeffries win the speakership?\n\nJeffries has consistently received 212 votes in each of the ballots—gaining the support of every Democrat in the House and surpassing the number of ballots for McCarthy. But it is highly unlikely that Jeffries would win the speakership.\n\nIt would require a member, or multiple members, of the Republican party to reach across the aisle and cast a ballot in support of the opposite party.\n\nThe last time a lawmaker voted for the opposite political party was in 2001. Democratic Rep. Jim Traficant from Ohio voted for the Republican speaker nominee. The Democratic party stripped him of all committee assignments in response.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWho is Hakeem Jeffries?:What to know about the Brooklyn Rep. nominated for Congress\n\nDonalds: ‘I never came here to try to be speaker’\n\nFlorida Rep. Byron Donalds, who received 20 votes in the last ballot, said he expects the speaker to be elected today, but added that serving in the top leadership position was never his intention. He said he anticipates meeting with McCarthy later today.\n\n“I didn’t come to DC being interested in becoming speaker of the House,” he said, adding, however, that he understands the responsibility of making sure the Republican conference can govern. “I’m going to help do that in any way I can,” he said.\n\n“The time of leadership by acclamation, those days are over,” he said.\n\n-- Rachel Looker\n\nMcCarthy appears to lose fifth vote\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy appears to have lost his bid for speaker a fifth consecutive time, continuing a string of stinging defeats and a tumultuous day in the lower chamber.\n\nMcCarthy lost three times Tuesday and twice so far Wednesday. There could be more votes this afternoon, as no member in either party has motioned to adjourn.\n\nBefore the fifth vote, multiple McCarthy allies worked to end the impasse with his 20 detractors, but the count proved out of their favor.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nWho is McCarthy?:Kevin McCarthy was once rejected for a House internship. Now he could become the next speaker\n\nWho voted present today on the fourth ballot?\n\nOn the fourth ballot for speaker, Indiana Republican Rep. Victoria Spartz opted to vote “present” after backing McCarthy in the previous three ballots, in another blow to McCarthy’s chances of securing the speakership.\n\n“We have a constitutional duty to elect the speaker of the House, but we have to deliberate further as a Republican conference until we have enough votes and stop wasting everyone’s time.” Spartz said. “None of the Republican candidates have this number yet. That’s why I voted present after all votes were cast.”\n\nNo member from McCarthy’s opposition has yet to flip and vote for McCarthy as speaker.\n\n-- Ken Tran\n\nA new Congress with new priorities:What to know on investigations, the fate of Biden's agenda and more\n\nTrump has been calling GOP lawmakers to urge support for McCarthy, Boebert says\n\nGOP Rep. Lauren Boebert in her nominating remarks shook off Trump’s endorsement of McCarthy.\n\n“Let’s stop with the campaign smears and tactics to get people to turn against us,” said Boebert. “Even having my favorite president call us and tell us we need to knock this off, I think it actually needs to be reversed.”\n\n“The president needs to tell Kevin McCarthy, ‘Sir you do not have the votes and it’s time to withdraw.’” said Boebert to cheers from McCarthy’s opposition.\n\n-- Ken Tran\n\nThrowback:Lawmakers sound off on recorded call of Kevin McCarthy saying Trump should resign over Jan. 6\n\nBoebert nominates Donalds\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert nominated Rep. Byron Donalds for House speaker, his second nomination of the day.\n\nAlong with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ nomination, it marks the first day two Black men have been nominated speaker.\n\nBoebert said Donalds will uphold conservative principles and build consensus.

MAGA lawmakers Greene and Boebert spar over Kevin McCarthy's speaker bid\n\nAguilar nominates Jeffries for the fifth time\n\nAfter the fourth ballot was officially tallied, the House went straight to a fifth ballot with Aguilar nominating Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries on the Democratic side again.\n\n“Madam Clerk, the lead vote getter in the last four tallies, Democrats are united behind a speaker who will work to codify the right to seek an abortion into law,” said Aguilar, referencing a key Democratic priority to enshrine abortion rights into federal law.\n\nIn all of the last four ballots, Jeffries earned the complete support of his Democratic colleagues at 212 votes.\n\n-- Ken Tran\n\nWho is Hakeem Jeffries in Congress?:What to know about the Brooklyn Rep. set to replace Pelosi\n\nDavidson gives McCarthy fifth nomination\n\nRep. Warren Davidson, an Ohio Republican who took former Speaker John Boehner’s seat, nominated Rep. Kevin McCarthy Wednesday immediately following the House GOP leader’s fourth loss for speaker.\n\nDavidson pointed out that there may be some members who don’t trust McCarthy, but said there are about 200 members who don’t trust the leader’s 20 detractors.\n\nAfter rattling off a list of concessions he said McCarthy has made to those voting against him, Davidson said, “Kevin McCarthy engaged in that negotiation. He led the Congress to adopt substantive reforms that will make our majority more effective.”\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nRound four: Another loss for McCarthy\n\nThe fourth ballot, the first of Wednesday, went a little worse for McCarthy.\n\nThe struggling speaker candidate officially wound up with only 201 votes, fewer than the numbers he took on the three ballots on Tuesday, according to the House clerk. One of his previous supporters, Victoria Spartz of Indiana, voted \"present\" on Wednesday.\n\nMcCarthy needs 218 votes to win the speaker's job, and he is moving a little farther away.\n\nThis despite a morning endorsement from Donald Trump and heavy lobbying from allies who say all this is making the Republicans look bad.\n\nDespite the pressure, McCarthy opponents who supported Jim Jordan for speaker on Monday backed a new challenger on Tuesday, Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida. He received 20 votes, the same number Jordan got on Tuesday's third ballot.\n\nThe stalemate again allowed Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries to become the top vote getter with 212 Democrats, but without the majority needed to prevail.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhat's happening in the House:Who are the Republicans balking at Kevin McCarthy as a House speaker?\n\nMcCarthy appears to lose fourth ballot\n\nThe outlook for Kevin McCarthy grew dimmer Wednesday afternoon when the House GOP leader appeared to have lost his bid for speaker a fourth consecutive time.\n\nIt was a crucial vote for McCarthy, who after losing three times yesterday worked to find a path forward today. He and his allies have tried to both sway his opponents and also persuade some of them to vote “present,” making it easier for him to win with a lower voting majority.\n\nOn Wednesday, it was evident McCarthy did little to advance when he did not pick up any votes.\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nGallagher nominates McCarthy for speaker\n\nRep. Mike Gallagher. a Wisconsin Republican, nominated House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy for speaker – his fourth nomination in two days.\n\n“I wish we had a bigger majority,” Gallagher said, “but the American people gave us an opportunity.”\n\nMcCarthy is not asking for a vote to keep business as usual, Gallagher said. The leader wants to do the people’s business, he said.\n\nGaetz challenges McCarthy over office space\n\nIt's really gotten personal between aspiring House Speaker McCarthy and conservative critic Matt Gaetz.\n\nGaetz has asked the Architect of the Capitol to investigate McCarthy for moving stuff into the Speaker of the House's suite of offices, even though he failed to actually win the job during three ballots on Tuesday.\n\n\"How long will he remain there before he is considered a squatter?\" the Florida Republican said in a letter to the architect's office.\n\nAnother McCarthy opponent, Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, re-tweeted Gaetz's complaint and amplified the itinerant metaphor: \"McCarthy is squatting in the Speaker’s office.\"\n\nFor his part, McCarthy and his allies have criticized Gaetz for saying he would rather see Democrat Hakeem Jeffries win the speaker's job than McCarthy.\n\nStay tuned for more news about McCarthy's political future – and his office.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMike Pence chimes in, urges House GOP to elect McCarthy as speaker\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence offered his perspective on McCarthy’s battle, urging House Republicans “to support my friend, Kevin McCarthy as the next speaker of the House.”\n\n“@GOPLeader’s (McCarthy's) leadership & vision led to the new Republican majority & I know Speaker McCarthy will lead the House to begin a great American comeback!” Pence tweeted.\n\n-- Ken Tran\n\nAguilar: ‘Crisis of the Congress’\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar of California, the House Democratic Caucus chair, reiterated support for Jeffries Wednesday morning and said he will be nominating Jeffries during the speaker votes this afternoon. All 212 Democrats voted for Jeffries Tuesday during the three ballots.\n\n“This is a crisis of the congress,” Aguilar said of yesterday’s proceedings.\n\nHe added that Democrats have not had any outreach with their colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Ted Lieu said the speakership position has already weakened from the inability of the Republican caucus to unite and select a speaker, noting that Democrats are also at a standstill and can’t appoint members to committees.\n\n“They’ve already weakened that position,” Lieu said of the speakership, referencing McCarthy’s concessions including the motion to vacate.\n\n- Rachel Looker and Sarah Elbeshbishi\n\n'The rest of the world is looking': Biden calls GOP House speaker fight ‘embarrassing’\n\nPresident Joe Biden called Republicans’ fight over electing a new House speaker “embarrassing,” “not a good look” and “not my problem” as he sought to contrast the chaos in House with a focus on governing.\n\n“I hope they get their act together,” Biden told reporters Wednesday, adding that “the rest of the world is looking” and he is focused on “getting things done.”\n\nBiden, speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, was en route to Kentucky. There he will appear with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and other officeholders of both parties to promote bipartanship by showcasing a major bridge project funded by federal infrastructure dollars.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nGaetz: Trump won't change my mind about opposing McCarthy\n\nMatt Gaetz, an outspoken supporter of Donald Trump, is saying Trump's endorsement of McCarthy won't shake his opposition to the latter's candidacy for House speaker.\n\n\"Sad!\" Gaetz said in a Wednesday statement to Fox News Digital. \"This changes neither my view of McCarthy nor Trump nor my vote.\"\n\nIn a Truth Social post hours earlier, Trump hit the all-caps button to say to Republican dissidents: \"VOTE FOR KEVIN, CLOSE THE DEAL, TAKE THE VICTORY.\"\n\nGaetz is especially close to Trump; he once endorsed Trump himself for the speaker's job. If Trump can't change his mind, it's hard to see many of the 20 or so opponents of McCarthy changing theirs.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhat about George Santos?\n\nAs if the GOP didn't have enough distractions.\n\nRep.-elect George Santos, of New York, has been embroiled in controversy after reports found he made up multiple parts of his biography during the 2022 midterm campaign.\n\nThe 34-year-old Republican, who is under investigation by New York prosecutors, admitted he lied about his educational achievements, his ancestry and his employment. He was in the chamber Tuesday for the speaker vote and is expected to be there Wednesday.\n\nOn the first three ballots, Santos voted for McCarthy. Like all other members of the House, he can take part in the vote for speaker though he won't be sworn in until after one is chosen.\n\nTrump calls for members to vote for McCarthy\n\nIn a new Truth Social post Wednesday morning, Former President Donald Trump called on Republican House members to support Kevin McCarthy.\n\n“Vote for Kevin, close the deal, take the victory,” Trump said in all caps.\n\nHe urged Republicans: “Do not turn a great triumph into a giant & embarrassing defeat.”\n\nTrump said it’s time to celebrate, seemingly referring to the GOP’s four-vote majority in the House.\n\n“Kevin McCarthy will do a good job, and maybe even a great job – just watch!” he said in closing.\n\nMcCarthy’s most fervent opponents are some of Trump’s biggest supporters. It remains to be seen if they will be swayed by his endorsement Wednesday morning.\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nWhat to expect today\n\nThe House formally gavels in at noon, but both Republicans and Democrats will be meeting throughout the morning.\n\nOn the Republican side, Rep. Kevin McCarthy and his allies are working on two fronts: they are trying to negotiate with his detractors to sway their votes to his side and they’re also trying to get some members to vote “present” rather than for a named candidate. Voting present would ultimately help McCarthy boost his numbers and lower the threshold for which he needs to become speaker.\n\nOn the Democratic side, House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar and Vice Chair Ted Lieu will hold a press conference at 10:45 a.m. after their closed caucus meeting that starts at 9 a.m. Look for Democrats to take questions on whether they will help Republicans by having some members absent from the chamber today, lowering the overall voting majority and number McCarthy would need to clinch the speakership.\n\nLast night, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said his caucus is focused on having a working partnership with Republicans to pass bipartisan legislation, but they’re not responsible for helping the GOP get organized.\n\nOnce the House gavels in at noon, members-elect could choose to vote again for speaker or adjourn again to allow for more negotiations.\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nWhat changed overnight?\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy is shifting his strategy to become speaker of the House – or at least he’s shifting the way he’s talking about it.\n\nWhen a confident, almost defiant, McCarthy spoke during and after a Republican conference meeting Tuesday morning, he had said he wasn’t making any more concessions to appease the most conservative flank of his party and that he had “earned” the speakership.\n\nBy Tuesday night at the Capitol, after he had lost three votes to become speaker, he said he wanted all views to be represented on House committees and that negotiations were ongoing between his more than 200 supporters and 20 detractors.\n\nMcCarthy also said he had a new path to the speakership. Rather than focusing on the 218 votes needed to win the speakership outright, he mentioned 11 votes last night he needs to flip. A lot of that strategy involves getting some of his 20 dissenters to vote “present” rather than for a named candidate, which would allow him to win the speakership with a lower majority of votes.\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nWhat could happen next?\n\nMembers will continue to vote — again and again potentially when they come back at noon. The vote could last for days, weeks or months until a speaker candidate receives enough votes. This leaves the House paralyzed since no member can be sworn in, no rules can be adopted and no legislative business can be conducted until a speaker is chosen\n\nMcCarthy could drop out of the race for speaker, leaving an opening for another Republican to win the speakership. As of Tuesday afternoon, no McCarthy challengers have come close to gaining enough votes to win the speakership. During the three ballots, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, former New York Rep. Lee Zeldin and New York Rep. Byron Donalds received votes.\n\nAs a last resort, lawmakers could adopt a resolution that would elect a speaker by a plurality or by rank-choice voting instead of a simple majority.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nMore:McCarthy denied, Santos in House: 5 takeaways from the tumultuous first day of a new Congress\n\nMore:What can Congress do about Rep.-elect George Santos, who lied ahead of winning his election?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/01/02/house-speaker-vote-explained/10912271002/", "title": "How the House picks a speaker: What happens after McCarthy loses?", "text": "The first day of the 118th Congress ended Tuesday without a new House speaker. Voting resumed Wednesday – and still no speaker.\n\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy failed to secure enough votes to become speaker of the House on six ballotsover both days, heightening tumult around the new GOP majority. For the first time in a century, the House was unable to pick a speaker on the first vote.\n\nThe speaker is the most powerful role in Congress, in line behind the vice president to succeed the president should the commander in chief be incapacitated. But the more immediate and prominent authority the speaker wields is controlling the agenda and committee assignments that shape legislation in the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nWhen Republicans took the majority in November's midterm elections, McCarthy became the top contender for the speakership after GOP lawmakers elected to keep him last month as head of the caucus. But a faction of the party balked at giving him the support he would need to secure the position.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., challenged McCarthy for the powerful leadership role and earned 10 votes on the first ballot Tuesday. By Wednesday, Biggs appeared to be out of the running for the gavel as did Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, who received 20 votes on the third ballot. Florida GOP Rep. Byron Donalds became the McCarthy alternative, earning 20 votes on the fourth, fifth and sixth ballots.\n\nIn contrast, every one of the 212 elected Democrats voted for Rep.

Here's how the election works and what could happen if McCarthy does not reach the vote threshold needed for the speakership.\n\nHow does the speaker vote process begin?\n\nPrior the start of a new Congress, both parties hold a private meeting where they elect the party leadership for the next Congress. This takes place before Jan. 3, the official start of the new term when all House members vote for the speaker.\n\nA candidate only needs a majority of votes from their respective party to win the endorsement in the private meeting for leadership.\n\nEven if a colleague votes against a candidate in the private caucus meeting, the party typically sticks together to back their nominee on the House floor in January, according to Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Government Affairs Institute.\n\nMore:A poor GOP showing in the midterms could hamper Kevin McCarthy's path to be House speaker\n\nHowever, when the whole House votes, anyone can be nominated. And just a few votes in opposition to a candidate from their own party could cost them the speakership if the majority is narrow as is the case with the Republicans: as few as five GOP House members could block the party leader from winning the gavel.\n\n\"Which creates a scenario where people could dissent, a very small faction could stop you from winning on the floor in your own party,\" Glassman said.\n\nHow is the speaker vote held?\n\nThe clerk of the House from the prior Congress gavels in the opening session and presides as speaker until one is elected.\n\nThe clerk first calls for a quorum to establish that enough members are present to conduct business and then proceeds immediately to the speaker election – before the swearing in of newly elected members.\n\nThe clerk calls lawmakers in alphabetical order by last name who then announce their choice for speaker by calling out the last name of the candidate. This differs from the usual electronic voting conducted in the House on legislation.\n\nCandidates for speaker are nominated from the floor by members of their parties. There is always one Democratic nominee and one Republican, but the speaker does not have to be a member of the majority party or even a member of Congress.\n\nHow many votes are needed to be chosen as Speaker?\n\nThe magic number is 218 – kind of.\n\nA candidate requires votes from a majority of lawmakers who are voting to be elected speaker. That means if all 435 members are present and voting, the number of votes needed is 218.\n\nBut lawmakers can decide to skip the vote, or vote \"present,\" which reduces the vote threshold needed to win the speakership. Speakers Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and John Boehner, R-Ohio, both won the speakership without reaching 218 votes.\n\nMore:Kevin McCarthy wants to block three Democrats from committees if he becomes House speaker\n\nIn the new Congress, all 434 members (one fewer than 435 because Virginia Rep. Donald McEachin recently died and a successor has yet to be chosen) can vote. If the results, for example, are: 216 votes for McCarthy, 212 for a Democratic candidate and 6 representatives vote for someone else, the 216 votes would not be the majority of 434 needed for the speakership. McCarthy would come up short.\n\nHowever, if those six representatives do not vote for someone else, they don't count toward the total votes needed. This lowers the threshold to 428, meaning a 216 vote could secure the speakership for McCarthy.\n\nGlassman said this is often used as a tactic by speaker candidates who convince their colleagues to, in essence, abstain as a compromise between voting for another candidate and supporting their candidacy.\n\n\"That's certainly a viable strategy,\" he said.\n\nWhat happens if a candidate doesn't get the majority of votes?\n\nIf the first ballot fails to provide a speaker, lawmakers will continue to vote until a candidate receives a majority. Members can vote for different candidates each ballot.\n\nIt's not common that there is more than one ballot, but it has happened.\n\nIn 1923, it took multiple ballots – nine – to elect a speaker. On three occasions prior to the Civil War, a speaker was not elected on the first ballot. In one instance, it took 133 ballots over a period of two months.\n\nAs a last resort, lawmakers can adopt a resolution that would elect a speaker by a plurality or by rank-choice voting instead of a simple majority.\n\nGlassman said McCarthy needs at least 213 votes because the 212 House Democrats are likely going to all back their party leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Of the remaining nine GOP lawmakers who have expressed reservations about supporting McCarthy, the California Republican will need some combination of votes for him, \"present\" vote or no votes.\n\n\"The important thing functionally is nothing else happens in the House until they have a speaker,\" Glassman said, adding that the House won't be able to adopt rules, assign committees or consider legislation until the speaker is chosen.\n\nHow do members typically vote?\n\nLawmakers traditionally vote for their party's nominee, but some in recent years have chosen to vote \"present\" or not vote.\n\n\"This is sort of a modern thing in the last 10 years,\" Glassman said. \"We've had members of the majority party threatening not to vote for their party's nominee on the floor.\"\n\nHe cites one reason as the current media environment where outliers realize they can gain attention from opposing a speaker nominee and separate themselves from the leadership to appeal to voters.\n\nMore:Nancy Pelosi's legacy: 'A troublemaker with a gavel' leaves her mark, from health care to impeachment\n\n\"It's a way to stand out,\" he said.\n\nThe last to vote for the opposite political party was Democratic Rep. Jim Traficant from Ohio. He voted in 2001 for the Republican speaker nominee and faced severe consequences: Democrats stripped him of his committee assignments.\n\nHow will this play out for McCarthy?\n\nA two-month speakership election is not likely.\n\nMcCarthy won the closed-door vote leadership election, and by wide margins, after facing challenger Biggs, the Republican of Arizona and a member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe votes on Tuesday and Wednesday, which included all members of the House and not just the Republican party, have yet to put McCarthy – or anyone else – over the vote threshold to win the speakership.\n\nThe speaker vote could play out in a few ways.\n\nMembers will continue to vote for days, weeks or months until a speaker candidate receives enough votes, which means no other legislative business will be conducted and members will not be officially sworn in.\n\nOne option for McCarthy is to continue to try to bargain with his colleagues to gain enough votes, though that hasn't worked so far. He could also drop out of the race for speaker, leaving an opening for another Republican to win the gavel.\n\nDespite the repeated ballots, no McCarthy challengers have come close to gaining the majority of votes for the gavel.\n\n\"If none of those things happen, then you're in for a real chaos situation because then you have to try to find candidates somewhere in the party who weren't even on the radar screen,\" Glassman said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/politics/house-leadership-elections/index.html", "title": "What to know about upcoming House leadership elections | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA new Congress won’t be sworn in until January and control of the House has not yet been determined, but Republicans appear on track to recapture the chamber and the race to determine who will serve as the next speaker is underway.\n\nHouse GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has officially declared his bid for the speakership, but is already facing headwinds from members of the hardline, pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus who are threatening to withhold their support as they hope to extract concessions.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Nancy Pelosi, the current House speaker, has not yet made clear what her next move will be. Speculation has intensified in Washington over her political future and whether she will run again for the top leadership spot for House Democrats or if she will instead decide to step aside as a new generation of potential leaders waits in the wings.\n\nTiming for internal GOP leadership elections – and the speaker vote\n\nThe vote to elect the next speaker will take place in January at the start of the new Congress, but House Republicans will hold their internal leadership elections to pick a Speaker nominee this week.\n\nRepublicans are scheduled to hold a candidate forum on Monday evening, followed by leadership elections on Tuesday, November 15, according to a copy of the schedule shared with CNN.\n\nThe elections are conducted behind closed doors and are done via secret ballot. In the GOP’s internal leadership elections, McCarthy only needs a simple majority to win his party’s nomination for speaker. That is expected to happen, but McCarthy could still fall short of 218 votes – the magic number needed to win the speaker’s gavel in January.\n\nDuring that speaker vote, McCarthy will have a higher hurdle to clear. The full House holds a vote on the floor for Speaker and to win, a candidate needs to win a majority of all members, which amounts to 218 votes if no member skips the vote or votes “present.”\n\nWhen will Democrats hold their election?\n\nHouse Democrats will hold their internal leadership elections later – the week after Thanksgiving.\n\nHouse Democratic leadership elections have been announced for Wednesday, November 30. Voting will take place behind closed doors via secret ballot using an app.\n\nTo be elected to any position in Democratic leadership, a candidate needs to win a majority among those present and voting. If more than two candidates run and no one wins a majority, the candidate with the fewest votes after the first round of voting will be eliminated and voting will proceed to a second round. That process continues until one candidate wins a majority.\n\nWhoever is elected for the top leadership spot in the House Democratic caucus would serve as their party’s Speaker nominee. But if Republicans have a majority, that nominee would be expected to fall short in the vote by the full House in the Speaker’s election in January and would be poised to become House Minority Leader instead.\n\nThe first election on November 30 will be for the next House Democratic Caucus Chair and whoever is elected to that role will administer the rest of the leadership elections.\n\nWho to watch in GOP leadership elections\n\nMcCarthy has been working the phones locking down support from across the conference and has received former President Donald Trump’s endorsement. But even if he becomes his party’s speaker nominee, as is expected, he could still face a rocky road to securing the gavel.\n\nMembers of the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus are threatening to withhold support for McCarthy’s speakership bid and have begun to lay out their list of demands, putting the California Republican’s path to securing 218 votes in peril if the party ultimately takes the House with a slim majority. Members of the caucus are emboldened by the likelihood of a narrow House GOP majority – which would make the margins for McCarthy’s vote math tight.\n\nMcCarthy and his team are confident he will ultimately get the votes to be speaker. And two would-be challengers, Reps. Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise, the current House GOP whip, have lined up behind his speakership bid.\n\nBut if enough members of the Freedom Caucus withhold their support, it could imperil his speaker bid or force him to make deals to weaken the speakership, something he has long resisted.\n\nCNN reported Sunday that Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, a former chairman of the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus, is considering mounting a long-shot challenge to McCarthy, according to GOP sources familiar with the matter. McCarthy’s team has been prepared for this possibility.\n\nIf a challenger does emerge, it would be more of a protest candidate than a serious one. But the House Freedom Caucus is hoping to show McCarthy during the internal GOP leadership elections that he doesn’t have the floor votes for speaker, in hopes of forcing him to the negotiating table.\n\nRepublican races besides leader of the party\n\nAside from the speaker’s race, Republicans’ underwhelming performance in the midterms has scrambled other leadership races.\n\nThe race for House GOP whip – a position that will only open up if Republicans win the majority – was already competitive, though Rep. Tom Emmer, who chairs the House GOP’s campaign arm, was seen as having the edge since he was likely to be rewarded if they had a strong night.\n\nNow, Republicans say it could be tougher for Emmer to pull out a win.\n\nEmmer told reporters Tuesday he still plans to run and that he doesn’t know if a smaller majority impacts his bid. But his pitch to members is similar to McCarthy’s, saying: “we delivered.”\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, a Trump ally and the head of the conservative Republican Study Committee, also officially declared his candidacy for the whip’s position. And Rep. Drew Ferguson of Georgia, the current deputy whip, is also vying for the post, arguing that his experience on the whip’s team will be even more valuable in a slimmer majority, where the chief vote counting job will be crucial for governing.\n\nWho to watch: Nancy Pelosi\n\nWhat happens in Democratic leadership elections revolves around the key question of what Pelosi decides to do.\n\nPelosi was asked by CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday whether she would make a decision on running for leadership before the party’s leadership elections.\n\n“Of course. Well, you know that I’m not asking anybody – people are campaigning, and that’s a beautiful thing,” the California Democrat told Bash. “And I’m not asking anyone for anything. My members are asking me to consider doing that. But, again, let’s just get through the election.”\n\nIf Pelosi decides to run again for the top leadership spot for House Democrats, it will make clear that she is not yet ready to relinquish her role atop the House Democratic caucus. Pelosi, a towering figure in Democratic politics, commands widespread support among her members and is viewed as an effective leader within her party.\n\nBut if she runs again for leadership, such a move would also likely surprise, and even frustrate, many in Washington, including members of her own party, who have been anticipating that she might step aside for a new generation of leadership to take the reins.\n\nIf Pelosi does not run for the top leadership post, it would set the stage for a major shakeup in House Democratic leadership and mark the end of an era for Washington. The move would kick off a fight for her successor that could expose divisions within the party as other prominent members of the party look to move up the leadership ladder.\n\nPelosi’s future freezes much of the Democratic races\n\nUntil Pelosi makes her announcement, much of the rest of the field is expected to remain essentially frozen in place.\n\nCurrently, Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer serves as the No. 2 House Democrat, in the role of House majority leader, and South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn serves in the role of House majority whip. Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark serves in the role of assistant Speaker and New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries serves as House Democratic caucus chair.\n\nAs potential candidates for the higher rungs of House Democratic leadership wait to see what Pelosi does before publicly making moves, some Democrats vying for other positions in their party’s leadership have already announced their candidacy.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado, who currently serves as the co-chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, has announced his run for caucus chair to replace Jeffries who is term limited.\n\nThe race to lead the party’s campaign arm, DCCC chair, is starting to take shape up after the current chair Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York lost his reelection.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Tony Cardenas of California announced his race for the spot on Friday but others are being floated as well including Reps.

The California Republican tapped a group of members to be on his whip team that will help him secure the 218 votes in order to win the speakership in January, with GOP lawmakers on the call promising to “work hard to get him elected,” according to a source familiar with the matter. And several allies were seen popping in and out of McCarthy’s office on Wednesday as they started to hash out and execute their game plan.\n\n“Yes,” McCarthy said confidently Wednesday night as he left the Capitol and was asked if he had the votes to assume the speakership.\n\nBut McCarthy’s easy ascension to the speakership will be determined in large part by the size of a potential GOP majority. If McCarthy maintains a narrow majority, then the pro-Trump House Freedom Caucus could stand in the way of his leadership ambitions. CNN has not yet projected a Republican takeover of the chamber.\n\nA source familiar with the House Freedom Caucus’ deliberations told CNN on Wednesday morning that there are around two dozen current and incoming members who are willing to vote against McCarthy if he doesn’t offer them concessions. They are actively discussing putting up a nominal challenger to face McCarthy in next week’s leadership elections in an effort to force the GOP leader to give them more influence in how the House operates, the source said.\n\nMcCarthy, who sent a letter to the conference Wednesday afternoon officially declaring his bid for the speakership and asking members for their support, spoke with some potential GOP holdouts behind closed doors throughout the day, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the controversial conservative who was booted from her committee assignments by Democrats – and a number of Republicans – over her past incendiary rhetoric. Greene has pushed for a spot on the powerful House Oversight Committee in a GOP majority.\n\nLeaving McCarthy’s office, Greene would not say if she’d get what she’s been seeking.\n\n“No comment,” Greene said when asked if she’d support McCarthy for speaker.\n\nNext week’s leadership election is just the first step in the process. McCarthy would need to win a majority of his conference’s support next week to be nominated for speaker before a January vote when he would need 218 votes of the full House to win the gavel. The hope, the source said, is that if they back a challenger to McCarthy in next week’s elections, it would force the California Republican to cut a deal in order to secure their support in the January speaker’s race when he wouldn’t be able to afford to lose more than a handful of GOP votes in a narrow Republican majority.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus’ strategy will come into sharper focus by week’s end as members weigh their options and as incoming lawmakers come to Washington for initial meetings. Rep. Matt Gaetz, an unabashed McCarthy critic who is not a member of the Freedom Caucus but is closely aligned with the group, also started calling members to talk strategy about the speaker’s race, according to a source familiar.\n\nAmong their demands: Making it easier for individual members to call for a vote ousting a sitting speaker, an idea that McCarthy has long rejected and one that was wielded over former Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio. The same source said that the Freedom Caucus wants more representation on the panel that makes selections on members’ committee assignments. They are also calling on GOP leaders to commit to slowing down the legislative process and give them more time to review even non-controversial bills.\n\nHardliners may also push for promises related to launching investigations and impeachment proceedings into President Joe Biden or members of his Cabinet.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican and former chairman of the Freedom Caucus, told a right-wing streaming network that a McCarthy speakership should not be a “foregone conclusion,” complaining that a red wave never materialized and accusing McCarthy of “backpedaling” on impeachment.\n\n“McCarthy has a lot of chips to cash in,” said a senior GOP source. “But he’s gonna have to cash in every single one of them.”\n\nMcCarthy could also win over detectors with plum committee assignments, lush office space and other perks. Prior to Tuesday, there was also talk of adding an extra leadership position to his team, which could also be used to woo critics.\n\nMcCarthy allies are touting his Tuesday endorsement from former President Donald Trump for the speaker’s gavel, something that could help with staunch Trump backers in the House GOP conference. Moreover, McCarthy has long moved to develop a good standing with even the most rebellious forces within the Freedom Caucus and has been in talks with some members of the group about their role in a GOP majority for weeks, according to Republican sources.\n\nPlus, McCarthy allies believe Republicans will credit him for the hundreds of millions of dollars that his outside group raised and spent in key races. McCarthy has been calling victorious GOP candidates and members since Tuesday night.\n\nMcCarthy’s pitch to members, according to a source familiar, has been relatively straight forward: the GOP picked up seats two cycles in a row under his watch, and he is on the verge of delivering Republicans the majority – which will arm them subpoena power and allow them to serve as a check on the Biden administration.\n\nWhile McCarthy’s allies say the GOP leader is willing to hear members out, they believe negotiating with members could become a slippery slope – though McCarthy may have no choice, depending on the margins.\n\nMcCarthy had hoped to pick up at least 20 seats to give him a cushion in both the speaker’s race and to help push through his agenda. It’s unclear if they can get there as many races remain too early for CNN to call.\n\nOther leadership races in flux\n\nAside from the speaker’s race, Tuesday’s underwhelming performance for the GOP has scrambled other leadership races.\n\nThe race for House GOP whip – a position that will only open up if Republicans win the majority – was already competitive, though Rep.

Conservative hardliners seeking to plot McCarthy’s ouster say otherwise.\n\nAnd what will happen if he can’t get 218 votes? No one knows.\n\n“You can’t beat somebody with nobody, and there’s nobody else running,” said Rep. Dusty Johnson, a South Dakota Republican who supports McCarthy for speaker. “Even if there was another announced candidate, that person would not be better positioned to get 218 than Kevin.”\n\nMcCarthy’s foes say another candidate will emerge and that talks have already begun to recruit a replacement. Some of Kevin McCarthy’s detractors have asked whether Reps. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Jim Jordan of Ohio and Tom Emmer of Minnesota would be willing to jump into the race, according to GOP sources familiar with the informal conversations. But all three men have made clear they’re backing McCarthy for speaker and wouldn’t challenge him for the job.\n\nIt’s still not known what would happen on Jan. 3 if McCarthy cannot get 218 votes to be elected speaker. But there’s an expectation that any number of Republicans could throw their hat into the ring if McCarthy stumbles or drops out.\n\n“There’s quality candidates who represent the conservative center of the Republican conference who are privately acknowledging that once it becomes clear it’s not going to Kevin McCarthy, they are interested in becoming speaker,” said Rep. Bob Good, a Virginia Republican who’s one of the handful of conservative hardliners publicly saying they are “hard no” votes against McCarthy. “And there are members who would excite the base, who would excite Republicans across the country, unite Republicans across the country as candidates, but they’re not going to raise their hand publicly until it’s clear to them that it’s not Kevin McCarthy.”\n\nIf McCarthy loses more than four GOP votes on January 3, he is expected to fall under the 218 votes he would need to claim the speakership. Then the House would keep voting until someone wins a majority of support from the members in attendance who are choosing a specific candidate and not voting “present.” If that happens, McCarthy insists he still won’t drop out.\n\n“Oh yeah, I’ll take the speaker’s fight to the floor,” McCarthy told CNN.\n\nMcCarthy also said he was willing to go through as many rounds of voting on the floor as it takes, predicting: “I’ll get there.”\n\nMeanwhile, the California Republican’s fiercest detractors are also digging in.\n\nMembers of the hardline House Freedom Caucus met with the chamber’s parliamentarian on Wednesday in order to get a briefing on the floor rules and procedures that dictate the process for the speakership vote. And some of McCarthy’s foes are reiterating their pledge to oppose him on the floor and calling on the GOP leader to drop out of the race now so they can start the search for a serious alternative.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Analysis: One of Trump's biggest defenders thinks he has a chance to lead the RNC 04:02 - Source: CNN\n\n“He can avoid it now,” said Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, a former co-chair of the Freedom Caucus who lost to McCarthy for his conference’s nomination to be speaker, of a potential floor fight. “He doesn’t have the votes. We can move to different candidates. I’m willing to entertain anyone else.”\n\nThe commitment from both camps to take the speakership battle to January is shaping up to be a political game of chicken, with both sides signaling they’re willing to call the other’s bluff. But most Republicans are hoping it won’t come to that, worrying it would set the wrong tone as they enter into power and prepare for a tough two years of governing while working to protect their narrow majority.\n\n“I don’t want to see that happen. I can’t guarantee that not happening right now,” Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Trump ally who is backing McCarthy, said of a speaker showdown on the floor. “But the goal is to stop that from happening, to get everybody on the same page, and create unity so that we’re ready from day one.”\n\nAdded Tennessee Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, another McCarthy backer: “My hope is that we have unity and get this done on the first ballot, but we’ll see. … I’m hoping and praying for unity.”\n\nSome Republicans think the hardliners are bluffing.\n\n“Maybe they’re just trying to promote themselves a little bit?” said Rep. Greg Pence of Indiana, adding that conservative members’ views behind closed doors are more collegial than they may be publicly.\n\nAsked if he could instead vote for McCarthy’s No. 2, Scalise, for speaker, Pence said: “I’m voting for Kevin McCarthy. He’s gonna win.”\n\nTension builds in GOP Conference\n\nThe last time a vote for speaker had to go to multiple ballots was in 1923. And the longest time in history it took to elect a speaker lasted two months, with a total of 133 ballots.\n\nIn recent weeks, part of McCarthy’s pitch to his critics has been that if they don’t unify, then Democrats could theoretically band together and peel off a few Republicans to elect the next speaker on the floor.\n\n“Having a challenge on the floor is never going to be positive and really turn the floor over the Democrats,” McCarthy told reporters this week.\n\nBiggs, however, brushed off that possibility. And most Republicans don’t see it as a serious threat, though they privately acknowledge the speaker’s race could go to multiple ballots.\n\n“I don’t buy it,” Biggs said. “Name the Democrat that a Republican would vote for.”\n\nSome moderates and mainstream Republicans are growing increasingly frustrated with their colleagues’ threats to cause chaos on the floor. And some of them have a warning of their own: if the vote goes to a second ballot or more, they plan to just keep voting for McCarthy – potentially foiling the anti-McCarthy group’s plans to force him out of contention in the hopes of getting lawmakers to rally around an alternative.\n\n“Many of us are perturbed. We took a vote and McCarthy got 85%,” said Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, who represents a district that Joe Biden carried in 2020, referring to the internal GOP election when Republicans backed McCarthy to be their nominee. “The right thing to do is coalesce around someone who has broad support. To do otherwise weakens the conference and hurts the team.”\n\nA group of mainstream House Republicans, known as the Republican Governance Group, sent a letter to their GOP colleagues on Friday urging them to unite behind McCarthy for speaker and warning that a floor fight over choosing their next leader could undermine the GOP as they enter the majority.\n\n“Such quarrels will only delay our ability to establish a working majority in the People’s House, which is critically important to successfully countering a Democrat-controlled Senate and Executive Branch,” the lawmakers wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN. “But make no mistake, we will not allow this conference to be dragged down a path to a paralyzed House that weakens our hard-fought majority.”\n\nThe letter, which is signed by 21 Republicans, also notes that while Republicans won the House, voters handed them power “skeptically” – a nod to the fact they only will have a razor-thin majority next year.\n\nRep. Dave Joyce of Ohio, who chairs the Republican Governance Group, said in a statement to CNN: “This Conference cannot handcuff itself to a burning building before we gavel in the 118th Congress. We are the dealmakers without whom this legislative body cannot govern, and we intend to provide the American people with a working majority.”\n\nSo far, at least five House Republicans have vowed to oppose McCarthy for speaker – a problem for him since he likely can only afford to lose four GOP lawmakers – though some of them have expressed openness to negotiating.\n\nMcCarthy’s foes say he has a much bigger problem.\n\n“Well, I think it’s a much larger number than people realize,” Good said of the McCarthy “no” votes. “My hope would be that more of them will start to come out publicly. So it just becomes increasingly clear that he doesn’t have the votes and we need to consider other candidates.”\n\nTheir efforts to recruit a viable alternative have been unsuccessful thus far. Scalise, McCarthy’s top deputy, has repeatedly said on the record he is supporting McCarthy and is looking forward to serving as majority leader next year.\n\nJordan, a McCarthy ally and co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus, told CNN he is not interested in the speaker’s gavel and just wants to be chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and wouldn’t entertain questions about a hypothetical scenario in which McCarthy can’t get the necessary support to secure the speaker’s gavel. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who has openly campaigned for Jordan to become speaker, told CNN he has asked Jordan to run “daily for two years.”\n\nAnd Emmer, who will serve as majority whip next year, said in a statement that “There is no one more deserving to lead House Republicans than Kevin McCarthy and he has my full support. Kevin has earned that right by raising hundreds of millions of dollars and helping Republicans win seats in back-to-back cycles.”\n\nTo win over holdouts, McCarthy has brokered negotiations on potential rules changes designed to empower rank-and-file members, such as enabling members to offer more amendments and giving them more notice before fast-tracked bills come to the floor.\n\nAnd McCarthy has also made public professions about what he would do as speaker, from dangling a potential impeachment inquiry over Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to threatening to investigate the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021 — both top priorities on the right.\n\n“We’ve got a long way to go,” said Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry, the current Freedom Caucus chief. But he added: “I think there is a burgeoning realization and acknowledgment that this place is broken. That’s a start.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/01/04/new-congress-takeaways-mccarthy-loses-again-biden-chides-house-gop/10989345002/", "title": "McCarthy keeps losing, Biden mocks House GOP: 5 takeaways from ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy failed again to win election to speaker Wednesday on the new Congress' second day as opponents within the GOP caucus continued to block his nomination.\n\nThe losses came despite pleas to the rebel faction of nearly two dozen Republicans from former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence to back McCarthy.\n\nHaving lost on the first three ballots Tuesday, the GOP leader switched strategies by asking Republican members who oppose him to vote \"present\" rather backing another candidate, a move to lower the threshold needed to win the speakership.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe 118th Congress will begin on Tuesday, bringing in a new era of Republican control of the House and a high-stakes leadership fight that will determine who controls the speaker’s gavel.\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy has the support of a majority of Republicans to be the GOP leader but has so far not secured enough votes to become House speaker.\n\nWhat’s standing between McCarthy and the position he has long sought is a handful of conservative lawmakers. These conservatives, many members of the Freedom Caucus, don’t trust McCarthy and have not yet been convinced by him or those lobbying on his behalf, including former President Donald Trump, that McCarthy will appropriately stand up to Democrats and President Joe Biden.\n\nRepublicans will only have a slim majority – 222 Republicans compared with 212 Democrats – which means McCarthy can’t afford many defections if he is to find the 218 votes needed to make him speaker of the House.\n\nHow the day will unfold\n\nCongress can’t really function until it has a House speaker; the position is filled on the first day of a new Congress, January 3, even before members-elect take the oath of office.\n\nMembers will meet in the morning to tie off loose ends and close the 117th Congress. Then, at noon Eastern time, the clerk of the House will gavel in the new Congress and will call a quorum. The first major order of business will be the speaker election. Democrats will place Rep. Hakeem Jeffries’ name into nomination, and Republicans are set to place McCarthy’s name.\n\nThen the clerk will call the roll and each member will state the name of the person whom they are voting for. If no one amasses a majority of votes cast, it goes to a second ballot. If another ballot is needed, it is not clear if Congress will recess the chamber or if members will continue voting.\n\nMembers can vote for anyone they want\n\nThere’s no rule that the speaker is a House member. Members can vote for anyone, and they can protest by skipping the vote or voting “present.” The vast majority will vote for their party’s leader.\n\nBoth parties met last year to determine their leadership, with Democrats selecting Jeffries and Republicans agreeing to nominate McCarthy, but by a margin that signaled a possible floor fight ahead.\n\nMcCarthy faces a long-shot challenger: hard-right Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona. The challenge highlights the opposition McCarthy is up against and could draw votes away from him.\n\nIf no one wins a majority …\n\nLawmakers will continue voting until someone wins the majority. They can take successive votes on January 3. They can adjourn to horse trade and deal among themselves. But the House does not kick off the new Congress until a speaker is elected.\n\nThis is what people are talking about when they refer to a “floor fight.” It’s when House members require multiple ballots, or votes, to elect their speaker.\n\nIt’s been 100 years\n\nThe chamber of the House of Representatives is seen at the Capitol on February 28, 2022. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nIn the 200-plus years since the first two-year Congress met in 1789, such floor fights have occurred just 14 times, according to the House historian.\n\nAll but one of those multi-ballot speaker elections took place before the Civil War as the two-party system was evolving. Back then, floor fights were routine.\n\nA floor fight has only taken place once since the Civil War, exactly 100 years ago, when it took nine ballots for Rep. Frederick Gillett of Massachusetts to be elected speaker in 1923.\n\nThere is some mystery here\n\nPolitico notes it’s been so long that the exact procedure if no one has a majority is a smidge unclear. A Congressional Research Service brief on electing the speaker simply says that if no one gets a majority, the vote is repeated.\n\nThere have been exceptions to the majority vote\n\nWay back in 1849, the House had been in session so long without being able to elect a speaker – 19 days – that members voted to elect their speaker with a plurality rather than a majority. Members ultimately confirmed the plurality election with a majority vote.\n\nThe epic record for a floor fight\n\nIn 1855 and 1856, it took 133 separate votes for Rep. Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts to be elected, again by a plurality and not a majority.\n\nThe process stretched over more than a month and included a sort of inquisition on the House floor of the three contenders. They answered questions about their view of the expansion of slavery. Read more from the House historian’s website.\n\nIt’s also interesting to read about Banks; his official House biography notes he was elected to office as a Republican, an independent, a member of the America Party and as a Democrat.\n\nIt doesn’t always require 218 votes\n\nOne important thing to remember is that McCarthy does not technically need 218 votes to become speaker. A majority of those present and voting is required to get the speakership, which is usually 218 lawmakers. But if enough people skip the vote or vote “present,” the number of votes required for a majority can drop.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi was elected with 216 votes in 2021.\n\nFormer Speaker John Boehner won reelection to the post with 216 votes in 2015 after beating back a conservative rebellion like the one McCarthy is dealing with now.\n\nMost of the negotiation and arm-twisting happens long before the floor vote. Pelosi got 220 votes in 2019 after turning most of the fellow Democrats who opposed her. She did so by agreeing to serve only another few years as speaker, a pledge she kept by announcing her decision in November to not seek reelection for leadership.\n\nAbility to remove the speaker is a sticking point\n\nConservatives who oppose McCarthy have said they want to reinstate a dormant and arcane power to allow any member to call for a vote to remove the speaker at any time. Read more about the “motion to vacate.”\n\nRepublicans who oppose McCarthy see it as a tool for accountability. McCarthy and his allies see it as a recipe for bad governance if he is constantly at risk of losing the post that’s so difficult for him to attain.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Republicans make their ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — House Republicans will try for a third time to select a speaker of the House nominee on Wednesday, casting their votes on another pick to lead the lower chamber.\n\nDeeply divided House Republicans, roiled by infighting since they took control of the House at the start of the year, have already been unable to elect two speaker nominees: House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., and House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.\n\nThose divisions threaten the next nominee's chances to lead the House. Whether they can garner enough support and unite House Republicans is completely up in the air.\n\nEight GOP lawmakers are vying for the nomination, making for a crowded field that underscores the fact there is no clear successor to ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nThose eight candidates offered up their visions for the speakership and took questions from members for over two hours in a candidate forum Monday evening. House Republicans will again gather behind closed doors Tuesday at 9:00 a.m. to vote on a nominee before a speaker election with the entire House. That could happen the same day.\n\nHere’s what to know as the House enters its third week without a speaker.\n\nFloodgates open as eight candidates jockey for speaker\n\nEight GOP lawmakers are running for House speaker: Tom Emmer of Minnesota, Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, Byron Donalds of Florida, Mike Johnson of Louisiana, Austin Scott of Georgia, Jack Bergman of Michigan, Pete Sessions of Texas and Pete Sessions of Texas.\n\nNeedless to say, that’s a lot of candidates. The historic ouster of McCarthy earlier this month and the failure of the House Republican conference to elect two different speaker nominees has resulted in the mad dash among GOP lawmakers seeking the top job in the lower chamber.\n\nLast Friday, after House Republicans voted to drop Jordan in a closed-door meeting, some members immediately declared their own candidacy, such as Hern and Scott.\n\n“This is embarrassing for the Republican Party. It's embarrassing for the nation and we need to look at one another and solve the problem,” McCarthy said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” of the chaos that has embroiled the House.\n\nHow many votes will it take to become speaker?\n\nThe key question for any of the eight candidates is whether they can shore up enough support within the House Republican conference to be crowned speaker. The GOP controls the House with just 221 seats, and the magic number for any prospective speaker to be elected is 217. That means the eventual Republican nominee will need near-unanimous support from the conference to become speaker.\n\nOf the eight candidates in the speaker’s race, it is unclear who can reach 217 votes.\n\nJordan, who was abandoned by the conference as the nominee, and Scalise, who voluntarily withdrew from the race, both had a handful of their own detractors that prevented them from ever drumming up the support required to be elected speaker.\n\n“Getting 217 is obviously going to be very difficult and is the sort of Rubik's Cube of the answer to all of this,” Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n\nRep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., in an effort to ensure the next nominee has the support to become speaker, has been circulating a unity pledge for members to sign and promise they will support the eventual nominee, regardless of who it is.\n\nWill Republicans return to the backup plan to empower interim speaker McHenry?\n\nThe House, without a speaker, has been in a state of paralysis for the last three weeks after McCarthy's removal. The chamber can continue committee work, but it cannot pass any legislation on the floor until there is a new leader.\n\nAnd the House has crucial legislation to consider, including a funding package to avert a government shutdown and President Joe Biden’s request for a supplemental foreign aid package to U.S. allies, including Ukraine and Israel.Some GOP lawmakers frustrated with the legislative stasis in the House have called to temporarily empower acting speaker Rep. Patrick McHenry to get the lower chamber moving again.\n\nTwo GOP lawmakers, Reps. Dave Joyce, Ohio, and Mike Kelly, Pa., have each introduced their own resolutions empowering McHenry as interim speaker for a limited period to allow Congress to address time-sensitive issues, such as the looming shutdown.\n\nPrior to dropping Jordan as their nominee, House Republicans debated such a move behind closed-doors, but the plans ultimately fell through as it became clear empowering McHenry would require Democratic support, a prospect some GOP lawmakers balked at.\n\nBut if House Republicans make no progress towards electing a new leader by the end of the week, frustrations among Republicans could boil over, and there could be a revival of the efforts to grant McHenry more powers.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/politics/andy-biggs-running-for-speaker/index.html", "title": "Andy Biggs: Arizona Republican announces run for House speaker ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy’s bid for the speakership grew more complicated on Tuesday after a hard-right Republican announced his bid for the gavel next month, a move that could set off a messy floor fight and leave their party without a candidate who can win the 218 votes needed to become speaker.\n\nDespite losing the House GOP Conference’s nomination to be speaker last month, Rep. Andy Biggs, the hard-right Arizona Republican and one-time leader of the House Freedom Caucus, announced he will be a candidate for the speakership when the full House votes on January 3.\n\n“I’m running for Speaker to break the establishment,” Biggs wrote on Twitter. “Kevin McCarthy was created by, elevated by, and maintained by the establishment.”\n\nTo become elected speaker, McCarthy can only afford to lose four votes when the House meets next month. Last month when he defeated Biggs for his party’s nomination, McCarthy lost 31 votes despite winning 188. Now with Biggs’ candidacy, McCarthy detractors can vote for an alternative to run the new House, which will have 222 GOP seats.\n\nIf McCarthy can’t win 218 votes on the first ballot, it will go to multiple ballots until someone does – something that hasn’t happened in about a century.\n\nSteve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, told CNN he won’t speculate about the possibility that he could emerge as a candidate for speaker on January 3 if McCarthy can’t get 218 votes to win the gavel.\n\n“No, I’m not going to get into speculation,” Scalise said. “Obviously our focus is on getting it resolved by January 3. And there’s a lot of conversations that everybody has been having, Kevin, surely, with the members who have expressed concerns.”\n\n“I think this is all theatrics,” said Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas, a McCarthy supporter.\n\nThe move comes as the speakership fight has begun to overshadow their party’s plans in the majority, even as some in his conference have called on McCarthy to take a firmer stand on how he would run the House – including over raising the national debt limit – and as the California Republican on Tuesday night sketched out in lengthy detail on his website investigative plans for when Republicans get committee gavels and subpoena power next year.\n\nIn a closed-door meeting on Tuesday, House Republicans engaged in a back-and-forth over the speaker’s race, with McCarthy and his allies calling for the conference to come together over the speaker’s vote and his detractors pushing back, according to multiple GOP sources.\n\nEven the time limits imposed at the microphones became an issue, as House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia had an exchange over the matter, according to a source in the room.\n\nAfter the testy back-and-forth, Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee attempted to bring some levity to the moment by joking that the only woman he lets disrespect him is his wife. He added that conference meetings are a waste of time and no one learns anything from them, a sentiment met with a round of cheers, sources said.\n\nAfter the meeting, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – a controversial conservative and close ally of former President Donald Trump – confirmed she spoke up in favor of McCarthy and said she is “sick and tired” of the so-called “Never Kevin” movement, even though some of them are her friends. She urged them to back down, saying they’re going to look foolish if the floor fight delays their majority.\n\nYet some Republicans were not persuaded.\n\nIn the meeting, Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina told Republicans he wouldn’t be instructed over how to vote and that he would take the next 28 days and decide on his own, according to GOP sources. Norman confirmed his closed-door comments.\n\n“It should be testy,” Norman told CNN. “We’re getting to elect the No. 1 job in the country.”\n\nRep. Chip Roy, the Texas Republican, defended the effort by hardline Republicans to extract concessions from McCarthy and potentially send the House speaker’s race into multiple ballots on January 3. Roy has not said how he would vote.\n\n“It’s nothing new in our history,” Roy said. “This is normal, we’re having a debate, just like, by the way, the Democrats did last time, remember? I mean, there was an enormous discussion heading into the Speaker’s race in the last Congress about the Democrats” who were voting against Nancy Pelosi, though most ultimately did.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Manu Raju Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/09/politics/mccarthy-speaker-house-republicans-218/index.html", "title": "House Republicans brace for doomsday scenario if McCarthy falls ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs a right-wing faction threatens to tank his speakership ambitions, House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy delivered a promise: “I’ll never leave,” making clear he has no plans to drop out of the race even if the fight goes to many ballots on the floor.\n\n“I’ll get 218,” McCarthy told CNN, referring to the votes he’d need to become House speaker.\n\nBut Rep.

See her response 02:37 - Source: CNN\n\nMcCarthy’s supporters are vowing to keep voting for him on multiple ballots, and GOP sources said there are early discussions about a floor strategy for that potential scenario, including whether to recess the House or let the votes keep rolling – no matter how long it takes.\n\nTo prevent that from happening, McCarthy and his team have been engaged in serious talks with a group of conservatives, including over potentially giving them influential committee assignments and more power to drive the legislative process. GOP sources said those negotiations are still early in the process and could ultimately end up giving the group some aspect of what the hardliners desperately want: additional power to seek a sitting speaker’s ouster with a vote on the floor.\n\nAsked if he would drop out of the race if he doesn’t get 218 votes on the first ballot, Biggs refused to say.\n\n“I’m not going to talk about hypotheticals,” said Biggs, who lost his conference’s nomination to become speaker last month after securing 31 votes.\n\nBut in the case of a doomsday scenario – where neither McCarthy nor Biggs can get 218 votes on January 3 and neither drops out – some pro-McCarthy Republicans are signaling support for a different approach. Some said they would be willing to work with Democrats to find a moderate Republican who can get the 218 votes to clinch the gavel – a long-shot idea that underscores the uncertainty looming over the speaker’s race.\n\n“Our initial plan is vote for Kevin and let him fight this out repeatedly. … But if they think they’re going to use this to infinity to drive him out, well, we’re not going to bend to their will,” said Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican.\n\nBacon added if GOP hardliners don’t bend, then he would be willing to work with Democrats to find another more moderate Republican to secure the 218 votes to become speaker.\n\n“If a small group refuses to play ball and be part of the team, then we’ll work across the aisle to find an agreeable Republican,” Bacon said. “But I hope we don’t get there.”\n\nMcCarthy’s detractors don’t buy it.\n\n“There are very significant rules, changes being discussed that would open the House up, that would be transformative, that would give us the ability to actually legislate and represent our constituents,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Republican from Florida who said he’s a “hard no” on McCarthy. “And whoever is speaker is going to have to agree to those rules, I think. And I don’t think that person will be Kevin McCarthy because Kevin McCarthy won’t have 218 votes.”\n\nGaetz added: “I think the person who is ultimately going to be the speaker isn’t even the candidate yet.”\n\nIndeed, the small group of Republicans known as the “Never Kevin” movement – confident that Biggs could not win a majority of the House – has been trying to recruit a viable alternative, and claim “several” Republicans have privately told them they would be interested in running if McCarthy drops out. Their goal with voting for Biggs is to show that McCarthy is weak on the first ballot, which they hope would inspire other candidates to jump in.\n\n“How many members vote for someone else will show the strength (of the anti-McCarthy group),” Rep. Bob Good, a Virginia Republican who is a “hard no” on McCarthy, told CNN. “I think the second ballot is going to have more candidates. … There are already Republicans letting us know they’d like to be considered.”\n\nEven House Republicans who are supporting McCarthy predicted that a number of lawmakers would run if McCarthy withdrew his name, with some saying that House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, McCarthy’s top deputy, would emerge as the front runner in that case.\n\n“If at some point, if Kevin did take his name out, then you would have good people (running). Scalise would probably be the guy,” one GOP lawmaker said.\n\nScalise has repeatedly vowed to support McCarthy and refused to speculate on whether he would jump into the race if the GOP leader can’t get the votes.\n\n“No, I’m not going to get into speculation,” Scalise told CNN. “Obviously, our focus is on getting it resolved by January 3. And there’s a lot of conversations that everybody has been having, Kevin, surely, with the members who have expressed concerns.”\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, the conservative set to become the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, went even further, ruling out jumping into the race even though Gaetz and other hardliners have urged him to seek the speakership.\n\n“No,” Jordan said when asked if he’d run if McCarthy couldn’t get the votes. “I want to chair the Judiciary Committee.”\n\nMcCarthy’s weighs more concessions\n\nWith 222 GOP seats next year, McCarthy can only afford to lose four Republican votes and still win the speakership. But he and his team are still hopeful he can win on the first round as he has been working both publicly and privately to win over holdouts. So far, at least five Republicans have promised to oppose him on the floor – but in a positive sign for McCarthy, one of them has shown he’s gettable.\n\n“I will vote for Andy for speaker, subject to what we’re discussing,” said Rep. Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican after leaving a meeting in McCarthy’s office on Wednesday. He later added: “All this is positive. We’re having good change, regardless of what happens. And you’ll see more of it.”\n\nIn addition to those five, a new group of seven Republican hardliners on Thursday laid out a list of conditions to earn their vote, although they did not specifically threaten to vote against McCarthy if their demands aren’t met.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback GOP lawmaker explains why he won't vote for McCarthy to become House Speaker 03:08 - Source: CNN\n\nTheir list of demands – which shows the work McCarthy needs to do to get to 218 – includes a promise that leaders won’t play in primaries, restoring the motion to vacate the speaker’s chair, placing more conservatives on key committees, giving members at least 72 hours to read bill text before a vote, and committing to using the debt ceiling as a bargaining chip to demand more spending cuts, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN.\n\nMcCarthy has already begun brokering some rules changes to empower rank-and-file members, created a new select committee on China, vowed to boot some Democratic lawmakers from their committees, and sketched out in greater detail his investigative plans – including a potential impeachment inquiry into Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nBut McCarthy still has additional levers he could pull. Conservative hardliners are pushing for more representation on the powerful House Rules Committee, a leadership-aligned panel that decides how and when bills come to the floor. In one private meeting with a member of the House Freedom Caucus, McCarthy was urged to take a harder public stance on the coming policy issues for next year, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAnd the anti-McCarthy group is also still pressing for a process that would allow any single member to hold a floor vote on ousting the sitting speaker, which was wielded over former Speaker John Boehner before he was forced out of the job by the far right in 2015.\n\nMcCarthy has been adamantly opposed to restoring the “motion to vacate the chair,” and a majority of the House GOP voted against the idea during a during a closed-door meeting last month. When asked by CNN on Thursday if he would visit the issue, McCarthy laughed and refused to answer.\n\nBut McCarthy’s detractors said it’s an issue very much still on the table and think he may end up needing to embrace it if he still doesn’t have the speaker votes by January 3. GOP sources told CNN there’s potential room to negotiate to give members more power to call for a vote to oust the speaker – perhaps by allowing the vote to occur if a certain number of members call for one, rather than allowing a single lawmaker to call for a vote as the hardliners want.\n\n“A competent secure leader is not threatened by (the motion to vacate),” Good said. “And so, yeah, that I think that’s central to many members.”\n\nYet others said what Good and his allies are seeking is a recipe for chaos — and are calling on their colleagues to fall in line.\n\n“I think that’s one of the reasons that we didn’t see a red wave … the idea that people are sick and tired of the noise, and they’re sick and tired of the fighting,” Rep. David Joyce, an Ohio Republican, said of the impact of a January 3 floor fight. “And I know I get that wherever I go in my district is, ‘why can’t you guys just get things done?’”\n\nAs McCarthy scrambles to lock down speaker’s votes, he also delayed the GOP’s internal elections for committee chairmanships. There was some speculation that one of the members competing for a gavel, Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida, may retire early if he doesn’t win, which would make McCarthy’s math problem even tougher. But Buchanan vehemently disputed the notion.\n\n“It’s ridiculous, laughable,” he told reporters. “I’m doing everything I can to help get Kevin to 218.”\n\nMcCarthy could also try to convince Democrats or his GOP detractors to vote present or not show up to the floor proceedings, which would lower the threshold he needs to become speaker. But McCarthy promised his GOP colleagues he would not court Democratic votes.\n\nCould Democrats join Republicans and select a speaker?\n\nIn recent weeks, part of McCarthy’s pitch to his critics has been warning that if they don’t unify, then Democrats could theoretically band together and peel off a few Republicans to elect the next speaker.\n\nSome Democrats have said they would entertain the idea, including Rep. Henry Cuellar, a moderate Democrat from Texas who told CNN some of his GOP colleagues have approached him “informally” about it.\n\nJoyce also said some members have reached out to him about potentially running, but he dismissed it. “At the end of the day, Kevin’s going to be the new speaker.”\n\nNew York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the next House Democratic leader, said, “there are no behind-the-scenes conversations” that he has had with Republicans to put up an alternative candidate. But he refused to rule out a scenario where his caucus would help elect the next speaker if McCarthy couldn’t get the votes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear if Hakeem Jeffries would be willing to help Kevin McCarthy 02:25 - Source: CNN\n\n“Democrats are in the process of organizing the Democratic Conference,” Jeffries told CNN on Thursday. “Republicans are in the process of organizing the Republican Conference. Let’s see what happens on January 3.”\n\nSome of the potential consensus picks that have been floated included retiring Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan and John Katko of New York, who both voted to impeach Donald Trump for inciting the Capitol insurrection; Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus; and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, a veteran lawmaker and incoming head of the House Rules Committee.\n\nBut that would require agreement from every single Democrat and the help of five Republicans – no easy feat. Upton said he has no plans to be in Washington that day, telling CNN: “I’ll be skiing.”\n\nAnd progressives like Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York said they would never vote for a GOP speaker candidate, no matter how moderate.\n\n“No,” Bowman said, indicating he’d be voting for Jeffries on every ballot on January 3. “It’s going to be Hakeem.”\n\nBut Republican Rep. Bruce Westerman said this has happened before – nearly a decade ago in his state where minority Democrats in the Arkansas legislature joined forces with a handful of Republicans to elect a GOP speaker of their choice. Westerman privately made this case to his colleagues at a closed-door meeting this week.\n\n“I’m concerned about January 3 getting here and us not being able to form a Congress and organize committees and getting delayed in pushing the policy objectives that we want to push,” Westerman said.\n\nWesterman added that the discussion over changing House rules is good for the party. But he added: “I’m not really excited about any type of destructive movement.”", "authors": ["Manu Raju Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}]}

The US Department of Health and Human Services set a target vaccination rate of 70% in the Healthy People 2030 plan. But less than half of the population has actually gotten their annual flu shot each year for at least the past decade.\n\nPublic health leaders say it has been especially challenging to get people to get their flu vaccine this year because they’re growing tired of hearing about shots.\n\nWhat once was an annual push to get people vaccinated at the start of each flu season has become near-constant messaging about vaccines, with an announcement about new Covid-19 vaccine availability or eligibility seeming to come every couple of months.\n\n“There’s a great deal of vaccine fatigue out there. Asking people this year to get not just one vaccine but to get the annual influenza vaccine, as well as the Covid booster, has really been what I have called a hard sell,” said Dr. William Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\n“There’s the old saying, ‘familiarity breeds contempt.’ Well, perhaps that’s a bit strong, but familiarity does seem to breed a certain nonchalance,” he said.\n\nMillions fewer flu vaccine doses have been distributed this season compared with this point in seasons past, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Just 26% of adults had gotten their flu shot by the end of October, a deadline that medical experts have long encouraged for optimal protection throughout the season. About 43% of children had gotten their flu shot by the end of November.\n\nReckoning with a new normal\n\nThe first year of the Covid-19 pandemic – the 2020-21 flu season – was a notable outlier, experts say.\n\nFlu vaccination rates soared higher than usual amid fears of a “twindemic,” with the coronavirus and flu circulating together.\n\n“The public health message – and I think we did it very effectively – was, you can’t protect yourself against Covid right now, but you can definitely take flu off the table,” said LJ Tan, chief strategy officer for the Immunization Action Coalition and co-chair of the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit, nonprofits dedicated to improving vaccination coverage in the US.\n\n“We were coming out of lockdowns, and people wanted to be active as opposed to passive. So when we told people at that time, ‘You don’t have a Covid vaccine, but you can certainly take flu off the table by getting a flu vaccine,’ people said, ‘Yeah, I’m doing that.’ “\n\nBut that double threat didn’t materialize. Flu seasons have been uncharacteristically mild for the past two years, and people have let their guard down, experts say.\n\n“I’ve almost had to remind people about influenza,” Schaffner said. “We’ve had two quite curtailed, very low influenza years. And of course, everyone’s been preoccupied with Covid, and they want to put Covid behind them and get on with their lives.”\n\nNow, continued messaging about a triple threat of viruses – flu, Covid and RSV – isn’t hitting in quite the same way. The urgency is real, as hospitals across the country stretch their capacity to record levels, but it’s not driving people to action.\n\n“It strikes me that people have gotten used to bad flu seasons for the elderly. So this is kind of just the same, with a few other viruses around. There’s a sense that this is what we’re going to expect and this is what we have to live with,” said Dr. Jesse Hackell, a pediatrician who co-authored a clinical report about countering vaccine hesitancy in 2016.\n\n“What we’re missing is the fact that kids and children’s hospitals are suffering in ways that we’ve never seen before.”\n\nNumerous studies have found that flu and Covid-19 vaccines significantly reduce the risk of severe outcomes for those who become infected, including hospitalization and death – thus reducing the burden on the health care work force.\n\nExacerbating the general vaccine fatigue is decision fatigue, Hackell said.\n\nPeople have to choose whether to get the flu vaccine each year – and more recently, they have to make decisions about Covid-19 vaccine updates. Each new decision opens the door for misinformation or disinformation to seep into the process.\n\n“If it were a vaccine like measles, where it is really effective and it’s not repeated, it might be different,” Hackell said. “But we have to compare it to Covid and flu vaccines, where the efficacy is less than dramatic, and when there’s a lot of controversy going on, I think that spills over.”\n\nHealth care professionals are worn out too, experts say.\n\n“I think there’s fatigue, moral injury, call it burnout on the part of providers as well. We’re not pushing it as hard,” said Hackell, who is also chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Practice and Ambulatory Medicine. “It gets very difficult to keep having these unproductive conversations over and over again. And there’s so much more respiratory illness now that I don’t know that the time is there to have these long discussions when your office is packed with sick kids.”\n\nLinking Covid and flu\n\nUptake for the updated Covid-19 booster has also been lackluster: Fewer than 1 in 7 eligible people have gotten one since it was authorized in the fall, according to CDC data.\n\nOngoing messaging from the White House urges Americans to get their updated Covid-19 booster shot and the flu shot at the same time.\n\nBut despite the convenience of getting both shots at once, there’s evidence that linking the two isn’t the best way to boost coverage rates for either.\n\nThere has always been hesitancy around vaccination, but it has become highly politicized during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“We still have plenty of people in this country who do not believe in the flu or the Covid vaccine that we haven’t been able to win over,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. “Flu is serious in our country, and it kills a lot of people, and it hospitalizes a lot of people, and it attacks the young and old. And so we should pay more attention to it.”\n\nBut even when interest in booster shots was highest, it was rare for people to get both shots simultaneously.\n\nSelf-reports to the CDC’s V-safe monitoring system show that fewer than 1 in 10 people who got a Covid-19 booster between September 2021 and May 2022 got a flu shot at the same time.\n\n“We give multiple vaccines to our kids at the same time, but we haven’t typically done that for adults,” said Tan, former liaison to the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee for the American Medical Association.\n\nTrying to persuade people to do something new can add to the hesitancy that’s already become so pervasive and make them less likely to come in at all. Instead, people seem to be much more likely to accept the offer of a flu vaccine at an appointment they scheduled to get a Covid-19 vaccine booster, or vice versa.\n\n“Some confidence is given by direct interaction with a health-care provider – in this case, the pharmacist or the physician or the clinician – who is able to reassure the patient that it’s safe,” Tan said. “In that personal conversation between the provider and the patient, the patient ends up being converted and getting the vaccine. It’s a testimony also to our remarkable health-care providers.”\n\nThe message might finally be sticking. At Walgreens locations, co-administration of the flu and Covid-19 vaccine is 70% higher this year than it was last year, according to data shared with CNN.\n\nBetter late than never\n\nTan says there have been signs of improvement in recent weeks.\n\nPharmacies are becoming significantly more popular than doctors offices among adults as they choose where to get the flu shot, and CDC data shows that the number of flu vaccines given in pharmacies this season is actually outpacing last year. It’s a sign that there are more opportunities to reach a broader group of otherwise healthy adults who are less likely to have a primary care provider, Tan said.\n\n“At least we’ve got the uptick now, as opposed to this continuous decline that we were seeing four weeks ago,” he said. “But while I’m sounding positive, I want to remind us all that we need to be better than we currently are.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAnd while battling vaccine fatigue is a challenge, it’s not an excuse to let vaccination rates lapse.\n\n“In many circumstances, we can overcome fatigue with access,” Tan said.\n\nIn public health, “we need to start looking outside the box to find out what messaging needs to change so that we can think out of the box and make people motivated to look for the flu vaccine again. Right now, it’s way too much of a vaccine of convenience.”", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/10/health/thanksgiving-updated-covid-booster/index.html", "title": "Thanksgiving is two weeks away. Get your updated Covid-19 shot ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith Thanksgiving just two weeks away, people who are eligible for an updated Covid-19 vaccine booster but still haven’t received the shot will need to roll up their sleeves Thursday to get as much protection as possible before the holiday.\n\nHealth officials are worried about a possible surge in respiratory illnesses this winter – including Covid-19, flu, RSV and rhinoviruses – and they are urging people who are not up-to-date on their Covid-19 shots to get vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n“The way it makes protection is to create these proteins, which we call antibodies, that then circulate in the bloodstream. Well, that can’t be done with a snap of the finger. There’s a biological process that takes place,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\nAfter getting the updated Covid-19 vaccine, that biological process can take about 10 to 14 days.\n\n“So it starts right away, and gradually you get more and more of these antibodies into your bloodstream until, by about two weeks, you’re close to having a maximum,” Schaffner said. “The booster actually functions as a booster: You get an increase in antibody that’s faster than if you started from scratch.”\n\nThe rollout of the updated boosters has been sluggish, and there’s some urgency to building protection before gathering with family and friends for the holidays – the first festive season of the pandemic since most prevention measures, including masks and social distancing, largely became things of the past.\n\nIn October, White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said that getting the updated Covid-19 vaccine is “the most important thing” Americans can do for their health right now.\n\n“The most important thing every American can do to reduce their likelihood of having significant, preventable health issues in the next three to six months is to go get an updated Covid vaccine,” Jha said. “Beyond that, we need to make sure that everyone over the age of 50 or otherwise with high-risk conditions gets treatments if they do get infected. We have treatments widely available.”\n\nAs colder weather arrives, people spend more time indoors and more holiday celebrations are planned, concern mounts among local health officials that there will be some uptick in the spread of Covid-19, flu and RSV in the weeks ahead, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\nThat concern is heightened even more because relatively few people across the United States have gotten the updated Covid-19 vaccine booster that is now available for those 5 and older.\n\n“The message from the local health departments on this is that you should by now – if you are eligible and able – be getting your booster to protect you through the holidays,” Freeman said.\n\n“The longer that time goes on since you’ve received your last booster, the more that your immunity wanes and the more susceptible you become again to getting sick with the virus,” she said. “So all those things together spell out that we have prevention to do right now as we get ready for the end of the year and the holiday season upon us.”\n\nLess than 10% of the US population – about 26 million people 5 and older – has gotten an updated Covid-19 booster dose, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Coverage is highest among older adults: More than 1 in 5 seniors who got their primary series have also gotten an updated booster, compared with about 1 in 15 adults under the age of 30.\n\nBut the pace of uptake is relatively slow.\n\nAbout 1 in 5 adults who have their primary series say they will probably or definitely not get the updated booster – a share that has been consistent since at least September, CDC data shows.\n\n“What clearly will happen if we still don’t have widespread acceptance of this Covid booster is that the anticipated increase that we expect with Covid this winter will increase even more,” Schaffner said. “So we could make the season worse from the point of view of more serious disease.”\n\nHe added that with rising flu activity, an ongoing surge in RSV and the growing concerns around a possible increase in Covid-19 this winter, that is why it will be important to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and flu ahead of the holidays – and to make sure those around you will be vaccinated, washing their hands and staying home when sick.\n\n“You could have a rule: You’re all welcome at the Thanksgiving table, for example, if you’re vaccinated and not only against Covid, against influenza, too,” Schaffner said.\n\nHealth officials say it’s fine to get the updated Covid-19 booster and flu vaccine at the same time.\n\nFlu activity continues to ramp up\n\nFlu is already spreading at high levels in some areas.\n\nLast week, government health officials warned of an early and severe start to cold and flu season in the United States, saying they were closely monitoring hospital capacity and medical supplies and were ready to send help if needed.\n\n“We suspect that many children are being exposed to some respiratory viruses now for the first time, having avoided these viruses during the height of the pandemic,” said Dr. Jose Romero, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.\n\nAcross the United States, cases of RSV and influenza are increasing. At the same time, Covid-19 cases, which had been dropping, appear to have plateaued over the past three weeks, Romero said. A raft of new variants has been gaining ground against BA.5, the Omicron subvariant that caused a wave of illness over the summer.\n\nLooking ahead, some vaccine makers, including Novavax and Pfizer and BioNTech, are developing two-in-one combination vaccines that will offer protection against both flu and Covid-19 in a single shot.\n\nLast week, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that the first study participant has received a dose of their investigational flu-Covid combination vaccine in a Phase 1 trial. The vaccine candidate contains components of the companies’ updated Covid-19 booster and their investigational flu vaccine.\n\nIn October, Novavax announced that its Covid-19 and flu combination vaccine generated immune responses against coronavirus and influenza strains, showing “positive results” in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. That trial is “the first of its kind” to evaluate a Covid-flu combination vaccine, the company said, and insights from the trial will inform a Phase 2 study that’s expected to start by the end of this year. The investigational vaccine is a two-in-one combination of Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine and its quadrivalent flu vaccine candidate.\n\nModerna is also developing a combined flu and Covid-19 mRNA vaccine and another combination vaccine targeting flu, Covid-19 and RSV.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHealth officials have long suspected that Covid-19 vaccinations will be needed annually in the future, similar to how seasonal flu vaccines are given each year.\n\nA combination vaccine could be available as soon as for the next flu season, Freeman said, making it easier for people to roll up their sleeves on an annual basis.\n\n“We may see as early as next year,” she said. “And that will help make it easier for people to make that choice to get both their flu and Covid either together in one vaccine or together at once wherever they’re able to get their vaccine.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/12/health/covid-booster-flu-shot-timing-explained-wellness/index.html", "title": "Getting your Covid booster and flu shot at the same time: everything ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFall and winter are around the corner, which means not only is it time to get your flu shot, but US health officials are urging everyone who is eligible to get their updated Covid-19 booster, too.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the updated Covid-19 vaccine boosters this month, after the US Food and Drug Administration’s authorization. The updated Pfizer/BioNTech booster is authorized for people 12 and older, and Moderna’s is authorized for 18 and older.\n\nAt the same time, health officials stress the recommendation to get your seasonal flu vaccine. Some disease forecasters worry that the upcoming flu season could be a tough one for North America, as nations in the Southern Hemisphere that already had their flu seasons – like Australia and New Zealand – saw higher-than-average peaks in cases. So, the United States could see flu make a comeback while Covid-19 is still circulating at higher levels.\n\nBarring any new and concerning coronavirus variants, some officials predict that the updated Covid-19 shots could be the start of recommended boosters for Americans each year, similar to how updated annual flu vaccines are given.\n\n“For a majority of Americans, one shot a year will provide a very high degree of protection against serious illness, and that’s what we’ve got to be focused on,” Dr. Ashish Jha, White House coronavirus response coordinator, told CNN last week. “Maybe for some high-risk people – the elderly, the immunocompromised – they may need protection more than once a year, but for a majority of Americans, that’s where it is, and I think that’s a really good place to be.”\n\nWhere and when to get Covid-19 booster and flu shot\n\nThe updated Covid-19 vaccine booster and seasonal flu vaccines are available at most pharmacies, doctor’s offices and health care clinics.\n\nNot only are US health officials encouraging people to get both shots this year, some local public health departments are planning to schedule joint vaccine clinics, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\n“Jurisdictions are going to be standing up joint flu and Covid vaccine clinics and other opportunities for people to get both their flu vaccine and their Covid updated booster together,” Freeman said, adding that there is “no problem at all” with getting both shots at or around the same time.\n\nThe hope is for joint clinics to make it more convenient and accessible for people to get their vaccinations – but not everyone might be interested or even eligible to get both vaccines at the same time. Plus, some say it’s still early to get a flu shot.\n\nA single dose of the updated Covid-19 booster is recommended at least two months after the initial vaccine series or your most recent booster.\n\n“Now, suppose you’ve recovered from Covid – and many people of course have had Covid this summer – wait three months, at least,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\nHe added that it’s important to get your booster as soon as you are eligible.\n\n“It’s clear that whether you’re vaccinated or you’ve had Covid, if you get this booster, you will get much higher levels of antibody and they are thought to help us get more prolonged protection,” he said. “The other thing that happens is that the immune system responds more broadly, and it looks as though we will get more broad coverage against other variants.”\n\nAs for the flu shot, the recommended timing of vaccination for this flu season is similar to last season, according to the CDC’s website.\n\n“For most people who need only one dose for the season, September and October are generally good times to get vaccinated,” according to the CDC, adding that while “ideally” it’s recommended to get vaccinated by the end of October, vaccination after October can still provide protection during the peak of flu season.\n\n“The ideal time is during the month of October and maybe the first couple of weeks of November – and the reason I say that is, particularly for older people and people who are frail, that will help their protection extend well through February into March, and that’s when flu often peaks in the United States in February,” Schaffner said. “Everyone ages 6 months and older should get influenza vaccine.”\n\nAs for children younger than 12, who are not eligible for the updated Covid-19 booster, Schaffner said parents should focus on getting their youngsters vaccinated with the primary series or booster they can get now.\n\n“I would say, maintain the current schedule,” he said. “Because it’s quite clear the original still does a good job in protecting us against hospitalizations and more severe disease.”\n\nSchaffner added that some people have asked him whether the Covid-19 vaccine protects against flu or vice versa. They do not.\n\n“You do have to get both vaccines,” he said. “The Covid vaccine will not protect against flu. The flu vaccine will not protect against Covid.”\n\nBracing for possible Covid-19 surge\n\nLast week, the Biden administration announced its plan to manage Covid-19 this fall as there is the potential for an increase in infections, in part due to waning immunity from vaccines and infection.\n\n“Additionally, as the weather gets colder and people spend more time indoors, contagious viruses like COVID-19 can spread more easily,” the announcement says. “And, as we saw last fall with the emergence of Omicron, we must continue to stay prepared for the possibility of a potential new variant of concern.”\n\nThe White House continues to call on Congress to pass additional funding for Covid-19 response, having asked for an updated $22.4 billion last week. GOP Sen. Mitt Romney said that passing that funding would be “a very hard lift.”\n\nThe administration’s plan to manage Covid-19 this fall includes focusing on encouraging updated booster vaccinations and making them easy to access, as well as ensuring that people have easy access to at-home rapid tests and treatments.

However, she noted that flu vaccinations are lagging behind the pace of previous years.\n\nThrough the end of October, CDC data shows that vaccinations for pregnant women, a group that is more vulnerable to severe illness from influenza, are down about 12% from the same point in 2021.\n\nVaccination rates for seniors, the age group most likely to be hospitalized with influenza, were down about 3 percentage points from October 2021.\n\nFlu vaccinations for children are down about 5% compared with where they were before the Covid-19 pandemic, Walensky said.\n\nIn a typical year, about 60% of American adults get vaccinated against influenza.\n\nFlu hits the US hard\n\nFlu season has gotten off to an early and severe start in the US, with hospitalization rates hitting levels that typically aren’t seen until December or January.\n\n“We, of course, look in real time as to how well we think the influenza match is to what is circulating right now. The good news is that looks like it is a very good match,” Walensky said of the early start to the respiratory virus season.\n\nShe noted that the CDC would have more definitive data later in the season but that the data is encouraging.\n\nWalensky said that even when the vaccine doesn’t closely match the circulating flu strains, “We see a 35% decrease in rates of hospitalization … which really just emphasizes, when we do have a good match, how much more effective it will be.”\n\nCDC data shows that nearly 20,000 people in the United States were admitted to the hospital for flu during the week of Thanksgiving, almost double the number of admissions from the week before.\n\nCovid-19 hospitalizations have ticked up as well, rising 27% in the week after Thanksgiving. But Covid-19 is no longer the only virus straining hospitals.\n\nJust 5% of the US population lives in an area considered to have a high Covid-19 community level.\n\nWalensky said Monday that the CDC was “actively looking into” expanding its community levels beyond Covid-19 to include the effects of other viruses, such as the flu.\n\n“In the meantime, what I do want to say is, one need not take wait for CDC action in order to put a mask,” she said.\n\nPeople who are sick should stay home and away from others, use good hygiene like covering coughs and washing hands frequently, use a high-quality mask and improve the ventilation in indoor spaces, Walensky said.\n\nTreatment is available\n\nIf you do get sick, it’s important to get tested, even if you’ve been vaccinated, said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, board chair of the American Medical Association and an internal medicine physician in Atlanta.\n\nIf you have Covid-19 or the flu, there are antiviral medications for both. But flu antivirals don’t work against Covid-19, and vice versa.\n\n“It is going to be a confusing respiratory infections season. Figuring out what’s making people sick is going to be a conundrum,” Fryhofer said.\n\nIn response to a question about shortages of key medications during this rough virus season, Walensky said that “CDC is aware of the reports of some of the shortages for both antivirals as well as antibiotics across the country. I know FDA is working…with manufacturers to try and explore what can be done to address this.”\n\nShe also urged doctors not to prescribe antibiotics for illnesses caused by viruses.\n\nDr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said he and his colleagues have been astonished by the steep increase in flu cases this season. They have also wondered what could be causing it.\n\nHe says it’s likely that after two years without much flu activity in the US, we lost some of our immunity against that virus just as the country has returned to more normal travel and activity patterns.\n\n“Some of it has got to do with our behaviors in the past, having avoided flu and now opening up our lives to activities such as travel, religious services, getting together with families, going out to entertainment venues and doing all those things that take us into groups,” he said.\n\nThe flu vaccines are good at preventing severe outcomes, he said, but they don’t do much to stop the virus’ spread.\n\n“It keeps you out of the emergency room, the hospital, the intensive care unit and the cemetery. It’s not very good at interrupting transmission, and it is not very good at preventing milder infection,” he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSchaffner says it’s likely that flu hospitalizations are going up because the virus is hitting the elderly, who, on the whole, tend to get less protection from vaccinations.\n\n“The vaccine works least well among the population we most want to protect, namely older people, and that’s because they have immune systems that are much less robust than the immune systems of younger people.”\n\nSchaffner noted that there are high-dose vaccines for seniors, which are preferred for this age group to help increase their protection.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/12/06/flu-vaccine-rates-rural-covid-19-vaccine/3832618001/", "title": "What vaccination rates in rural America tell us about the advent of ...", "text": "America’s poor track record vaccinating people against the flu spells trouble for the coming effort to immunize the nation against COVID-19, experts say, particularly in rural areas where the novel coronavirus is raging out of control.\n\nA USA TODAY analysis of flu vaccine rates among Medicare participants shows that rural counties from West Texas to northern Nebraska to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan had some of the country’s lowest vaccination rates in 2017, the most recent year with data. It’s a pattern that holds true across America. The more rural the county, the lower flu vaccination rates tended to be.\n\nData for the analysis came from the County Health Rankings project and the Index of Relative Rurality, a metric that ranks counties based on population size, density, remoteness, and built-up area. The analysis identified 604 counties where fewer than a third of Medicare participants received flu vaccines, 580 of which were predominantly rural.\n\nThese places were home to more than 13 million people and were spread across the nation; all but nine states had at least one low-vaccination county.\n\nAt the extreme, there were 215 counties where fewer than 1 in 4 residents on Medicare were vaccinated.\n\n“We don't have the convenience of jumping into a Walgreens, CVS or Walmart and getting our flu shot. Our nearest Walgreens and Walmart are 30 miles away,” said Dr. Jennifer Bacani McKenney, a family physician and the Wilson County Health Officer in Fredonia, Kansas, explaining some of the barriers in rural areas that exist in addition to vaccine hesitancy and distrust.\n\nBecause of financial, storage and staffing issues, she said, \"none of the providers in our county and many private clinics across the state do not provide in-clinic vaccinations, so the patient is required to make an additional appointment to get vaccines at a health department.\"\n\nOf course, people who opt out of the flu vaccine might seek it for the coronavirus because the pandemic has killed more people than the annual flu. At the same time, people who previously took the flu vaccine might not get their shots for COVID-19 because the pandemic has intensified Americans’ skepticism of science and drug regulators.\n\nBut flu vaccination rates can at least provide clues to how rural America will respond to the arrival of the COVID-19 vaccine. Data on flu vaccination among Medicare enrollees – primary elderly Americans – provide a detailed geographic window into how the COVID-19 vaccine will be accepted by that key at-risk group, said Dr. Randy Hubach, an associate professor of rural health and director of the Sexual Health Research Lab at Oklahoma State University. “I think it’s an accurate contextual representation of what we can probably expect with the COVID vaccine.”\n\nThe potential consequences for rural America can be seen in flu data. Historic data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder database show that the flu virus tends to kill at higher rates in more rural counties.\n\nExperts say if COVID-19 vaccination follows the same pattern as the flu, the flow of people between these communities and the rest of the country will put both city dwellers and rural residents at risk.\n\nFlu vaccination has largely skipped much of rural America because, in part, it’s harder for people in remote communities to get to pharmacies, clinics or hospitals offering vaccines. There’s also a longstanding distrust in the medical system in these areas. Yet getting the COVID-19 vaccine to these areas will be key to tamping down a virus that’s ravaged rural communities, experts said.\n\n“Ensuring vaccine coverage of rural communities is an essential part of the strategy to protect rural communities from COVID-19,” Dr. Thomas Tsai, a surgeon and health policy researcher at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in an email.\n\nHerd immunity\n\nResearchers don’t know how much of the U.S. population will need to be protected to stop the spread of COVID-19. Estimates range from 50% to as high as 90% of the population to achieve a threshold epidemiologists describe as “herd immunity.”\n\nReaching that threshold will be a struggle, if the flu vaccine is any indication. Only half the country gets vaccinated for the flu, on average, and surveys show a growing number of people intend to refuse a COVID-19 vaccine. Achieving a much higher vaccination rate with the COVID-19 vaccine will be the difference between a coronavirus that’s endemic and actively circulating and a coronavirus that’s all but wiped out, a goal the nation has attained with the smallpox, mumps and diphtheria viruses.\n\n“How you are going to move that needle from 50% up to 75% really becomes the question,” Hubach said.\n\nMore:When could the first COVID-19 vaccines be given in the US?\n\nAnd the prickly problem of vaccine uptake is one that health officials need to figure out quickly. With two COVID-19 vaccine candidates expected to receive emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration later this month, federal and state health officials are finalizing vaccine distribution plans to immunize the front-line health care workers and nursing home residents that comprise the Phase 1a group, the Americans who will first receive the vaccine against the coronavirus.\n\nThat wave of immunizations is expected to occur before the end of the year. Mancef Slaoui, the chief science advisor to Operation Warp Speed, recently said he expected the first Americans to be vaccinated within two days of the FDA’s authorization. Dr. Nancy Messionier, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said last week that everyone in phase 1a should expect their first dose within three weeks of a vaccine being authorized.\n\nThe rollout thereafter should proceed quickly. On a Dec. 2 Operation Warp Speed call with reporters, Slaoui said he expected that 20 million people would receive either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine in December, followed by 30 million people in January and 50 million people in February, pending FDA authorization. In early 2021, vaccinations will proceed beyond front-line health care workers and nursing home residents to essential workers followed by adults with high-risk medical conditions and people aged 65 and older.\n\nBut getting vaccines to essential workers and seniors, especially in rural areas, will be an ongoing challenge given the historically low vaccination rates, which researchers sometimes refer to as 'uptake,’ in rural counties. The reason for low vaccine uptake? A variety of factors including long-standing systemic health and social inequities as well as a distrust of medical providers, says Hubach.\n\nMcKenney in Kansas is seeing vaccine distrust play out both in private clinic visits and in public town hall discussions about the coronavirus.\n\n“I hear people saying they’re hesitant to take this vaccine,” said McKenney. “They’re nervous. They don’t want to be the first ones. It goes along with the rural mentality of being suspicious of the government and science.”\n\nMore:Kentucky legislator pre-files bill prohibiting colleges from mandating vaccines\n\nThat worries McKenney because of how hard communities in Kansas and across the Plains have been hit by COVID-19 in recent months.\n\n“The numbers that we’re seeing right now in our communities actually makes me kind of terrified about what’s going to happen before we ever start vaccinating,” she said. “What’s going to happen in the next month or two months?”\n\nYet despite that damage, people aren’t changing their behaviors. “Even with those high numbers of cases and deaths, it’s still not hitting home for people,” said McKenney. “They’re saying, ‘Only 1 percent die. It’s not a big deal.’”\n\nRural counties in the Dakotas, Kansas, Montana and Mississippi have seen some of the highest COVID-19 surges with over 300 deaths per 100,000 people. Influenza and other respiratory diseases have also hit many of those same counties hard in the past, though at much lower levels – around 25 deaths per 100,000 on average, according to CDC data from 2018.\n\nEndemic illness\n\nRural residents who opt out of vaccination are far from monolithic in their reasons.\n\nLynn Ogren said she routinely passes on the flu shot and all other vaccines in Jerauld County, South Dakota, where just over one in five residents was immunized in 2017. The 69-year-old retired rancher and substitute teacher said she instead takes dietary supplements and minds a strict diet to keep in good health. She won’t be getting vaccinated for COVID-19 either, she said.\n\n“I don’t put anything foreign into my body that I don’t need to,” Ogren said. “I’ve never been vaccinated for the flu, and I don’t get vaccinated for anything.”\n\nJerauld County residents have died of COVID-19 at a rate of more than 640 per 100,000 residents, one of the highest rates in the country.\n\nHealth experts warn that if a population doesn’t attain herd immunity, places that haven’t been immunized will continue to see surges in cases and deaths from the virus known by the scientific name SARS-CoV-2. But achieving herd immunity will be a serious challenge in countries like the United States where vaccine hesitancy is widespread. The consequence is a coronavirus that returns seasonally, guaranteeing continued suffering.\n\n“What happens if countries do not reach high vaccine coverage levels? First, SARS-CoV-2 will become endemic but at a low level … with peaks in winter and troughs in summer in the northern hemisphere,” wrote the authors of a letter published last month in The Lancet journal pointing out challenges to herd immunity.\n\nDr. Roy Anderson, one of the authors and a professor in the School of Public Health at Imperial College London, said in an interview that the virus will continue to circulate if herd immunity isn’t reached. Rural areas will not be spared.\n\n“The virus will remain endemic, but cities will be major reservoirs seeding rural regions,” said Anderson, who was adamant that the virus would likely not ever go away. “It will be endemic and seasonal.”\n\nDr. Krutika Kuppalli, an assistant professor in the division of infectious disease at the Medical University of South Carolina, is also concerned.\n\n“Do I think it’s going to become endemic?” said Kuppalli. “Yeah, I do. When we have millions and millions of cases, it seems like it’s going to become endemic. My hope is we get enough people to take up the vaccine.”\n\nPromoting vaccination\n\nDespite rural counties’ historically low rates of vaccine uptake, Hubach sees an opportunity to better communicate with those communities about the COVID-19 vaccine. Tapping faith leaders and community outreach workers that have an understanding of local context and climate is going to be very important. “How do you have them say, ‘Vaccination is one thing we can do for the common good?’,” he said.\n\nMore:Side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine means 'your body responded the way it's supposed to,' experts say\n\nIn addition to tailoring public health messages to specific communities in rural counties, relying on the patient-doctor bond is an important way to build trust in the COVID-19 vaccine and boost vaccination rates, says Dr. Brian Chow, a physician and principal investigator on AstraZeneca’s COVID-9 vaccine trial at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. Many rural communities have been historically marginalized and denied health care or worse, Chow explained. Promoting COVID-19 vaccination needs to surmount distrust in medical care.\n\n“The majority of people will get vaccinated through their doctor’s office,” said Chow. “Leveraging those relationships will be key. A strong recommendation from their primary care provider really influences whether or not people accept a vaccine.”\n\nAleszu Bajak is on Twitter at @aleszubajak or can be emailed at abajak@usatoday.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/health/flu-covid-winter-us/index.html", "title": "Australia's tough flu season could spell trouble for the US this winter ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nInfluenza is always unpredictable. Infectious disease experts like to hedge their forecasts with a caution: When you’ve seen one flu season, you’ve seen one flu season.\n\nBut when forecasters try to get a bead on what influenza might have in store for North America in any given winter, they look to countries like Australia and New Zealand, where the season typically runs from April to October – winter months in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nThis year, Australia had its worst flu season in five years. Cases peaked about three times higher than the average for that period, and they topped out about two months earlier than they normally do, according to official government surveillance reports.\n\nRates of influenza-like illness have also been higher in New Zealand this year than they have been for the past two years.\n\nThe US should take heed, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Bloomberg News.\n\n“The Southern Hemisphere has had a pretty bad flu season, and it came on early,” Fauci said. “Influenza – as we all have experienced over many years – can be a serious disease, particularly when you have a bad season.”\n\nHe said that means the US could see flu make a comeback while Covid-19 is still circulating at higher levels.\n\nRecent government modeling predicts that Covid-19 will peak again in early December.\n\nIf that happens, it would be the first winter in which the US has had to contend with those two respiratory viruses circulating together at high levels, something infectious disease experts have cautioned about since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nLower immunity and maskless kids\n\nWhen Americans began isolating, social distancing and masking to slow Covid in early 2020, flu all but disappeared.\n\nAs people have returned to their normal routines, flu has staggered back, but cases haven’t approached pre-pandemic levels, which means most of us haven’t been exposed to the flu for a few years, said Dr. Jennifer Nayak, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Rochester Medical Center.\n\n“With these few mild flu seasons back-to-back, I think immunity in the population is probably lower than what it is entering an average flu season,” Nayak said.\n\nOn top of that, most kids are no longer wearing masks at schools.\n\n“We know that kids are an important source of influenza infections. They get it at school or day care, and they bring it home to the household,” Nayak says. Many adults also aren’t wearing masks or avoiding crowded spaces, “so there’s a potential for more transmission of influenza” this year.\n\nAll of that underscores the need for Americans to get vaccinated. But typically, about half do not. Just 45% of Americans got their flu shots last season, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Flu vaccination rates fell for several at-risk groups, including pregnant women and children.\n\nThe US government will launch a campaign this fall to urge people to get their flu shots and updated Covid-19 boosters at the same time.\n\nNayak wonders how those public health messages – urging people to get more vaccines to stave off more infections – may sound to pandemic-weary Americans.\n\n“I think we have to still see how this plays out with what our influenza vaccination rates are going to do,” she said.\n\nFlu’s burden on society\n\nAll of this is still hypothetical. We won’t really know for another eight weeks or so what the winter may have in store.\n\n“I think we’ve got to keep an eye – if we’re going to have something analogous to Australia – to what goes on in November,” said Jeffrey Shaman, a modeling expert at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “Do we start to see flu a little earlier than we typically do?

In the 2015-2016 flu season, just 43.3% of U.S. adults got the flu vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For those under age 18, the rate was 59%. (See graphic below)\n\nAt the same time, an estimated 24.5 million were stricken with the flu, resulting in 11 million medical visits, 308,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 deaths.\n\nThe financial impact? An estimated annual $10.4 billion in direct costs for hospitalizations and outpatient visits for adults.\n\n\"Getting the flu shot should be a no-brainer,\" said certified financial planner Chris Chen, wealth strategist with Insight Financial Strategists in Waltham, Massachusetts. \"The low or free cost of the shot is one of the great deals of everyday living, given what it can cost if you get the flu.\"\n\nIn the 2015-2016 flu season, the CDC estimates that the flu vaccine prevented about 5.1 illnesses, 2.5 million flu-induced medical visits and 71,000 hospitalizations.\n\nWhile some people use the term \"flu\" to describe just about any illness, influenza is a contagious respiratory illness that can cause mild to severe illnesses, sometimes resulting in hospitalization or even death. Some people are more likely to get severely sick from it, including older Americans, children under age 5, people with certain long-term health conditions and pregnant women.\n\nFor anyone with health insurance, the flu shot is typically free due to Obamacare, regardless of whether you get it at your doctor's office or in another setting. However, some plans might only allow you to get the shot at specific locations so it's worth checking first with the pharmacy or your insurer.\n\nThe larger pharmacies — i.e., Walgreens,CVS, Walmart Pharmacy — accept most insurance plans. Without coverage, the retail price of the shot depends on your age and recommended vaccine formulation.\n\nMore:Michigan mom jailed over vaccine refusal: Don't give my son more shots\n\nMore:What Australia's bad flu season might mean for us and other flu facts you need to know\n\nMore:7 ways to meet the costs of cold and flu season\n\nAt Walgreens, for instance, a shot that most adults and children would get runs $31.99 if you have no insurance. The price for the shot recommended for people age 65 and older is generally $59.99.\n\nIf you have no insurance and the price of a shot is prohibitive, check with your local health department. Colleges and workplaces also often offer a free way to brave the needle.\n\nMost people who get influenza recover anywhere from within a few days to less than two weeks. Others, however, develop complications such as sinus infections, bronchitis or pneumonia.\n\n\"Flu shots can be especially important for those at higher risk, but they're just as important for those of us that come in contact with those people,\" said Laura Barry, a CFP and principal and director of wealth advisory at Bronfman Rothschild in Milwaukee, Wisc. \"It could cost them a lot more.\"\n\nThe average daily cost of a hospital stay is $2,271, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The range is broad, from $3,368 in Oregon to $1,218 in South Dakota.\n\nEven if you get a mild version of the flu and need only rest, over-the-counter treatments and chicken noodle soup, missing work could cost you.\n\nThe average hourly wage of American workers is $26.55, according to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For those who don't get paid for sick days, that's $212.40 (pre-tax) for each eight-hour workday missed.\n\n\"The lower the income, the higher the impact of missing work will be on your finances if you're not getting paid for it,\" Chen said.\n\nEven if you get paid when absent, your sick days are likely limited. The average worker gets seven paid sick days after one year of service. The flu can easily eat up much of that in one fell swoop.\n\nRemember, too, that anyone you're responsible for should also get a flu shot. If you are a parent or caregiver and your charge gets ill, it will mean more workdays missed.\n\nAlso, other contagious illnesses that circulate throughout the year — i.e., the common cold, a stomach bug — could cause you to miss work, and they can't be prevented with a shot.\n\nFor the self-employed, getting the flu can be more personally costly, given that the lost productivity is borne by you rather than a separate employer.\n\nWhile it's impossible to say with certainty whether the 2017-2018 flu season will be brutal or not, and the vaccine is not a 100% promise of health, the flu shot is your best possible protection.\n\n\"You protect yourself with insurance for other risks,\" Chen said. \"The flu shot is like insurance.\"\n\n© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Last season, people vaccinated against the flu were about 40% to 70% less likely to be hospitalized because of flu illness or related complications, according to preliminary estimates from the CDC.\n\nWhile vaccine rates of adults remained steady during the ongoing pandemic, this rate faltered among other people in other age ranges.\n\nPregnant people and kids see a decline in vaccination rates\n\nFlu vaccination protection among pregnant people is down more than 16 percentage points since 2020, according to CDC data.\n\nAs of spring 2023, 48.9% of pregnant people were protected against the flu, compared to 65.5% during the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nAmong kids younger than 18, the rate of flu vaccination was roughly 55% as of April 2023, down from 62% at the start of the pandemic.\n\nFloridians unsure:Florida health officials say most people shouldn't get new COVID shot, contradicting CDC\n\nOlder patients continue to have higher vaccination rates\n\nAlmost 75% of adults 65 and older were protected against the flu as of last spring.\n\nA little over 50% of all adults aged 50 to 64 were vaccinated against the flu,\n\nWhile only 36% of adults aged 18 to 49 received a flu vaccine.\n\nFlu vaccination coverage for adults 65 and older is higher compared to their coverage at the same time last year.\n\nHow have COVID vaccine rates changed?\n\nWhen the COVID-19 vaccination first became available to the public in early 2021, about 80% of adults received their initial series of vaccinations, according to the CDC. Only 20% of adults got last year’s COVID-19 booster vaccine.\n\nFlu season is here:CDC announces flu shot recommendations\n\nWhat causes vaccine skepticism?\n\nHelen Maser, a Walgreens pharmacist based in New York said people may have reservations about getting vaccinated because of the fear of the unknown: “It's all about education. People are afraid of what they don't know,” said Maser. “If you come and ask a question, we can give you the knowledge, so you can make a good decision based on your own personal care that empowers you to take care of yourself and your family.”\n\nA UCLA study from 2022 found that adult flu vaccination rates dropped in the same states that had low rates of COVID-19 vaccination. The study’s findings suggest factors that cause low COVID-19 vaccine rates such as mistrust in the vaccine, concerns about side effects and a lack of trust in government are connected to declines in flu vaccine rates, compared to pre-pandemic years.\n\nWidespread online misinformation about the coronavirus and the vaccine caused many Americans to distrust public health expert’s recommendations on getting vaccinated. Some government officials have even contradicted the CDC, refusing to endorse the updated COVID booster shots, leading to more mistrust.\n\nHow can I prepare for flu season?\n\nSeptember and October remain the best times for most people to get their flu vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nVaccination should continue after October and throughout the given flu season since “influenza activity might not occur in certain communities until February, March, or later.” The CDC also recommends vaccination \"as long as flu viruses pose a threat.\"\n\nIt is safe to get a flu and COVID-19 shot at the same time, experts say.

State officials announced Wednesday the flu vaccine is required for all Massachusetts students enrolled in child care, preschool, K-12 and post-secondary institutions.\n\n“It is more important now than ever to get a flu vaccine because flu symptoms are very similar to those of COVID-19, and preventing the flu will save lives and preserve health care resources,” said Dr. Lawrence Madoff, medical director of the Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.\n\nWhen should I get my flu shot?\n\nDr. Susan Rehm, vice chair at the Cleveland Clinic’s Department of Infectious Diseases, said patients should get the influenza vaccine as soon as possible.\n\nCVS stores have the flu vaccine in stock, and it became available Monday at Walgreens.\n\n“I plan to get my flu shot as soon as the vaccines are available,” Rehm said. “My understanding is that they should be available in late August, early September nationwide.”\n\nOther doctors recommend that patients get their flu shot in late September or early October, so protection can last throughout the flu season, which typically ends around March or April. The vaccine lasts about six months.\n\nThe CDC recommends people get a flu vaccine no later than the end of October – because it takes a few weeks for the vaccine to become fully protective – but encourages people to get vaccinated later rather than not at all.\n\nHealthy people can get their flu vaccine as soon as it’s available, but experts recommend older people and those who are immunocompromised wait until mid-fall to get their shots, so they last throughout the flu season.\n\nWhat is the high-dose flu shot for seniors?\n\nPeople over 65 should get Fluzone High-Dose, or FLUAD, because it provides better protection against flu viruses.\n\nFluzone High-Dose contains four times the antigen that's in a standard dose, effectively making it a stronger version of the regular flu shot. FLUAD pairs the regular vaccine with an adjuvant, an immune stimulant, to cause the immune system to have a higher response to the vaccine.\n\nResearch indicates that such high-dose flu vaccines have improved a patient's protection against the flu. A peer-reviewed study published in The New England Journal of Medicine and sponsored by Sanofi, the company behind Fluzone High-Dose, found the high-dose vaccine is about 24% more effective than the standard shot in preventing the flu.\n\nAn observational study in 2013 found FLUAD is 51% effective in preventing flu-related hospitalizations for patients 65 and older. There are no studies that do a comparative analysis between the two vaccines.\n\nIs the flu vaccine safe?\n\nAccording to the CDC, hundreds of millions of Americans have safely received flu vaccine over the past 50 years. Common side effects for the vaccine include soreness at the injection spot, headache, fever, nausea and muscle aches.\n\nDr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, emphasized that these symptoms are not the flu because the vaccine cannot cause influenza.\n\n“That’s just your body working on the vaccine and your immune response responding to the vaccine,” he said. “That’s a small price to pay to keep you out of the emergency room. Believe me.”\n\nSome studies have found a small association of the flu vaccine with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), but Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said there’s a one in a million chance of that happening.\n\nNot only is the flu vaccine safe, but the pharmacies, doctors offices and hospitals administering it are also safe.\n\nHorovitz and Schaffner said hospitals take all the necessary precautions to make sure patients are protected against COVID-19. Some hospitals send staff out to patients’ cars for inoculation while others allow them to bypass the waiting room. Doctors offices require masks and social distancing, and they are routinely disinfected.\n\n“Call your health care provider to make sure you can get in and out quickly,” Schaffner advised. “It’s safe to get the flu vaccine and very important.”\n\nWill it help prevent COVID-19?\n\nExperts speculate any vaccine could hypothetically provide some protection against a virus, but there’s little data that suggests the flu vaccine can protect against the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.\n\n“We don’t want to confuse people of that … because there’s simply no data,” Schaffner said. “Flu vaccine prevents flu; we’re working on a coronavirus vaccine. They’re separate.”\n\nA study in 2018 found that the flu vaccine reduces the risk of being admitted to an ICU with flu by 82%, according to the CDC.\n\n\"People perhaps forget that influenza is something that we see every year,\" Rehm said. \"Tens of thousands of people die of influenza ever year, including people who are very healthy, and hundreds of thousands of people are hospitalized every year.\"\n\nDoctors said it will be even more hectic this year because some flu and COVID-19 symptoms overlap, delaying diagnosis and possibly care.\n\nWhat can we expect from this year’s flu season and vaccine?\n\n“Even before COVID, what we say about the flu is that it’s predictably unpredictable,” Rehm said. “There are some years that it’s a light year and some years that it’s horrible.”\n\nFlu experts said they sometimes look at Australia’s flu season to get a sense of the strain and how it spreads, because winter in the Southern Hemisphere started a few months ago.\n\nAccording to the country’s Department of Health surveillance report, influenza has virtually disappeared: only 85 cases in the last two weeks of June, compared with more than 20,000 confirmed cases that time last year.\n\n“Australia has had a modest season, but they were very good at implementing COVID containment measures, and of course, we’re not,” Schaffner said. “So we’re anticipating that we’re going to have a flu season that’s substantial.”\n\nThe CDC said two types of vaccines are available for the 2020-2021 season: the trivalent and quadrivalent. Trivalents contain two flu A strains and one flu B strain and are available only as high-dose vaccines. Quadrivalents contain those three strains plus an additional flu B strain, and they can be high- or standard-dose vaccines.\n\nThough some doctors may have both vaccines, others may have only one, depending on their supply chain. Natasha Bhuyan, a practicing family physician in Phoenix, said people should get whatever vaccine is available.\n\n\"Vaccines are a selfless act. They’re protecting yourself and your friends through herd immunity,\" she said. \"Any vaccine that you can get access to, you can get.\"\n\nHorovitz said vaccine production and distribution have been on schedule, despite international focus on coronavirus vaccine development. He has received his shipment to the hospital and plans to administer the vaccine with four strains closer to the start of the season.\n\n“I don’t think anything suffered because something else was being developed,” he said. “(The flu vaccine) has been pretty well established for the last 20 to 30 years.”\n\nProducers boosted supplies of the flu vaccine to meet what they expect will be higher demand. Vaccine maker Sanofi announced Monday that it will produce 15% more vaccine than in a normal year.\n\nRedfield told JAMA the CDC arranged for an additional 9.3 million doses of low-cost flu vaccine for uninsured adults, up from 500,000. The agency expanded plans to reach out to minority communities.\n\nWhat about the nasal spray instead of the shot?\n\nAfter the swine flu pandemic in 2009, several studies showed the nasal spray flu vaccine was less effective against H1N1 viruses, leading the CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to advise against it.\n\nSince the 2017-2018 season, the advisory committee and the CDC voted to resume the recommendation for its use after the manufacturer used new H1N1 vaccine viruses in production.\n\nThough agencies and advisory committees don’t recommend one vaccine over the other, some pediatricians argue the nasal spray is easier to administer to children than a shot.\n\nOther doctors prefer the flu shot because some of the nasal spray side effects mimic respiratory symptoms, including wheezing, coughing and a runny nose, according to the CDC. Horovitz said anything that presents cold symptoms should probably be avoided, especially among children who are vectors of respiratory diseases.\n\n“Giving them something that gives them cold (symptoms) for two or three days may expel more virus if they’re asymptomatic with COVID,” he said.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

That ...", "text": "More than 4 in 10 Americans aren't sure about or aren't planning on getting a flu shot this year, a new survey found, in a worrying trend public health experts say could exacerbate a worse-than-average flu season.\n\nLast year's worries around a \"twindemic\" of influenza and COVID-19 overwhelming hospitals around the nation luckily went unfounded after a historically mild flu season.\n\nBut with COVID-19 vaccinations affording many people a return to more \"normal\" lives of socialization and in-person work during flu season, hospitals and health systems could be strained in parts of the country where vaccination against both viruses remains low, doctors say.\n\n\"We're particularly concerned because COIVD is out there,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. \"Flu will come back this year. And we don't want to further stress our already very stressed health care system.\"\n\nAnd while COVID-19 cases are declining nationally, there are parts of the country \"where a large proportion of the population is undervaccinated against COVID,\" Schaffner said. \"COVID is going to remain active in those parts of the country. And then if you add influenza to that, I think in parts of the country, we could have a tough winter.\"\n\n'We face the same threat this year':Experts renew warnings of 'twindemic' as US enters flu season amid rising COVID-19 cases\n\nA survey of more than 1,000 U.S. adults commissioned by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases found that while more than 60% of Americans agreed the flu shot was the best way to prevent flu deaths and hospitalizations, 44% said they were unsure about or not planning to get a flu vaccine this year.\n\nThe causes of flu vaccine hesitancy may be less political than the divides driving COVID-19 vaccine skepticism, Schaffner said. They're a yearly practice, and unlike vaccines for polio or measles, which have virtually eradicated those diseases in the United States, the flu sticks around.\n\nThe top reason cited for flu vaccine hesitancy by surveyed adults was that it doesn't work very well.\n\nSchaffner said while the flu vaccine is by no means perfect, it still provides significant protection against hospitalization and death.\n\n\"It would be great if we had a vaccine that was even more effective than what we have,\" said Dr. Thomas Holland, an infectious diseases specialist at Duke University Hospital. \"But the fact remains that the most effective way, the best tool that we have to prevent influenza infections and hospitalizations and deaths is still the annual vaccine.\"\n\nEverything you need to know about flu shots:When should I get one? What about the COVID booster?\n\nSurvey respondents also said they wouldn't get a flu shot because they never get the flu, were worried about side effects, did not consider flu to be a serious illness, or were worried about getting flu from the vaccine.\n\nThe flu vaccine cannot give people the flu, and side effects indicate a proper immune response in the body. It also can be received at the same time as a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHolland said about half of Americans get a flu shot in a typical year. But immunity wanes much more quickly compared with COVID-19 vaccines, and flu viruses change yearly, requiring annual shots.\n\nHowever, with so few people exposed to the influenza virus last season, people won't have the potential added defense against illness that natural immunity can bring, he said.\n\nThe 2020-2021 flu season was practically nonexistent. Public health and clinical laboratories reported 2,038 flu cases during the season from Sept. 27, 2020, to April 24, according to the CDC.\n\nSchaffner said much of that decline was due to social distancing and mask-wearing practiced around the country to prevent the spread of COVID-19. With many of those restrictions eased, Schaffner expects flu to return.\n\nThe return of many children to classrooms poses a significant threat of transmission, he added, given children shed flu virus much more and for longer periods than adults.\n\nGot the sniffles? Colds are rushing back. Here's how to tell if it's COVID-19.\n\nOne potential benefit of the pandemic has been an increased willingness of people to stay home when sick rather than powering through an illness and potentially spreading it to others, Holland said.\n\nThe survey found 45% of Americans said they were more likely to stay home from work or school when ill because of the pandemic. A majority also said they would wear a mask at least sometimes during this flu season.\n\nTo boost vaccination numbers, Schaffner said physicians need to make the flu shot a priority in their messaging. Often, it is an afterthought at the end of a visit.\n\n\"Health care providers of all kinds have to be not just influenza vaccine recommenders, they have to be influenza vaccine insisters,\" Schaffner said.\n\nContributing: Adrianna Rodriguez", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/07"}]}

But already, the tale is one of searing trauma, with the broader American Jewish community now again forced to be resilient as it’s reminded of the ever-present potential for disaster.\n\nA rabbi welcomes a stranger\n\nA stranger arrived that morning at the synagogue.\n\nRabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker welcomed in the man and made him a cup of tea, the rabbi told CBS on Monday.\n\nCytron-Walker may not have known immediately that Malik Faisal Akram, 44, was a British national. Akram had arrived in the US via New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in late December, a US law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nIn the two weeks before he met Cytron-Walker, Akram had spent three nights – January 6, 11 and 13 – at a Dallas homeless shelter, according to Union Gospel Mission Dallas CEO Bruce Butler. He was very quiet and wasn’t there long enough to build any relationships, Butler said.\n\nOver their shared tea, Cytron-Walker and Akram talked, the rabbi said.\n\n“Some of his story didn’t quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that’s not necessarily an uncommon thing,” said the rabbi, who soon that day would lead a religious service for the 157 membership families of his congregation, established in 1999.\n\nThe rabbi pointed Jeffrey Cohen, the vice president on the synagogue’s board of trustees, to their guest that day. Cohen went over and introduced himself, he wrote in a Facebook post describing his experience.\n\n“He was on the phone, but briefly stopped his conversation,” Cohen said. “He said hello, smiled, and after we introduced ourselves, I let him go back to his call. He seemed calm and happy to be in from the frigid 20 degree morning. His eyes weren’t darting around; his hands were open and calm, he said hello, he smiled.”\n\nBecause of the recent coronavirus surge, many of Congregation Beth Israel’s members had stayed home on Saturday to watch the weekly prayers via Facebook or Zoom. Services began at 10 a.m.\n\nAs the rabbi led the prayers – his back turned as he faced toward Jerusalem – he heard a click. It came from the stranger.\n\n“And it turned out, that it was his gun,” Cytron-Walker said.\n\nCohen said he heard that same click, the “unmistakable sound of an automatic slide engaging a round.” The mysterious guest then began yelling something. Cohen dialed 911 on his phone, put the screen side down and moved as commanded, he wrote.\n\nAkram took four people hostage, including the rabbi, authorities said.\n\n‘I’m going to die at the end of this’\n\nPolice got an emergency call at 10:41 a.m.\n\nThey rushed to the synagogue and set up a perimeter, evacuating residents nearby, police said. Soon, nearly 200 members of local, state and federal law enforcement, including the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on hand, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said.\n\nMeanwhile, the livestream – intended for the faithful who’d stayed home to be safe from Covid-19 – appeared to capture some of what Akram was saying.\n\n“I’m gunned up. I’m ammo-ed up,” he told someone he called nephew. “Guess what, I will die.”\n\nThe audio can be difficult to understand, and it’s not clear whom Akram is talking to. But it’s clear he planned to die during the standoff, he repeatedly told people.\n\n“OK, are you listening? I don’t want you to cry. Listen! I’m going to release these four guys … but then I’m going to go in the yard, yeah? … And they’re going to take me, alright? I’m going to die at the end of this, alright? Are you listening? I am going to die! OK? So, don’t cry over me,” the man said to someone else.\n\nCongregation member Stacey Silverman watched the livestream for more than an hour. She heard the suspect ranting, sometimes switching between saying, “I’m not a criminal,” to apologies, she said.\n\nThe man vacillated among languages and was “screaming hysterically,” she said. He claimed to have a bomb.\n\nAkram also “spoke repeatedly about a convicted terrorist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States,” the FBI said in a statement. The convict is believed to be Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani with a PhD in neuroscience who is serving a federal prison sentence in Fort Worth after being found guilty of attempted murder and other charges in an assault on US officers in Afghanistan.\n\nShe was not involved in the Colleyville attack, her attorney said Saturday.\n\n“He wanted this woman released and he wanted to talk to her and he thought – well, he said point-blank – he chose this synagogue because ‘Jews control the world. Jews control the media. Jews control the banks. I want to talk to chief rabbi of the United States,’” Cohen told CNN, adding there is no chief rabbi in the US.\n\nInside the synagogue, Cohen resisted following exactly as Akram commanded, he wrote in his Facebook post. Rather than go to the back of the room as ordered, Cohen stayed in line with one of the exits. When a police officer came to the door and the hostage-taker became more agitated, Cohen moved closer to the exit door, he wrote.\n\nAkram let them call their families, and Cohen called his wife, daughter and son and even posted on Facebook. He also slowly moved a few chairs in front of him – “anything to slow or divert a bullet or shrapnel,” he wrote.\n\nAt one point – at the suspect’s request – the rabbi being held hostage called a well-known rabbi in New York City so the suspect could say Siddiqi was framed and he wanted her released, two officials briefed on investigation said.\n\nAs hours ticked on, law enforcement negotiators had a “high frequency and duration of contact” with the suspect, DeSarno said. The FBI called out its Hostage Rescue Team from Quantico, Virginia, and some 60 to 70 people came to the site, Colleyville Police Chief Michael Miller said.\n\nOne hostage – a man – was released unharmed around 5 p.m., Colleyville Police Sgt. Dara Nelson said. The hostage-taker did not harm the hostages, the rabbi told CBS.\n\nBut, he added, they were threatened the entire time.\n\nA thrown chair activates a bold escape\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Police speak out after synagogue hostages were rescued 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nWith threats and attacks targeting Jewish people growing more common in recent years, Cytron-Walker and his congregation had participated in security courses with law enforcement agencies, he said.\n\nAs Saturday afternoon rolled to the night – and the hostage-taker’s demeanor began to change – that training helped the rabbi and the two others who were still held against their will.\n\n“In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” Cytron-Walker said Sunday in a statement. “Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself.”\n\nCohen helped another hostage move closer to that exit, and whispered to him about the door, he wrote. The third hostage later joined them when they received pizza to eat, putting them all within 20 feet of the exit door.\n\nThey spoke with Akram and asked him questions, trying to buy the FBI time to move into position, he wrote.\n\nYet the situation began to devolve. “At one point, our attacker instructed us to get on our knees. I reared up in my chair, stared at him sternly. I think I slowly moved my head and mouthed NO. He stared at me, then moved back to sit down. It was this moment when Rabbi Charlie yelled run,” he wrote.\n\nCytron-Walker saw his opening when he got the gunman a drink in a glass, he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday.\n\n“As he was drinking, the gun wasn’t in the best position and I thought this was our best chance, I needed to make sure the people who were still with me that they were ready to go,” the rabbi said.\n\n“And so there was a chair that was right in front of me. I told the guys to go, I picked it up and I threw it at him with all the adrenaline,” Cytron-Walker said. “It was absolutely terrifying and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be shot, and I did not hear a shot fired as I made it out the door. I was the last one out.”\n\nThe three hostages burst through the exit door and sprinted away from the building, video taken from outside the synagogue by CNN affiliate WFAA shows. Seconds later, a man in black holding what appears to be a gun stepped halfway through the exit to look outside. He then returned inside the building without shooting, the video shows.\n\nA group of heavily armed law enforcement personnel moved toward another part of the building, the video shows. About 30 seconds later, a series of four bangs erupted, followed by a louder explosive boom that set a number of car alarms to begin wailing. Other armed law enforcement personnel moved into a different position by the building, and another three loud bangs then went off, the video shows.\n\nThe loud boom, heard by a CNN team near the synagogue at about 9:12 p.m., was the result of entry tools used by the hostage rescue team, an ATF spokesperson said.\n\nThe rescue team breached the synagogue, Miller said. The suspect was killed.\n\nNone of the four hostages was harmed, DeSarno said.\n\nMore booms echoed as the tactical team disposed of leftover entry explosives brought by the rescue team. Crime scene investigators recovered one firearm they believe belonged to the suspect, the ATF spokesperson said. An ATF dog found no more explosives, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Facebook, Cohen credited active shooter training he received for his survival and escape.\n\n“We weren’t released or freed,” he said. “We escaped because we had training from the Secure Community Network on what to do in the event of an active shooter.”\n\nThe Secure Community Network describes itself as the “official safety and security organization of the Jewish community in North America.”\n\n“Those courses, that instruction, helped me to understand that you need to act in moments where your life is threatened. I would not have had the courage, I would not have had the knowhow or what to do without that instruction,” Cytron-Walker said. “I want people to understand, it doesn’t matter if you are in a synagogue, if you’re Jewish, if you’re Muslim, if you’re Christian, if you’re religious at all, it can happen in a shopping mall. Unfortunately this is the world that we’re living in.”\n\n‘The time to heal our community has begun’\n\nOn Sunday morning, Cytron-Walker took to Facebook, this time to express his gratitude to those who supported him throughout Saturday’s ordeal.\n\n“I am thankful and filled with appreciation for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support, all of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us,” he wrote in the Facebook post.\n\n“I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the CBI Community, the Jewish Community, the Human Community. I am grateful that we made it out. I am grateful to be alive,” Cytron-Walker said in the post.\n\nNothing suggests the threat posed by Akram is continuing, officials said. The investigation into the case and its motive is likely to be global, DeSarno added, including contacts with Tel Aviv and London.\n\nInitially, the FBI, based on its exchanges, found the suspect to be “singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community, but we’ll continue to work to find motive,” DeSarno said.\n\nOn Monday, the agency called Saturday’s attack “a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted,” according to a statement. The case “is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.”\n\nCongregation Beth Israel held a special service Monday night at which the rabbi spoke about the need to heal after the incident.\n\n“Thank God, thank God,” Cytron-Walker said. “It could’ve been so much worse, and I am overflowing, truly overflowing, with gratitude.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/23/us/california-san-jose-small-plane-crash/index.html", "title": "Small plane crashes near residential neighborhood in San Jose ...", "text": "1.

ANDREWS, Scotland - Rory McIlroy had said all the right things in his post-round news conference and with those duties complete, he slumped into a four-passenger golf cart and buried his head into wife Erica's left shoulder and all the emotions came flooding out.\n\nThe 150th Open Championship, the one McIlroy labeled his Holy Grail earlier in the week, was his to win or lose. After sharing the 54-hole lead with Viktor Hovland, McIlroy had built a two-stroke lead with nine holes to go. The World No. 2 had his strut back this week and was playing chess against the fabled seaside links in a way that would have made past champions here like Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods proud.\n\nMcIlroy could almost taste the alcohol he surely would have consumed from the Claret Jug once he regained possession of the winner's trophy for the first time since 2014 and ended his nearly eight-year winless drought.\n\nOnly problem is Cameron Smith of Australia had other plans and vaulted into the lead by reeling off five back-nine birdies in a row en route to shooting 8-under 64 at the Old Course. McIlroy, who closed in 2-under 70, two shots back, and finished in third, was left to wonder what more he had to do claim his elusive fifth major title.\n\nBRITISH OPEN:Cameron Smith seals victory with spectacular final-round 64\n\nCAMERON SMITH:British Open winner is 'going to find out how many beers' fit in Claret Jug\n\nSPORTS NEWSLETTER:Sign up now to get daily updates in your inbox\n\n\"I'll be OK,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, it's not life or death. I'll have other chances to win the Open Championship and other chances to win majors. It's one that I feel like I let slip away, but there will be other opportunities.\"\n\nExcept he didn't look OK as he drove off. He rued failing to convert on birdie chances at Nos. 3, 6 and 9, which could have nipped Smith's charge in the bud. McIlroy hit every green in regulation in the final round and had a wonderful sense of speed with his putter, but he picked a bad time for it to go cold. He didn't make a single putt of consequence.\n\n\"I felt like I didn't do much wrong today, but I didn't do much right either,\" he said. \"It's just one of those days where I played a really controlled round of golf. I did what I felt like I needed to just apart from capitalizing on the easier holes - around the turn, 9, 12, 14. If I had made the birdies there from good positions, it probably would have been a different story.\"\n\nThis one will hurt because McIlroy knows he had every chance to stop Smith, but with every birdie by Smith, his confidence grew and the pressure on McIlroy tightened.\n\n\"I can't be too despondent because of how this year's went and this year's going,\" he said. \"I'm playing some of the best golf I've played in a long time. So it's just a matter of keep knocking on the door, and eventually one will open.\"\n\nBut despondent is what he looked like as he hid his face in his wife's embrace. He finished second at the Masters, eighth at the PGA Championship, T-5 at the U.S. Open, and third at the Open - a banner-type year for Rickie Fowler in 2014 but for McIlroy it is close but no cigar. The end result is a failure and like Vesuvius he has to wait until April to begin the quest of pushing the ball up the mountain again.\n\nIt hurt because he admitted that he had dreamed of winning the 150th and allowed himself moments to look ahead and think about what it might be like to hold the trophy and be celebrated on the 18th green as the Champion Golfer of the Year.\n\n\"I'm only human.

Tell us how we can make chips without spending all this money. Tell us how we can be safer, you don’t have to worry about your kids as much as you do today,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said in remarks at the AFPI conference in advance of Trump’s speech. “You did it once, you can do it again.”\n\nWhich, well, let me just stop you there.\n\nThe notion being put forward by Graham, that Trump has a) given a serious policy address and b) painted a “hopeful” vision for America is simply false.\n\nGo back to Trump’s two most famous/infamous speeches: The one to kickoff his 2016 presidential campaign and the one he delivered at his 2017 inauguration.\n\nThe first is defined in the public’s mind by Trump’s insistence that “when Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. … They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”\n\n(In that same speech, Trump blasted his opponents for their lack of understanding about air conditioning, bragged about his crowd size and called the US as a “dumping ground for everybody else’s problems.”)\n\nHopeful!\n\nThen there was Trump’s inauguration speech, which is remembered for Trump’s evocation of “American carnage” in describing the current state of the country.\n\nUplifting!\n\nThe simple fact is that Trump’s appeal has NEVER been about policies or a hopeful vision. It’s always been totally and completely about Trump himself – and the roiling sense of grievance, nostalgia and score-settling that sits at the center of his personality.\n\nSure, there have been issues that embodied that sentiment. Trump voters rallied behind his call to build a border wall – and make Mexico pay for it – because it sounded tough and freaked out liberal elites. His foreign policy stances appealed to voters who wanted America to go back to the take-no-prisoners approach they remembered from decades ago. (That such an American foreign policy stance never existed was besides the point for these folks.)\n\nTrump’s ever-shifting views on, well, most things, was the clearest evidence that his winning campaign – and the four years he spent in the White House — weren’t about advancing some broader theory of the case. They were about Trump doing whatever felt good at the moment – and the cult of personality that grew up around his many maneuvers. (In 2017, the New Yorker wrote a great piece about conservative intellectuals who tried to put an ideological framework around Trumpism. Which, well, ha!)\n\nNow to Trump’s speech on Tuesday.\n\nHe said the country was “on the brink” and the weakest that it has been since the Civil War. (Trump cited Newt Gingrich as the authority on that second claim.) He said we have “very little” public safety. He said that there is an “invasion” of immigrants coming into the country. He said, “Our streets are riddled with needles and soaked with the blood of innocent victims.” He decried “drugged-out lunatics” and “sadists” who he insisted are taking over the country. “Our country is now a cesspool of crime,” said Trump.\n\nHis policy solution? “It has to stop and it has to stop now.”\n\nWhich, well, color me unsurprised.\n\nThe Point: The appeal of Trump to voters has never, ever been about a policy or a set of policies.

Officials say people should skip large family gatherings in favor of scaled-back events. “We all want to see our family at holiday time, and yet this is a special year. This is a year unlike any we’ve ever had,” Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said. “Many things maybe could be done virtually, which is not nearly as much fun but certainly safer.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines. Suzanne Judd, an epidemiologist from the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s School of Public Health, said Thanksgiving is particularly problematic because it’s a holiday celebrated by family gatherings indoors. “Gatherings greater than 10 people pose a substantial risk of one of the people being COVID-positive and not knowing,” Judd said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The spread of the coronavirus at the state’s largest prison has accelerated beyond an initial outbreak, with 110 inmates testing positive for the virus as of Monday. Goose Creek Correctional Center first announced a virus outbreak at the facility Nov. 2, when the Alaska Department of Corrections said 22 inmates and five staff members tested positive, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The prison west of Wasilla near Point McKenzie housed 1,317 pretrial and sentenced prisoners as of Monday, department spokeswoman Sarah Gallagher said. Staff are required and inmates are strongly encouraged to wear masks, she said. The outbreak began in one of the prison’s housing units, known as mods. Each mod has 64 prisoners, indicating the outbreak has expanded beyond a single unit, Gallagher said. Each mod continues to operate as a “family unit” in order to minimize the risk of further transmission, Gallagher said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With the state reporting a daily average of 1,900 new COVID-19 cases over the past week, Gov. Doug Ducey has urged residents to be careful. In a video posted Tuesday, Ducey urged Arizona residents to wear face coverings, wash hands, practice social distancing and stay home when sick. “Gatherings of families and friends from outside your household are no safer than going to the grocery store,” he said. Ducey, a Republican, has not implemented a statewide masking requirement, while many local governments in the state have done so. He announced no new virus prevention initiatives in the video posted on social media and his office’s website. He cited past moves that included increasing testing and providing money to hospitals for protective gear, staffing and ventilators. Ducey said he wants to protect public health “keep our economy safely open and moving, We know that both are important to the health and well-being of Arizonans.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations again hit a new high Tuesday, as Gov. Asa Hutchinson resisted calls for new restrictions on businesses or gatherings to combat a surge in coronavirus cases. An outbreak of the virus among state legislators also grew to 11 on Tuesday, with a lawmaker testing positive. The Department of Health reported 24 more people were hospitalized because of COVID-19, bringing the state’s virus hospitalizations to a new high of 810. The state’s confirmed and probable virus cases rose by 1,424 to 124,235. “The numbers aren’t good, the trend is not good, and we have a lot of work to do here in Arkansas and across the nation,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news briefing on the virus. The state’s COVID-19 deaths rose by four to 2,112. The Republican governor said many of the state’s cases are coming from smaller gatherings at homes that he said can’t be regulated.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city will study the feasibility of using its enormous convention center as a temporary shelter for the increasing number of homeless people living on the streets. City Councilman Curren Price introduced a motion Tuesday seeking a report on what it would take to transform the 720,000-square-foot LA Convention Center in his downtown district. The property has not been used for conventions since the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, the pandemic has forced more people into homelessness, Price said. With more than 60,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, encampments have gone up throughout the region on sidewalks, in empty lots and under freeway overpasses. “We’re in a panic situation along with a pandemic situation. Folks on the streets are just suffering,” Price told the Los Angeles Times. “We have to do a better job of housing individuals who are homeless.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Department of Public Health and Environment has routinely deleted emails related to the coronavirus pandemic even though the state archives has asked that they be saved, a newspaper has found. The Denver Post reports it discovered that emails sent and received by state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy were deleted after the newspaper requested documents. The department said it would provide some records, including emails. But it said emails “from May would have already been auto-deleted unless otherwise preserved, or they were previously deleted by Dr. Herlihy as part of a normal business process,” said Monica Wilkerson, the department’s records and legal services liaison. As of last year, the department deleted most employee emails after 90 days. The policy mirrors similar practices by the state government. The Colorado State Archives posted a notice in June asking agencies to “keep all records related to COVID-19.” Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition Executive Director Jeff Roberts said it is important to keep records so that journalists can report on a crisis affecting the health and safety of residents.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Canaan: More than 350 students and 20 teachers in a wealthy suburb are in quarantine after a new round of coronavirus testing turned up 15 infections, according to the local school district. New Canaan schools on Tuesday reported 13 students and two teachers tested positive, days after all 540 tests of students came back negative, the Stamford Advocate reports. There were also 26 new positive tests last weekend, First Selectman Kevin Moynihan said. “We continue to see cases spread from gatherings, dinner parties, out-of-town caregivers, house cleaners and, not unexpectedly, within families,” Moynihan said. “This rapid case increase over the weekend illustrates how fast community transmission spreads and accelerates.” The most recent testing resulted in quarantines for 213 students at New Canaan High School, 70 at Saxe Middle School and 70 at three elementary schools. People in quarantine are told they must stay home for 14 days.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Attorneys for a cleric say they’ve reached a settlement with Gov. John Carney over the coronavirus restrictions he imposed on worship services. The Rev. Christopher Allan Bullock filed a lawsuit in May claiming Carney’s restrictions were unconstitutional and discriminatory. Carney then rescinded many of the restrictions, and his lawyers argued Bullock’s claims were moot. But Bullock’s attorneys asked for an injunction prohibiting the governor from imposing similar limitations in the future. Lawyers representing the New Castle County pastor and community activist said Wednesday that the settlement requires the governor to treat houses of worship in a neutral manner in any future emergency. Among other things, if certain businesses or activities are considered essential, that definition will include churches. Attorney Thomas Neuberger said the state also agreed to pay the plaintiffs $150,000 in lawyer fees and $7,200 in court costs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. reported 206 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday – its highest single-day total since late May, WUSA-TV reports. Daily test data lags behind and is only available up to Nov. 7, so it’s unclear what, if any, connection to the weekend’s celebrations these numbers may have. The city is now averaging more than 100 new cases a day for the first time since May 30.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than a dozen Miami nurses and front-line health care workers are finally getting a well-deserved break. The group was scheduled for an upcoming, mandatory – aka boring – 48-hour training but was instead surprised with an island vacation to the Florida Keys. Jackson Health System supervisors were asked to choose staff who went above and beyond during the pandemic. Many of the staff, including respiratory therapists and lab techs, have not been able to take any time off during the pandemic to relax or spend time with their loved ones and have been working tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients, the hospital said. The 50 workers were told they had to attend a two-day training, but when they gathered at the hospital Tuesday, they were handed gift boxes with gift certificates. Hawks Cay Resort in the Florida Keys donated two-night stays to its island on Duck Key, surrounded by sparkling waters and swaying palm trees, as part of its Heroes Salute program.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is again hitting a new peak in public high school graduation rates. The state Department of Education said Tuesday that 83.8% of seniors graduated on time in the spring. That’s the highest level recorded since Georgia began calculating according to current methods, which require a student to graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma, and rose from 82% in 2019. The state says part of the increase came from a waiver allowing the state to count students with significant cognitive disabilities, about 1% of students overall, as graduating on time even if they take more than four years to complete high school. Because of the pandemic, many high school students did not have to take end-of-course exams last year, which would have counted for 20% of their overall grade. Most students take the courses that require the exams before their senior year, so it’s unclear whether the lack of tests influenced Georgia’s graduation rates.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Bankruptcies declined in October for the eighth time in 10 months as state unemployment reached a national high of 15.1% and as tourism was in the beginning stage of reopening after a major economic downturn. There were 125 bankruptcy filings in October, a 22.6% decrease from the 162 during the same period in the previous year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Data provided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Hawaii, showed bankruptcy filings were down 9.8% to 1,274 for the year through October compared to 1,412 during the same period in 2019. Chapter 7 liquidation filings, the most common type of bankruptcy, fell 19.8% in October to 93 from 116 in the year-earlier period. Chapter 13 filings, which allow people with regular income sources to establish installment payment plans to creditors over three to five years, dropped 27.3% to 32 from 44 in the year-earlier period.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A judge dismissed a case against a woman who was cited for holding a yard sale authorities said violated the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order. Judge Van Valin on Friday dismissed the case brought by officials who said the yard sale was not an “essential business,” The Idaho Statesman reports. Valin ruled the yard sale conducted in April by Christa Thompson of Rathdrum was not a business. Defense attorney Edward Dindinger said in a statement that the judge ruled the language of the stay-at-home order issued in response to the coronavirus pandemic did not apply to Thompson. The Rathdrum Police Department said in April that the event was a “large nonessential yard sale” that filled the front yard and spilled into the back yard of her home. Thompson held the sale “to liquidate her late father-in-law’s estate,” Dindinger said. Thompson faced a possible sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state set another single-day record for coronavirus infections Tuesday, pushing the total number of people who have tested positive in the state since the pandemic began past 500,000. Gov. J.B. Pritzker presented statistics to show that hospitalizations are nearing their spring peak, when the initial wave of infections had officials scrambling for hospital beds and professionals to tend them. State public health officials reported 12,623 newly confirmed cases of the virus, nearly 15% higher than the previous record set Saturday, when cases also topped 12,000. In Chicago, officials reported a daily average of 1,686 new cases, roughly four times higher than a month ago. “There are no signs of slowing,” Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said. Hospitalizations jumped 7.5% in one day to 4,742. The seven-day average of 4,207 in hospital beds is creeping toward the 4,822 average hit May 5.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is continuing its record-setting increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new infections, health officials said Tuesday as the state once again surpassed 4,000 new cases and reported 63 more deaths. The newly reported deaths raised Indiana’s pandemic death toll to 4,731, including confirmed and presumed coronavirus infections, the Indiana State Department of Health said in its daily statistics update. The 4,879 infections reported Tuesday were Indiana’s second-highest daily count of newly reported coronavirus cases and marked the sixth straight day the state reported more than 4,000 new cases. Indiana’s seven-day rolling average for newly confirmed cases rose to 4,490, according to Tuesday’s daily update of the state’s coronavirus dashboard. That is the highest level Indiana has seen during the pandemic and more than five times the seven-day rolling average of 858 newly confirmed cases the agency reported Sept. 22.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two more state prisons are reporting outbreaks of coronavirus infections, according to the Iowa Department of Corrections. Recent testing has revealed outbreaks at prisons in Clarinda, where 377 inmates and 16 staff members are positive, and Rockwell City, where 254 inmates and four staff members are positive, a DOC report updated Sunday shows. The Clarinda prison has about 900 inmates, and Rockwell City has 426. The department released data Friday showing an outbreak at the Anamosa prison, and the updated numbers show 485 infected inmates of the 982 inmates at the prison. An additional 50 staff members tested positive. Additional smaller prison outbreaks are reported at Mount Pleasant, where 18 inmates and five staff members are positive, and the women’s prison in Mitchellville, where four inmates and 10 staff members are positive.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s largest public school district, in Wichita, has scrapped plans to allow its middle and high school students to attend some in-person classes, and three counties have imposed new restrictions inspired by the coronavirus pandemic. The moves by local officials come as the state works to expand its overall testing capacity so under a “unified” statewide strategy announced by Gov. Laura Kelly in late September. The strategy calls for regular testing of at-risk populations, including first responders, prison inmates, nursing home residents, and K-12 students and staff, as well as more aggressive testing in virus hot spots. The state plans to spend at least $53 million in federal coronavirus relief funds on contracts with private laboratories. But Kelly said Tuesday during a Statehouse news conference: “It won’t work if people are not abiding by the other safety protocols, particularly wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentuckians should avoid large Thanksgiving gatherings as a safeguard to protect extended family and friends from a surging COVID-19 outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Instead, in-person get-togethers should be limited to people from the same household, he said. While the health guidelines might be tough to swallow, the guidance can save lives as Kentucky struggles with its worst outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the Democratic governor said. “That person that you may think that you will really miss sitting across the table from you this year, I want to make sure is across the table from you next year,” Beshear said at a news conference. “And this right now is the most dangerous time we’ve had in this virus.” The Thanksgiving guidance came as the state reported 2,120 new virus cases – its highest total for a Tuesday and fifth-highest day overall, Beshear said. He also reported 14 more virus-related deaths.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Shoppers will see state sales taxes suspended for two days this month, under a bill passed by lawmakers in their latest special session and signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. House Speaker Clay Schexnayder, a Gonzales Republican, sponsored the measure to help residents and businesses recovering from hurricanes Laura and Delta and coping with the coronavirus pandemic. The state sales tax holiday will be held Nov. 20-21. Louisiana’s 4.45% state sales tax will not be charged on the first $2,500 of a purchase. The holiday doesn’t cover car, truck and other vehicle purchases. And it doesn’t apply to local sales taxes. The state is estimated to lose $4.5 million in sales tax collections because of the tax holiday, according to a nonpartisan financial analysis of the bill.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers plan to hold their first legislative sessions at the Augusta Civic Center instead of the Statehouse as coronavirus cases grow. The city-owned, 49,000-square-foot civic center, about 3 miles from the Statehouse, is typically used for events such as concerts, agriculture conventions and conferences. It would provide more space than the Statehouse, and that would make it easier to observe social distancing, a spokeswoman for outgoing Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon told the Portland Press Herald. The full Legislature last met in March. The top priority for lawmakers will be crafting a new, two-year state budget at a time when Maine’s finances have been stressed by the pandemic. New Hampshire lawmakers took a similar approach in June when they met in the University of New Hampshire Whittemore Center Arena.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state will reduce indoor operations for bars and restaurants from 75% to 50% in response to rising coronavirus cases and increased hospitalizations, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday. The new limits took effect Wednesday. “Last week, I said that the warning lights were starting to blink on the dashboard and that it appeared we were approaching a critical turning point in the fight. Today, I’m reporting that we have now crossed over into the danger zone,” Hogan said at a news conference. “Too many residents and businesses have COVID fatigue and have begun letting their guard down.” State health officials also have issued a public health advisory effective immediately to strongly discourage indoor gatherings of 25 people or more at family gatherings or house parties. Contact tracing data has shown an increase in cases resulting from such gatherings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases could force the state to once again open field hospitals to care for a possible overflow of patients as intensive care units fill up, Gov. Charlie Baker warned Tuesday. Hospitals are also prepared to make an additional 400 beds available for COVID-19 patients by converting acute care beds to ICU beds to deal with an expected rise in cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus during the fall and winter, Baker said at a press conference. “The trends obviously are going in the wrong direction and show no signs of changing,” he said. When and where field hospitals might be set up depends on space and need, Baker said. Massachusetts residents had done a good job controlling the virus after an initial spike in the spring but are getting careless and allowing the virus to get a toehold again, leading to a second surge, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state on Tuesday posted a record number of daily confirmed coronavirus cases, near 6,500, and reported 59 deaths within the previous 24 hours – its deadliest day in six months. COVID-19, which subsided over the summer after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer imposed sweeping stay-at-home and other restrictions, has rebounded this fall. Asked if she might again order people to stay home, the Democrat said she was talking with the state health department about potential next steps. Mask requirements and gathering limits remain in effect despite a “confusing” state Supreme Court ruling that invalidated a law she used to issue orders, she said. Whitmer said she will not see extended family in person for Thanksgiving and said it is “inherently dangerous” to have more than one household in an enclosed space without ventilation and open windows. The state’s latest average positivity rate is 9.4%, up from 4.9% two weeks ago.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials reported a record 56 new deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz said. Walz told Minnesota Public Radio the daily report shows positivity rates above 20%, an important measure of how fast the disease is spreading. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Minnesota has nearly doubled over the past two weeks from just under 7% on Oct. 27 to nearly 13% on Tuesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. The governor made the comments a day after warning Minnesotans that the state is approaching the worst phase of the pandemic and that conditions will get dramatically worse unless people start changing their behavior. He said it won’t be unusual for people to open their newspapers and see 50 to 60 new deaths. “This is just inevitable if we do not change our behaviors and take some mitigation efforts.” Walz told MPR. Minnesota’s previous record was 36 deaths, reported Friday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Tuesday that he, his wife and their three daughters are in isolation after the youngest tested positive for the coronavirus. Maddie Reeves, 8, attends a private elementary school in Jackson. The Republican governor said in a social media post: “She feels OK, but could still use prayers! Please pray for her momma too!” Reeves also said everyone in his family is being tested for the virus. The governor announced his daughter’s infection shortly after he canceled his coronavirus news conference that was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon. An executive order issued by Reeves requires children and teachers to wear masks in public and private schools. Sixteen of Mississippi’s 82 counties have been under a mask mandate that was set to expire Wednesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Twenty-eight employees of an election board have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent weeks, and a director believes they most likely got infected from voters, though local health officials aren’t convinced. The Jackson County Election Board’s Republican director, Tammy Brown, said Tuesday that eight full-time and 20 part-time employees tested positive for the virus in the past 21/ 2 weeks. Most are doing well and recovering at home, but two are hospitalized, including one in intensive care, Brown said. Jackson County is Missouri’s second-largest county, behind St. Louis County. While Kansas City is part of Jackson County, the city has its own election board. The Jackson County board handled votes cast by nearly 200,000 people. Jackson County Health Department spokeswoman Kayla Parker said community transmission is so widespread that determining the source would be next to impossible.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, the state’s chief epidemiologist said the spread of the coronavirus has stressed medical services to the brink, and he predicted the situation will get worse as winter sets in. “We’re kind of preparing for the worst here,” Jim Murphy said. “We have pretty spooky numbers for COVID, going into a fall respiratory season. It’s not a position that anybody would like to be in.” Murphy said the increase in cases across the state has led to a shortage in health care workers, in addition to a shortage in hospital beds. “You can have a lot of beds. But if you don’t have the staff to support those beds, that’s a problem,” he said. U.S. officials have dispatched a team of nearly 30 physicians, nurses, paramedics and other health care workers to Montana’s largest city. The National Disaster Medical System team arrived Friday and will work in Billings for two weeks, The Billings Gazette reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to set records with the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and health care providers expect that to continue because of the recent surge of cases. Cliff Robertson, CEO of CHI Health, said his group of 14 hospitals in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa is preparing for COVID-19 cases to keep increasing over the next three to four weeks. He said COVID-19 patients already account for about 25% of all the patients in his hospitals. “We highly encourage folks to take this seriously because … this virus is rampant in our community right now,” Robertson said. The steady increase in cases raises the concern that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist at Nebraska Medicine in Omaha. “In three weeks’ time, our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and we will no longer be able to deliver optimal and effective care for COVID, and we will also no longer be able to deliver appropriate care for everyone who comes in with a heart attack or a stroke.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Although the coronavirus is spreading at record rates, the state will not need to tighten restrictions if individuals commit to preventive measures like mask-wearing and working from home, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Tuesday. For the third time in three weeks, the governor referred to “alarming trends” and said Nevada was almost at the point where stricter measures would be necessary. But unlike in the past, when he has hesitated to commit to benchmarks or timelines, he provided a deadline: If Nevada doesn’t show signs that it’s containing the virus in two weeks, he will be forced to tighten the state’s prevention measures. “If you don’t have to go out, don’t go out. Reduce your time in public to what is necessary, and limit any and all exposures to those outside your household,” Sisolak said. “Think about changes like ordering groceries for delivery instead of going into the store, or picking up dinner curbside.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAmherst: Officials say an Election Day voter at a polling place tested positive for the coronavirus, but the town had safety precautions in place. WMUR-TV reports town officials in Amherst said they were notified by the state that a voter tested positive for the virus. They said the infected person was at Souhegan High School between 10:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. on Election Day. Amherst town moderator Steve Coughlan said it wasn’t crowded. The town is now contacting election volunteers who may have had direct contact with the voter. Coughlan said plexiglass shields separated voters from election workers. Volunteers had to wear masks, but voters did not. “I think we provided a very safe environment,” Coughlan said. “It would be crazy for us to have thought that there would be zero infected voters out of everyone coming in. So we took precautions that were appropriate.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The family of the state’s first law enforcement officer to die from COVID-19 has filed a claim to sue Hudson County, saying he did not receive any masks or other personal protective equipment while working at the county jail. Bernard Waddell Sr., a corrections officer with 32 years of experience, was forced to work within close proximity to inmates who he believed were infected, said family lawyer Paul da Costa. “Up to his last day on the job, he was not provided with any PPE,” da Costa said. The virus devastated the jail in Kearny. Along with Waddell, it claimed the lives of two nurses, a commissary director and another corrections officer. Waddell, 56, died April 1. The Jersey City resident is survived by his wife and two sons. Around the time of his death, New Jersey was experiencing a severe shortage of face masks and gowns, prompting hospitals to ask the public for donations.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Santa Fe Public Schools is ending a short-lived soft opening of in-person learning as the coronavirus pandemic hobbles the state. “I am announcing today a hiatus of our volunteer hybrid program due to the rampant rise in COVID-19 cases in Santa Fe County and New Mexico and SFPS’ philosophy to always prioritize the safety and well being of our students and staff,” Superintendent Veronica Garcia said. The volunteers included 58 teachers who went to work despite the pandemic, enabling about 200 elementary students to attend school in person at least part of the week. The program started Oct. 26 and will hold the last day of classes Nov. 20. “If parents are able to keep their children home next week, I urge them to do so,” Garcia said. The announcement comes as the state sets records for COVID-19 cases amid dwindling space in hospitals and as students are failing classes at much higher rates.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. across the state in the latest effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday. He said people will also be barred from hosting private gatherings with more than 10 people. Cuomo said the new restrictions, which go into effect Friday, are necessary because new coronavirus infections have been traced to those types of activities. Businesses can reopen each morning. “Bars, restaurants, gyms, house parties – that’s where it’s coming from, primarily,” Cuomo said. The governor spoke as rates of coronavirus infection continued to rise. He said 1,628 people were hospitalized across the state for COVID-19 on Tuesday, and 21 people died. “What we’re seeing is what they predicted for months,” Cuomo said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state will remain paused in its current reopening plan for an additional three weeks, with indoor gathering limits reduced from 25 people to 10 people starting Friday. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced the tightening of gathering restrictions during a Tuesday news conference. The decision not to further reopen ahead of Thanksgiving comes at a time when the state is concerned about increases it has seen in COVID-19 cases and the percentage of coronavirus tests coming back positive. “The science shows that the transmission of this virus is much greater indoors, and the more people are gathered, the easier this virus can spread,” Cooper said. Cooper, who won reelection last week, noted that churches and restaurants would be unaffected by the updated guidance. The executive order will remain in place until Dec. 4.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state continues to lead the nation in daily new coronavirus cases per capita, with 1 in 83 residents testing positive in just the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. In the past two weeks, there were 2,265 new cases per 100,000 people in North Dakota, which ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, according to the COVID Tracking Project. State health officials reported a dozen new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus Wednesday, down from a record 30 deaths Tuesday. The deaths reported Wednesday increased total fatalities to 696 since the pandemic began. The report said 123 deaths have occurred in November, matching all of September. October has been the deadliest month so far in North Dakota, with 292 deaths. State health officials reported 1,039 new coronavirus cases Wednesday and a daily positivity rate of more than 18% for the second straight day.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine beseeched Ohioans on Wednesday to take the surging coronavirus spread seriously, issuing new orders on mask enforcement in businesses, limiting gatherings across the state, and threatening to close bars, restaurants and fitness centers if cases continue to rise. “Throughout our country’s history, each generation has faced unique sacrifices,” DeWine said in the statewide address. “Today, we all must do something far less dramatic but very important: Wear a mask so your friends and family members can live.” DeWine shifted the authority of mask enforcement from the local counties to the state. The Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation will be responsible for inspections across the 88 counties. If a business receives more than one violation, it will have to close for 24 hours. “We must do this to protect our front-line workers,” DeWine said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of people hospitalized with confirmed and probable coronavirus in the state shattered the previous one-day record by nearly 200 on Wednesday, and more than 2,100 new cases were reported, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The department reported 1,248 hospitalizations to surpass the previous record of 1,055 set last Thursday. The department reported 2,177 new cases and 19 additional deaths since Tuesday for totals of 142,334 cases and 1,470 deaths since the pandemic began in March. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Data from Johns Hopkins University shows the seven-day average of the percentage of people who tested positive has risen from 9% to nearly 16% in Oklahoma, and the average number of new cases each day increased from 1265.8 per day to 1,947.3.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown and state health officials warned Tuesday of the capacity challenges facing hospitals as COVID-19 case counts continue to spike. The Oregon Health Authority recorded a record 285 confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospitals Tuesday – a 57% increase in just the past week and an 83% increase in the past four weeks. “There are limitations to what Oregon’s health care system can handle,” said Dana Hargunani, the health authority’s chief medical officer. “Even with regional planning and the hard work of all of our hospital partners, we cannot handle ever-growing high daily case counts and widespread hospitalizations.” Currently out of Oregon’s 703 listed intensive care unit beds, 27% are available, and about 18% of non-ICU adult hospital beds in the state are available, based on data on from the health authority’s website. “Our fear that this virus would spread out of control as the colder months set in is now becoming a frightening reality,” Brown said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city’s public school students will continue to attend classes virtually for the foreseeable future, district officials announced Tuesday. The announcement came on the same day Philadelphia public health officials saw a peak in confirmed virus cases and increased hospitalizations. The school district had planned to begin bringing back younger students for a hybrid in-person instruction model starting Nov. 30, with plans to phase in instruction for students with complex instructional needs and then older students next. “We hope to see these students back in school before the spring,” Philadelphia district Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said, adding that it would ultimately depend on health experts and infection trends. About one-third of parents with students who would have been eligible to return had opted for in-person, part-time instruction that would have put students in classrooms two days a week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Employees of the state Senate are being told to work from home after three workers tested positive for the coronavirus, state officials said. The Senate’s roughly 50 workers were instructed to start working remotely Monday after three staffers tested positive over the weekend, The Providence Journal reports. They were told to work remotely for two weeks. The directive came from Gov. Gina Raimondo. Senate spokesman Greg Pare said the Senate president is “following that guidance and wants to do all he can to keep Senate staff members safe.” The House said it has no plans to shift to remote work. The new cases in the Senate were reported as the General Assembly looks for ways to gather for its first full sessions since July. Democratic Senate President Dominick Ruggerio previously said he is exploring whether meetings can be held at the Rhode Island Convention Center.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Officials in the state’s largest school district say the number of students who received an F in at least one class tripled this year, as the district adjusted learning because of the coronavirus pandemic. First-quarter report cards show a little more than 16,000 students in Greenville County Schools had an F. That compares to roughly 5,300 students with at least one failing grade in the first quarter last year. The pandemic has limited in-person teaching for the district’s 75,000 students, and Associate Superintendent of Academics Jeff McCoy said that likely was a factor in the jump in Fs. He also cited the stress of the crisis on families and the emergency shutdown of schools in the spring. Still, the district wasn’t expecting such a big increase in the number of struggling students. McCoy said the report cards show a much larger proportion of virtual students are receiving failing grades compared to in-person students.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The mayor cast the tie-breaking vote that defeated a proposed mask mandate in the state’s largest city Tuesday night. After more than two hours of public comment, Mayor Paul TenHaken rejected the mandate after the City Council tied 4-4 on the ordinance. The mandate would have required face coverings to be worn by people in most indoor public places where 6-foot social distancing was not achievable. Violations carried a $50 fine. “I believe the small uptick we’ll see in compliance is not worth the community division that this will create,” TenHaken said as he ended debate. Councilor Greg Neitzert said he did not want to live in a city where people are calling the police because someone isn’t wearing a mask. “It’s not just about health,” Neitzert said. “We also have to look at principles.” The Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce opposed it. Several faith leaders in the city supported the mandate.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that he’s looking to include “meaningful” teacher pay raises in next year’s budget despite facing financial crunches brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee had originally proposed funneling an additional $117 million to K-12 teacher salaries earlier this year before the virus outbreak began rippling across the state. If approved, the starting minimum annual salary for teachers would have increased from $36,000 to $40,000 over the next two years. Yet months later, Lee was forced to strip the teacher funding boost, as well as many other budget initiatives, as officials braced for funding shortfalls. However, Tennessee’s revenues have come in slightly higher than originally projected over the past three months, allowing Lee’s administration to remain slightly optimistic that it will be able to fund some new measures rather than have to dip into rainy day funds.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state has become the first with more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases as the nation continues to face a surge of infections, according to data from Johns Hopkins University early Wednesday. The nation’s second-most populous state has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases with 19,337 deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to the count on the Johns Hopkins website. Texas recorded 10,865 new cases Tuesday, setting a new daily record that surpassed by 74 cases an old mark set July 15, state officials said. According to state figures Tuesday, an estimated 132,146 cases are active, the most since Aug. 17, and 6,170 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, the most since Aug. 18. There were 94 new deaths Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Meanwhile, cases of the coronavirus are surging in the Laredo area, health officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A group of teachers has organized an event to encourage educators across the state to call in sick and use the day off to get tested for the coronavirus amid a surge in confirmed infection cases. “There are no testing requirements for teachers or students currently,” Granite School District teacher Lindsay Plummer said. Some teachers believe the “test out” planned for Thursday will prompt state leaders to do more to limit the spread of COVID-19 and increase safety protocols in classrooms, FOX13 reports. Plummer said the group was inspired to act following remarks made by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert on Sunday, when he put in place a statewide mask mandate. “The goal of doing something like this is we want to push them to do more,” she said. The Utah Education Association said it is aware of event but is urging teachers to be patient. Herbert’s office has said all teachers have universal access to testing.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state on Tuesday suspended a program that allowed people from across the Northeast to visit Vermont without quarantining if they come from a county with a low rate of coronavirus infection. Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that the number of counties eligible – listed on a map that uses red, orange and green to indicate eligibility – has continued to shrink. As of Tuesday only two counties between Maine and Ohio were listed as green. “The fact is, along with social gatherings, travel to and from other states without the proper quarantine continues to be one of the common denominators in our rising case counts,” Scott said. Essential travel – such as work, school, medical care, personal safety, shared child custody or buying groceries – is not affected, but people should only do what they need to do and then return home, he said. Vermont determined eligible counties as those with virus rates of less than 400 cases per million residents.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As COVID-19 cases continue to surge, Gov. Ralph Northam on Tuesday announced plans to significantly increase statewide testing capacity and to launch a media campaign in southwest Virginia, which has seen a sharp rise in cases over the past month. The moves came three days after Virginia reported 2,103 new cases – its biggest single-day increase in new cases since the start of the pandemic. On Tuesday, the state reported 1,435 new cases. The state’s seven-day moving average of new cases is 1,462. The seven-day testing positivity rate has also climbed from just under 5% a few weeks ago to 6.2% on Tuesday. Since the start of the pandemic, the state has recorded a total of 194,192 cases, with 3,726 deaths. Northam said he is focusing on mitigation efforts and continuing to encourage people to wear masks and practice social distancing. He said he is not currently considering ordering new restrictions.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two hospitals near the city are struggling with COVID-19 outbreaks within the facilities. The Auburn Medical Center reported at least five employees and eight patients tested positive for the coronavirus, after an outbreak on a fourth-floor unit. The hospital said in a statement Tuesday that one patient died after the outbreak was detected late last week, The Seattle Times reports. The MultiCare hospital system, which owns the hospital, tested all 40 patients in the unit and 212 staffers who had worked there in the two-week period before the first positive test was reported, officials said. At St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton, at least six people have been infected since early November. CHI Franciscan, the hospital system that owns St. Michael, announced Tuesday that four patients and two employees have been infected to date. State health officials have reported 350 outbreaks in health care settings, including hospitals, since Oct. 24, a statewide outbreak report said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a new high of 642 coronavirus cases Wednesday and seven deaths as the pandemic continued its march into rural enclaves. There are 277 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, slightly down from the peak of 290 last week. A total of 553 deaths have been linked to COVID-19. Virus-related deaths have increased 45% in the past month. The daily positivity rate is up to 5.9%, the highest it has been in about two months. “The enemy is at our borders, and the enemy is coming at us right now,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a press briefing. Twenty-five counties had the most severe designation of virus spread, with 25 or more cases per 100,000 residents. Justice said all options are on the table for bringing new travel and business restrictions, but nothing is planned yet. “Legally, I can’t go out and start arresting people” for not wearing masks, Justice said in urging people to follow guidelines and get tested for the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers renewed his pleas Tuesday for people to stay home to avoid the coronavirus in an unusual prime-time speech hours after the state set new records for infections and deaths. The governor announced he was advising people to stay in their houses and businesses to allow people to work remotely, requiring masks, and limiting the number of people in stores and offices. He said projections show that if nothing changes, deaths could double to 5,000 by January. Evers has been imploring people to stay home and wear masks for months during twice-weekly afternoon news conferences to little avail. This time his office streamed his remarks live on his Facebook page and YouTube channel. “So I want to be clear tonight: Each day this virus goes unchecked is a setback for our economic recovery,” Evers said. Republicans and their conservative allies have worked to block every Evers initiative to stop the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The son of a state representative who opposed COVID-19 public restrictions said his father was positive for the coronavirus when he died. Roy Edwards, 66, died Nov. 2 at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper after being hospitalized for more than a week with illness that was not immediately disclosed, The Gillette News Record reports. Edwards continued to oppose public restrictions resulting from the pandemic during his recent campaign to retain his House seat. He was reelected the day after he died. Mitch Edwards said his father initially experienced minor virus symptoms. He was told by a medical professional that he had sinusitis, an inflammation of the sinuses, and did not need to be tested for COVID-19. Roy Edwards was not advised to quarantine, but he did so as a a precaution, Mitch Edwards said. His symptoms worsened, and he had trouble breathing Oct. 23, when he again sought medical attention.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/31/us/five-things-august-31-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for August 31: Mar-a-Lago, Flooding, Heat waves ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’ve gotten up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

State authorities are now scrambling to begin distributing water to 180,000 residents, according to Gov. Tate Reeves. “Please stay safe. Do not drink the water,” Reeves said, explaining that untreated water from the reservoir is being pushed through the pipes. The state is expected to call in the National Guard to help distribute drinking and non-drinking water as crews work to get the treatment plant back online. On Monday evening, Jackson residents were dealing with the aftermath of record-setting rain that resulted in the Pearl River cresting at a dangerously high level.\n\n2. Capitol riot\n\nIn the wake of the deadliest US school shooting in nearly a decade, the National Rifle Association is set to hold its 2022 annual convention in Houston, Texas, today. Several notable conservatives, including former President Donald Trump, are scheduled to speak at the meeting. Some other speakers have canceled their planned appearances, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who will instead attend a news conference in Uvalde, according to his spokesperson. Several musicians who were set to sing in a concert at this weekend’s convention have also canceled their performances. The annual meeting is only open to NRA members. The organization currently has over five million members, according to its website.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Iraq\n\nThe Biden administration is preparing to approve sending an advanced long-range rocket system to Ukraine, multiple officials say. Senior Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have pleaded in recent weeks for the US and its allies to provide the Multiple Launch Rocket System. The US-made weapon systems can fire a barrage of rockets hundreds of kilometers – much farther than any of the systems Ukraine has – which the Ukrainians argue could be a game-changer in their war against Russia. The administration is leaning toward sending the systems with a larger package of military and security assistance to Ukraine, which could be announced as soon as next week. This comes as Ukrainian officials today reported heavy fighting across several fronts, including in the Luhansk region where a local military chief describes “fierce battles” are currently taking place.\n\n4.

Delta, however, isn’t the first airline to trim its summer schedule due to operational issues and decreased staffing.

The state’s answer to the first abortion rights ballot question since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade sent shockwaves across the nation’s political landscape, signaling the issue may be a greater motivator to vote in the midterm elections than previously thought.\n\nJarrolyn Quinones, 65, a paralegal and Democrat, was \"stunned\" by the vote in her largely conservative home state, she told USA TODAY late Wednesday morning.\n\nThe results taught her something: The abortion issue cuts through partisan politics. Women who feel the same way she does about abortion rights might not have signs in their yard or be from the same political party, but they were silently aligned at the ballot box.\n\n\"Women understand their rights are being taken away ... and if they don't act, we will be back in the 1950s,\" Quinones said. \"Regardless if women have different political beliefs or different religious beliefs, they agree they want the right to make their own choices.\"\n\nIf Kansas’ turnout is replicated nationwide in November, it would benefit Democrats, who count on the Roe reversal to improve their odds this fall as the party faces headwinds that include high consumer prices, President Joe Biden's low approval numbers and a historical record that shows midterms typically go against the sitting president's party.\n\nThe monkeypox outbreak that has infected more than 6,600 people in the United States is officially a public health emergency, the Biden administration declared Thursday. --Ella & Amy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/19/us/pete-arredondo-uvalde-school-police-chief/index.html", "title": "Pete Arredondo: Uvalde school police chief's termination may be ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUvalde Consolidated Independent School District officials have informed district police chief Pete Arredondo that the school board intends to meet Saturday to decide on his fate, according to a source close to the discussions.\n\nThe source told CNN Tuesday the board is expected to vote to terminate Arredondo, who was placed on administrative leave last month for his role in the botched response to the Robb Elementary School shooting that killed 19 children and two teachers.\n\nEarlier, two sources close to the process told CNN Uvalde officials were in discussions on the process to remove Arredondo over his role in the response to the shooting.\n\nThe discussions follow a heated school board meeting Monday night where parents demanded the board fire Arredondo by Tuesday.\n\nCNN has reached out to Arredondo’s attorney and has not received a response.\n\nArredondo, who has been the school district police chief since March 2020, was one of the nearly 400 law enforcement officers who responded to the mass shooting in which a gunman entered adjoining classrooms inside the Texas school on May 24.\n\nOfficers began arriving at the school within minutes but allowed the gunman to remain in the classrooms for 77 minutes until they finally entered and killed him, according to a timeline from the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). The lengthy delay contradicted widely taught protocol for active shooter situations that call for police to immediately stop the threat and came even as children inside repeatedly called 911 and begged for help.\n\nIn a hearing before the Texas Senate last month, DPS Director Col. Steven McCraw called the police response an “abject failure.” He placed sole blame for the failure on Arredondo, who officials have identified as the on-scene commander, saying he “decided to place the lives of officers before the lives of children.”\n\nBut Arredondo did not consider himself incident commander, according to a Texas House investigative committee’s preliminary report. “My approach and thought was responding as a police officer. And so I didn’t title myself,” Arredondo said in the investigative report.\n\nThe report instead placed blame more broadly, saying, “The entirety of law enforcement and its training, preparation, and response shares systemic responsibility for many missed opportunities.”\n\nIt also noted others could have assumed command.\n\nAdvanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training “teaches that any law enforcement officer can assume command, that somebody must assume command, and that an incident commander can transfer responsibility as an incident develops,” the report said. “That did not happen at Robb Elementary, and the lack of effective incident command is a major factor that caused other vital measures to be left undone.”\n\nIn the wake of sharp criticism, Uvalde school district Superintendent Hal Harrell placed Arredondo on leave from his position as school police chief on June 22.\n\n“Because of the lack of clarity that remains and the unknown timing of when I will receive the results of the investigations, I have made the decision to place Chief Arredondo on administrative leave effective on this date,” Harrell wrote in the announcement.\n\nArredondo, who has worked in law enforcement for nearly 30 years, has not spoken substantively to the public about his decision-making the day of the massacre, but he told the Texas Tribune in an interview he did not consider himself the on-scene commander.\n\nHowever, at least one of the responding officers expressed the belief that Arredondo was leading the law enforcement response inside the school, telling others, “the chief is in charge,” according to the DPS timeline.\n\nArredondo also told the Tribune he did not instruct officers to refrain from breaching the classrooms.\n\nSeparately, Arredondo resigned his position on the Uvalde City Council in early July, according to a resignation letter he sent to the city.\n\n“After much consideration, it is in the best interest of the community to step down as a member of the City Council for District 3 to minimize further distractions,” Arredondo said in the letter. “The Mayor, the City Council, and the City Staff must continue to move forward to unite our community, once again.”", "authors": ["Shimon Prokupecz Eric Levenson", "Shimon Prokupecz", "Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/politics/biden-campaign-trail-age/index.html", "title": "This is the bar Joe Biden will have to clear in 2024 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nJoe Biden still hasn’t made up his mind about whether or not to run for president in 2024.\n\n“Look, my intention as I said to begin with is that I would run again,” the President said last month in an interview with CBS’ “60 Minutes.” “But it’s just an intention. But is it a firm decision that I run again? That remains to be seen.”\n\nLet’s say, for the sake of argument, that Biden does decide to run for another term in two years time. The challenge before him will be simple but profound: Prove to the American people that he can campaign all over the country for the entirety of the campaign.\n\nThat’s according to the latest column from The Washington Post’s Megan McArdle, who writes:\n\n“You need only watch video from 10 years ago to see that the president now appears slower than he used to be. That doesn’t mean he’s unfit to be president; he will not be asked to resolve a foreign policy crisis by solving crossword puzzles at high speed. But whether it’s a policy problem, it is a political problem.”\n\nMcArdle’s argument – if I extrapolate it somewhat – goes like this:\n\n1. In the early primary and caucus states where a premium was put on hand-to-hand campaigning, Biden was crushed.\n\n2. He was saved by the endorsement of South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn and the strong support of Black voters in the Palmetto State.\n\n3. After that win in South Carolina, the primary campaign effectively ended because the country went into lockdown over Covid-19.\n\n4. The general election campaign, similarly, wasn’t much of a campaign. Biden held very few in-person events and the ones he did hold were with small numbers of people.\n\n5. By the time the 2024 campaign rolls around, the pandemic will be in the rearview mirror (Biden says it already is) and politics will return to normal again. Which means Biden will have to do something he hasn’t done in years – actively campaign.\n\nAgain, McArdle:\n\n“Whether Republicans nominate Trump or someone else, his opponent is going to be out there on the stump, whipping up voter enthusiasm and proving they have the stamina for the job. If Biden doesn’t follow suit, he will be conceding them an edge — especially since they will not be shy about using that fact to raise questions about his fitness.”\n\nWe know from oodles of polling that there are real and persistent questions among the electorate – including a decent-sized chunk of Democrats – about whether Biden should run again, with his age being a prime driver of those doubts.\n\nWhether you agree with McArdle or not, she raises a provocative and important point: Given Biden’s age and snafus like the one last week involving the late Rep. Jackie Walorski, people are going to be keeping a close eye on how he carries himself as a candidate in 2024.\n\nThe Point: Biden, assuming he runs in 2024, will be 81 years old on the campaign trail – the oldest person to ever seek a second term as president. (He was also the oldest person ever elected to a first term.) His ability to handle the rigors of a campaign will be a major hurdle he needs to clear in the eyes of many voters.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/weather/fourth-of-july-weekend-weather-forecast/index.html", "title": "Rain will be a big part of this holiday weekend, impacting flights and ...", "text": "Programming note: CNN’s annual Fourth In America special features musical performances from artists including the B-52s, Machine Gun Kelly and Pitbull, as well as fireworks shows from across the US.

But 2022 was already an awful year for crypto before the FTX-Binance soap opera.\n\nBitcoin prices are currently hovering around $16,500, down from a level of $20,000 just a week ago. Still, even at $20,000, that was a far cry from the price of just north of $46,000 that bitcoin was trading at on the last day of 2021.\n\nIt turns out that investors who were hoping that rising interest rates and higher levels of inflation would be good for so-called alternative assets like cryptos and gold have been in for a rude awakening this year.\n\nThey’ve gotten hit just like stocks and bonds, proving there really is no place to hide in a market where worries about rate hikes and recession reign supreme.\n\nGold prices have fallen about 6% this year, and the price of the yellow metal is not far from the lows it hit at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020. Gold, like bitcoin, then surged in the latter part of 2020 as a sort of safe haven trade.\n\nSo can gold and crypto bounce back? The strength of the US dollar has hurt both precious metals and cryptos. Why buy gold or digital assets when the greenback is proving to be the king of currencies?\n\nSome experts are hopeful that the worst could soon be over for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin has historically had big swings up and down\n\nThis isn’t the first time that there has been a so-called crypto winter. Bitcoin prices have been notoriously volatile over the past few years, but they have still done better than many major stock market indexes.\n\nJust look at bitcoin prices since the summer of 2020. They’re up more than 80%…even though it has been far from a smooth ride. The Nasdaq, by way of comparison, is only up about 1% from July 2020 levels.\n\n“Bitcoin and ethereum went straight up and down but they have still gained a lot from mid-2020. Over that longer time horizon, digital assets are still outperforming tech stocks,” said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, a firm that specializes in crypto.\n\nThe crypto crash has also led to a massive plunge in the shares of publicly traded companies with ties to bitcoin, such as Coinbase, crypto mining firms Hive (HVBTF) and Riot (RIOT) and bitcoin bank Silvergate (SI).\n\nOverreaction in the broader crypto sector?\n\nSome analysts think that it’s a mistake though to punish the entire crypto industry because of the problems at FTX. The near-collapse of FTX, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has prompted questions of contagion.\n\n“While we acknowledge that the FTX saga could weigh on the crypto space in the near term, we also believe the sell-off in [Silvergate] shares…reflected significant misunderstanding of the mechanics of the company’s platform,” said Mark Palmer, head of digital asset research at BTIG, in a report.\n\nOne venture capitalist who focuses on bitcoin and crypto assets agreed that FTX’s problems won’t derail the entire digital assets universe.\n\n“Investors don’t appear to be concerned about the impact of FTX on bitcoin’s future,” said Alyse Killeen, founder and managing partner of venture firm Stillmark. To that end, her company recently invested in bitcoin infrastructure firm Hoseki, a company that is also backed by the parent company of Fidelity.\n\nKilleen added that the drop in bitcoin prices that was occurring even before the FTX meltdown is a sign that cryptocurrencies are not yet a true hedge against inflation and a stronger dollar.\n\nThat may eventually change once bitcoin matures. But for now, crypto adoption is still in its nascent stages. So dollar strength is still a negative for bitcoin.\n\n“Bitcoin is still young. It is still a new form of currency, payment and store of value,” she said.\n\nGold isn’t glittering yet either\n\nThe strength of the mighty dollar has been a headwind for gold, too, and it’s not yet clear if the greenback is going to weaken substantially anytime soon…even though October inflation figures showed a smaller than expected jump in consumer prices. That could lead the Fed to start slowing its pace of rate hikes.\n\n“In this current environment, monetary policy remains the dominant force,” said Joe Cavatoni, chief market strategist for North America with the World Gold Council. “I’ll be looking out to see what happens to investment demand and the gold price once inflation settles at a steady rate.”\n\nCavatoni said that gold weakness this year is due primarily to a “more tactical response to persistent Fed rate hikes and the surging US dollar” from big institutional investors.\n\nThe dollar may have more room to run. That could be more bad news for gold.\n\n“Cash has still been king,” said Bob Doll, chief investment officer at Crossmark Global Investments. “The dollar eventually has to weaken and that could get gold going again, but it’s hard to call tops and bottoms in currencies.”\n\n“We’re not likely to get on board a dollar weakness. It’s not time to try and be a hero with gold,” he added.", "authors": ["Paul R.

A year ago, the 30-year fixed rate stood at 3.09%.\n\nMortgage rates continue to hover around 7%, causing the once-hot housing market to cool considerably, said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.\n\nThe 30-year fixed rate had risen almost every week since late August and has more than doubled since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe rapid rise has been fueled by the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented campaign of hiking interest rates in order to tame soaring inflation. The combination of the central bank’s rate hikes, investor’s concerns about a recession and mixed economic news has made mortgage rates increasingly volatile over the past several months.\n\nThe Fed announced yesterday it would raise its benchmark interest rate by another 75 basis points, the sixth rate increase this year and the fourth-consecutive hike of that size.\n\n“Yesterday’s interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve will certainly inject additional lead into the heels of the housing market,” Khater said.\n\nHe added that demand is declining as some potential buyers try to navigate the unpredictable landscape, while others remain sidelined because they cannot qualify for a loan.\n\nInflation remains a challenge\n\nFollowing the Fed’s meeting on Wednesday, Chairman Jerome Powell said that the possibility of a “soft landing,” in which the economy cools without crashing into a recession, has narrowed but it is still possible.\n\n“The inflation picture has become more and more challenging over the course of this year,” he said. “That means we have to have policy be more restrictive, and that narrows the path to a soft landing.”\n\nWhile the Fed does not set the interest rates borrowers pay on mortgages directly, its actions influence them. Mortgage rates tend to track the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds. As investors see or anticipate rate hikes, they make moves which send yields higher and mortgage rates rise.\n\nBoth two-year and 10-year Treasury yields rose higher in the wake of Wednesday’s announcement, a sign that capital markets see a rising probability of recession in 2023, said George Ratiu, Realtor.com’s manager of economic research.\n\n“With inflation still running at a 40-year high and the Fed expecting a few more rate increases to combat it, mortgage rates will experience upward pressure through the end of 2022,” said Ratiu.\n\nRates moved lower over the past week because yesterday’s Fed announcement was already priced into the mortgage market, said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. But inflation is not where the Fed would like it to be yet and rates are expected to remain volatile.\n\n“Mortgage rates are near 20-year highs, and that hurts homebuyers,” said Yun. “Once inflation is contained, mortgage rates will start to drift lower. It may be another year or two before that happens.”\n\nMore people priced out\n\nAs rates rise, homeownership becomes increasingly out of reach for people who can’t afford, or don’t even qualify for a home loan.\n\nWith mortgage rates about 4 percentage points higher than last year, a buyer of a median-priced home is looking at a monthly mortgage payment that is $1,000 higher, according to Realtor.com.\n\n“This dramatic jump in financing costs has effectively shrunk most buyers’ budgets,” said Ratiu.\n\nIt isn’t just mortgage rates that have gone up from last year, home prices have significantly increased as well.\n\nBased on September 2021’s median home price and 30-year fixed mortgage rate, and assuming a 20% down payment, a typical homebuyer would have been looking at a $1,296 monthly payment, according to Realtor.com. This year, due to both higher prices and mortgage rates that are hovering around 7%, a typical buyer is facing a $2,296 monthly payment.\n\nIn order for this year’s buyer to have the same monthly payment as last year, the median home price would have to decline by 45%, to about $235,000.\n\nPrices aren’t dropping that much, but they are starting to creep down in some areas.\n\n“Most homes are priced based on comparable properties that sold in the past six months, a period which does not capture today’s much-higher rates and buyers’ inability to afford them,” said Ratiu. “With household incomes lagging inflation and borrowing costs still rising, we can expect transactions to continue declining, and prices to continue to fall.”", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/homes/us-home-prices-case-shiller-december-2021/index.html", "title": "Home prices skyrocketed last year.

Phoenix led the way for the 31st consecutive month with prices 32.5% higher than the year before. It was followed by Tampa with a 29.4% increase, and Miami, with a 27.3% increase.\n\n“We continue to see very strong growth at the city level,” said Craig J. Lazzara, managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “All 20 cities saw price increases in 2021, and prices in all 20 are at their all-time highs.”\n\nAffordability challenges\n\nOver the past several months home prices have been rising at very high, but decelerating rates, said Lazzara. But that deceleration paused in December. After peaking at 19.8% in August, the annual price increase declined through the fall to 18.8% in November, where it stayed in December.\n\nMonth-to-month, home prices in the US National Index, which covers all nine U.S. Census divisions, increased 1.3% in December from November, after seasonal adjustment.\n\nLazzara said the strength of the US housing market is being driven, in part, by Americans who decided to move during the pandemic.\n\nA persistent low inventory of homes dropped to record low levels in December, according to a recent report from the National Association of Realtors. In the face of continued strong demand, prices were pushed higher. Newly constructed homes are in the pipeline, but a long-running shortage, combined with the lingering effects of the pandemic mean it will take years to meet demand.\n\nHowever, rising mortgage rates could start to quell some of that demand, Lazarra said. “In the short term, we should soon begin to see the impact of increasing mortgage rates on home prices.”\n\nMortgage rates, which had risen only gradually since August, began to abruptly climb in late December and have since risen to nearly 4% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\n\n“A marked change may be ahead for growth as rising mortgage rates eat into homebuyer purchasing power,” said Danielle Hale, Realtor.com’s chief economist.\n\nHigher mortgage rates have added more than $200 to the monthly cost of a typical for-sale home since December 2020 – when rates were at all-time lows. More than half of that increase has occurred over the past eight weeks, Hale said.\n\n“With home prices expected to continue rising, even at a slower pace, affordability will increasingly challenge 2022 buyers as a decade-long underbuilding trend has left the housing market 5.8 million homes short of household growth,” said Hale. “At the same time, we expect pandemic trends like workplace flexibility and competitive labor market conditions to give workers the boost in income and wider search areas they need to navigate a still-challenging housing market successfully.”", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2021/08/16/uwm-pontiac-mortgage-lender-sees-growth-start-accepting-bitcoin/8150026002/", "title": "UWM see growth, plans to accept Bitcoin for mortgage payments", "text": "United Wholesale Mortgage CEO Mat Ishbia said Monday that the Pontiac-based company plans to start accepting cryptocurrency for payments before year's end, making it the first major nationwide mortgage lender to do so.\n\n'We’re excited that hopefully (this year) we can actually execute on that before anyone in the country,\" Ishbia said late Monday afternoon in an earnings call with Wall Street analysts.\n\nHe later told the Free Press that UWM could begin accepting one or more digital currencies later this quarter or in the fourth quarter.\n\n“I think we’re starting with Bitcoin, but we’re looking at Ethereum and others,\" Ishbia said in an interview. \"We’re going to walk before we run, but at the same time, we are definitely a leader in technology and innovation and we are always trying to be the best and the leader in everything we do.\"\n\nHe added, \"That’s the plan.

Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\n\nLondon CNN Business —\n\nThe story of financial markets and the global economy this year has been written in part by the dramatic rise of the US dollar, whose inexorable ascent has sent shockwaves around the world. At last, however, its breakneck rally could be coming to an end.\n\nWhat’s happening: The dollar has shed more than 4% so far this quarter, falling back from a two-decade high it reached in September. Last week, investors turned bearish on the greenback for the first time since July 2021, according to data from Societe Generale.\n\n“Markets are anxious for signs of a fundamental shift, and investors are increasingly fearful of missing out since corrections after a peak tend to be swift and steep,” strategists at Goldman Sachs said in the bank’s recently-published 2023 outlook.\n\nWhat’s changed? First, there was the surprising inflation data in the United States, which showed that prices rose more slowly than expected in October. That bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve could dial down interest rate hikes soon.\n\n(The sharp run-up in rates this year has been a key reason the dollar has soared. It’s encouraged investors to buy US assets, which have increasingly attractive returns. To execute those transactions, they need to buy dollars.)\n\nSecond, there’s been growing optimism that China could be preparing to ease coronavirus restrictions. The government has also been taking steps to deal with a crisis in the country’s real estate sector. Plus, warm fall weather in Europe has reduced concerns about access to energy this winter, leading to slightly more optimistic economic forecasts.\n\nIf these economies perform better than expected, the United States won’t look like the only game in town — and other currencies could look appealing again.\n\n“You have a combination of clear signs inflation is slowing down in the US, clear signs Europe may not have as bad a winter as we thought, and clear signs China may be focused more on growth than it was previously,” Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura, told me. He thinks it’s possible the dollar’s value has peaked when compared to other major currencies.\n\nLooking ahead: There are, of course, huge risks to the outlook. China continues to play tough on Covid, even though investors desperately hope President Xi Jinping will change his approach soon. The dollar strengthened on Monday after a five-day lockdown was announced in a district of Guangzhou, a major transportation hub.\n\nMajor uncertainty lingers around the Federal Reserve’s plans. And Russia’s unpredictable war in Ukraine still has the potential to quickly change the calculus for Europe.\n\n“It’s unlikely that the dollar will fall in a straight line,” Societe Generale’s Kit Juckes recently warned. When it arrives, the peak will probably look jagged, he cautioned, instead of a sharp, clean “imitation of the Matterhorn.”\n\nWhy it matters: I’ve written about why the strong dollar has been extremely painful for other countries here. In short, a weaker greenback could make imports of food and energy less expensive, and reduce pain for governments with dollar debts. It could even lower the likelihood of political instability — meaning many leaders will be watching what happens next.\n\nNo one in crypto world is safe right now\n\nOn the heels of the spectacular implosion of FTX, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has been on a media blitz. His message: Don’t lump us in with the bad actors.\n\nFTX is “not representative of every company in crypto,” Armstrong said in a recent interview with CNBC, noting that Coinbase is based in the United States and is publicly traded, which means its finances can be closely scrutinized. The company even took out an ad in the Wall Street Journal, noting it can be trusted while calling for updated regulations.\n\nYet investors aren’t buying the message, as fears balloon about the health of the entire crypto sector.\n\nSee here: Shares of Coinbase have plunged more than 20% in the past five days. They’re down 84% year-to-date.\n\nTraders are also dumping the company’s debt. The yield on 2028 bonds, which moves opposite prices, has jumped in recent days, topping 15%. At the beginning of the month, it was close to 11%, and was lower than 5% at the start of the year.\n\nBank of America lowered its price outlook for Coinbase shares late last week. Analyst Jason Kupferberg said that while he’s confident that the startup won’t face the same fate as FTX, “that does not make them immune from the broader fallout within the crypto ecosystem,” as regulators circle and traders pull back.\n\nBitcoin has fallen below $16,000 this week. It has lost 66% of its value year-to-date.\n\nTech layoffs shouldn’t spook everyone\n\nA spate of hiring freezes and layoffs in the tech sector has produced an alarming string of headlines, my colleague Nicole Goodkind noted earlier this month. The list of affected companies is a who’s who of the top players: Amazon, Apple, Meta, Stripe — and, of course, Twitter.\n\nBut Morgan Stanley doesn’t think this should be read as a warning sign for America’s broader job market.\n\n“Could the sector be a harbinger of changes in labor supply going forward? We do not think so,” the bank’s economists and strategists said in a recent research note.\n\nThe team identified two reasons for this. First, they argue, the tech industry is huge when it comes to its stock market valuation, but doesn’t actually employ that many people as a proportion of the total US workforce. Using the broadest possible measure, it accounts for 9% of total employment. Tech layoffs, while significant, make up just over 0.1% of total US payrolls.\n\nSecond, the tech world’s approach to hiring and staffing is different from the rest of the economy. Tech employment has “risen sharply” above its pre-pandemic level, while others are just catching up.\n\nOne caveat: Morgan Stanley expects the US job market to weaken in 2023 as the economy slows. About 261,000 positions were added in October, and by next summer, the bank expects monthly gains of closer to 50,000.\n\nStill, outside of tech, it doesn’t expect mass cuts — especially given ongoing staffing shortages.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/12/04/dow-jumps-200-pts-tax-reform-optimism-after-senate-passes-its-bill/913837001/", "title": "Dow soars after Senate passes tax plan, helping bulls' view of Dow ...", "text": "The Dow’s milestone mania may have more room to run.\n\nAfter topping 24,000 last week and briefly surging more than 300 points Monday on optimism that a tax overhaul plan is moving closer to reality after the Senate passed a bill over the weekend, Wall Street bulls say Dow \"25K\" is pretty much a sure thing.\n\nBut the rally, they say, likely won't stop there.\n\nThe skyrocketing blue-chip stock gauge might not stop going up until headlines trumpet Dow 30,000, bulls say. And Dow \"30K\" — an additional 23.5% gain from Monday's close of 24,290 — is not an unthinkable level to attain before the average peaks and enters the next bear market, or protracted decline of 20% or more.\n\nThe Dow this year has barreled through 20,000 and four other 1,000-point milestones on its way to 64 record highs.\n\n“This rally looks bulletproof because every area of the economy is seeing gains,” says Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, a New York-based bank. “Twenty-five thousand is too close and no one sees that as a ceiling. Thirty thousand may be more likely as a stopping point.”\n\nMilestone Mania\n\nIf the Dow's performance in 2018 is similar to its year-to-date gain of 23%, it could reach 30,000 next year. If the market matches its long-term average annual gain of around 10%, however, it would surpass 30K sometime in 2020.\n\nThe Dow jumped 302 points Monday to an intraday record of 24,534.04 before closing up 58 points as investors' moods got a boost from movement on tax cuts.\n\nThe hopes for sizable tax reductions for American corporations have been a main pillar of Wall Street's bullish view of stocks this year and next. The Senate bill slashes the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%. The final tax bill still needs to be ironed out by the House and Senate.\n\nLast week, however, ended on a volatile note as political risk jumped after President Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and said he was cooperating with prosecutors in the probe related to Russia's meddling in the U.S. presidential election. The news created fresh political uncertainty and raised fresh questions as to the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.\n\nMore:Stocks dive on news of Michael Flynn pleading guilty to lying to FBI\n\nMore:401(k) investors: December is Dow's best month over past 100 years\n\nMore:Bitcoin's big swing at $11,000 launches renewed talk of bubble\n\nBearish investors warn of turbulence ahead, citing pricey stocks, the expectation for higher rates and early signs of irrational exuberance.\n\nThe Path to Dow 30,000\n\nBut the Dow's latest rally could be a sign of things to come, bulls counter.\n\nThe path to Dow 30,000, Rupkey says, will be driven by successful Dow components such as Boeing, UnitedHealth, 3M, Apple, McDonald's, Caterpillar and Home Depot — companies which have strong earnings potential as the U.S. economy gains momentum.\n\n“We aren't talking Bitcoin here,” says Rupkey, referring to the highly volatile and speculative digital currency that has rallied roughly 1,000% this year. “This handful of companies driving the rally this year are the heart of America. Betting against the economy is a fool's bet.”\n\nGetting to 30,000 before the next bear market is “a pretty tall order, but one I think we can achieve,” adds Chris Zaccarelli, chief Investment officer at Charlotte-based Independent Advisor Alliance.\n\nThe Dow would have to fall to 19,432 from Monday's close to enter a bear market.\n\nZaccarelli’s optimism that the Dow can gain another 5,700 points before major trouble strikes is based on his belief that a recession — a typical bull market killer — is far off. The economic recovery that is gaining traction around the world, he says, will extend the life of the current U.S. recovery, which began in June 2009. He won't rule out a steep pullback along the way, however.\n\nIt’s hard to get too negative about a market that doesn’t yet face the headwinds of fast-rising interest rates or signs of global economic weakness, adds Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group.\n\nStone says stocks are expensive on a historical basis but remain attractive given the low interest rate environment.\n\nAnd as Monday's Dow surge illustrates, stocks could also get a lift from corporate tax cuts. If companies pay less in taxes, it will free up cash for them to make acquisitions, buy back company stock, invest more in their businesses or return money to shareholders via dividends. Credit Suisse estimates that a 20% tax rate for corporations would boost the overall S&P 500 stock index's earnings by 10% in 2018.\n\n\"Dow 30K is certainly possible before a bear market,\" Stone says.\n\nSkeptic: Slim Chance of Dow 30K\n\nBut not everyone on Wall Street thinks the Dow will go up that much.\n\nCiting the Dow’s big gains this year, Joe Quinlan, chief market strategist at U.S. Trust in New York, says a breather for stocks would not be surprising.\n\nHe says the Dow’s high point “before this rally peters out” will be around 26,500, or about 2,200 points, or 9% higher. The Dow will run into headwinds, Quinlan says, perhaps in as early as the middle of next year, when growth overseas accelerates, causing weakness in the U.S. dollar to dissipate.\n\nA stronger dollar poses a threat to Dow companies that do a lot of business abroad, as their products are more expensive when bought with weaker foreign currencies, causing sales and profits to decrease.\n\nAt the moment, more bullish Rupkey says he sees little reason why stocks should tank.\n\n“A bear market drop of 20% is hard to imagine,” he says. It will take more than a geopolitical shock, such as a missile strike from North Korea or a major trade disruption or a downturn in China to send the Dow into a downward spiral, he argues.\n\n“I don't see a good old-fashioned 20% bear market drop unless the economy does an about-face and actually turns down, and right now the risks of recession are minimal,\" Rupkey says.\n\n\"Until then,\" he adds, \"the stock market can party (until) 25,000 or 30,000 or something higher.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/investing/china-bull-market-policy-shifts-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Global investors are bullish again on China as Beijing switches to ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN Business —\n\nMarket sentiment on Chinese stocks hit rock bottom just weeks ago after President Xi Jinping secured a historic third term in power and stacked his top team with loyalists in a clean sweep not seen since the Mao era.\n\nBut in the past week, a series of unexpected steps by Beijing — the easing of draconian zero-Covid restrictions, moves to salvage the ailing property sector and Xi’s personal return to the world stage -— have triggered a huge rally.\n\nHong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng (HSI) Index has gained 14% since last Friday, putting it squarely into bull market territory, or more than 20% above its recent low. A key index of Chinese stocks in New York jumped 15% during the same period.\n\nOn the tightly controlled mainland markets, Shanghai and Shenzhen stocks have also advanced more than 2%.\n\n“China continued to see a barrage of upside activity… as reopening measures are a clear buy signal,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner for SPI Asset Management. “We are in a sea change after China’s more progressive policy evolution arrived unexpectedly.”\n\nInvestors now have a “tactically constructive” view on China after key concerns were addressed by credible policy actions, according to Bank of America’s monthly survey of Asian fund managers released on Wednesday.\n\nSome investment banks even upgraded their China growth forecasts following the policy changes. On Wednesday, ANZ Research hiked its China GDP forecast to 5.4% for 2023 from 4.2% previously.\n\n“The changes reflect the party leadership’s intention to stop losses. They want to correct the market’s perception of China’s economic outlook, as President Xi Jinping interacts with global leaders at G20,” it said.\n\nClear signals\n\nInvestors sold off China stocks in October due to fears that Xi’s tightening grip on power would lead to the continuation of existing policies, such as zero-Covid and the common prosperity campaign, that have dragged down the economy and battered financial markets.\n\nA leadership team loyal to Xi also suggested that China may continue to prioritize ideology over the kind of pragmatic decision-making that had enabled the country’s swift economic rise over the past four decades.\n\nBut the latest policy shifts, although not a full-throated economic opening, have been enough to excite investors and analysts waiting for any sign of China easing its rules.\n\nFrom Bali to Bangkok, Xi returned to the world stage after a near three-year absence. There were encouraging signs, in particular, coming from the historic meeting between Xi and US President Joe Biden on Monday, which fueled expectations for stronger economic ties between the two major world powers.\n\n“The US’s willingness to set a ‘floor’ on US-China relations likely means the US is keen to find common ground with China to prevent extreme outcomes,” said Jefferies analysts in a research note earlier this week.\n\nChinese companies on Wall Street have been hammered by delisting risks since last year because of a simmering spat between the two countries over audits. In December, US regulators finalized rules to ban trading in shares of Chinese companies if they can’t access their audit papers, a request that had been denied by Beijing on national security grounds.\n\n“We believe the Xi-Biden meeting could reduce the risk of Chinese ADRs being delisted,” the Jefferies analysts added.\n\nIn August, the two countries reached an agreement to allow US officials to inspect the audit papers of those firms, taking a first step toward resolving the dispute.\n\nReuters also reported Wednesday that US regulators gained “good access” in their review of auditing work done on New York-listed Chinese firms during a seven-week inspection in Hong Kong.\n\nToo optimistic?\n\nDespite this week’s rally, some analysts remain cautious. Qi Wang, CEO of MegaTrust Investment in Hong Kong, said the recovery may be driven by a lot of buying to close out previous short positions and money chasing quick returns.\n\n“I don’t think the long-term appetite for China and Hong Kong shares will return so quickly. Right or wrong, there were some fatal blows to global investor confidence earlier this year,” Wang said.\n\n“There is some good news recently, but the big institutional money still need time to assess the situation, including the economic prospect for next year,” he added.\n\nIncluding the recent surge, the Hang Seng index is still down 23% this year, making it one of the world’s worst performing indices. The Nasdaq Golden China Index, a popular index tracking Chinese companies in New York, has plunged more than 33% so far in 2022.\n\n“This week’s rally is a strong over-reaction to mildly positive news,” said Brock Silvers, Hong Kong-based chief investment officer at Kaiyuan Capital, a private equity investment firm. “The market was desperate for good news, but it’s foolish to think that once Covid is behind us we’ll return to the go-go days of high octane growth.”\n\nSilvers added that the economic factors and political risks that made China “uninvestable” a month ago are still prevalent and are likely to reassert themselves before long.\n\nChina is still dealing with Covid outbreaks and remains firmly committed to measures long abandoned by most other nations. Even more serious is the real estate crisis and the risks that poses for the banking sector, he said, adding that the 16-point rescue plan Beijing announced last Friday did not go far enough.\n\nHao Hong, chief economist for Grow Investment Group, described the rally as sentiment-driven and technical in nature, because the market was previously oversold to an epic level.\n\nBut as winter is coming, Covid cases are set to rise.\n\n“Whether we could deal with the resurgence with adequate medical facilities and without panic remains to be seen,” he said, adding it also remains uncertain how effective the new property support measures are and whether the developers can “rise from ashes.”\n\nIf China re-tightens Covid restrictions or US-China tension flares up again, market sentiment could plummet once more, he said.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/energy/gas-prices/index.html", "title": "Gas prices are starting to take off again. More increases are on the ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nEven before Wednesday’s action by OPEC+ to cut oil production, US gas prices were on their way up. More price increases at the pump likely lay ahead.\n\nGas prices rose nearly 3 cents a gallon in AAA’s daily reading Wednesday, to $3.83 a gallon, the biggest one-day hike in nearly four months.\n\nThe 99-day streak of price declines from mid-June to September 20 may become a distant memory, even as today’s prices are still far below the June record of just over $5.03 a gallon. Gas prices have increased every day but one day since then, and are now up by 16 cents a gallon, or 4%, since they bottomed out two weeks ago at $3.67 a gallon.\n\nFor the most part the price increases have been slow and incremental, but that might be about to change. OPEC+, which includes not only nations in the oil cartel but other major oil producers such as Russia, agreed Wednesday to slash oil production by about 2 million barrels a day.\n\nOil futures rose about 2% on the news and gasoline futures were also slightly higher on the OPEC move. Gasoline futures are up about 20 cents a gallon since the slide in gasoline prices ended last month, pointing to possible higher prices ahead.\n\nOil and gasoline futures had been falling since mid-June due to growing concerns about a possible recession cutting demand for gasoline and oil, among other factors.\n\nThe recent increases have been caused by the unusually high number of US refineries that are shut down for maintenance work, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS, which tracks gasoline prices for AAA. He said nearly 18% of the nation’s refining capacity is now offline.\n\n“A lot of it was put off in spring because they were making so much money,” he said. “The margin of error in US refining capacity is so slim right now that you can’t lose any capacity without affecting prices.”\n\nThis is normally the time of year that gas prices drop as regulations requiring cleaner but pricier gas to fight smog come to an end in most of the country. The end of the summer driving season also reduces demand, which in turn pushes prices downward.\n\nUnfortunately, the refinery capacity squeeze “means gas prices are not going to go down like I had thought,” said veteran oil analyst Andy Lipow. “In fact, they might drift upwards.”\n\nOne other factor that helped to reduce prices in recent months: the release of about 1 million barrels of oil a day from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is set to end November 1.\n\n“Nobody really knows what happens when SPR sales end,” said Kloza.\n\nOne thing that could reduce prices: California, which typically keeps its rules requiring the summer of blend of gasoline in place until November, lifted the requirement early last week. That could lower the national average price, even if it only affects gasoline in California. The state accounts for about 9% of US gasoline consumption, so the change can affect the national average even if prices don’t move elsewhere. The average price there is $5.52 a gallon, by far the highest in the nation.\n\n“I don’t think we’ll see major moves in national prices. even if we see California prices come back to the pack,” Kloza said.\n\nThe decline in gasoline prices has been an important control on rising overall prices, as well as a support for consumer spending, as it means more money goes in consumers’ pockets.\n\nThe typical US household buys about 90 gallons of gas a month, so the fall from $5.03 a gallon to a low of $3.67 a gallon late last month represented a savings of about $120 a month. By contrast, the 16-cent rise from that low point was costing about $14 a household.\n\nThe concern by the Biden administration is that rising gas prices bring renewed focus in voters’ mind.\n\nFor that reason, members of the Biden administration pushed hard to convince OPEC nations not to cut production and possibly send prices higher ahead of a midterm vote. Those efforts were unsuccessful.\n\n– CNN’s Alex Marquardt, Natasha Bertrand and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Matt Egan", "Chris Isidore", "Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/success/us-national-rent-february/index.html", "title": "Rent jumped 17% since last year, hitting a new record | CNN Business", "text": "The cost of monthly rent reached a new high in February, with the typical apartment now $283 more expensive each month than it was two years ago, before the onset of the pandemic.\n\nThe national median rent was $1,792 last month, up 17% from a year ago, according to a report from Realtor.com. Rent for studio apartments, one bedrooms and two bedrooms all saw double-digit increases over the past year.\n\nFebruary marked the seventh-straight month of rents soaring by double-digit percentages, after rents cratered in some of the biggest cities during the pandemic.\n\n“With rents up by nearly 20% over the past two years, rental prices are likely to remain high, but we do expect some cooling from the recent accelerated pace,” said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.\n\nIn some cities, the rent increases have been staggering. Miami saw the fastest growth, with the median rental price spiking 55% in February from a year ago, making it the least affordable market of the top 50 cities, according to the report.\n\nCities that saw the smallest rent increases were Cleveland, Minneapolis and Detroit, where rents were up by just 6% or less in February from a year ago.\n\nSan Jose, California, remains the most expensive place to rent, with a median rent of $3,024 a month, followed by San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and New York City.\n\n“With rents surging nationwide, February data indicates that many renters’ budgets may be stretched beyond the affordability limit,” said Hale.\n\nSun Belt rents rising fastest\n\nThe Sun Belt continues to attract new residents drawn by its relative affordability, attractive lifestyle and an increased ability to work remotely. As a result, all 10 of the fastest-growing rental markets are in the southern tier of the US, including four in Florida.\n\nAfter Miami, the cities with the biggest annual rent jumps were Orlando and Tampa, Florida; Austin, Texas; San Diego; Las Vegas; Phoenix; Jacksonville, Florida; Memphis, Tennessee; and San Antonio, Texas – all with rent surges of 23% or more.\n\nRent growth is being driven up by an increase in demand, particularly from young renters, many of whom may have been priced out of buying a home, according to the report.\n\nAlthough buying a starter home is more affordable than renting one in a city like Miami, the report showed, home prices there are rising and mortgage rates are climbing, with purchase prices up 31.6% in February from a year ago.\n\n“In light of mounting economic uncertainties and the conflict in Ukraine, some households will prefer to buy, in an effort to lock in a largely fixed monthly payment as a hedge against further inflation,” said Hale. “But fast-rising mortgage rates and still-limited numbers of homes for sale could mean some would-be buyers may stick with the flexibility of renting. With rental demand already outmatching supply, rental affordability will remain a challenge.”\n\nRents taking a bigger share of income\n\nA general rule of thumb is to keep monthly housing costs at 30% or less of monthly income. But even if wages are rising in some industries, rents are up a lot more – and taking up a larger share of monthly income.\n\nSun Belt cities experiencing strong inbound migration are some of the least affordable places to rent, based on a Realtor.com analysis.\n\nAs the least affordable city to rent, Miami’s median rent is $2,929 a month, which takes up nearly 60% of the median monthly income, making renters there heavily cost burdened.\n\nThe rental share of income was over 30% in 14 of the top 50 cities, including Los Angeles, where rent took up 46% of monthly income; followed by Riverside, California, at 45.9% and Tampa, Florida, at 44.7%.\n\nMeanwhile, cities determined to be most affordable were places where rent was going up, but not eating up more than 30% of the median income. Kansas City was the most affordable city to rent, the analysis found. Although rent there jumped 11% in February from a year ago, the median rent of $1,216 a month ate up only 20% of the median income.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA swarm of hundreds of birds plummeted to the ground outside your house. Carcasses lay strewed in the street, the birds killed from the impact.\n\nThat’s the view a handful of people woke up to in Chihuahua, Mexico, on February 7.\n\nMillions around the world got a front-row seat of the massacre when security camera footage was released of the event, but it left people with more questions than answers.\n\nWhy did the birds crash?\n\n“The cause of this bizarre and troubling incident is honestly anybody’s guess at this point,” said Carlos Botero, assistant professor of biology at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nThe footage didn’t show the entire swarm of birds, but Botero hypothesized that they could have flown through a cloud of lethal chemicals. Autopsies of the dead bird specimens would need to be completed to determine if that was the case, he said.\n\nA predator could have also sent the birds frantically flying away, Botero added.\n\nRichard Broughton, an ornithologist at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, was almost certain the maneuver was to avoid a predator like a peregrine falcon.\n\n“Blackbirds form tight flocks, called a ‘murmuration,’ that swirls in the sky to try and confuse the falcon so it cannot pick a target,” Broughton said via email.\n\nTo combat this strategy, the falcon dives straight into the flock of birds to separate out a target, Broughton explained. When this happens, the blackbirds try to avoid it.\n\nHundreds of yellow-headed blackbirds crashed to the ground in Chihuahua, Mexico, leaving many dead. Kerry Wu/Adobe Stock\n\nIn the video, viewers are likely seeing the birds try and escape a predator that attacked them from above, he said. The birds headed down, but some could not pull up fast enough, Broughton added.\n\nAssuming the time stamp of 7:42 p.m. local time on the video is accurate, the birds were likely leaving their nocturnal roost nearby, said Andrew Farnsworth, senior research associate at The Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, New York.\n\nIn addition to the predatory theory, Farnsworth suggested that a loud noise startling the birds was another possibility. This has happened in the past with other species of birds, he said.\n\nHow common is this behavior?\n\nIt’s very rare for birds to crash into the ground, and it’s not normal behavior, Botero said.\n\nThere are other occurrences of birds dying from abrupt crashing, Farnsworth said.\n\nIn 1999, about 110 king eiders, a type of large sea duck, were found dead on Baffin Island in Canada. There weren’t any obstacles in their way, so it’s likely they crashed because of poor visibility, which could be attributed to the cataracts in their eyes, a study found.\n\nIn 1985 and 2003, dozens of geese were found dead in fields in southern Manitoba, Canada. Researchers initially thought they were poisoned, but the severe injuries the geese sustained hinted that they could have become disoriented on the moonless nights or been frightened by a thunderstorm.\n\nWhat are these birds?\n\nExperts identified the birds as yellow-headed blackbirds, migratory birds living in the western and prairie wetlands of North America. In the winter they form large flocks, which is what was caught on video.\n\nThe eBird, an online database of bird observations, at The Cornell Lab of Ornithology tracks these birds’ migration pattern on a map as they fly south to Mexico for the winter then back to the United States and Canada for the summer.

Others shouted for the now-shuttered store to be re-opened.\n\n\"If we can't work, we have to come and get something to eat,\" said 60-year-old fisherman Anastasio Barrera, as he stood with his wife outside the store. \"The city government isn't doing anything for us, and neither is the state government.\"\n\nMexico was hit by the one-two punch of twin storms over the weekend, and Interior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong said 57 storm-related deaths had occurred.\n\nThe country could get another double blow by week's end. A tropical disturbance formed over the Yucatan Peninsula on the country's eastern tip and Tropical Depression Manuel — the same storm that battered Acapulco — regained force in the Pacific. It was expected to hit Baja California on the country's far west as a renewed tropical storm.\n\nWith the twin roads from Acapulco to Mexico City closed down, at least 40,000 tourists saw a long holiday beach weekend degenerate into a desperate struggle to get weeping children, elderly parents and even a few damp, bedraggled dogs back home.\n\nTwo of Mexico's largest airlines were running about two flights an hour from Acapulco's still-flooded international airport Tuesday, with priority for those with tickets, the elderly and families with young children.\n\nEveryone else who couldn't wait for the government's promise to reopen the roads within two days flocked to Air Base 7, about 20 minutes north of Acapulco, where a military air bridge made up of barely more than a dozen aircraft ferried tourists to Mexico City. The normally quiet beachfront installation was transformed into a scene from a conflict zone.\n\nFamilies in shorts and sandals waited for as long as eight hours outside the gates of the base, held at bay by rifle-toting soldiers until they were allowed to drag suitcases, pet carriers and red-eyed children across the tarmac, where they jostled furiously for a chance at one of the 150 seats on the next departing Air Force Boeing 727.\n\nMilitary officials said only two of the passenger planes were in service, although a few hundred people got seats on one of the five helicopters or seven cargo planes also pressed into emergency duty.\n\nMany told of spending the weekend trapped by torrential rains inside their hotels, emerging to discover there was no way back home.\n\n\"It's probably one of the worst holidays I've ever been on,\" said David Jefferson Gled, a 28-year-old from Bristol, England, who teaches English at a private school in Mexico City. \"It wasn't really a holiday, more of an incarceration.\"\n\nBy the end of Tuesday, 24 hours after most vacationers were supposed to be back, about 2,750 people had been flown out of Acapulco, the Guerrero state government said. But many still waited miserably on the runway or, worse, with thousands of other sweating, blank-eyed people in a roughly quarter-mile-long line outside the base.\n\n\"It's horrible. We haven't eaten anything since nine in the morning,\" said Lizbeth Sasia, a 25-year-old teacher from Cuernavaca. \"They keep telling us we'll be on the next flight, but the next flight never comes.\"\n\nAdding insult to injury, a few immaculately dressed families skipped the line and were escorted to private jets by soldiers, to the incredulous stares of the sweltering masses.\n\n\"We're cooking here, burnt. We're tired, desperate,\" said Irma Antonio Martinez, a 43-year-old housewife from suburban Mexico City who came to celebrate the three-day Independence Day weekend with 12 relatives. \"We just want to get home to our poor house. Our families are waiting for us.\"\n\nAsked how she felt, Juana Colin Escamilla cradled her toddler daughter and was able to get out one word, \"bad\" before she burst into tears.\n\nSome cash machines along Acapulco's coastal boulevard were low on bills, but most of the city's tourist zone appeared back to normal, with roads clear, restaurants and hotels open and brightly lit and tourists strolling along the bay in an attempt to recover some of the leisure time lost to three days of incessant rains.\n\nGavin McLoughlin, 27, another teacher at Mexico City's Greengates School, said he went to Acapulco on a late-night bus Thursday with about 30 other teachers at the school, many of whom are in their 20s.\n\n\"We had no idea of the weather,\" the Englishman said. \"We knew there was a hurricane on the other side but not this side.\"\n\nFederal officials said it could take at least another two days to open the main highway between Mexico and Acapulco, which was hit by more than 13 landslides, and to bring food and relief supplies into the city of more than 800,000 people.\n\nCity officials said about 23,000 homes, mostly on Acapulco's outskirts, were without electricity and water. Stores were nearly emptied by residents who rushed to stock up on basic goods.

Ingrid's maximum sustained winds Monday decreased to near 60 mph with additional weakening expected as the storm moves inland, where it's spreading heavy rain.\n\nThe heaviest blow Sunday fell on the southern coastal state of Guerrero, where Mexico's government reported 14 confirmed deaths. State officials said people had been killed in landslides, drownings in a swollen river and a truck crash on a rain-slickened mountain highway.\n\nMexico's federal Civil Protection coordinator, Luis Felipe Puente, told reporters late Sunday that stormy weather from one or both of the two systems also caused three deaths in Hidalgo, three in Puebla and one in Oaxaca.\n\nGetting hit by a tropical storm and a hurricane at the same time \"is completely atypical\" for Mexico, Juan Manuel Caballero, coordinator of the country's National Weather Service, said at a news conference with Puente.\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center said Ingrid, the second hurricane of the Atlantic storm season, could reach the mainland by Monday morning or early afternoon, most likely along the lightly populated coast north of the port of Tampico.\n\nAuthorities in the Gulf states of Tamaulipas and Veracruz evacuated more than 7,000 people from low-lying areas as the hurricane closed in, and the prospect of severe weather prompted some communities to cancel Independence Day celebrations planned for Sunday and Monday.\n\nManuel came ashore as a tropical storm Sunday afternoon near the Pacific port of Manzanillo, but quickly began losing strength and was downgraded to a tropical depression late Sunday, although officials warned its rains could still cause flash floods and mudslides. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the system dissipated early Monday.\n\nThe rains caused some rivers to overflow in Guerrero, damaging hundreds of homes and disrupting communications for several hours.\n\nEarly Monday, Manuel's remnants had maximum sustained winds of about 30 mph and was moving to the northwest at 8 mph. It was about 5 miles west of Puerto Vallarta.\n\nManuel was expected to dump up to 10 to 15 inches of rain over parts of Guerrero and Michoacan states, with maximums of 25 inches possible in some isolated areas. Rains of 5 to 10 inches were possible in the states of Colima, Jalisco and Nayarit. Authorities said the rains presented a dangerous threat in mountains, where flash floods and mudslides were possible.\n\nIngrid also was expected to bring very heavy rains. It had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph early Monday and was centered about 25 miles west of La Pesca as it moved west-northwest at 8 mph.\n\nMore than 1,000 homes in Veracruz state had been affected by the storm to varying degrees, and 20 highways and 12 bridges had damage, the state's civil protection authority said. A bridge collapsed near the northern Veracruz city of Misantla on Friday, cutting off the area from the state capital, Xalapa.\n\nA week ago, 13 people died in the state when a landslide buried their homes in heavy rains spawned by Tropical Depression Fernand.\n\nFar out in the open Atlantic, Tropical Storm Humberto reformed Monday morning.

There may be some differences between the audio and the text.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nGood morning, I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Wednesday, the 8th of September 2021. Today new grim milestones for the U.S. Coronavirus pandemic, plus Biden calls for climate action, and more.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nHere are some of the top headlines.\n\nA powerful magnitude seven earthquake slammed near the Mexican resort city of Acapulco last night. At least one person is dead, and buildings moved hundreds of miles away in Mexico City. The Taliban have announced an interim government in Afghanistan. The cabinet has no women, includes veterans of their hard line rule in the 1990s, and is made up mostly of the country's dominant Pashtun ethnic group. There is already international pressure on the move, but the Taliban have called the current government temporary. And Britney Spears' father, Jamie Spears, has filed a petition to end his daughter's conservatorship. He's controlled it, at least in part, for the past 13 years.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe United States reached two grim COVID-19 milestones yesterday. On the same day the country reached 650,000 total deaths from the virus, the U.S. also registered more COVID cases in 2021 than all of 2020. Both of those numbers are more than 20.1 million. One caveat is that testing for the virus was still limited early last year, and major outbreaks were not detected in the U.S. until March of 2020 so the true number of 2020 infections will never be known. But it's clear that the Delta variant of COVID-19 has again brought the pandemic to concerning levels after cases dropped dramatically over this summer. And even as most children returned to the classroom in recent weeks, kids are making up more and more Coronavirus cases. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, they accounted for 26.8% of cases in the week ending September 2nd. That's almost twice as high as the 15.1% they've represented since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll found that most parents support mask mandates at school, with all children under 12 still ineligible for the vaccine. According to the polling, 65% support mask requirements for students and staff, and the same portion want vaccine requirements for staff as well. Only a slightly lower number, 59%, want to require eligible students be vaccinated. Even with the enthusiasm for these requirements, parents do want their kids back in the classroom, with 67% in favor of five days a week.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nPresident Joe Biden visited parts of New York and New Jersey yesterday that were slammed by Hurricane Ida. During his visit, he pointed to climate change and the likelihood that more freak weather events are on the way in coming years.\n\nJoe Biden:\n\nThe threat is here. It's not going to get any better. The question, can it get worse? We can stop it from getting worse, and so folks we've got to listen to the scientists and the economists and the national security experts. They all tell us this is code red. The nation and the world are in peril.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nHurricane Ida killed at least 67 people around the country, particularly in the flooded Northeast which is not used to regular hurricane conditions.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMeanwhile, swells from Hurricane Larry will hit parts of the Atlantic coast today from Florida to Maine. The waves could cause coastal flooding, though the storm itself is not expected to make a U.S. landfall. Larry is still spinning in the Atlantic as a category three hurricane with sustained winds of 115 miles an hour.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nVice President Kamala Harris heads to her home state of California today to campaign for Governor Gavin Newsom. The governor faces a recall election next Tuesday, under pressure for a number of issues including his handling of the Coronavirus pandemic. National correspondent Crystal Hayes has more.\n\nCrystal Hayes:\n\nDuring COVID a lot of Governors got a lot of heat. There were recall efforts against Governors in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, but none of them garnered enough support, enough signatures to actually do what's happening right now in California. This recall effort against Governor Newsom really started before the pandemic had really, really hit the U.S. And then the recall effort was really fixated on his policies from immigration, taxes, those sorts of things, but as the pandemic wore on fatigue grew, and a lot of people were pretty angry about some of the very, very strict mandates that California elicited, from shutting down schools to shutting down even outdoor dining for some restaurants, closing beaches, those sorts of things. We've seen a lot of things, like homelessness, skyrocket in the country, especially in California.\n\nCrystal Hayes:\n\nBasically this allows voters the chance to say we're not happy with the job you're doing, and force somebody out of office before an actual election. People have to garner enough signatures and then the process becomes an actual ballot pitcher where people vote. When you look at California on a national stage it's known as one of the bluest states in the country. It's a leader on a lot of progressive and liberal policies. It's going to send shock waves if Governor Newsom is in fact booted from office. What it will mean for the Democratic Party, what it will mean as far as other leaders looking at how they manage COVID in the future, it'll send a message to the Democratic Party, and you will hear Republicans no doubt saying that the Governor and all of his policies failed.\n\nCrystal Hayes:\n\nFor Democrats, it could be a warning signal for them ahead of the next election. There's 46 candidates, so a lot of people on the ballot. People like reality star and former Olympian, Caitlyn Jenner, former Mayor of San Diego and Conservative Radio Host Larry Elder. Recalls are used in quite a few states, 19 states. States like Alaska, California, Colorado, Arizona, but it's incredibly rare. California's almost kind of more so known for this. There are only two times in history that a Governor has actually been recalled or removed from office. That happened in the 1920s in North Dakota and then most recently in 2003 in California when then Governor Gray Davis was removed from office and replaced by movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nPresident Joe Biden will also head to the Golden State to campaign for Newsom in the coming days.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nVirginia today will remove its largest Confederate monument. The 131-year-old Robert E. Lee Memorial statue in Richmond served as both a symbol of Confederate heritage and a major base for racial equality demonstrations last summer. The City's Mayor, Levar Stoney, said in a statement, \"We are taking an important step this week to embrace the righteous cause and put the lost cause behind us. Richmond is no longer the capital of the Confederacy. We are a diverse, open and welcoming city, and our symbols need to reflect this reality.\"\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nVirginia Governor Ralph Northam announced last year that the statue would be removed during nationwide protests against systemic racism after George Floyd's murder by police. Some residents last October filed a lawsuit opposing its removal, but the Supreme Court of Virginia ruled against them last week. Robert E. Lee was a Confederate General during the Civil War.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWell, Derek Jeter and Larry Walker are finally heading to the Baseball Hall of Fame. The New York Yankees shortstop and Montreal Expos and Colorado Rockies outfielder will enter the hall during a formal induction ceremony today after delays because of the pandemic. They'll be joined in the class of 2020 by former St. Louis Cardinals player, Ted Simmons and the late former Labor Leader, Marvin Miller. He ran the Major League Baseball Players Association from 1966 to 1982, pushing for a number of changes in the players favored. There will not be a class of 2021. You can catch today's induction ceremony at 1:30 PM Eastern, 10:30 AM Pacific on MLB network and mlb.com.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd you can find 5 Things wherever you get your audio, including Apple Podcasts and Spotify.

Bookmark CNN’s lite site for fast connectivity.\n\nCNN —\n\nAt least two people have died in Puerto Rico because of Hurricane Fiona, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi told CNN, as rescuers scrambled to save flooding victims.\n\nA 58-year-old man died after being swept away by La Plata River behind his home in Comerío, and a man in his 30s died after attempting to fill his generator with gasoline while it was on, setting it on fire, according to Press Secretary Sheila Angleró-Mojica.\n\nThe storm wiped out power to most of the island before crashing into the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Ricans who remember the wrath of Hurricane Maria in 2017 say Fiona might be more destructive.\n\n“It’s unbelievable,” said Juan Miguel Gonzalez, a business owner in San Juan.\n\n“A lot of people – more than (during) Maria – lost their houses now … lost everything in their houses because of the flooding,” Gonzalez told CNN’s Leyla Santiago.\n\n“Maria was tough winds. But this one, with all the rain, it just destroyed everything in the house. Gov. Pierluisi also told CNN Monday that damage on the island is mostly rain-related.\n\nBy midday Monday, about 1,000 people in Puerto Rico had been rescued by emergency crews, said Maj. Gen. José Reyes, adjutant general of the Puerto Rico National Guard.\n\nThe “catastrophic rain that won’t stop” is “the biggest challenge” for responders, Federal Emergency Management Agency Coordingating Officer Robert Little told CNN’s Erin Burnett Monday evening.\n\n“The first responders, the local responders, the responders of the government of Puerto Rico, are not able to get out and help those that needed or access the damage like they would like to do,” he added.\n\nCars and buildings are partially submerged in Puerto Rico, which remains lagely without power. Courtesy Pito Hernández León\n\nIntense rain was expected to produce more mudslides and catastrophic flooding through Monday night.\n\nOne hundred first responders from New York will head to the US territory to help as soon as weather allows, Pierluisi said, adding that the governors of New Jersey and California have also pledged to send help.\n\nFiona made landfall Monday morning in the Dominican Republic after crossing onto land a day earlier in southwestern Puerto Rico.\n\nStill, Puerto Rico remains almost entirely under flash flood or flood warnings – nearly five years to the day after Hurricane Maria devastated the territory.\n\nOne area north of the city of Ponce reported over 2 feet of rain in 24 hours.\n\nRescues were underway Monday in the western Puerto Rican municipalities of Mayaguez and Hormigueros, officials said. The Guanajibo River in Hormigueros surpassed its previous record height set during Maria.\n\nMeanwhile, southern Puerto Rico can expect another 4 to 8 inches of rain or more early this week – meaning Fiona will leave the island deluged with 12 to 30 inches of rain, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.\n\n“These rains will continue to produce life-threatening and catastrophic flooding along with mudslides and landslides across Puerto Rico,” the center said.\n\nAt least one death was reported in the heavily-damaged city of Basse-Terre, the capitol of the French territory of Guadeloupe, the vice president of the territory’s environmental agency said.\n\nFiona could become a major hurricane by Wednesday, with winds reaching 111 mph. That would make Fiona the first major hurricane of the year in the Atlantic, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nMassive power outages cripple Puerto Rico\n\nA house is deluged Sunday in Cayey, Puerto Rico. Three people inside the home were reportedly rescued. Stephanie Rojas/AP\n\nJust 115,000 out of 1.4 million customers on the island currently have power, Pierluisi said Monday evening. The entire island was in the dark early Monday, PowerOutage.us reported.\n\nAnd it could be days before power is restored, the main power utility in Puerto Rico said Sunday, as daily high temperatures after Monday are forecast to reach the mid-80s to 90s.\n\nSeveral transmission line outages contributing to the blackout, LUMA Energy said. Power will be restored “gradually,” Pierluisi said in a Facebook post.\n\nOnly 35% of customers are getting water services because water filtration plants are being impacted by the river flooding and excess rain, the governor said.\n\nHurricane evacuees take refuge at a public school in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico. Ricardo Arduengo/Reuters\n\nBy late Monday morning, a bit of good news from island’s capital: The power system came back up for hospitals in San Juan’s medical complex, Puerto Rico Health Secretary Dr. Carlos Mellado López said. The complex is the island’s most important and stretches across 227 acres, according to the Health Administration of Puerto Rico.\n\n“The power system at all the hospitals in the Medical Center Complex has been restored,” Mellado tweeted Sunday night. “Our patients are safe and receiving the medical care they need.”\n\nFiona’s latest path\n\nIntense rainfall will continue producing mudslides, landslides and catastrophic flooding across Puerto Rico through Monday night, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nFiona could intensify as it moves across the Atlantic Ocean. cnnweather\n\nThe hurricane slammed the Dominican Republic community of Boca de Yuma early Monday, whipping maximum sustained winds of 90 mph, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe storm knocked 59 aqueducts out of service, leaving more than 1 million people in the Dominican Republic without running water, according to Jose Luis German Mejia, an emergency management official. At least 54 homes have been reported damaged so far, said Juan Manuel Mendez, the country’s emergency management director of operations.\n\nEmergency officials have transported 789 people to safety, Mendez said at a storm briefing Monday. More than 500 people are housed in 29 shelters, he said.\n\nTen electric circuits are offline currently, but officials did not have an exact number of how many customers were without power.\n\n“This is still an emergency event,” and the storm is still affecting the country, said Mejia.\n\nLife-threatening flash flooding and urban flooding is forecast for eastern portions of the Dominican Republic through early Tuesday, the hurricane center said.\n\nFiona could also dump 10 inches of rain in the eastern and northern parts of the country, according to the center.\n\nGET LIVE UPDATES\n\nAs Fiona moves away from the Dominican Republic’s northern coast, it’s expected to intensify as it moves north over warm water.\n\nTropical storm conditions are expected in the southeastern Bahamas by late Monday or early Tuesday, and Fiona is expected to impact the eastern Turks and Caicos on Tuesday morning.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect for Turks and Caicos, the National Hurricane Center said Monday evening.\n\n“Fiona will continue turning northward and then northeastward this week, nearing Bermuda on Friday as a major hurricane,” CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.\n\nYet another widespread calamity\n\nPower outages have become a familiar crisis for many who live in Puerto Rico. Just five months ago, residents suffered another islandwide blackout after a fire broke out in a power plant.\n\nSome parts of the island still bear the scars of Maria, which inflicted catastrophic infrastructure damage; it took almost a year for power to be restored across the island.\n\nSamuel Rivera and his mother Lourdes Rodriguez lived without power for about a year after Maria, Rivera told CNN. On Sunday morning, they lost power once again, conjuring up similar fears to those they had five years ago.\n\nThey were also concerned a nearby river might overflow and trees surrounding their home could be felled by the powerful winds, they said.\n\nRushing waters easily wiped away a bridge, carrying its structure downstream, one video of the dangerous flooding shows. Elsewhere in the city of Arecibo, quickly moving waters overtook large construction vehicles and entire trees as rain fell in sheets, another video by Samuel De Jesús shows.\n\nMany rivers on the eastern side of the island were at moderate to major flood stages Sunday afternoon, including one southeastern river which rose over 12 feet in less than seven hours.\n\nUS President Joe Biden early Sunday approved an emergency declaration to provide federal assistance to disaster relief efforts.\n\nMore than 300 FEMA emergency workers were on the ground to respond to the crisis, said Anne Bink, FEMA’s associate administrator for Response and Recovery.\n\n“Our heart goes out to the residents that again are going through another catastrophic event five years later,” Bink said, nodding to Maria. This time, she said, FEMA plans to implement lessons learned from the 2017 crisis.\n\n“We were much more prepared. We have four warehouses now strategically located throughout the island, which includes commodities, exponentially larger supplies than in the past,” Bink said.\n\n“We’re proactively there – and well ahead of any storm hitting – to make sure that we are coordinating. And all of the planning efforts we undertake during those blue skies days can be brought to bear when the rain falls.”\n\nBiden told Gov. Pierluisi in a Tuesday call that he would “ensure that the Federal team remains on the job to get it done, especially given that Puerto Rico is still recovering from the damage of Hurricane Maria five years ago this week,” a readout of the call said.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe Holly Yan Melissa Alonso", "Elizabeth Wolfe", "Holly Yan", "Melissa Alonso"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/07/africa/second-cyclone-hits-madagascar-intl/index.html", "title": "Madagascar hit by cyclone Batsirai, second in two weeks | CNN", "text": "Antananarivo, Madagascar Reuters —\n\nEmergency rescuers were struggling on Monday to reach parts of Madagascar ravaged by a cyclone over the weekend because many roads and bridges were impassable, while rising river levels were threatening to displace more people, officials said.\n\nCyclone Batsirai slammed into the Indian Ocean island late on Saturday, battering the eastern coastline until it moved away late on Sunday, leaving at least 10 people dead, 43,000 displaced and some towns and villages largely destroyed.\n\nMadagascar, with a population of nearly 30 million, had already been dealing with the aftermath of Cyclone Ana, which killed 55 people and displaced 130,000 just two weeks earlier, as well as with a drought and food emergency in its southern Grand Sud region.\n\nPresident Andy Rajoelina flew into the coastal town of Mananjary, normally about 500 kms (311 miles) by road southeast of the capital Antananarivo.

By Wednesday night, maximum sustained winds had dropped to 50 mph as the storm slogged northward, but flooding was reported in some areas and remained a threat.\n\nOn May 23, the National Hurricane Center had said odds favor a below-normal hurricane season in the eastern Pacific for 2013. It said 11 to 16 named storms were likely, below the 15-storm annual average for 1981-2010.\n\nBut Barbara appeared to start the Pacific season unusually early, and it also made landfall farther east than any other Pacific hurricane since 1966.

Kitchens were readied to serve the thousands expected to be stuck without a roof over their heads for the days, weeks and even months to come.\n\nIt occurs every hurricane season. Some 3,000 soldiers arrived ahead of Patricia's landfall late Friday along Mexico's southwestern coast, ready to deal with damage from the catastrophic storm. Responding to natural disasters is one of the strengths of the nation's Army and civil protection authorities.\n\nPatricia tops list of world's strongest storms\n\nOrdinary Mexicans also chip in, regularly reacting to tragedies with generosity by dropping off gifts of food, blankets and household items at distribution points set up around the country. Politicians are quick to respond, too, arriving to oversee the distribution of relief to residents who have lost everything.\n\nLeft out of the scenario: prevention and planning — seemingly afterthoughts in a country where hurricanes frequently crash both coasts, and flooding is a recurring fact of life in low-lying areas.\n\nGraphic: A look at damage from hurricane winds\n\nAlong with the lack of prevention, the aftermath of the storms and floods often unmasks cases of corruption and expedience — most notoriously in 2013, when Hurricane Manuel flooded working class areas of Acapulco that had been built with improper permits. That storm also brought reports of relief supplies being pilfered before arriving at the doorsteps of those in need.\n\n“The culture of Mexico isn’t one of prevention,” said Aldo Muñoz, political science professor at the Autonomous University of Mexico State. “It’s a day-to-day culture in which it’s not important what happens tomorrow.” That's especially true among the approximately 50% of the population considered poor, he added.\n\nPatricia's 200-mph winds will turn planes, vehicles into airborne missiles\n\nPoliticians, especially at the local level, regularly opt to invest more in ornamental projects like parks, roads and bridges — instead of mundane, but necessary infrastructure improvements such as sewers and waterworks. They also have preferred the photo-ops of riding to the rescue in times of trouble to the scant political capital accumulated by promoting prevention projects, experts say.\n\n“It is not only that rescue gives you a better photo-op than prevention,\" said Rodolfo Soriano Nuñez, sociologist in Mexico City. \"Not preventing and playing the hero gives you many more chances of stealing money from the public treasury.”\n\nStorm surge, torrential rain, landslides also major threats from Patricia\n\nStill, ordinary Mexicans often show outpourings of generosity in times of crisis — most exemplary after the 1985 earthquake, when an inept government response left many to fend for themselves. Today, earthquake preparedness has taken a priority in Mexico City, which debuted an alert system in September and promoted drills for evacuating buildings.\n\n“There are many displays of solidarity” in times of crisis, said Ilán Semo, historian at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City. “You see Mexican society at its very best.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/23"}]}

Now these families want to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChristopher James Dawley, known as CJ to his friends and family, was 14 years old when he signed up for Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Like many teenagers, he documented his life on those platforms.\n\nCJ worked as a busboy at Texas Roadhouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He loved playing golf, watching “Doctor Who” and was highly sought after by top-tier colleges. “His counselor said he could get a free ride anywhere he wanted to go,” his mother Donna Dawley told CNN Business during a recent interview at the family’s home.\n\nBut throughout high school, he developed what his parents felt was an addiction to social media. By his senior year, “he couldn’t stop looking at his phone,” she said. He often stayed up until 3 a.m. on Instagram messaging with others, sometimes swapping nude photos, his mother said. He became sleep deprived and obsessed with his body image.\n\nOn January 4, 2015, while his family was taking down their Christmas tree and decorations, CJ retreated into his room. He sent a text message to his best friend – “God’s speed” – and posted an update on his Facebook page: “Who turned out the light?” CJ held a 22-caliber rifle in one hand, his smartphone in the other and fatally shot himself. He was 17. Police found a suicide note written on the envelope of a college acceptance letter. His parents said he never showed outward signs of depression or suicidal ideation.\n\n“When we found him, his phone was still on, still in his hand, with blood on it,” Donna Dawley said. “He was so addicted to it that even his last moments of his life were about posting on social media.”\n\n\"For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,\" said Donna Dawley, the mother of CJ. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nNow, the Dawleys are joining a growing number of families who have filed recent wrongful death lawsuits against some of the big social media companies, claiming their platforms played a significant role in their teenagers’ decisions to end their lives. The Dawleys’ lawsuit, which was filed last week, targets Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. The suit accuses the two companies of designing their platforms to addict users with algorithms that lead to “never-ending” scrolling as part of an effort to maximize time spent on the platform for advertising purposes and profit.\n\nThe lawsuit also said the platforms effectively exploit minor users’ decision-making and impulse control capabilities due to “incomplete brain development.”\n\nDonna Dawley said she and her husband, Chris, believe CJ’s mental health suffered as a direct result of the addictive nature of the platforms. They said they were motivated to file the lawsuit against Meta and Snap after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked hundreds of internal documents, including some that showed the company was aware of the ways Instagram can damage mental health and body image.\n\nIn public remarks, including her testimony before Congress last fall, Haugen also raised concerns about how Facebook’s algorithms could drive younger users toward harmful content, such as posts about eating disorders or self-harm, and lead to social media addiction. (Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a 1,300-word post on Facebook at the time claiming Haugen took the company’s research on its impact on children out of context and painted a “false picture of the company.”)\n\n“For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,” said Donna Dawley, adding she felt compelled to “hold the companies accountable” after she heard how Instagram is designed to keep users on the platform for as long as possible. “How dare you put a product out there knowing that it was going to be addictive? Who would ever do that?”\n\nCJ Dawley died by suicide at the age of 17. His parents allege his social media addiction contributed to his death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nHaugen’s disclosures and Congressional testimony renewed scrutiny of tech platforms from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. A bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate in February that proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harm. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.”\n\nSome families are now also taking matters into their own hands and turning to the courts to pressure the tech companies to change how their platforms work. Matthew Bergman, the Dawleys’ lawyer, formed the Social Media Victims Law Center last fall after the release of the Facebook documents. He now represents 20 families who have filed wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies.\n\n“Money is not what is driving Donna and Chris Dawley to file this case and re-live their unimaginable loss they sustained,” Bergman said. “The only way to force [social media companies] to change their dangerous but highly profitable algorithms is to change their economic calculus by making them pay the true costs that their dangerous products have inflicted on families such as the Dawleys.”\n\nHe added: “When faced with similar instances of outrageous misconduct by product manufacturers, juries have awarded tens of millions of dollars in compensatory damages and imposed billion-dollar punitive damage awards. I have every reason to anticipate a jury, after fairly evaluating all the evidence, could render a similar judgment in this case.”\n\nCJ's parents, Chris and Donna, are now suing Meta and Snap over CJ's death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Snap spokesperson Katie Derkits said it can’t comment on active litigation but “our hearts go out to any family who has lost a loved one to suicide.”\n\n“We intentionally built Snapchat differently than traditional social media platforms to be a place for people to connect with their real friends and offer in-app mental health resources, including on suicide prevention for Snapchatters in need,” Derkits said. “Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our community and we are constantly exploring additional ways we can support Snapchatters.”\n\nMeta also declined to comment on the case because it is in litigation but said the company currently offers a series of suicide prevention tools, such as automatically providing resources to a user if a friend or AI detects a post is about suicide.\n\nTech companies under pressure to make changes\n\nAlthough alarms have been raised about social media addiction for years, Haugen’s testimony – coupled with concerns around kids’ increased time spent online during the pandemic – has made the issue a national talking point. But change hasn’t come fast enough for some families.\n\nJennifer Mitchell, who said her 16-year-old son Ian died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat, is also working with the Social Media Victims Law Center to file a lawsuit against Snap. She said she hopes it will make more parents aware of the dangers of social media and encourage lawmakers to regulate the platforms.\n\n“If we can put age restrictions on alcohol, cigarettes and to purchase a gun, something needs to be something done when it comes to social media,” she told CNN Business. Snapchat’s age requirement for signing up is 13. “It’s too addictive for kids.”\n\nIn August 2019, Mitchell had just landed in Alaska on a business trip from Florida when she received a series of voice messages saying her son died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She said police later told her they believed Ian was recording a video at the time of the incident.\n\n“After trying to get into some of his social media accounts, we found video of him [taken] on Snapchat that looked like he was playing Russian roulette with the gun,” Mitchell said. “We don’t know who he was sending it to or if he was playing with someone. The phone was found not too far from his body.”\n\nSnap declined to comment on the incident.\n\nIan's mother said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat. Courtesy Jennifer Mitchell\n\nThe emergence of wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies isn’t limited to teenagers. In January, Tammy Rodriguez filed a lawsuit, alleging her 11-year-old daughter Selena struggled with social media addiction for two years before taking her own life in July 2021. (Instagram and Snapchat, the two sites her daughter is said to have used most, require users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with many social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.)\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Selena Rodriguez had spent more time on those social networks during the pandemic and started communicating with older men on the platforms. She responded to requests to send sexually explicit images, “which were subsequently shared or leaked to her classmates, increasing the ridicule and embarrassment she experienced at school,” the suit alleged.\n\n“Throughout the period of Selena’s use of social media, Tammy Rodriguez was unaware of the clinically addictive and mentally harmful effects of Instagram and Snapchat,” the lawsuit said. It also cited the lack of sufficient parental controls at the time as a contributing factor, an issue that has been a focus of some recent criticism among lawmakers.\n\nBoth Snap and Meta declined to comment on the case but referenced their resources to help its users struggling with their mental health.\n\n“If a person walks into a bad neighborhood and is assaulted, that’s a regrettable incident,” said Bergman, who is also representing the Rodriguez family. “But if a tour guide says, ‘Let me show you around the city or I’ll show you the top sites,’ and one of those [spots] is a very dangerous neighborhood where a person is assaulted, the tour guide appropriately has some responsibility for putting the tourist in harm’s way. That’s exactly what these platforms do.”\n\n“It’s not random that teenage girls are directed toward content that makes them feel bad about their bodies. That is the way the algorithms work; it’s by design,” he added.\n\nA long and uncertain legal road\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, believes these wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies could hold up in court despite inevitable challenges.\n\n“The problem, at least in the traditional notion in the law, has been that it’s difficult to prove addiction that then leads to taking somebody’s life or doing serious damage to somebody that’s self-inflicted,” he said. “But judges and juries in certain situations might be more open to finding liability and awarding damages.”\n\nHe said Haugen’s “damning” testimony before Congress and the “seemingly troubling” data companies collect about young users, as revealed in the documents, could potentially support a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, depending on each case.\n\nIf you suspect someone may be suicidal: 1. Do not leave the person alone. 2. Remove any ﬁrearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt. 3. Call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). 4. Take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.

However, Tobias said because families are now targeting how the platforms are designed, it “might persuade a court to distinguish the new allegations from other actions by defendants that judges found immune.”\n\nIn the months following the leaked internal documents, Instagram has rolled out a handful of safeguards aimed at protecting its young users, including a tool called Take a Break, which aims to encourage people to spend some time away from the platform after they’ve been scrolling for a certain period. It also introduced a tool that allows parents to see how much time their kids spend on Instagram and set time limits, and brought back a version of its news feed that sorts posts in reverse chronological order rather than ranked according to the platform’s algorithms.\n\nLast month, dozens of attorneys general wrote a letter to TikTok and Snap calling on the companies to strengthen the platforms’ existing parental tools and better work alongside third-party monitoring apps, which can alert parents if children use language that suggests a desire for self-harm or suicide.\n\n“Your platforms do not effectively collaborate with parental control applications or otherwise provide an adequate opportunity for parental control within the platform,” the letter said. “We ask that you conform to widespread industry practice by giving parents increased ability to protect their vulnerable children.”\n\nSnap told CNN Business in a response it is currently working on new tools for parents that give more insight into what their teens are doing on Snapchat and who they’re talking to. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company has expanded its safety features over the years. In 2019, TikTok introduced a limited app experience called TikTok for Younger Users which restricts messaging, commenting and sharing videos for users under age 13. In 2020, it rolled out the ability to disable direct messaging for users under the age of 16.\n\nBergman said he anticipates a “long fight” ahead as he plans to “file a lot of cases” against social media companies. “The only thing that’s certain is the level of opposition that we’re going to face from companies that have all the money in the world to hire all the lawyers,” he said. “They want to do everything they can to avoid standing up in a courtroom and explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the life of CJ Dawley.”\n\nDonna Dawley said the last time she saw her son, on the day of his death, he was looking down at his phone, appearing sad. “I just wish I would have grabbed him and hugged him,” she said.\n\n“[This lawsuit] is not about winning or losing. We’re all losing right now. But if we can get them to change the algorithm for one child – if one child is saved – then it’s been worth it.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/tech/discord-teens/index.html", "title": "The dark side of Discord for teens | CNN Business", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nWhen a mother in Washington state learned her teenage daughter was on Discord, a popular social media platform, she felt reasonably comfortable with the idea of her using it to communicate with members of her high school marching band.\n\nBut in September, the mother discovered the 16-year-old was also using the audio and chat service to message with someone who appeared from his profile picture to be an older man. The stranger, who said he lived in England, entered a group chat that included her daughter and members of the band, according to the mother. They struck up a friendship in a private thread. He asked for nude pictures; her daughter obliged.\n\n“I went through every chat they ever had but the most disturbing thing, beyond the nudes, was that he asked her to send a picture of our house,” said the mother, who, like other parents of young Discord users, asked to remain anonymous, citing concerns about their family’s privacy. “My daughter went on Zillow, found our home and sent it, so he knew where she lives. He then asked what American school buses looked like, so she took a photo of her bus and sent it.” He then requested pictures of her friends, and she sent those, too.\n\nThe mother worried the Discord user was manipulating, tracking and planning to exploit her daughter. After shutting down her daughter’s Discord account, an effort she said took six weeks for the company to complete, she installed outdoor security cameras around the home. The mother never reported the incident to Discord, and the conversations are no longer available to flag because the account was deleted. “There’s lots of things we should have done in hindsight,” she said.\n\nIn recent months, large social media companies have faced renewed scrutiny from lawmakers over the negative impacts their platforms can have on teens. Executives from Facebook (FB), Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat’s parent company were called to testify before the Senate after leaks from a Facebook (FB) whistleblower pointed to Instagram’s potential to harm one’s mental health and body image, especially among teenage girls.\n\nLawmakers are now weighing legislation to protect kids online – a bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate last month which proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harms. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.”\n\nDiscord, however, has not been part of that conversation. Launched in 2015, Discord is less well-known among parents than big names like Instagram, even as it surged to 150 million monthly active users globally during the pandemic. The service, which is known for its video game communities, is also less intuitive for some parents, blending the feel of early AOL chat rooms or work chat app Slack with the chaotic, personalized world of MySpace. While much of the focus from lawmakers with other platforms has been on scrutinizing more sophisticated technologies like algorithms, which can surface potentially harmful content to younger users, parents’ concerns about Discord recall an earlier era of the internet: anonymous chat rooms.\n\nDiscord is less well-known among parents than big names like Instagram, even as it surged to 150 million monthly active users globally during the pandemic. Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDiscord’s users, about 79% of which are located outside of North America, engage in public and private chats or channels, called servers, on varying topics, including music interests, Harry Potter and Minecraft, and homework help. Some, like a room for memes, can have hundreds of thousands of members. But the vast majority are private, invite-only spaces with fewer than 10 people, according to Discord. All servers are private by default, and only channels with more than 200 members are discoverable in its search tool if the administrator wants it to be public, the company added.\n\nStill, it’s possible for minors to connect with people they don’t know on public servers or in private chats if the stranger was invited by someone else in the room or if the channel link is dropped into a public group that the user accessed. By default, all users – including users ages 13 to 17 – can receive friend invitations from anyone in the same server, which then opens up the ability for them to send private messages.\n\nCNN Business spoke to nearly a dozen parents who shared stories about their teenagers being exposed to self-harm chats, sexually explicit content and sexual predators on the platform, including users they believed were older men seeking inappropriate pictures and videos.\n\nOne mother from Charlotte, North Carolina said her 13-year-old daughter’s mental health was impacted after a Discord chat room involving her interests took a turn. “The group eventually started talking about cutting themselves, shared tips on how to hide it from parents, and suggested advice on how to run away from home,” the mother told CNN. “I later found out she was actively engaging in self-harm and had planned to run away to Alabama to visit a friend she made on Discord.”\n\nA father outside Boston, who initially didn’t think much of his 13-year-old daughter downloading Discord last summer “because she’s a gamer,” later discovered she had been talking with a man in his 30s who was looking for photos of her and wanted to engage in “naughty cam” activities, in messages reviewed by CNN Business.\n\nThe father said he also later learned some of his daughter’s classmates actively use Discord throughout the day unbeknownst to the school.\n\n“The school actively blocks apps such as Snapchat and Instagram when they log onto the school network on school devices, but teens are using other platforms like Discord that aren’t on their radar,” the father said. “It is the wild west of social media.”\n\nCNN Business reported several of these cases to Discord – with the parents’ permission – ahead of this article’s publication. After launching a series of investigations, the company said it took action against some accounts but said it does not publicly comment on specific cases or user accounts.\n\nMany of the parents CNN Business spoke with said they did not enable any of the offered parental controls at the time, mostly because they were in the dark about how the platform works. If enabled, those parental control tools, including one that prohibits a minor from receiving a friend request or a direct message from someone they don’t know, likely could have prevented many of these incidents. Some parents also expressed frustration with how Discord responded to their incidents once they were reported and struggled with the fact that audio chats on Discord don’t leave a written record and can prove to be more difficult to moderate.\n\nData on the frequency of such incidents is hard to come by. One recent report from Bark, a paid monitoring service that screens more than 30 apps and platforms, including emails and personal messages, for terms and phrases that could indicate concerns for the nearly 6 million children it protects, said Discord ranked among the top five apps or platforms for content flagged by its algorithms for severe violence, bullying, sexual content and suicidal ideation.\n\nIn its most recent transparency report, Discord said it removed more than 470,000 non-spam accounts between January and June 2021, a significant rise from 266,075 account deletions during the second half of 2020. “Exploitative content made a particularly large contribution to this overall rise,” said the report, which describes it as an umbrella category which encompasses sexually explicit material. The category went from around 130,000 removals in the second half of 2020 to 238,000 in the first half of 2021, and the removal of exploitative content servers – which Discord defines as non-consensual pornography and sexual content related to minors – nearly doubled to more than 11,000.\n\nHowever, Discord told CNN Business that child sexual abuse material and grooming — a term that refers to an adult forging an emotional connection with a minor so they can manipulate, abuse or exploit them — makes up a small percentage of activity on the service.\n\nIn response to questions about the incidents parents shared with CNN Business, John Redgrave, the company’s VP of trust and safety, said “this behavior is appalling, unacceptable, and has no place on Discord.”\n\n“It’s our highest priority for our communities to have a safe experience on the service, which is why we continuously invest in new tools to protect teens and remove harmful content from the service, and have built a team dedicated to this work,” Redgrave said in a statement. “We also invest in education, so that parents know how our service works and understand the account controls that can contribute to a positive, safe experience for their teens.”\n\nRedgrave added: “We built Discord to foster a sense of belonging and community, and it’s deeply concerning to our whole company when it is misused. We must and will do better.”\n\nBut some experts argue the concerns that parents raised with Discord are innate to its design model.\n\n“With Discord, you subscribe to channels and engage in private chat, which is a veil of privacy and secrecy in the way it is constructed,” said Danielle Citron, a law professor at University of Virginia who focuses on digital privacy issues. While some larger social networks have faced scrutiny around harassment and other issues, much of that activity is “public facing,” she said. “Discord is newer to the party and so much of it is happening behind closed doors.”\n\nA gaming tool goes mainstream\n\nDiscord started with aspirations to become a game developer studio called Hammer & Chisel but shifted to focus on its communication tool after a multiplayer game it created never caught on. Its use of voice-over-video and screen sharing was a draw for gamers, allowing them to interact with friends or others while playing video games. In June 2020, the company announced a rebranding effort to grow beyond gaming; now about 80% of active Discord users report they either use the service mainly for non-gaming purposes, or use it equally for gaming and other purposes, according to the company.\n\nThe company, which employs 600 people globally, said it makes its money through a subscription service called Nitro, which provides an enhanced Discord experience, such as customizing profiles with unique tags, accessing animated emojis, uploading large files and “boosting” users’ favorite servers. In September 2021, Discord announced it raised $500 million in a funding round, placing its valuation at around $15 billion. Earlier in the year, the Wall Street Journal reported it walked away from a deal to be acquired by Microsoft for at least $10 billion. The company is widely expected to be moving toward a potential initial public offering.\n\nLike other social platforms, Discord said it saw a jump in usage as people were stuck at home during the pandemic, going from 56 million monthly active users in 2019 to 150 million in September 2021. Like other platforms, it has also had to confront extreme content, including from far right and conspiracy groups. And while users must be 13 years of age or older to join, problems exist with age verification, just as on other platforms.\n\nAmanda Schneider said an older man pursued an inappropriate relationship with her 13-year-old son on Discord. \"It was just awful; there was no help at all.\" Courtesy Amanda Schneider\n\nSimilar to Reddit, there are moderators for channels who are responsible for enforcing the company’s community guidelines and their own chat room rules. They are directly able to investigate a situation and then warn, quarantine, or ban users from channels. Discord also has an in-house Trust & Safety team of full-time employees who investigate and respond to user reports. According to Discord, they can rely on a mix of proactive and reactive ways to keep the platform safe, including automated search tools that scan photos and videos for exploitative content.\n\nThe company said it’s made an increased effort around boosting its safety protocols across its platform in the last year, working to scale reactive operations and improve methods to proactively detect and remove abuse. It continues to roll out more account controls through its Safety Center, which includes the ability to block offensive users, restrict explicit content, control who messages you and set up server rules and permissions within communities. It has also partnered with ConnectSafely, a nonprofit dedicated to internet safety, to create a parent’s guide to Discord of recommended safety settings for teens, and is hosting “listening sessions” with National Parent Teacher Association chapters to increase awareness and usage of Discord’s safety features and practices.\n\nDiscord said parents can request that their child’s account be deleted by sending an email associated with the account to confirm they are the child’s guardian. This process may require some back and forth with the Trust & Safety team to help the parent through the process, according to the company.\n\nDiscord also said it plans to turn off the default option for minors to receive friend invitations or private messages from anyone in the same server as part of a future safety update.\n\nThe company recently updated its terms of service and privacy policy to take into account the off-platform behaviors committed by its users to assess violations of its community guidelines, including for sexualizing children. (Other large platforms, including Twitter and Twitch, began taking into account a user’s activity off their platforms several years ago, such as being affiliated with a violent organization, as part of their efforts to crack down on abusive behavior.)\n\nBut problems persist. Many of the parents CNN spoke with said they believe Discord is not doing enough to protect its young users.\n\n‘There was no help at all’\n\nOne mother from Los Angeles who submitted a report to Discord said the company was unable to help her after a man struck up a conversation with her 10-year-old daughter who started sending her links to BDSM pornography. (Discord requires users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with other social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.)

We understand this may be uncomfortable but, if possible, please send us the message links to the reported content for the team to review and take appropriate action.”\n\nAfter the mother sent Discord the requested links more than a year ago, the company never responded. Although the company told CNN Business it does not comment on specific reported cases, it said it reviews all reports of inappropriate content with a minor, investigates the behavior and takes appropriate action.\n\nRich Wistocki teaching people about social media safety practices. As with other social platforms, parents with kids on Discord should abide by age restrictions and enable parental controls, he said. Courtesy Rich Wistocki\n\nAmanda Schneider, who lives outside Phoenix, said she was also disappointed with how the platform handled her concerns when she said a man in his late 20s pursued an inappropriate relationship with her 13-year-old son, asking the teenager to masturbate and tell him about it afterward.\n\n“Discord told me I couldn’t do anything unless I had specific links to the text thread that showed my son verifying his age — such as typing ‘I am 13,’ which was shared through a voice [chat] — and the other person verifying his age before an incident happened,” said Schneider.\n\n“It was just awful; there was no help at all,” she said. After she reported the incident to law enforcement, she learned he was a registered sex offender and had been arrested, according to Schneider.\n\nThe company told CNN Business the reason it requires links to the chat and cannot use screenshots or attachments to verify content is to prevent users from potentially falsifying information to get others in trouble. It added that parents have the ability to use its report form to flag specific users to the Trust & Safety team.\n\nAccording to Citron, the law professor at the University of Virginia, voice-to-voice chats on Discord make reporting even harder for parents. “Unlike text conversations, predators thrive in the voice space because there isn’t a record,” she said. “When a parent goes to report that a kid has been engaging with someone [inappropriately] or that they’re being groomed by a sexual predator, there’s often no proof [because audio isn’t saved].”\n\nDiscord said its rules and standards around audio are the same as its text and image policies. But it told CNN Business that like other platforms, audio presents a different set of challenges for moderation than text-based communication. Discord said it does not store or record voice chats, but its team investigates reports of misuse and looks at information from text-based channels as part of that process.\n\nWhat parents can do\n\nSome parents like Stephane Cotichini, a professional video game developer, believe Discord can be a positive platform for young users if the right parental controls are in place. His teenage sons who use the site for gaming have a handful of Discord’s features enabled, such as restricting direct messages to only friends.\n\n“I know Discord can be problematic, but it’s important for me as a parent to not simply prohibit these things because of the dangers but teach my kids about how to navigate them and balance limiting it,” he said. “To my knowledge, I’ve never had an issue with any of my boys.”\n\nCotichini, who uses Discord to chat with his own team at work, said the platform is a valuable place for other gamers to drop into his servers and weigh in on what they’re developing in real time. He also attributes the platform to encouraging his sons’ love of gaming; two have already made their own programs, including one who won an award at the XPrize Connect Code Games Challenge in 2021.\n\nThe Discord app as seen on an iPhone Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\n“If at a young age I can get them to spend a percentage of their time creating content as opposed to consuming, I feel like I’m somehow succeeding,” he said.\n\nAs with other social platforms, parents with kids on Discord should abide by age restrictions and enable parental controls, said Rich Wistocki, a former detective in Illinois who now runs Be Sure Cyber training to help parents, school administrators and law enforcement learn more about the dangers of social media. In the event of an incident, he said parents should take screenshots of the chat, pictures, video, user ID and save links to the text in the channel when reporting it.\n\n“Parents often don’t think these things will happen to their kids,” he said. “More can be done to prevent these incidents from continuing.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/15/tech/tiktok-teens-study-trnd/index.html", "title": "TikTok may push potentially harmful content to teens within minutes ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTikTok may surface potentially harmful content related to suicide and eating disorders to teenagers within minutes of them creating an account, a new study suggests, likely adding to growing scrutiny of the app’s impact on its youngest users.\n\nIn a report published Wednesday, the non-profit Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that it can take less than three minutes after signing up for a TikTok account to see content related to suicide and about five more minutes to find a community promoting eating disorder content.\n\nThe researchers said they set up eight new accounts in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia at TikTok’s minimum user age of 13. These accounts briefly paused on and liked content about body image and mental health. The CCDH said the app recommended videos about body image and mental health about every 39 seconds within a 30-minute period.\n\nThe report comes as state and federal lawmakers seek ways to crack down on TikTok over privacy and security concerns, as well as determining whether the app is appropriate for teens. It also comes more than a year after executives from social media platforms, TikTok included, faced tough questions from lawmakers during a series of congressional hearings over how their platforms can direct younger users – particularly teenage girls – to harmful content, damaging their mental health and body image.\n\nAfter those hearings, which followed disclosures from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen about Instagram’s impact on teens, the companies vowed to change. But the latest findings from the CCDH suggest more work may still need to be done.\n\n“The results are every parent’s nightmare: young people’s feeds are bombarded with harmful, harrowing content that can have a significant cumulative impact on their understanding of the world around them, and their physical and mental health,” Imran Ahmed, CEO of the CCDH, said in the report.\n\nA TikTok spokesperson pushed back on the study, saying it is an inaccurate depiction of the viewing experience on the platform for varying reasons, including the small sample size, the limited 30-minute window for testing, and the way the accounts scrolled past a series of unrelated topics to look for other content.\n\n“This activity and resulting experience does not reflect genuine behavior or viewing experiences of real people,” the TikTok spokesperson told CNN. “We regularly consult with health experts, remove violations of our policies, and provide access to supportive resources for anyone in need. We’re mindful that triggering content is unique to each individual and remain focused on fostering a safe and comfortable space for everyone, including people who choose to share their recovery journeys or educate others on these important topics.”\n\nThe spokesperson said the CCDH does not distinguish between positive and negative videos on given topics, adding that people often share empowering stories about eating disorder recovery.\n\nTikTok said it continues to roll out new safeguards for its users, including ways to filter out mature or “potentially problematic” videos. In July, it added a “maturity score” to videos detected as potentially containing mature or complex themes as well as a feature to help people decide how much time they want to spend on TikTok videos, set regular screen time breaks, and provide a dashboard that details the number of times they opened the app. TikTok also offers a handful of parental controls.\n\nThis isn’t the first time social media algorithms have been tested. In October 2021, US Sen. Richard Blumenthal’s staff registered an Instagram account as a 13-year-old girl and proceeded to follow some dieting and pro-eating disorder accounts (the latter of which are supposed to be banned by Instagram). Instagram’s algorithm soon began almost exclusively recommending the young teenage account should follow more and more extreme dieting accounts, the senator told CNN at the time.\n\n(After CNN sent a sample from this list of five accounts to Instagram for comment, the company removed them, saying they all broke Instagram’s policies against encouraging eating disorders.)\n\nTikTok said it does not allow content depicting, promoting, normalizing, or glorifying activities that could lead to suicide or self-harm. Of the videos removed for violating its policies on suicide and self-harm content from April to June of this year, 93.4% were removed at zero views, 91.5% were removed within 24 hours of being posted and 97.1% were removed before any reports, according to the company.\n\nThe spokesperson told CNN when someone searches for banned words or phrases such as #selfharm, they will not see any results and will instead be redirected to local support resources.\n\nStill, the CCDH says more needs to be done to restrict specific content on TikTok and bolster protections for young users.\n\n“This report underscores the urgent need for reform of online spaces,” said the CCDH’s Ahmed. “Without oversight, TikTok’s opaque platform will continue to profit by serving its users – children as young as 13, remember – increasingly intense and distressing content without checks, resources or support.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/04/10/why-jcps-in-kentucky-is-suing-instagram-youtube-other-social-media/70085118007/", "title": "JCPS vs corporate America: Why Kentucky's largest district is suing ...", "text": "For the third time since 2019, Kentucky's largest school district has filed a lawsuit against big business in an attempt to be compensated for harm allegedly caused to students.\n\nIn the latest suit, Jefferson County Public Schools is suing companies connected to YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook, for intentionally leading \"to the mental health crisis among America’s youth,\" the suit states.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/tech/elon-musk-twitter-verification-plans/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk wants Twitter users to pay to be verified. It could create a ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nIn 2009, after Twitter was sued by then-St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa for being impersonated on the platform, the young company introduced a new feature: a blue and white check mark.\n\nThe check indicated that Twitter had verified the accounts of artists, athletes, government officials and agencies and other public figures. The option, which kicked off with plans to verify the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was presented as protection for individuals at risk of having their accounts fraudulently imitated and as a benefit to all users — a means of letting people know they could trust information being shared by prominent figures.\n\nIt soon became one of the platform’s signature features, copied by rivals like Facebook, and created a new kind of cultural cachet for those who received it. Now Twitter’s new owner, Elon Musk, is looking to overhaul the way verification works, with the potential not only to change who gets a coveted blue check mark, but also to create new headaches for users in spotting fake and fraudulent activity on the platform.\n\nMusk confirmed this week he’s working to launch an updated version of the company’s Twitter Blue subscription service in which any user can pay $8 per month to get or remain verified. The world’s richest man has also used populist language, framing the move as a way to break “Twitter’s current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark.”\n\nIf users buy in, the plan could be a new revenue driver for Twitter, something Musk needs following his $44 billion acquisition of the company, which was partly funded with debt. He has also suggested that verifying more actual, human users could help address the prevalence of fake and spam accounts that he purported to be concerned about during his months-long effort to get out of the acquisition deal.\n\nThe logic appears to go something like this: By requiring users to pay for verification, using a bank account or credit card, it would create a higher barrier to entry for inauthentic accounts. Musk said in a tweet Wednesday that if accounts verified under his new system engage in “spam/scam/impersonation, they’ll be suspended, but Twitter will keep their money!” And he said he would create a separate tag that would show up under the name of public figures, similar to how Twitter already identifies government officials and representatives of state media organizations.\n\nBut the move could disincentivize certain prominent accounts from being verified, making it harder for users to determine which are authentic. And it’s not clear that it will prevent inauthentic and bot activity either.\n\n“In fact, this is making Twitter a pay-for-play system, and we know that propagandists, people working to spread disinformation and other forms of manipulation via Twitter, are very much willing and able to finance their operations,” said Samuel Woolley, assistant professor at the University of Texas’ School of Information and author of the book “Bots.”\n\n“Most of the propagandists that social media companies are most worried about, like the Russian government, the Chinese government, extremist groups, have a lot of resources,” he said.\n\nCurrently, Woolley said, to get past the Twitter verification requirement that users link a cell phone number to their account, bad actors will “buy thousands of smartphones and put them on racks … and that’s a much more costly endeavor than paying an $8 verification fee.” In theory, a person could also pay to verify an account and then allow a computer to run it, thus effectively creating an automated (or “bot”) verified account.\n\nThere may be other complicating factors. Users might have concerns about handing over their bank or credit card information to a company that allegedly has major security vulnerabilities, according to a company whistleblower complaint from just months ago. In many parts of the world, people don’t readily have access to banking services. And many regular Twitter users who aren’t worried about being impersonated and don’t care about Twitter “clout” may also simply not care to shell out for a blue check.\n\nIt’s also not clear what would stop someone from creating and paying to verify an account fraudulently impersonating someone else, thus undermining the original purpose of the feature. It’s not hard to imagine someone paying to verify themselves as a customer support agent for a particular company and then using the credibility that comes from having a blue check mark to scam unsuspecting customers.\n\nTwitter did not immediately respond to questions about the plan, including how it would prevent such imitation.\n\nMusk has said his goal in buying Twitter is to bolster “free speech,” but some worry that the new subscription option could create a two-tiered speech system, based on who can and can’t afford to pay. With the new plan, for example, subscribers would get priority in replies, mentions and search, as well as the ability to post longer video and audio content while getting half as many ads as free users, according to Musk.\n\n“You’re really saying that the free speech of people who pay is more important than the free speech of people who can’t,” said Jessica González, co-CEO of media accountability Free Press, who was part of a group of civil society leaders who met with Musk earlier this week to discuss content moderation and a recent surge of hateful rhetoric on the platform. “I actually told him … that I think that $8 a month is highly problematic.”\n\nThe proposed subscription update has been panned by several high-profile Twitter users, including author Stephen King and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. “Lmao at a billionaire earnestly trying to sell people on the idea that ‘free speech’ is actually a $8/mo subscription plan,” Ocasio Cortez said in a tweet Wednesday.\n\nMusk on Wednesday hit back at critics of the plan, saying in a tweet: “To all the complainers, please continue complaining, but it will cost $8.”\n\n–CNN’s Jennifer Korn contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/politics/florida-red-flag-law/index.html", "title": "Florida's red flag law, championed by Republicans, is taking guns ...", "text": "Tampa, Florida CNN —\n\nTwice a week from her courtroom, Florida 13th Circuit Court Judge Denise Pomponio decides who in Hillsborough County can no longer be trusted with a gun.\n\nIn just the last two months, she has taken away the firearm privileges of dozens of people, including a dad accused of threatening to “shoot everyone” at his son’s school, a woman who police say attempted suicide and then accidentally shot her boyfriend during a struggle for her revolver, a husband who allegedly fired multiple rounds in the street to “blow off steam” after losing a family member, a bullied 13-year-old witnesses overheard saying, “If all of 8th grade is missing tomorrow you will know why,” and a mother arrested for brandishing a handgun at another mom after a school bus incident between their daughters.\n\nThis is Florida’s “red flag” law in action. Passed in the wake of the horrific 2018 mass shooting at a Parkland high school, the state law provides police a path to ask a judge to temporarily bar dangerous individuals from possessing or purchasing a firearm. Since its creation, Florida judges have acted more than 8,000 times to keep guns out of the hands of people authorities deemed a risk to themselves or others, according to data maintained by the Office of the State Courts Administrator.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pomponio added another one to the list: A man accused of pointing two guns at his stepfather.\n\n“He was enjoying the whole thing,” the stepfather told the courtroom. His stepson’s wife even filmed the encounter, he said. “He said he wanted to eff me up.” One of the guns was later found in the bed of the stepson’s 11-year-old brother, a sheriff’s deputy told the courtroom.\n\nIn the aftermath of recent massacres in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, those looking to change the country’s gun laws see in Florida a blueprint to move forward – not only because leaders moved to restrict firearms, but because it emerged out of a Republican stronghold unofficially known as the “Gunshine State.”\n\n“The Florida law is a good law, and it’s a signal of what’s possible,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, one of the most vocal advocates in Congress for gun control, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\nIn Florida, a red flag policy, also known as risk protection orders, was one piece of a sprawling gun reform package that then-Gov. Rick Scott signed into law just three weeks after a teenage gunman killed 17 people inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It included $400 million in new spending for priorities like school security and mental health resources, and allowed trained school staff to carry firearms for the first time. Republican lawmakers also agreed to raise the age to own a gun to 21 and implemented a three-day waiting period to purchase most rifles.\n\n“I knew the time for thoughts and prayers, although necessary, was not enough,” said Bill Galvano, a Republican and the former state senator who sponsored the legislation.\n\nGalvano told CNN he began drafting the bill at his kitchen table after a tour of the carnage in Parkland. He incorporated ideas he had picked up from interviewing teachers and staff at the school. He was intent on including some gun safety reforms and focused on what he thought could pass. He was still learning how red flag laws worked when it was added to the draft.\n\nLooking at the data on the people who had guns taken away in Florida, Galvano says, “You have to believe that makes a difference.”\n\nResearch suggests red flags have made a difference where they’ve been implemented. One analysis of Connecticut’s red flag law, in place since 1999, found that for every 10 to 20 guns removed by a risk protection order led to one averted suicide. Another study found intimate partner homicides dropped in states where authorities can prohibit people convicted of “nonspecific violent misdemeanors” from possessing firearms.\n\nThe National Rifle Association and its Florida lobbyist, Marion Hammer, fiercely opposed the 2018 gun safety legislation. The organization’s influential scorecards loomed over the head of most Republican lawmakers. Hammer, a towering figure in Florida politics for decades, called GOP supporters “turncoat Republicans” and the organization urged its members to pressure lawmakers into abandoning the legislation. Galvano acknowledged that some of his colleagues were concerned the NRA would mount primary challenges against them in the coming elections.\n\nFormer state Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat who attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas, recounted the headwinds they faced with Republicans in power and the NRA throwing arounds its weight.\n\n“Yet, we rolled the NRA,” Moskowitz said, adding: “Not one Republican who voted for that bill in Florida has paid a political price for protecting kids and doing the right thing.”\n\nThe NRA responded by docking the scorecards of anyone who voted for the bill, and it knocked Scott from an A+ to a C. The organization also filed a lawsuit against the state over the new legislation. The case remains in court under appeal.\n\nHammer did not respond to an email for comment.\n\nStill, the law has survived as the legislature has grown more conservative and through the first term of Gov. Ron DeSantis. As a candidate in 2018, DeSantis said he opposed the gun restrictions in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public Safety Act, telling one Florida newspaper he would have vetoed it.\n\nDeSantis has not publicly commented on the shooting in Uvalde and his office did not respond when asked if the governor supports Florida’s red flag law. He recently promised Florida would join other states that no longer require training or a permit to carry a firearm in public, like Texas.\n\nRepublicans lukewarm\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell previously told CNN he has encouraged Texas Sen. John Cornyn to work with Murphy on a middle-ground solution in response to the massacre inside the Uvalde elementary school.\n\nHowever, support for adopting risk protection orders like Florida’s appeared tepid as senators headed into the Memorial Day recess.\n\nEven Scott, who once called Florida’s response to the Parkland massacre “an example to the entire country that government can and must move fast,” now seems uncertain about a national risk protection policy. Scott, elected in 2018 to the US Senate, told The Washington Post: “It ought to be done at the state level.”\n\nMeanwhile, opponents of red flag laws have grown increasingly vocal as gun reform advocates hone in on the proposal.\n\n“What you’re essentially trying to do with the red flag law is enforce the law before the law has been broken. And it’s a really difficult thing to do, it’s difficult to assess whether somebody is a threat,” said Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Republican from Texas. “Now if they are such a threat that they’re threatening somebody with a weapon already, well, then they’ve already broken the law. So why do you need this other law?”\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd defended Florida’s red flag law against Crenshaw’s characterization. Polk is a conservative county between Tampa and Orlando that former President Donald Trump won in 2020 by 14 points, and it is also the county that has issued more risk protection orders than any other in the state.\n\n“Let me tell Rep. Crenshaw, if that were so, then Florida, which is dominated by conservatives, the Republicans wouldn’t have passed (risk protection orders),” Judd said.\n\nJudd – who simultaneously describes himself as a law-and-order sheriff and a “Second Amendment guy” – defined a risk protection order as a “cooling off period” for people who have displayed dangerous behaviors. Some are experiencing a mental health episode or expressed a desire to hurt themselves. Others have made threats that may not rise to an arrest, or they are charged with a crime that won’t result in a loss of gun charges. The risk protection orders, he said, allows law enforcement to focus on prevention instead of reacting to an active shooter when “it’s too late.”\n\nIn a Polk courtroom last week, a young woman described her boyfriend putting a loaded gun to his head in front of her and his mother. In another case, a prosecutor told the judge that a woman named Carol “threatened to burn down her house and shoot any responders that would get there.” In both instances, the judge took away their ability to have a firearm.\n\nDavid Carmichael, an attorney who represents local police departments in Polk County in these cases, says in his experience, about half of the people facing risk protection orders willingly give up their right to a weapon without having to go through a hearing.\n\n“They don’t have an objection,” he said. “They say, ‘I’m in a bad place. I fully understand it’s a good idea.’ I expected more people to aggressively defend themselves.”\n\nRisk protection orders\n\nIn Florida, orders last for one year, and can be extended for another 12 months. At the time of the shooting in Uvalde, there were 2,845 people under risk protection orders in Florida, according to the state Department of Law Enforcement.\n\nJudges may require someone to undergo a mental health or substance abuse treatment before the order is lifted. However, unless convicted of a felony, most people are likely to get their firearms returned after a year.\n\nTampa city attorney Michael Schmid described an individual under the influence of a drug who was acting strange in public and making people uncomfortable. Police confronted him and found guns in every part of his car. They later searched his home and found an arsenal of 100 guns “if not more,” Schmid said, with some hidden in stuffed animals and a cat scratch post. A sign in the house said, “If they ever come in my house, I’m not going easy.”\n\n“I hope he accomplished something during the cooling off period and having him evaluated helped,” Schmid said. “But at the end of the day, he will get his guns back.”\n\nAs it is, some activists don’t see red flag laws as going far enough to curb gun violence. Many Democrats unsuccessfully pushed for the 2018 legislation to include a ban on the AR-15, the weapon used in the vast majority of mass shootings, and other semiautomatic long guns.\n\nIn a news conference with Florida Democrats in response to the Uvalde tragedy, state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith of Orlando noted some states allow loved ones and family members to petition the courts for a risk protection order. Those are the people “who know the person best,” he said. Florida limits petitions to law enforcement.\n\n“That’s why it’s important in Florida that we expand on the good move we made in enacting the red flag law in the first place, to make sure we can continue to prevent these instances of gun violence,” Smith said.\n\nMoskowitz, now running to represent Parkland in the US House of Representatives, said moving the ball 20 yards is still a victory. “And you come back and you move the ball another 20 yards.”\n\nGalvano said Florida was able to act because the legislation “had aspects that both parties wanted and liked and aspects that both parties did not support.”\n\n“Look at the politics and understand we are a conservative state,” Galvano said. “We’re red by all accounts. And we were still able to make some reforms that were not traditional.”\n\n‘It doesn’t have to be highly effective to have an effect’\n\nTony Montalto’s daughter Gina was killed inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018. Within days of the massacre, he and other Parkland parents became a unified force in pressuring Florida lawmakers to take meaningful action.\n\nMontalto, as president of Stand with Parkland, has spent the last four years urging more states to follow Florida’s lead in hopes no parents would have to experience his pain. There are 19 states plus the District of Columbia with red flag laws, and 14 were passed after Parkland.\n\nIt’s a legacy that makes Montalto proud, but makes it all the more difficult to watch a similar tragedy unfold in Texas.\n\n“They would’ve been a lot safer had they taken advantage of simple things, such as red flags that we passed in Florida. This is simple stuff that keeps the majority of people safe,” Montalto said. “We heard extremists say this was a gun grab and all these bad things would happen. But the sky has not fallen. People still own guns. People still hunt. People still protect themselves. And yet, thousands of people in Florida have had their guns taken away to protect the majority of people.”\n\n“We had President Trump support red flag laws. We’ve seen President Biden support red flag laws. How come Congress has not acted?”\n\nShannon Frattaroli, a professor in the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, is reviewing risk protection cases in six states, including Florida. Her research has found hundreds of examples of police using red flag laws to remove weapons from people who have threatened mass violence.\n\n“If even 1% of the orders that are issued in response to a threat of mass violence makes a difference, that’s pretty powerful,” Frattaroli said. “It doesn’t have to be highly effective to have an effect.”", "authors": ["Steve Contorno Leyla Santiago Denise Royal", "Steve Contorno", "Leyla Santiago", "Denise Royal"], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/tech/tiktok-young-attorney-general-investigation/index.html", "title": "Group of attorneys general announce investigation into TikTok's ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nA nationwide group of state attorneys general announced an investigation into TikTok’s impact on young Americans Tuesday, adding to the steady drumbeat of political pressure being applied to social media platforms.\n\nThe probe zeroes in on TikTok’s user engagement techniques and alleged risks that the platform may pose to the mental health of children, according to announcements by the states.\n\nInvestigators are probing the company to determine whether any of its practices may run afoul of state consumer protection laws.\n\nIn a statement, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong cited “reckless viral challenges” on TikTok as a major source of concern. He added that while TikTok has made some moves to limit harms to children, “our investigation will look at what TikTok knew about the risks to our children, and precisely what they have been doing to keep our kids online.”\n\nThe list of participating states includes California, Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, Tennessee and Vermont.\n\n“Like many parents and caregivers, I continue to be concerned about the negative impact of social media on children and young adults,” said Vermont Attorney General TJ Donovan in a statement. “This investigation is about protecting kids and supporting parents.

Also on Tuesday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered state agencies to ban TikTok use on government-issued devices, citing the threat of “gaining access to critical U.S. information and infrastructure,” following the lead of several other states, including South Dakota and Maryland.\n\nTikTok does not comment on pending litigation, but said, “the safety, privacy and security of our community is our top priority,” according to a statement from a company spokesperson.\n\n“We build youth well-being into our policies, limit features by age, empower parents with tools and resources, and continue to invest in new ways to enjoy content based on age-appropriateness or family comfort,” the spokesperson said. “We are also confident that we’re on a path in our negotiations with the U.S. Government to fully satisfy all reasonable U.S. national security concerns, and we have already made significant strides toward implementing those solutions.”\n\nThe first lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday, alleges that TikTok lures children onto the platform by falsely claiming it is friendly for users between 13 to 17 years old.\n\nAmerican teens spend an average of 99 minutes per day on the app, the lawsuit claims, and in that time they’re exposed to content that can contain drug and alcohol use, nudity and intense profanity.\n\nThe suit claims this exposure can negatively influence the behaviors of minors.\n\nA second lawsuit, filed on Wednesday, alleges that TikTok has “reams” of highly sensitive data and personal information about consumers in Indiana and that the company “has deceived those consumers to believe that this information is protected from the Chinese government and Communist Party,” the media release said.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that TikTok’s European privacy policy has been updated “to clearly state that it permits individuals outside of Europe, including China, to access European user data,” while the company has “made no such update to its U.S privacy policy, which applies to Indiana consumers, explicitly informing them that their data is accessed by individuals and entities in China.”\n\nIn both suits, monetary civil penalties against TikTok, along with injunctive relief are being sought.\n\nTikTok has for years grappled with bipartisan concerns in Washington about the possibility that US user data could find its way to the Chinese government and be used to undermine US interests, thanks to a national security law in that country that compels companies located there to cooperate with data requests. And there has been renewed criticism of TikTok this year, stemming from a Buzzfeed News report in June that said some US user data has been repeatedly accessed from China. The reporting cited leaked audio recordings of dozens of internal TikTok meetings, including one where a TikTok employee allegedly said, “Everything is seen in China.”\n\nIn a response to the report, TikTok previously said it “has consistently maintained that our engineers in locations outside of the US, including China, can be granted access to US user data on an as-needed basis under those strict controls.” The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a multi-agency government body charged with reviewing business deals involving foreign ownership, has spent months negotiating with TikTok on a proposal to resolve concerns that Chinese government authorities could seek to gain access to the data TikTok holds on US citizens.\n\nA TikTok executive testified before a Senate panel earlier this year that it doesn’t share information with the Chinese government and that a US-based security team decides who can access US user data from China, but stopped short of committing to cut off flows of US user data to China.\n\nThe popular video-based app has also faced questions about the safety of young users after rocketing to popularity during the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year, TikTok’s Head of Public Policy Michael Beckerman joined executives from Snap and YouTube in a Senate hearing about children’s safety, during which he said TikTok is working to “keep its platform safe and create age appropriate experiences” but added “we do know trust must be earned.”\n\nAnd earlier this year, a group of state attorneys general announced an investigation into TikTok’s impact on young Americans focused on the app’s user engagement techniques and alleged risks that the platform may pose to the mental health of children. (At the time, TikTok said that it limits its features by age, provides tools and resources to parents, and designs its policies with the well-being of young people in mind.)", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/02/27/westport-schools-in-class-action-lawsuit-against-apps-youtube-tiktok/69932426007/", "title": "Westport schools in class action lawsuit against apps YouTube, TikTok", "text": "WESTPORT — Westport Community Schools are now part of a national mass action suit against a number of social media companies whose platforms are popular among school-age children, including TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube, alleging these services have contributed to a \"youth mental health crisis.\"\n\nThe School Committee voted unanimously to join the suit, being filed by San Diego-based Frantz Law Group, at their February meeting earlier this month.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the companies behind Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube \"are substantially contributing to the mental health crisis America's youth are facing,\" according to a memo from the law firm, which lists increased rates of depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, eating disorders and suicide in as some of the results of youth use, or overuse, of the platforms.\n\n\"The harms allegedly caused by these companies include, but are not limited to, intentionally designing, marketing, and operating their exploitive social media platforms to be extremely popular with youth users, despite research confirming the severe and wide-ranging effects of social media on youth mental health,\" the document reads.\n\n'Right thing to do':Framingham schools join national lawsuit against JUUL\n\nThe defendants and their online platforms named in the lawsuit are:\n\nMeta, Platforms, Inc. and subsidiaries (Facebook, Instagram)\n\nSnap Inc.

Interest resumed building in September on federal student loans that were covered under the unique pause that began three-and-a-half years ago and kept getting extended.\n\nLearn more: Best personal loans\n\nBorrowers didn't have to make any payments on their federal student loans that were covered under the pause, freeing up $300 or $400 a month in some cases. The pause temporarily froze most federal student debt with a 0% interest rate.\n\nFor many borrowers, the first payment is due in October. Exact payment dates vary. The Education Department has noted previously that borrowers were to get a bill, detailing their payment amount and due date, at least 21 days before their specific due date.\n\nSome told they owe more than they do\n\nIn recent weeks, some people who logged into their individual student loan accounts, according to experts, spotted a payment amount that was higher than it should have been. And, as might be imagined, borrowers who faced questionably higher figures weren't too happy.\n\n\"Servicers are being held accountable and borrowers will not have payments due until these mistakes are fixed,\" according to the Education Department.\n\nBorrowers are to be notified by loan servicers of any errors that took place — such as indicating a payment due that's much higher than was quoted for a new SAVE plan. Loan servicers are to put the borrowers into \"administrative forbearance until their correct payment amount was calculated, so there would be as little impact as possible on borrowers,\" the Education Department said.\n\nBorrowers wise to double-check their statements\n\nThe department said its stringent oversight efforts contributed to quickly catching these errors.\n\nOn Sept. 29, a letter was sent to President Joe Biden and Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, signed by attorneys general from 19 states, which raised concerns about receiving \"consumer complaints from borrowers struggling to get timely and accurate information from servicers.\"\n\nThe letter indicated that one borrower had complained of seeing a monthly bill jump to $444 from $293, following the automatic switch from an old REPAYE plan to the SAVE plan. Something was clearly wrong.\n\nOthers complained of seeing incorrect loan balances and interest rates.\n\nThe letter noted: \"We know from experience that servicing transfers create a high risk of servicing errors. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, borrowers regularly reported issues with servicer transfers, such as lost paperwork, incorrect records and delays in communication.\"\n\nGiven news of some of the bad billing numbers, it does not hurt to review your payment amount to make sure it is correct.\n\nMost issues have been resolved at this point, according to loan servicers, but borrowers are wise to double-check their bills against any information they received when they signed up for the SAVE plan or other income-driven repayment plans.\n\nThe Education Department said it is working closely with student loan servicers to \"ensure that they are providing borrowers the information they need and holding servicers accountable when they do not. \"\n\nIn many cases, the glitches involved incorrect calculations by federal student loan servicers for payment amounts under the SAVE plan — the new Saving on a Valuable Education Plan that promotes itself as an option for the lowest payments possible for many people on a federal income-driven repayment.\n\nFor some borrowers who have very limited incomes, the SAVE plan can get monthly payments down to $0 a month. The Education Department noted that some who received incorrect information qualify for $0 monthly payments under SAVE.\n\nNearly 5 million borrowers already are enrolled in the new SAVE plan, which will cut payments in half for many borrowers, according to the Education Department.\n\nSAVE plan switch triggered some mix-ups\n\nSome bad numbers rolled out, though, as accounts for a sizable number of borrowers were automatically converted into the new SAVE plan.\n\nThe plan replaces the old Revised Pay As You Earn or the REPAYE Plan, an income-driven repayment plan. Borrowers on the REPAYE Plan automatically are being put on the SAVE Plan and do not need to sign up.\n\nScott Buchanan, the executive director of Student Loan Servicing Alliance, an industry trade group, said technical issues arose involving data, as servicers tried to convert about 3 million borrowers from an old REPAYE plan into a new one and enroll others in that new payment plan.\n\nWhen automatically transitioning borrowers from the REPAYE to the SAVE Plan, the Education Department stated, one loan servicer, MOHELA, \"inadvertently used the 2022 — instead of 2023 — poverty guidelines tables to calculate payments.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s servicer oversight team identified this error and corrected it, according to the Education Department. As of last month, the Department \"notified affected borrowers about their correct payment amount, which will be lower than was initially communicated.\"\n\nMonthly payments under the SAVE plan are based on your discretionary income — the difference between your adjusted gross income and 225% of the poverty line for your family size, up from the 150% guideline used in other repayment plans. The objective is to protect a minimum amount of income to ensure that borrowers can cover basic necessities like food and housing costs.\n\nUsing the old poverty guideline would trigger higher monthly payments, even though those payments should be lower under the SAVE plan.\n\n\"There is a lot of finger-pointing going on,\" as to who deserves more of the blame, the U.S. Department of Education or loan servicers, said Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert.\n\nThe Education Department is blaming the loan servicers, Kantrowitz said, but perhaps the U.S. Department of Education is also partly to blame as they provided the loan servicers with inaccurate data for borrowers involved in income-driven repayment.\n\nIncorrect payment amounts were given for other income-driven repayment plans, too, not just the SAVE plan, according to Kantrowitz, who has heard from upset borrowers.\n\nSome errors can be blamed solely on the loan servicers, he said, \"such as using the wrong year's poverty lines and putting some borrowers into a different repayment plan than the one they were signed up for.\"\n\nSome borrowers deal with a new servicer\n\nAbout four out of 10 borrowers have a new student loan servicer and won't be dealing with the same servicer they had before the COVID-19 pandemic pause began in March 2020. And that's created some issues, as expected earlier, Kantrowitz said.\n\nThe new servicers, he said, received income, family size and tax filing status information from the U.S. Department of Education, but this information was incorrect for some borrowers.\n\nThe Education Department stated that its standard monitoring and review process uncovered some discrepancies in the calculations of payment amounts given by some servicers.\n\nRestarting student loan payments and launching a new, more affordable payment plan at the same time proved, as frankly, one would have expected, to overload the system.\n\nLoan servicers needed to restart the payment process after a hiatus of three-and-a-half years — which had never been done before.\n\nThe new SAVE plan was launched in late August by the Biden administration — dubbed the \"most affordable student loan repayment plan ever.\" Many borrowers had to sign up at StudentAid.gov/SAVE first to get lower monthly payments.\n\nIt was a short window to sign up, if you wanted a lower monthly payment at the restart in October. But there isn't a deadline for signing up for the SAVE plan, so many borrowers can still make the move if their payments aren't doable given their family size and income.\n\n\"So far, the challenges have been the system implementation of things,\" said Buchanan of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance.\n\nThe education department wanted to speed up the introduction of the SAVE plan, Buchanan said, which gave loan servicers a few months to start a program that might normally take eight months.\n\nFor most people, he said, such issues were corrected before they even got a billing statement.\n\nIf people think there is an error, he said, the borrowers can reach out to their servicer to validate if the payment information has been corrected.\n\nOf course, many borrowers are complaining that it's tough to get a servicer on the phone.\n\nDon't get tricked by a scammer\n\nWhat borrowers shouldn't do, though, is jump at an unsolicited email or text about their student loans from some outfit that promises to cut through the red tape or cut their monthly bill.\n\n\"Scammers often target distressed borrowers or people looking for help to manage their loans,\" according to a warning from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nBorrowers are encouraged to use self-service options at the websites for their loan servicers, such as updating their contact information, checking their loan balance, and applying for an income-driven repayment plan.\n\nIn addition, a previously announced on-ramp program is providing borrowers a transition into repayment where they will not be harmed if they miss a payment during the restart.\n\nAs a nod perhaps to the reality that there would be some glitches along the way, a temporary \"on-ramp\" to repayment was put in place to run from October through Sept. 30, 2024, to protect financially vulnerable borrowers who miss payments. No action will be taken then that could result in declaring a loan in default or otherwise hurt a borrower's credit.\n\nAs I reported earlier, some borrowers are seeing due dates in November, December and even January, particularly if they made some payments toward their federal student loans sometime during the pandemic.\n\nAs the payment pause ends, the restart date might reflect when your loan servicer last received a payment from you during the pandemic. In some cases, the last payment might be treated as an extra payment that has now pushed back your upcoming restart of payments.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

Since 2010, all federal student loans have been made under the direct loan program.\n\nIgnoring things for just a while longer isn't the smart thing to do here. The best bet: Research your options. Figure out how you'll make those payments. Or review federal income-driven repayment plans, like the new SAVE program, to help you cut those monthly payments for now.\n\nJust a year ago in August, borrowers had plenty of hope that they'd be eligible for a one-time forgiveness program that was being rolled out by President Joe Biden. Under that plan, individuals would have seen up to $10,000 in federal student loans — or up to $20,000 for those who had Pell Grants in college — simply go away.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nOn June 30, the U.S. Supreme Court put a stop to the president's plan. A 6-3 majority ruled that the Biden administration overstepped its power by attempting to forgive more than $400 billion in student loans left lingering during the pandemic.\n\nThe payment pause, which began in March 2020, temporarily froze most federal student debt with a 0% interest rate. After repeated extensions, the pause — which was initially only to last three months — remained in place through much of 2023.\n\nBy not having to make payments, many borrowers had access to more money in their budgets and, ultimately, in some cases an extra $14,000 or $15,000 over the entire stretch of the pause.\n\nIf you’re making very little money now, you want to figure out more affordable options, including possibly considering a new federal program called SAVE that’s designed to help borrowers reduce their payments to a more manageable level.\n\nWhat should student loan borrowers do now?\n\nTo prepare for repayment, update your contact information with your loan servicer and on StudentAid.gov to make certain that you'll get your bill and know when to make your payments.\n\nReview any emails you might have already received in late July or so from the Department of Education. The initial email can tell you who your servicer is at this point, as well as your servicer's website.\n\nThe email sent to college borrowers by the U.S. Department of Education referred to a Preparing for Payments to Resume page on that site for borrowers to review options and resources before October.\n\nBorrowers are going to get their bill, with their payment amount and due date, at least 21 days before the money must be paid. Start looking for those bills shortly after Labor Day.\n\nThe odds are good that your student loan servicer may have changed since the payment pause began more than three years ago. It's estimated that 44% of borrowers have a new student loan servicer since before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert who is the author of \"How to Appeal for More College Financial Aid.\"\n\nKantrowitz said it's important to update your contact information with StudentAid.gov to get all the notices and alerts that will be sent in the weeks ahead. The law, he said, requires six notices be sent in the 60 days prior to the restart of repayment.\n\nAccording to the Education Department, the monthly bill that you receive in September will contain your payment amount. But it's also possible that you'll receive a communication called a “disclosure” from your servicer in August that will give you a number for what you'll owe each month.\n\nMore:US Supreme Court blocks student loan debt forgiveness: What happens now\n\nMore:What do interest rate hikes mean for student loans?\n\nTo get current loan balances, go to the Federal Student Aid website StudentAid.gov and enter your ID and password to see your balance, payment status, current loan servicer, and interest accrued on all of your federal student loans.\n\nSign up for autopay for student loan bills\n\nMany borrowers would be wise to have their student loan payments automatically paid each month out of their checking account directly to the loan servicer.\n\n\"Not only will this help you avoid the chaos and confusion surrounding the restart of repayment, but you'll get a 0.25% percentage point interest rate reduction as an incentive,\" Kantrowitz said.\n\nIf you were previously signed up for autopay, you'd likely need to reenroll after the long payment pause. You'd sign up for autopay on your servicer's website.\n\nIf you're using autopay, you'd want your bank account to have enough money in it to cover the bill by the due date.\n\nWhat if I can't afford to make monthly payments?\n\nA new Saving on a Valuable Education program began a soft launch July 31. The official launch is expected later in August.\n\nThe SAVE plan can help borrowers reduce their monthly payments, limit how much interest will build and ultimately reduce the amount that would be paid back over one's lifetime.\n\nWhat's being called the SAVE plan replaces the existing Revised Pay As You Earn or the REPAYE Plan. Borrowers on the REPAYE Plan will automatically be put on the SAVE Plan.\n\nMore than 1 million additional low-income borrowers will qualify for a $0 monthly payment under the SAVE plan, including 400,000 already enrolled on the REPAYE plan, according to the Education Department.\n\nOthers can qualify for relatively small monthly payments. For example, an estimated monthly payment could be $143 a month for someone without children who is making $50,000 a year.\n\nSomeone wouldn't need to make payments on federal student loans if they're signed up to be part of this plan and are a single borrower earning $32,800 or less, which is roughly $15 an hour for someone working full time.\n\nThe monthly payment would be $0 for a family of four earning $67,500 or less (threshold amounts are higher in Alaska and Hawaii). \"Borrowers earning more than these amounts will save at least $1,000 per year, compared to the current income-driven repayment plans,\" according to the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nUnder the SAVE plan, monthly payments for undergraduate loans essentially will be cut in half compared with earlier income-driven repayment plans. Borrowers have to pay just 5% of their discretionary income toward student loans, rather than 10%.\n\nIt's essential for you to make the payments that are required under this plan. If you make your monthly payment, the Education Department notes, your loan balance won’t keep growing due to unpaid interest. After making at least 10 years of payments, some borrowers could see their remaining debt canceled down the line.\n\n\"Borrowers with original principal balances of $12,000 or less will receive forgiveness of any remaining balance after making 10 years of payments,\" according to the Department of Education. The maximum repayment period before forgiveness rises by one year for every additional $1,000 borrowed. So it could take 12 years until you see loan forgiveness if your original principal balance was $14,000.\n\nYour monthly payment amount is based on your discretionary income. That's defined as the difference between your adjusted gross income and 225% of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guideline amount for your family size. The old threshold was 150%.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education noted online that it has begun a beta version to accept applications now to refine the process ahead of the official launch. See Studentaid.gov/idr for more information about signing up. A \"Loan Simulator\" at the site can help you select the right income-driven repayment plan.\n\nIf you're not making much money, an income-driven repayment plan can adjust your monthly payment to reflect your income and family size. Apply with the Education Department soon if you'd like a lower monthly payment before your first bill hits.\n\nIf you have private student loans, it's important to know that student loan lenders typically don't offer income-driven plans, but they might offer alternative repayment plans on a case-by-case basis.\n\nDon't wait until October to figure out what's next\n\nA lot likely happened in your life since 2020. Maybe, you bought a home, moved across country, started a family, took on a car loan to buy a new or used car, went into another field of work. And maybe you're dealing with a lot more debt as a result of some of those changes.\n\nSomeone who is burdened by student debt could very well face challenges making payments on credit card debt, personal loans and car payments as well, said Tayri Martinez-Orza, a quality assurance specialist at GreenPath Financial Wellness, a nationwide nonprofit financial counseling and education service based in Farmington Hills.\n\nAs borrowers are increasingly aware that their student loan payments will resume in October, she said, more are calling GreenPath for advice. Some callers want to know more about how to pick the right income-driven repayment plan; others want to review their options for dealing with their debt overall.\n\nGreenPath has seen a 55% increase in call volume since this same time last year, she said. All those calls don't deal with student loans; many are dealing with the burdens of high rate credit cards.\n\nThe average credit card rate has soared to 20.53%, up from 17.42% a year ago, following the Federal Reserve's rate hike on July 26, according to the latest data from Bankrate.com.\n\nThe average student loan balance was $55,254 among GreenPath clients who enrolled in a debt management plan in May. The median — the midpoint where half owed more and half owed less — was $32,874.\n\nMany college grads and borrowers who have college debt but no degree borrowed more money on credit cards, took out car loans and tapped into personal loans during the student loan payment pause that began at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNow, Martinez-Orza said, it's tougher to find a few hundred dollars or more a month in a budget to pay a student loan bill. Among GreenPath's clients in May who were dealing with debt, only 27% had extra of $100 or less each month. Another 26% didn't have any such surplus.\n\n\"Once that payment is due, that payment may not be feasible for a lot of people,\" she said. GreenPath offers free student loan counseling at 855-783-1410 to review repayment options and examine the pros and cons of various income-driven repayment plans.\n\nAbout 65% of student loan borrowers who took advantage of the payment pause said they have no idea how they're going to restart making those payments in the fall, according to an online survey done in May by Big Valley for Fidelity Investments. The survey involved 2,004 respondents.\n\nAccording to the survey, 67% of recent graduates with student loan debt said their student loan debt is preventing them from participating in major life milestones like saving for retirement, getting married or buying a home.\n\nOn a somewhat humorous level, the Fidelity \"College Savings & Student Debt Study\" noted that more than 4 in 10 surveyed would \"rather clean the communal dorm shower than have their credit card statement read out loud to their entire class.\"\n\nIn some cases, student loan borrowers used the payment pause as an opportunity to address other concerns.\n\n\"We estimate that the student debt payment pause immediately increased consumption, as borrowers used the new liquidity to increase borrowing on credit cards, mortgages, and auto loans rather than avoid delinquencies,\" according to a working paper published in the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nThe payment pause led to a sharp drop in federal student loan payments — even though borrowers could have continued to pay — and an increase in credit scores, according to the study conducted by researchers out of the University of Chicago.\n\nOutstanding student loan debt hit $1.57 trillion in the second quarter, according to The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Center for Microeconomic Data report issued in August. Mortgage balances hit $12.01 trillion, with auto loan balances coming in second at $1.58 trillion. Credit card debt ranked fourth at $1.03 billion.\n\nLess than 1% of aggregate student debt was 90-plus days delinquent or in default in the second quarter, according to the Fed data, which was a small decline from the previous quarter. Reported delinquencies remain at historic lows. The payment pause — and the fact that missed payments on federal student loans will not be reported to credit bureaus until the fourth quarter in 2024 — both benefited borrowers.\n\nYet, some concerns are growing, especially after credit card balances grew at a fast clip in the second quarter.\n\n\"About one-in-five student loan borrowers have risk factors that suggest they could struggle when scheduled payments resume,\" according to a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau blog published in June.\n\n\"Student loan borrowers who are already having difficulty with their other payment obligations are especially likely to struggle with their student loan payments if they don’t get some sort of payment relief like enrolling in an (income-drive repayment) plan,\" the blog noted.\n\nWho won't have to start paying on their student loans?\n\nNot everyone needs to worry come October. Borrowers who are still in school still won't have to start repayments. Borrowers who graduated in May or June won't have to make payments until November or December, when the six-month grace period for new graduates ends.\n\nAnd remember, not everyone was going to benefit from the federal student loan forgiveness package, as proposed last year. Borrowers would not have received loan forgiveness if their annual income during the pandemic was $125,000 or higher for individuals and $250,000 or higher for married couples.\n\nFor some borrowers, it's wise to check to see whether you qualify for any targeted loan forgiveness. More than 2 million borrowers have been granted forgiveness in the last two years due to public service employment, disability, or college wrongdoing, according to the Education Department's initial email to borrowers.\n\nSome legal challenges have cropped up regarding specific forgiveness plans, including one involving a plan to forgive some $39 billion in federal student loan debt for some 804,000 borrowers. This plan involved a one-time fix to correct previous errors involving those who made income-driven repayment plans for years. Some borrowers who signed up for those plans faced difficulty getting credit for all of the payments they have made. So some confusion continues.\n\nWatch out for quick-fix student loan scams\n\nStudent loan forgiveness scams are lurking in the wings — and could increase as we get closer to October.\n\nA Genesee County borrower made monthly payments to a scammer who claimed to be from a debt consolidation company. But not a dime went toward that actual loan, according to an alert by the Better Business Bureau Serving Eastern Michigan.\n\nThe student debt scam can start out with an email, letter, or phone call from someone claiming you are eligible for “student loan consolidation,” “payment reduction program,” or a similar service. Some scammers are even impersonating the Federal Student Aid department and claiming the new benefit allegedly is part of “the new 2023 guidelines.”\n\nThe scammer wants you to hand over your Social Security number, name, address and even your log-in information for StudentAid.gov. Don't do it.\n\nThe Department of Education or your student loan servicer will never ask for your FSA ID or password, according to an alert by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nA key tip from the CFPB: \"Scammers sometimes unlawfully get personal information about you from your credit report. So even if a company claims to know your student loan balance or other details about your loans, they still may not be legitimate.\"\n\nAvoid pitches with false promises. The Federal Student Aid site noted some of these false claims:\n\n\"You are now eligible to receive benefits from a recent law that has passed regarding federal student loans, including total forgiveness in some circumstances. Federal student loan programs may change. Please call within 30 days of receiving this notice.”\n\n“Your student loans may qualify for complete discharge. Enrollments are first come, first served.”\n\nIn another version of a student loan scam, you might be asked to make a small upfront payment to get the ball rolling on student loan forgiveness. But no real government student loan program requires an advance processing fee. You do not have to pay a fee — or hand over your credit card number — to get help with an income-driven repayment plan.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

The interest that comes with that debt will kick in again, too.\n\nFor many borrowers, that interest has been the obstacle to paying off their loans. Advocates say the return to payments, for which the Education Department is now preparing after the Supreme Court struck down President Joe Biden’s sweeping debt forgiveness plan, could be catastrophic financially.\n\nBut new legislation written by Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., and Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., aims to get rid of that interest for current borrowers while capping it based on a sliding scale for future borrowers. The bill, unveiled and shared exclusively Thursday with USA TODAY, also would devise a means of paying for the lost interest – one that wouldn't leave taxpayers covering those costs.\n\nNot just student loans: Interest overwhelms borrowers\n\nStudent loan payments, which have been on hold since the start of the pandemic, will be due starting in October.\n\nIt’s not just payments that have been on pause. The interest that comes with them, cut to 0% for more than 3 years, also will resume starting Sept. 1. For many borrowers, that looming expense is just as bad as – if not worse – than the principal owed.\n\nInterest rates on federal student loans are fixed based on the year borrowers take them out, but the interest is often added to the principal right away and accrues every day. While most borrowers generally don’t have to start paying down their loans until six months after they graduate, interest does add up if they go into forbearance.\n\nInterest also continues to accrue for borrowers on income-driven repayment plans even when their principal amounts are reduced. Often it's collected not just on the principal but on the administrative fees charged.\n\n“My government is making money off of me,” said Lisa Rapaszky, a grassroots organizer who recently earned her master’s degree and says she has more than $30,000 in student loan debt, in an Education Department hearing recently. The hearing was meant to gather feedback from members of the public as the department works with experts to change federal law and allow for widespread forgiveness.\n\nRapaszky, 50, emphasized that student loan interest reform would go a long way toward helping her pay off her loans, remain in her public service research field and save for retirement. Once payments resume, she said, her estimated accrued interest will cost nearly $5 a day. “It's just too much,” she said, noting her interest rate is 5.28%. “That is not a good interest rate – and in this case, it's coming from my government.”\n\nFederal student loan interest, which is typically fixed, is set at 5.5% for undergraduates this upcoming school year. For graduate students, it’s 7.05%.\n\nNew student loan forgiveness plan:5 key takeaways from the first day\n\nTrust fund approach\n\nThere have been a number of attempts to address the interest on student loans. One new repayment option from the Biden administration will cut borrowers’ payments from 10% of discretionary income to 5% and forgive balances after 10 years of payments – far less than other income-based plans. When it comes to interest, borrowers on this new so-called SAVE plan won’t be charged for unpaid monthly interest, so a borrower’s loan balance can’t grow as long as they are making payments, even if their payment is cut to $0 because they earn a low wage.\n\nOther legislation has been introduced to tackle interest, too. One bill introduced last month by Republicans in Congress would, among other prongs, cap interest for borrowers who are going through income-driven repayment. Another would forgive existing interest owed on federal student loans while setting the new rate to 0%.\n\nBut this, the bill’s sponsors say, would be the first bill to address the interest question as a whole – and to create a mechanism for covering the resulting costs. That mechanism: a trust fund that would be created with borrowers’ principal payments and then invested in various bonds.\n\nThis trust fund approach is “a very novel,” said Courtney, who co-sponsored the bill.\n\n“The beauty of this bill is that it gets rid of the added burden of borrowing, which in really bad instances can metastasize and increase people’s debt levels to even above their initial principal balance,” Courtney said. “And it does it in a way that does not add to the deficit and does not shift the burden to taxpayers.”\n\nThis is similar to how the Railroad Retirement Trust Fund works. That trust fund invests any revenue in excess of railroad workers' benefit payments in a mix of government securities and private equities. The Congressional Research Service projected the system will remain solvent for at least the next 25 years.\n\n“It shouldn’t be this expensive to get an education, and it shouldn’t be this hard to pay off your debt,” said Welch, who is also introducing the bill, in a statement. “We can – and should – keep pushing for debt forgiveness, but we also need to make college more affordable for future generations and avoid saddling students with additional debt from high interest rates.”\n\nA solution for future students?\n\nThe legislation would set the interest for current borrowers to 0%, clearing that obligation entirely.\n\nBut using the trust fund, it would also eliminate or reduce interest for future borrowers. Interest would be capped at a maximum of 4%, the rates set to a sliding scale depending on the borrower’s household income. Most borrowers wouldn’t have to pay any interest.\n\n(The idea behind the sliding scale is that students who have the means to cover some or all of the tuition don’t take advantage of the federal aid program and take out loans just to borrow at 0%.)\n\nThis “innovative solution of investing students’ principal repayments to earn a return is the first plan that addresses the cost of the student loan program,” said Bob Hildreth, president of the Hildreth Institute, in a statement. “It comes at a critical time as students must renew payments this fall without the benefit of cancellation.\"\n\nThe Hildreth Institute, a research and policy center focused on improving access to higher education, helped the lawmakers develop the legislation’s model.\n\nIt's getting closer:Prepare for the return of student loan payments to avoid struggling come October\n\nBipartisan appeal? No unfair burden on taxpayers\n\nIt also comes at a time when the public remains divided on the merits of broad forgiveness and of Biden’s latitude when it comes to providing it. Biden “is maxing out the executive branch authority that he has,” Courtney suggested.\n\nThe Hildreth Institute “is very sensitive to the political reality that if you don't have a pay-for, then you're basically asking other taxpayers who aren't participating in student loans or whose kids aren't participating in student loans to foot the bill for eliminating interest rates,” Courtney said.\n\nWhether the bill will gain any traction is hard to say. Similar proposals have languished amid fierce partisan fights over full-blown cancellation.\n\nBut “I think the fundamental attraction to this bill – whether you’re a Republican or Democrat or Independent – is that the government should not be making money on the student debt program,” Courtney said. And the way the parameters are set up now, Congress is the only entity with the authority to change that.\n\nContact Alia Wong at (202) 507-2256 or awong@usatoday.com.

The debt relief would help him pay off his loans by the time his children go to college.\n\n“I’d be in a position to help them in a way my parents weren’t able to help me,” he said.\n\nBut before the application was launched, the Biden administration abruptly scaled back the program. As a result, an estimated 700,000 people with a certain kind of federal loan – including Christofield – lost eligibility for debt relief.\n\n“It was dangled in front of us,” Christofield, 43, said.\n\nThe move affected borrowers with older federal loans that, through no fault of their own, are held by private lenders instead of the government. The loans are at the center of a lawsuit making its way through the courts, challenging the legality of Biden’s debt relief program.\n\nBiden administration officials have repeatedly said that they are assessing whether there are alternative pathways to provide relief to these borrowers, but the application for the program officially opened Monday without any update.\n\nThe administration is “moving as quickly as possible to provide relief to as many people as possible,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said at a press conference Monday.\n\nHowever, an appeals court ruling Friday temporarily paused the program, delaying relief while it considers a challenge to the loan cancellation plan. The administration had said it would begin granting student loan discharges as early as Sunday.\n\nWho’s left out?\n\nThe eligibility change, announced on September 29, excluded federal student loans that are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders.\n\nMany of these loans were made under the former Federal Family Education Loan program, known as FFEL, and Federal Perkins Loan program.\n\nGenerally, borrowers didn’t have the opportunity to choose whether to take out a federal loan held by the government or one held by a private lender. The FFEL program ended in 2010, so borrowers who took out loans after that date likely have Direct Loans that qualify for debt relief. Often, the FFEL and Perkins loans are serviced by the same companies that service the federal Direct Loans.\n\nThe federal government bought some loans from the FFEL program during the Great Recession. But about 4 million of the 43 million federal loan borrowers still currently have a FFEL loan owned by a private lender – though not all of those people were likely initially eligible for the loan forgiveness plan, which also includes an income requirement.\n\nEstimating how many of those borrowers were eligible relies on assumptions about their income as well as how many would apply for the relief. The Biden administration has said around 700,000 people lost eligibility.\n\nMany borrowers with privately held federal loans feel like they keep getting the short end of the stick. Their loans also do not qualify for the pandemic-related pause on payments and interest that began in March 2020.\n\nBorrower frustration: ‘This can’t be happening’\n\nSome borrowers with privately held federal loans may still qualify for forgiveness under Biden’s plan. But they must have applied to consolidate their loans into federal Direct Loans before September 29 – roughly five weeks after the program was announced.\n\nPaulo Calderon said he immediately considered consolidating his FFEL loans in order to qualify for the debt relief. But when he called his loan servicer, it was unclear that consolidating was the best option for him.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Biden forgave $10K in student debt. People flooded TikTok with their reactions 02:08 - Source: CNN\n\n“I was actually told there was no guarantee that consolidating would qualify me for loan forgiveness,” said Calderon, 45, who owes about $26,000 in student debt.\n\nThere are risks to consolidating. It could have increased his interest rate, raising the amount owed each month. Plus, the application for debt relief had not launched yet and the Biden administration said borrowers would have until December 2023 to apply.\n\nCalderon continued to research and was leaning toward consolidating – but didn’t take action before reading a news article on September 29 about the change in eligibility. He called his servicer again that day, but it was too late to consolidate.\n\n“It was so frustrating. I was like, ‘This can’t be happening,” Calderon said.\n\nWhy are some loans treated differently?\n\nThe Biden administration changed the eligibility criteria on the same day six GOP-led states sued, claiming the President does not have the legal authority to erase student debt.\n\nThe states also argued that student loan servicers – including the Higher Education Loan Authority of the State of Missouri, known as MOHELA – are financially harmed by Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan. The lawsuit argued that the plan creates an incentive for borrowers to consolidate Federal Family Education Loans owned by MOHELA into Direct Loans owned by the government, “depriving them (MOHELA) of the ongoing revenue it earns from servicing those loans,” according to the lawsuit.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Have student debt? Hear some expert tips on how to manage it 03:00 - Source: CNN Business\n\nBy excluding these borrowers from the program, the Biden administration likely weakened the plaintiffs’ argument.\n\nOn Thursday, the judge dismissed the case, ruling that the states did not have the legal standing to bring the challenge. The states immediately appealed, sending the case to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals where it is likely to face a panel of conservative judges.\n\nWho still qualifies for debt relief?\n\nUnder Biden’s plan, eligible individual borrowers who earned less than $125,000 in either 2020 or 2021 and married couples or heads of households who made less than $250,000 annually in those years will see up to $10,000 of their federal student loan debt forgiven.\n\nIf a qualifying borrower also received a federal Pell grant while enrolled in college, the individual is eligible for up to $20,000 of debt forgiveness.\n\nFederal Direct Loans, including subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans, parent PLUS loans and graduate PLUS loans, are eligible.\n\nWhile borrowers with FFEL and Perkins loans who have kept paying their bills on time remain ineligible, defaulted federal loans taken out under any program are eligible.\n\nThe application for forgiveness can be found online here.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-launch/index.html", "title": "Student loan forgiveness applications now formally open, Biden ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Monday announced the formal launch of the federal application for Americans seeking student loan forgiveness, the latest phase of his plan that is expected to provide debt relief to as many as 43 million borrowers.\n\n“Today, I’m announcing millions of people working and middle-class folks can apply and get this relief. And it’s simple and it’s now. It’s easy,” Biden said in remarks from the White House alongside Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. “This is a game changer for millions of Americans … and it took an incredible amount of effort to get this website done in such a short time.”\n\nIndividuals seeking to apply for student debt relief can now fill out the form in English or Spanish at Studentaid.gov. The form includes information on the debt relief, who qualifies for it and how it works. It asks applicants for information including their full name, Social Security number, date of birth, phone number and an email address. Borrowers have until December 31, 2023, to submit an application.\n\nBiden in August announced his decision to cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt for individuals making less than $125,000 a year or as much as $20,000 for eligible borrowers who were also Pell Grant recipients.\n\nBorrowers must have federally held student loans to qualify. In addition to federal Direct Loans used to pay for an undergraduate degree, federal PLUS loans borrowed by graduate students and parents may also be eligible if the borrower meets the income requirements.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that applicants who are “more likely to exceed the income cutoff” will be required to submit additional information, like a tax transcript. And while borrowers will not have to pay federal income tax on the student loan debt forgiveness, it’s possible that some borrowers may have to pay state income tax on the amount of debt forgiven.\n\nThe Department of Education has also said it already had income information for nearly 8 million borrowers, likely because of financial aid forms or previously submitted income-driven repayment plan applications. Those borrowers will automatically receive the debt relief if they meet the income requirement, unless they choose to opt out. The department has said it will email borrowers who will be considered for debt relief but don’t need to apply.\n\nThe formal launch of the application marks the next phase of a massive technical undertaking for federal agencies and student loan servicers to provide broad relief to tens of millions of borrowers. A beta version of the website was launched on Friday evening and Biden said over 8 million Americans used the website over the weekend to fill out their applications.\n\nThe President credited “a talented group of data scientists and engineers across the federal government” who “built and tested and launched this new application in just weeks.” In the few days of beta testing the application, Biden said, the website “handled more than 8 million applications without a glitch or difficulty.”\n\n“As millions of people fill out the application, we’re going to make sure the system continues to work as smoothly as possible so that we can deliver student loan relief for millions of Americans as quickly and as efficiently as possible,” he added.\n\nThe Department of Education is facing several lawsuits challenging the student loan forgiveness policy. A US district judge could soon decide whether to temporarily block the program from taking effect after hearing a motion for a preliminary injunction last week. That could put student loan cancellation on hold until the judge issues a final ruling on the case.\n\nAsked at the end of his remarks about litigation challenging the plan, Biden said he thinks the administration’s plan will hold up in court. He also took aim at Republican critics of his student debt relief plan, calling their outrage “wrong” and “hypocritical.”\n\n“I will never apologize for helping working Americans and middle-class people as they recover from the pandemic. Especially not the same Republicans who voted for a $2 trillion tax cut in the last administration, mainly benefited the wealthiest Americans and the largest corporations and didn’t pay for a penny of it and racked up the deficit,” he added.\n\nBorrowers whose federal student loans are guaranteed by the government but held by private lenders, many of which were made under the former Federal Family Education Loan program and Federal Perkins Loan program, are currently excluded – unless a borrower applied to consolidate those loans into Direct loans by September 29.\n\nThe Education Department initially said these privately held loans would be eligible for the one-time forgiveness action – but reversed course in September when six Republican-led states sued the Biden administration, arguing that forgiving the privately held loans would financially hurt states and student loan servicers.\n\nAsked by CNN’s MJ Lee about those with privately held loans being ineligible for the mass relief, Cardona said the administration is “moving as quickly as possible to provide relief to as many people as possible.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Sam Fossum Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez", "Sam Fossum", "Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/us/five-things-december-14-trnd/index.html", "title": "5 things to know for Dec. 14: Immigration, Storms, Student loans ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGet '5 things' in your inbox If your day doesn’t start until you’ve gotten up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Immigration\n\nThe Biden administration is facing a December deadline to terminate a public health authority, known as Title 42, that was invoked at the onset of the Covid pandemic and allowed officials to turn away migrants encountered at the US Southern border. As officials prepare for a surge of migrants ahead of the forced end of the Trump-era border policy, the Department of Homeland Security has deployed additional agents to El Paso, Texas, where thousands of migrants have been attempting to cross the border daily. Administration officials have also received a steady stream of calls from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers – as well as state and local officials – on the merits of the authority, people familiar with the matter said. The calls all echoed consistent concerns about the termination of Title 42 and what it will mean along the border in the coming weeks.\n\n2. Storms\n\nA massive storm is producing raging blizzards in the North and damaging tornadoes in the South, shuttering highways and hampering travel. According to CNN’s storm tracker, the storm system is moving east across the nation and is currently lingering over the central US. There have been at least five confirmed tornadoes in Texas and multiple others reported, officials said. The storms left a path of destruction across Oklahoma and the Dallas-Fort Worth area Tuesday, flattening homes and injuring at least seven people. In Louisiana, a child who was missing after a tornado touched down Tuesday was later found dead, authorities said. Meanwhile, nearly 10 million people – largely in the north-central US – are under winter weather warnings or advisories, with blowing snow and power outages a key concern. Another 6 million people across the Northeast will be under winter storm watches today.\n\n3. Student loans\n\nAbout 9 million people recently received emails from the Department of Education that mistakenly said their application for student loan forgiveness had been approved. Thus far, no one has received debt forgiveness from the Biden administration’s debt relief program because it remains blocked by federal courts. While there are some borrowers who were already deemed eligible for debt forgiveness by the Department of Education, borrowers should not expect to see debt relief unless the Supreme Court allows the program to move forward. The 9 million borrowers who received the inaccurate emails last month have now started to receive new emails from the government correcting the “human error.”\n\n4. Ukraine\n\nThe Biden administration is finalizing plans to send the Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine that could be announced as soon as this week, according to two US officials and a senior administration official. Amid a barrage of Russian attacks, Ukraine has been calling for the US to send the advanced air defense system that is widely considered one of the most capable long-range weapons to defend airspace against incoming missiles, as well as some aircraft. It would be the most effective long-range defensive weapons system sent to the country, and officials say it will help secure airspace for NATO nations in eastern Europe.

Though the $10 billion figure is a fraction of what is expected to be erased, changes to the program for public service workers still mark some of the largest swaths of debt to be cancelled by the federal government.\n\nIt's also part of the $32 billion in student loans the Biden administration already forgave through existing debt relief programs. Most recently, the federal government wiped nearly $4 billion in federal loans for roughly 208,000 borrowers who attended ITT Technical Institute from January 2005 to September 2016.\n\n“Today’s announcement that we’ve surpassed $10 billion in forgiveness for more than 175,000 public servants shows that the Biden-Harris administration’s efforts to cut red tape are turning the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program from a promise broken into a promise kept,\" Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said.\n\nWhat is the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program?\n\nThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness program has long had a reputation for being difficult for borrowers to use. Broadly, those working for the government or nonprofits qualify. That may include teachers and firefighters, but also public defenders and doctors.\n\nThe program requires borrowers to work full-time in a qualifying public service job and pay down their federal student loans for 10 years. The federal government then would forgive whatever balance remains after a decade.\n\nIt didn’t work that simply in practice.\n\nOpinion:'Forgiving' student loans isn't motivated by kindness. It's all about cold, hard politics.\n\nThe federal government for years rejected nearly all applicants because of the program’s rigid criteria. It required, for example, that borrowers carry direct loans, those owned directly by the government, though many borrowers were unaware they had the wrong type of loan until after making years worth of payments. Borrowers were also denied because they were in the wrong type of repayment plan or they had made late payments.\n\nHow did the Biden administration change the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program?\n\nIn October, the Biden administration loosened many of the program’s rules, and borrowers now can get credit for most past payments so long as they can prove they were working in a qualifying job at the time. When the department first announced the waiver, it said it would erase the debt of 22,000 borrowers and expected another 27,000 might benefit from full cancellation.\n\nThe definition of public service is based on a person's employer, not their profession, which can make tracking the number of people eligible for the program difficult.\n\nThe window for applying while some rules are being waived closes October 31, but on Tuesday more than 100 lawmakers and dozens of trade groups signed a letter urging the administration to extend it through July 1, 2023. (The Education Department urged borrowers who think they might be eligible to apply before the waiver ends.)\n\nThe effort was led by Sens. Robert Menendez, New Jersey; Patty Murray, Washington and the chair of the senate’s committee on education; Tim Kaine, Virginia; Kirsten Gillibrand, New York, along with Reps. John Sarbanes, Maryland; Joe Courtney, Connecticut; Jahana Hayes, Connecticut; and Kathy Manning, North Carolina.\n\nThey mentioned figures from the Student Borrower Protection Center, a borrower advocacy group, which estimated that only about 15 percent of the 9 million people who might be eligible for the program had started the application process.\n\n“Since the deadline of October 31, 2022 to qualify for PSLF under the waiver program is rapidly approaching, we ask that the Department extend this deadline in order to ensure that all public servants with federal student loans are able to benefit from this historic waiver,” they wrote.\n\nThe letter signers also requested that the Biden administration increase its outreach to borrowers who might qualify for the program.\n\nThe Education Department said it will host four \"days of action\" in the coming weeks meant to \"encourage public servants across the nation to take advantage of temporary changes\" to the program. And Biden will send a letter to federal employees Wednesday informing them of the changes to the program and how they can apply.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/11/21/student-loan-borrowers-share-3-75-m-citibank-failures-led-overpayments/886454001/", "title": "Student loan borrowers to get $3.75M from Citibank", "text": "Some student loan borrowers will share $3.75 million in payments from Citibank for financial practices that forced them to make overpayments, a federal watchdog said Tuesday.\n\nCitibank improperly misled borrowers into believing they were ineligible for a tax deduction on interest the paid on certain student loans, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said in a consent order.\n\nThe bank also incorrectly charged late fees and extra interest to borrowers who were still in school and eligible to defer repayments on their student loans, the consumer agency said.\n\nAdditionally, Citibank misled borrowers about their monthly bills and failed to disclose required information after the bank denied borrower requests to release loan co-signers.\n\nLearn more: Best private student loans\n\n\"Citibank's servicing failures made it more costly and confusing for borrowers trying to pay back their student loans,\" Richard Cordray, the consumer bureau's director, said in a statement issued with the announcement.\n\nThe bank, also hit with a $2.75 million federal fine as another part of a consent order reached with the consumer watchdog, said it was \"pleased to resolve this matter.\"\n\nMore:Student loans: Here are major complaints borrowers reported to a federal watchdog\n\nHomebuilder to help Millennials pay student loans and get a house — but is it a good idea?\n\nCitibank is among the world's largest banks, with more than $1.4 trillion in assets.

About 26 million people had already applied to the program by the time it was frozen prompting the government to stop taking applications. No debt has been canceled thus far.\n\nIn the case at hand before the Supreme Court, a district court dismissed a challenge brought by a group of states, holding that they couldn’t prove the legal injury necessary to bring the challenge. In November, the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and blocked the program.\n\nAn “erroneous injunction” from a federal appeals court, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the Supreme Court, “leaves millions of economically vulnerable borrowers in limbo, uncertain about the size of their debt and unable to make financial decisions with an accurate understanding of their future repayment obligations.”\n\nShe said that Biden acted in order to address the financial harms of the pandemic and “smooth the transition to repayment” in order to provide targeted debt relief to certain federal student-loan borrowers affected by the pandemic.\n\nThe program is designed to aid borrowers who are at highest risk of delinquency or default. Once debt cancellation begins, the plan could offer up to $10,000 in student loan debt relief to eligible borrowers making less than $125,000 ($250,000 per household.)\n\nIn addition, borrowers who received a Pell grant can receive up to $20,000 in relief.\n\nAs the Covid-19 pandemic began, the Department of Education paused payments and accrual of interest on student loans to help those who were struggling financially. Those payments were set to resume in January, but last week the Biden administration issued an extension due to the fact that his loan forgiveness program – announced in August – had come under multiple legal attacks.\n\nAs things stand, the payment pause will last until 60 days after the litigation over the loan forgiveness program is resolved. If the program has not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June 30, payments will resume 60 days after that, according to the government.\n\nThe authority exists under the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003, or the HEROES Act, the administration argued. It said the law exempts the government from otherwise applicable procedural requirements, including notice-and-comment rulemaking.\n\nA group of states, led by Nebraska, challenged the Biden policy, arguing that it violates the separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs the process by which federal agencies issue regulations.\n\nIn court papers lawyers for the states, Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina told the justices the program should remain on pause, especially because the Biden administration has announced an extension of the payment pause until 2023.\n\nNebraska Attorney General Douglas J. Peterson told the justices that Biden’s debt relief program is an “unlawful attempt to erase over $400 billion of the 1.6 trillion in federal student loan debt and eliminate all remaining loan balances for roughly 20 million of 43 million borrowers.”\n\nIn a separate challenge, the 5th US Circuit US Court of Appeals on Wednesday night refused to lift a stay put in place by a district court judge blocking the program.\n\nThat challenge is brought by two individual borrowers – Myra Brown and Alexander Taylor – who are not qualified for full debt relief forgiveness and who say they were denied an opportunity to comment on the secretary of education’s decision to provided targeted student loan debt relief to some.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/04/29/student-loans-corinthian-colleges-court-fight-debts/557436002/", "title": "Student loans: Fight looms over debts of Corinthian Colleges students", "text": "Thousands of former Corinthian Colleges students face a potentially pivotal court hearing Monday in a battle to erase millions of dollars in loan debt for their studies at the scandal-scarred, for-profit schools.\n\nAttorneys for the students are trying to force the U.S. Department of Education to restore a program that would forgive the student loans. Their argument is that Corinthian defrauded the borrowers with misleading data about career opportunities and post-graduation job placement.\n\nGovernment lawyers oppose the motion, arguing that a recently revised Department of Education program provides a fair and equitable evaluation of each student loan borrower's claim for debt relief.\n\nJason Spencer, a former Corinthian Colleges student, says he owes roughly $25,000 in student loan debt for the nine-month program in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning from which he graduated in 2012. Despite what he describes as promises the training would prepare him for \"a great career,\" the classes didn't enable him to land a long-term job in the field, he adds.\n\nLearn more: Best private student loans\n\n'Good sales pitch'\n\nCorinthian representatives gave \"a good sales pitch,\" says Spencer, a 38-year-old resident of Sunnyvale, Calif. But the promises were \"B.S., to be frank,\" he says.\n\nHis Corinthian training consisted of roughly 90% book learning and just 10% hands-on experience, says Spencer. He lasted about a week at an HVAC job in Redwood City, Calif., after graduation before leaving because he believed he would have been let go for inadequate skills training, he adds.\n\nThe federal class-action lawsuit for former students like Spencer was filed in California by the Project on Predatory Student Lending, an organization formed in 2012 to address alleged fraud against students and taxpayers by for-profit colleges, and by Housing and Economic Rights Advocates, a California not-for-profit legal service group.\n\nThe fight focuses on Corinthian, a former Santa Ana, Calif.-based company that primarily offered certificate and associate degree programs nationwide through its Everest, Heald, and WyoTech colleges. During 2009 and 2010, Corinthian operated more than 100 campuses in 25 states, enrolled more than 110,00 students and collected $1.7 billion in federal student aid, court filings state.\n\nCorinthian ceased operations and closed its remaining campuses in 2015. The shutdown came by agreement after a Department of Education review found that the company's Heald College system had misled students and the federal government about job hiring rates for graduates.\n\nLiquidated\n\nThe department placed a hold on Corinthian's access to student loans, essentially cutting off much of the company's funding. Education officials later said they would impose a $30 million fine on the company.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau separately obtained a more than $531 million default judgment against Corinthian in late 2015. By then, however, the company had been liquidated in bankruptcy court proceedings.\n\nThousands of Corinthian students, many unable to find jobs in their fields of study, asked the Department of Education to forgive their student loan debts in response to the company's misrepresentations.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, the DOE created a procedure that granted full loan discharges to nearly 25,000 Corinthian borrowers who attested that they either had attended one of the company's colleges that closed in 2015 or believed they had been defrauded by one of the schools.\n\nA Trump administration change\n\nHowever, the loan forgiveness program for Corinthian student loan borrowers changed last year under the Trump administration. After reviewing student loan borrower claims and other records, the department determined 51 Corinthian programs had met guidelines for instruction that leads to gainful employment, while six had failed.\n\nAs a result, education officials in December established a new procedure that would vary the loan forgiveness percentage for former Corinthian students and similar borrowers. The system is based on the programs the students attended and whether they subsequently were able to earn as much as peers in programs that satisfied the gainful employment guidelines.\n\n\"No fraud is acceptable, and students deserve relief if the school they attended acted dishonestly,\" Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a statement issued with the new procedure. \"This improved process will allow claims to be adjudicated quickly and harmed students to be treated fairly. It also protects taxpayers from being forced to shoulder massive costs that may be unjustified.\"\n\nHowever, the change \"left over 110,000 former Corinthian borrowers who have applied for loan discharge in limbo,\" attorneys for the students argued in an amended class-action complaint filed in March.\n\nInstead of providing clear, unambiguous relief, the department's new procedure subjects the borrowers to \"a murky, convoluted, unfair, and irrational process designed to minimize relief,\" saving the federal government money, the attorneys argued.\n\nPaying student loans - and other bills\n\nAmid the legal battle over the change, some Corinthian borrowers have had their federal tax refunds taken and applied to their education debts and also had their wages garnished, the lawyers also contended.\n\nMany of the borrowers \"are living on fixed incomes and cannot absorb the shock of the department's bait-and-switch,\" the attorneys argued. \"After having structured their lives believing that these loans would be forgiven,\" the students \"will be unable to make payments when they become due,\" and \"will face a choice between paying for their daily necessities or defaulting on their loans.\"\n\nSpencer says he received notification last week that he's soon required to start repaying 70% of the student loan debt he ran up at Corinthian, with the remainder to be forgiven. That amounts to $118 a month, an amount he says will \"take a toll,\" given his $591-a-week salary at a company where he installs and repairs fire sprinklers.\n\n\"I don't make that much right now,\" says Spencer, who adds that his salary pays for rent, food, car-related bills and other expenses for him and his family, including a young daughter.\n\nAlthough he hopes the lawsuit will succeed and wipe out his student loan debt, Spencer isn't overly optimistic. \"I think it may not, but I'm wishing,\" he says.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/29"}]}

Their sacrifice and courageous stand addressed the two-tier wages structure and permanent temporary worker classification that has plagued working-class Americans.”\n\nMore:GM calls UAW workers back to plants, targeting truck assembly first\n\nMore:UAW says it will target Ford to negotiate labor contract\n\nMore:UAW GM workers' bonuses barely make up pay lost during strike\n\nIn announcing the ratification and end to the strike, the UAW said 23,389 members voted yes and 17,501 voted no on the proposed contract.\n\nThe UAW said that workers will begin to report to work as instructed by GM. The union also announced Friday the next pattern bargaining company will be Ford.\n\nGM, confirmed the contract ratification Friday saying it delivered a contract that recognizes employees for the important contributions they make to the company's success with a strong wage and benefit package and additional investment and job growth in U.S. operations.\n\n\"GM is proud to provide good-paying jobs to tens of thousands of employees in America and to grow our substantial investment in the U.S,\" said GM CEO Mary Barra, \"As one team, we can move forward and stay focused on our priorities of safety and building high-quality cars, trucks and crossovers for our customers.\"\n\nSeparately, Aramark workers also ratified a contract for about 850 janitors at five GM locations in Michigan and Ohio.\n\nThe nearly 46,000 union members will receive $11,000 ratification bonuses from GM. Temporary workers are to get $4,500.\n\nIn an internal alert to GM employees, the carmaker said UAW employees will resume work on Monday with first shift. GM is calling workers at its Flint Assembly and Fort Wayne Assembly in Roanoke, Indiana, seeking volunteers to start production Saturday or Sunday at those two plants. GM builds its 2020 Chevrolet Silverado and 2020 GMC Sierra pickups at those two plants.\n\nThe strike cost the company $450 million a week, the Center for Automotive Research estimated, interrupted production of key vehicles and will delay delivery of the 2020 midengine Corvette Stingray.\n\nThe strike's impact goes beyond the automaker.\n\nLear Corp. said Friday that the six-week strike represents $525 million in lost revenue for the seating and electronic systems supplier.\n\nLear, based in Southfield, also lowered its full-year financial outlook, according to Crain’s Detroit Business. Its third-quarter net income fell 15% to $216 million. GM is Lear's largest customer, accounting for 18% of Lear’s business last year.\n\nTemporary workers\n\nThe union said the new contract will automatically make more than 900 temporary workers regular employees in January. After that, temps would get permanent jobs as they accrue time on the job under terms of the new contract. Their benefits improve, and the union has a voice in how many temporary workers the company can add.\n\nLikewise, all \"in-progression\" workers would get a raise within 52 weeks of their last raise. Under the old contract, those hired after 2007, dubbed in-progression workers, start at $17 an hour and could move up to $28 an hour after eight years. This new deal provides for them to reach $32.32 an hour by the time the new contract expires in 2023.\n\nAt Local 163, which represents GM Romulus Powertrain, 1,064 members out of about 1,100 voted, said Ralph Morris, president of the local. He said many workers live as far away as Flint and Toledo, but they drove in to vote.\n\nBut during the informational meetings, there were many “impassioned” questions around the contract, he said.\n\n“Some liked that there were no increases to their health care, they liked that the cap was raised for wages to help in-progression employees move up,” said Morris, “But, it was a mixed bag. Was it a slam dunk? No, but a lot of them felt it was an improvement from the current plan and there was a pathway for temporary employees.”\n\nGM will be calling some Local 163 skilled trades workers asking them to work Saturday and Sunday at Romulus, said Morris. They will be paid time-and-a-half for that work. Monday would be the full production day, he said.\n\nNext up!\n\nThe UAW will move on to negotiating a new tentative agreement with Ford, using the GM contract as the template.\n\nA UAW Local leader at a GM plant said the union will face challenges at Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles as they head into negotiations with those companies.\n\n“Ford really wanted the health care cut down and Chrysler has the biggest problem with four levels of 10,000 temp workers. Chrysler is going to be very challenging,” the local officer said. “It’ll be interesting to see what Chrysler will do with 10,000 temp employees.”\n\nThis officer said Ford should have the easiest time because the union’s top negotiator for Ford, Rory Gamble, has a lot of experience and a good relationship with Ford’s negotiations team.\n\n“They have a strong ability to work together, so they shouldn’t have any problems at all,” said the GM local leader.\n\nIndeed, what worked for GM and the UAW in negotiations isn't necessarily a right fit for Ford and FCA, said David Kudla, CEO of Mainstay Capital Management.\n\n\"GM was able to concede wage growth and health care costs for the ability to close three factories,\" said Kudla. \"Ford and FCA didn't have three factories that they wanted to close, but will have to work around this new framework for higher wages and unchanged health care that the UAW and GM have set.\"\n\nThe union has said it has made significant progress on subcommittee issues with both automakers, but final economic provisions and production promises remain to be worked out. That means those contracts remain uncertain and both companies are still vulnerable to strikes if union negotiators want to play that card.\n\n\"Just because there was a GM strike does not mean the other two are off the hook,\" said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor.\n\nSeparately, the UAW Mack Truck Council announced late Thursday that they have reached a tentative agreement, suspending a nearly two-week strike. Mack workers will be scheduled to return to their jobs. Mack Trucks has five facilities in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Florida.\n\nLordstown's end\n\nThe ratification spells an end to GM’s now-idle Lordstown Assembly plant in Ohio.\n\nGM is in talks to sell the facility to an investor group, Lordstown Motors, backed by electric truck maker Workhorse. But the local union members wanted GM to give the plant a new product to build after GM stopped building the Chevrolet Cruze compact car there in March.\n\nThe contract did not include a new product for Lordstown. It also does not include language to build a battery cell manufacturing facility near Lordstown, which was something GM proposed to the UAW during negotiations. But a GM spokesman confirmed the battery cell plant is still part of GM’s plans.\n\nLocal 1112, which represents Lordstown, voted to reject the proposed contract.\n\n“Obviously, we’re all disappointed and angry over what happened,” said Tim O’Hara, president of Local 1112. “For our members, they have to make some decisions now that they hoped they didn’t have to make. Many of them transferred to other plants and left their families behind hoping they’d return to Lordstown one day.”\n\nIn a statement, GM said it is moving forward with opportunities for future investments and job growth in the Mahoning Valley in Ohio. These investments are outside the national agreement:\n\nAn opportunity to bring battery cell production to the area, which would create 1,000 manufacturing jobs\n\nThe sale of the GM Lordstown complex to Lordstown Motors Corp., which plans to create 400 manufacturing jobs initially.\n\nLocal 1112 now represents fewer than 20 workers at Mahoning County Jobs and Family Services and Infinite Synergy in Youngstown, Ohio.\n\n“Obviously, we have a lot of decisions to make as far as the local union,” said O’Hara. “We’ll sit down internally and we’ll have discussions with people at the regional level to see where we go from here.”\n\nThe local has enough finances to make it into early next year, he said. The potential of Lordstown Motors buying the plant and GM building a battery cell maker are options given, “they’re saying they want their workers to be UAW,” said O’Hara.\n\nBut those are 18 to 24 months down the road, “so we can’t sustain ourselves financially that long. So I don’t know what that means for Local 1112.”\n\nThe bitter battle\n\nThe strike against GM has been prolonged and at times painful. At one point, a public exchange of words saw GM insinuating the UAW was moving too slowly in negotiations and not responding to company proposals. The UAW fired back that GM was not taking the union seriously.\n\nAfter that, it took the heavyweights coming to the table to re-ignite progress toward a deal. GM's Barra and UAW President Gary Jones met with negotiators just days before the two sides finally reached a tentative agreement.\n\nMany UAW leaders and labor experts said that despite the prolonged and sometimes-contentious negotiations, the agreement is a big win for UAW-represented workers at 55 GM facilities in 10 states who had been on strike since 12:01 a.m. Sept. 16.\n\nThe deal provides 4% lump sum wage payments in years one and three and 3% base wage increases in alternating years. It gets rid of long-term temporary worker status and holds hourly workers' share of health care costs to 3%, among other provisions.\n\nIt also keeps GM's Detroit-Hamtramck plant running by adding an electric pickup and other electric trucks. GM will invest $3 billion in the plant, which also will assemble batteries, and bring in 2,225 new jobs when it's at full volume.\n\nWarren Tech Center will get a new vehicle program, $200 million investment and retention of approximately 75 jobs under the agreement. Lansing Delta and Spring Hill, Tennessee, assembly plants get a next generation midsize SUV assembly worth $1 billion and 5,000 jobs.\n\nBesides Lordstown Assembly Plant in Ohio, a transmission plant in Warren and Baltimore are to remain closed.\n\nStrike fallout\n\nThe ratification vote comes at a crucial time. The strike has already cost GM nearly a half-billion dollars a week. Anderson Economic Group in East Lansing said it cost GM another $400 million for the entire next week that the union remained out conducting ratification meetings with ballots due by Oct. 25.\n\nGM has had to temporarily shutter other North American plants. On Oct. 19, GM halted production of its new 2020 Chevrolet Blazer SUV at its Ramos Arizpe Vehicle Assembly in Mexico because of a parts shortage from the UAW nationwide strike.\n\nGM's decision to build the Blazer in Mexico instead of a U.S. plant was a sore point with the UAW, as is low-cost Mexican production in general.\n\nAlso, GM's production of the 2020 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups at its Silao Assembly Plant in Mexico, along with production of the previous generation pickups at GM's Oshawa plant in Ontario, both went down during the strike because of a parts shortage.\n\nGM declined to comment specifically on Mexico production. A spokesman said the company wants to get all its U.S. production up as soon as possible. Those plants will make the parts to get GM's plants in Mexico back up.\n\nThe Corvette plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky, was to be retooled this month to build the much-anticipated 2020 Stingray, but that will be delayed while it finishes orders for the 2019 model.\n\nMany of GM's car dealers complained of a lack of parts to perform repairs in the service lanes. And, 100,000 related workers saw their income impacted because of the strike, economists said.\n\nLikewise, UAW workers were getting by on $250 a week for almost a month until the union raised the strike wage to $275 a week on week Oct. 13. The cost to UAW workers was $14 million per day while they were on strike and not working, Anderson Economic Group said.\n\nThe terms\n\nHere are a few highlights of the new contract:\n\nUAW-represented GM workers will get a bonus of $11,000 upon ratification of the deal. Temporary workers get $4,500.\n\nSo-called in-progression workers hired after 2007 get a faster path to top pay. Under the previous contract, those workers started at $17 an hour, reaching $28/hour after eight years. Under the proposal, that is shortened to four years.\n\nTemporary workers, who have been paid $15-19 an hour with inferior benefits to permanent autoworkers, get a path to a permanent role starting next year. Part-time workers get a path to regular status starting in 2021. These workers also get improved paid and unpaid time off.\n\nThe union has full approval authority and the ability to monitor the number of temporary employees working in the plants.

He got knocked off balance and fell awkwardly to the court, landing hard on his back with 2:45 left in the third.\n\nThe Lakers were anxious as they surrounded him under the basket.\n\n“Fingers crossed, hope for the best, pray for the best,” coach Frank Vogel said.\n\nDavis pounded the court in pain and stayed down for roughly two minutes, but eventually rose with his teammates' help and then slowly walked off unaided.\n\n“We're hoping he'll be fine, and we believe he'll be fine,” said LeBron James, who played through illness. “Tough night for us.”\n\nX-rays were negative, but Davis didn't return to the game and he was scheduled for additional testing overnight. His agent, Rich Paul, said his client felt extremely sore.\n\nIt seems quite likely Davis will miss at least a little playing time this month, given the Lakers' lofty record and the long road to the playoffs still ahead. The Lakers have a two-game road trip starting Friday in Dallas.\n\n“We hope he's all right,” Kentavious Caldwell-Pope said. “We're just hoping he'll get better soon. We need him.”\n\nJames scored 31 points and Caldwell-Pope added 15 after bouncing back from a flagrant foul to his head by Bobby Portis, but the Lakers (30-7) didn't exactly celebrate becoming the second NBA team to win 30 games this season.\n\nDavis, who will be an unrestricted free agent this summer, is the primary reason behind Los Angeles' swift rise to the top of the Western Conference. He is averaging 27.7 points and 9.5 rebounds per game in his first season after the Lakers traded most of their young core to New Orleans for him.\n\n“He's one of our pillars,” Vogel said. “He's our present. He's our future. He's one of the best players in the world, so obviously he means a lot.”\n\nR.J. Barrett scored 19 points for the Knicks, and Randle had 15 points and 10 rebounds against his former team. New York dropped to 0-3 on its four-game West Coast trip.\n\nLos Angeles had little trouble holding off the Knicks in the second half despite Davis' abrupt exit. The Lakers pushed their lead to 30 early in the fourth quarter with a run led by James, who scored 16 points in 16 minutes in the second half.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nKnicks: Former Lakers forward Reggie Bullock started in place of Marcus Morris and scored seven points in 27 minutes. Morris sat out with a sore neck. ... Portis had two points on 1-of-5 shooting in six minutes.\n\nLakers: James thought about sitting out after feeling sick all day, but elected to play. ... Avery Bradley scored 12 points despite sitting out the end of Sunday's game with an ankle injury. Bradley had no swelling and didn't need to miss a game, he said. ... The Lakers didn't win their 30th game last season until Feb. 27, when they were 30-31.\n\nFLAGRANT FOUL\n\nPortis was ejected early in the second quarter for a flagrant foul on Caldwell-Pope. Portis clocked Caldwell-Pope in the head while the Lakers veteran was going up for a fast-break dunk, knocking off his headband and sending him to the locker room.\n\n“It wasn't intentional at all,” Portis said. “I went for the ball. My intent was never to hurt anybody or anything like that. Just trying to make a play on the ball. Missed the ball and hit him in the head. My apologies to Caldwell-Pope. Happy to see him go out and do his thing, come back into the game and impact the game.\"\n\nCaldwell-Pope returned in the third quarter and scored eight more points.\n\n“I was feeling great before I even came back on the court,” he said.\n\nHERO TIME\n\nBarrett, the Knicks' 19-year-old rookie, got a thrill from playing against James: \"It was definitely cool. He was always my favorite player growing up, so that was good. But once I got in the game, it was a regular game now. Just got to play.”\n\nTHE NEW 30\n\nThe Lakers joined the NBA-leading Milwaukee Bucks as the league's only 30-game winners so far this season. Los Angeles hadn't won 30 games this quickly since the 2008-09 season, when Kobe Bryant's Lakers started 30-6 and eventually won the 15th of their 16 NBA titles.\n\nDWIGHT'S ALL RIGHT\n\nDwight Howard had another strong game with eight points, 13 rebounds and three blocked shots. The Lakers' veteran big man also hit the eighth 3-pointer of his career in the fourth quarter to much amusement from his teammates and fans.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nKnicks: Visit the Utah Jazz on Wednesday.\n\nLakers: At the Dallas Mavericks on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2023/01/25/garcia-payne-sidelined-for-gophers-in-latest-injury-setback/51223411/", "title": "Garcia, Payne sidelined for Gophers in latest injury setback", "text": "AP\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota sidelined leading scorer Dawson Garcia and top reserve Pharrel Payne for the game Wednesday against Indiana due to injuries, further depleting the last-place team in the Big Ten.\n\nHoosiers coach Mike Woodson also was ruled out of the game because of COVID-19, the university announced before tipoff.\n\nGarcia has a bone bruise in his right foot, an injury that came late in the game Sunday at Michigan.

That's I guess an unequivocal injury, but there's a lot of gray area beyond that,\" Zaidi said.\n\nPUJOLS BALL:Who is the 'rightful' owner of milestone ball?\n\nFOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team\n\nHolland blasted the Giants' front office Saturday night after he learned from manager Bruce Bochy that he was being moved to the bullpen.\n\n\"To be honest I have no idea what they're doing,\" Holland said. \"I don't mean that by Bochy and them, it's more the front office. They keep changing a lot of things. I did a fake injury. I'm not happy about that. But at the end of the day I'm going to do whatever they ask me to do.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old was placed on the IL April 29, retroactive to the previous day. In his first outing after being activated, Holland gave up seven runs in 2 2/3 innings Thursday at Colorado amid heavy snowfall.\n\n\"I feel equally bad that when he did get back out there, it was in a blizzard,\" Zaidi said. \"I don't know how much of kind of the cold and weather, interacting with whatever lack of feel he has in the finger, contributed to what happened in Colorado.\"\n\nZaidi said Holland didn't want to go on the IL last month and was told he would only miss one start.\n\n\"Guys want to play,\" Zaidi said. \"I love the fact that Derek wants to be out there. That's one of the reasons we brought him back.\"\n\nHolland signed a one-year, $7 million contract in January to return to San Francisco for a second year. He is 1-4 with a 6.75 ERA.\n\nZaidi stood by comments he made to the San Francisco Chronicle Saturday night about Holland's injury. He told the newspaper that Holland had an MRI and the decision to put him on the IL was \"collaboratively made.\"\n\n\"His use of the word 'fake' probably comes from him feeling he could continue to pitch with it,\" Zaidi told the Chronicle.\n\nOn Sunday, Zaidi said Holland's anger was understandable given the team's struggles. The Giants are last in the NL West.\n\n\"There's a lot of frustration right now. We're not playing as well as we'd like,\" Zaid said. \"I think fans are frustrated, as a front office we're frustrated. I understand players being frustrated, but we're going to do everything we can every day to get better.\"\n\nHolland blasted the Giants' front office Saturday night after he learned from manager Bruce Bochy that he was being moved to the bullpen. \"To be honest, I have no idea what they're doing,\" Holland said, before adding, \"I did a fake injury.

Doing it in a game is a rare accomplishment at the 20-year-old stadium.\n\n\"He did it in BP, third deck, and then followed it up in the game,\" Mariners teammate Mallex Smith said. \"He's not a 5 o'clock hitter.\"\n\nVogelbach's mammoth two-run homer in the seventh inning was the highlight of a 6-2 win over the Texas Rangers that snapped Seattle's six-game losing streak.\n\nKyle Seager drove in his first run of the season and Smith stole four bases, including three in the eighth — capped by his second career steal of home. Seattle also got solid pitching from Tommy Milone as the Mariners rebounded after being swept by Texas and Oakland on the road.\n\nFOLLOW THE MONEY: MLB player salaries and payrolls for every major league team\n\nBut what everyone wanted to talk about was Vogelbach's towering homer off reliever Jose Leclerc that found a rare landing spot, one of the few home runs to reach that part of the stadium.\n\nEveryone except Vogelbach.\n\n\"It was just a curveball out over the plate and I was able to ride it out and keep it fair. I was just happy I could drive two runs in,\" he said.\n\nAccording to team records through the 2015 season, only two homers had reached that level of the stadium and it was uncertain if any had in the past four seasons. It was Vogelbach's 15th homer of the season and while it was close to being a foul ball, the home run call stood following a replay review.\n\n\"For the ball to go over the top of the foul pole like that, that's some kind of special power,\" Seattle manager Scott Servais said.\n\nSeager, activated off the 60-day injured list last weekend, blooped a single to score Smith in the third when Seattle scored a pair. Smith came through an inning later with a sharp single to score J.P. Crawford.\n\nMilone (1-1) pitched into the sixth. Logan Forsythe missed a home run by inches and settled for an RBI double in the fourth, and Ronald Guzmán homered on a 1-2 pitch in the fifth. Those were the only costly mistakes by Milone, who allowed four hits and struck out seven.\n\nRangers manager Chris Woodward said he thought an early start time and shadows on the field were a factor.\n\n\"I think more so for him (Milone) because he is an off-speed guy. He changes speeds, he moves the ball around. Our hitters had a tough time seeing that changeup,\" Woodward said.\n\nTexas starter Lance Lynn (6-4) struck out 10 and yielded three earned runs in six innings.\n\n\"I gave up three runs and we lost, so it doesn't matter how many strikeouts,\" Lynn said.\n\nSPEED RACER\n\nSmith stole home in the eighth when Kyle Bird tried to pick off Mitch Haniger at first base. Smith stole second and third earlier in the inning and had a stolen base in the third. The four steals were a career high and matched a club record.\n\nSeattle's last steal of home was by Dustin Ackley in 2012.\n\nROSTER SHUFFLE\n\nRangers: Texas recalled Bird from Triple-A Nashville and designated RHP Jeanmar Gómez for assignment. Gómez had an 8.22 ERA in 16 relief appearances for the Rangers.\n\nMariners: Seattle claimed RHP Jimmy Cordero off waivers from Toronto and transferred RHP Gerson Bautista to the 60-day injured list to clear a spot on the 40-man roster. Cordero, 27, was designated for assignment by Toronto last week.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nServais had a long list of injury updates and most of them were positive. Second baseman Dee Gordon was diagnosed with a deep bone bruise in his right wrist and not a fracture after seeing a specialist in Florida. Servais said Gordon's return will likely be determined by how well the wrist can handle swinging and hitting. Gordon said he aggravated the wrist by returning too soon from the initial injury after being hit by a pitch earlier this month.\n\n\"I thought I was invincible. I am not,\" Gordon joked.\n\nMariners infielder Ryon Healy (lower back inflammation) should resume baseball activities in the next few days.\n\nSeattle pitchers Hunter Strickland (lat) and Felix Hernandez (shoulder) could be throwing off a mound by the end of the week, or early next week. Both have been tossing from beyond 100 feet in recent days, Servais said. Strickland has been out since March 30, and Hernandez has been sidelined since May 12.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRangers: RHP Adrian Sampson (2-3) was listed as the starter for Tuesday, although the Rangers plan to use Jesse Chavez (0-1) as an opener. Sampson has followed an opener in each of his past two outings.\n\nMariners: LHP Marco Gonzales (5-4) hasn't won since April 25 and is 0-4 with a 4.56 ERA in his last five starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball coverage: www.apnews.com/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/12/17/spains-prime-minister-punched-face-campaign-trail/77469284/", "title": "Spain's prime minister Mariano Rajoy punched in face on campaign ...", "text": "Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Thursday tweeted a video of himself working out in a gym a day after he was punched in the face while campaigning for Sunday's general election.\n\n“Happy Thursday from Barcelona.

CB Tramon Williams' knee leaves him questionable for Cleveland.\n\nKey to the game: Steelers RB Le’Veon Bell and WR Antonio Brown headline a group that’s capable of making explosive plays, but the Steelers rank near the middle of the league in scoring and in the bottom third in rushing offense. The Steelers want to get multiple players involved and use the no-huddle offense to keep the pressure on defenses, but they’ve become a little too reliant on the deep ball. Look for a run-heavy game plan early with the intent of opening things up for the passing game.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nBy the numbers: 4. The Steelers went for two points last week after all four of their TDs and didn’t convert any of them. They set an NFL record for most successful two-point conversions last season, but, given last week’s events, will coach Mike Tomlin employ a different philosophy?\n\nUSA TODAY Sports' Week 11 NFL picks\n\nBaltimore Ravens (5-4) at Dallas Cowboys (8-1)\n\nTV: Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, CBS (Ian Eagle, Dan Fouts, Evan Washburn)\n\nLine: Cowboys by 7\n\nInjuries of note: LB Elvis Dumervil (foot) and CB Jimmy Smith (back) are doubtful. Cowboys QB Tony Romo (back) will be active for the first time this season.\n\nKey to the game: WR Dez Bryant’s return and his ability to muscle smaller defenders has opened another avenue for the Cowboys. Throwing down the field could open up the run game even more.\n\nPlayer to watch: Cowboys RB Ezekiel Elliott. The rookie posted his fifth 100-yard rushing game and his seventh in a row with more than 90 yards last week. The Cowboys have invested heavily in their offensive line, and the Elliott-heavy game plan won’t change this week.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (2-7) at Detroit Lions (5-4)\n\nTV: Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, CBS (Andrew Catalon, Steve Tasker, Steve Beuerlein)\n\nLine: Lions by 6½\n\nInjuries of note: Lions No. 1 CB Darius Slay (hamstring) is set to return, thought LB DeAndre Levy (knee) probably needs more time.\n\nKey to the game: Act the part. The Lions backed into first place without playing, but they overcame a three-game losing streak early in the season to get here. This might be the kind of game, against a reeling bottom dweller at home, that Detroit would have squandered in the past. If this season is different, it will capitalize on its good fortune and put away an inferior foe.\n\nBy the numbers: 12. The Jaguars have gone five games without a takeaway, during which they’re minus-12 in turnover differential.\n\nFantasy football rankings: Week 11\n\nTennessee Titans (5-5) at Indianapolis Colts (4-5)\n\nTV: Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, CBS (Spero Dedes, Solomon Wilcots)\n\nLine: Colts by 3\n\nInjuries of note: Tennessee had no one on their injury report Friday. For the Colts, DE Kendall Langford (knee) is out, CB Patrick Robinson (groin) is doubtful, and DT Art Jones (illness) is questionable.\n\nKey to the game: Stopping the run: The Titans, for the most part, have been outstanding against the run, holding opponents fewer than 100 rushing yards six times and going 4-2 in those games. The Colts, on the other hand, have held opponents under the century mark only twice, going 1-1. If Tennessee can exploit that lopsidedness, they can win this game.\n\nPlayer to watch: Delanie Walker. The Titans’ speedy, bruising tight end racked up 11 targets last week, more than double anyone else, and caught nearly everything thrown his way, finishing with nine receptions for 124 yards and a TD. The Colts have struggled shutting down tight ends all season, so if anyone from Tennessee is going off with big stats in this one, it’ll be Walker.\n\nNFL MVP tracker: Ezekiel Elliott knocks Matt Ryan from pedestal\n\nBuffalo Bills (3-4-1) at Cincinnati Bengals (4-5)\n\nTV: Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, CBS (Thom Brennaman, Charles Davis, Chris Spielman, Holly Sonders)\n\nLine: Bengals by 4½\n\nInjuries of note: Bills DT Marcell Dareus (groin), LB Jerry Hughes (hand) and WR Robert Woods (foot) are questionable.\n\nKey to the game: Bengals QB Andy Dalton endured 28 sacks over his first nine games, and some of those were a result of him holding on to the ball too long. Bills coach Rex Ryan knows how to get after quarterbacks and disguise coverages, so Dalton will need to be quick with his reads or he’ll be in for a long afternoon.\n\nPlayer to watch: Bills QB Tyrod Taylor. He played arguably the best game of his career in a 31-25 road loss to the Seahawks two Mondays ago. The second-year starter completed 71% of his passes and seemed more decisive with his reads. He elevated the play of those around him. For the Bills to have any chance of making the playoffs, he’ll need to continue to build on that performance.\n\nNFL playoff picture: Three teams could join Seahawks as division winners\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (4-5) at Kansas City Chiefs (7-2)\n\nTV: Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, Fox (Kenny Albert, Daryl Johnston, Laura Okmin)\n\nLine: Chiefs by 7½\n\nInjuries of note: The Chiefs will be without WR Jeremy Maclin (groin). OLB Justin Houston (knee) could make his season debut, while LB Derrick Johnson (hamstring), CB Marcus Peters (hip) and DT Dontari Poe (knee) are all officially questionable.\n\nKey to the game: Creating turnovers. The Chiefs consistently do it better than any other team in the NFL with 22 takeaways and a plus 14 ratio. Tampa Bay was minus-3 before Sunday but is even after taking it away from Chicago four times. The Bucs will have to be almost perfect to win in Kansas City.\n\nMatchup to watch: Peters vs. Buccaneers WR Mike Evans. Evans is Winston’s favorite target and has 59 receptions for 811 yards and eight TDs. Peters, who has five interceptions, might not be on him very often, as he has missed practice with a hip injury and rarely shadows top opponents. The Chiefs will have to decide how much safety help will be needed to limit Evans.\n\nReport: Tony Romo wanted to compete with Dak Prescott for Cowboys' QB job\n\nChicago Bears (2-7) at New York Giants (6-3)\n\nTV: Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, Fox (Kevin Burkhardt, John Lynch, Pam Oliver)\n\nLine: Giants by 7\n\nInjuries of note: Bears RG Kyle Long (ankle) went on IR and T Bobby Massie (concussion) is unlikely to play. WR Alshon Jeffery (suspension) is also out. RB Jordan Howard is coping with ankle and Achilles issues. Giants WR Victor Cruz (ankle) was not on the final injury report.\n\nKey to the game: After what might be his second-worst game with the Bears, QB Jay Cutler will have to rebound against a pesky and improving Giants unit known for its aggressiveness under Spagnuolo. Giants DEs Jason Pierre-Paul and Olivier Vernon will try to tee off on Cutler behind a line likely missing its starters on the right side, Long and Massie.\n\nMatchup to watch: Bears CB Tracy Porter vs. Giants WR Odell Beckham Jr.: It’ll take a village to slow Beckham, who has 31 TDs in his first 36 NFL games. Porter has quietly been outstanding for the Bears, keeping TD machine, Tampa Bay’s Mike Evans, out of the end zone Sunday and off the stat sheet before halftime. But he is dealing with a bum knee.\n\nDallas Cowboys aren't just America's Team. They're Mexico's, too\n\nArizona Cardinals (4-4-1) at Minnesota Vikings (5-4)\n\nTV: Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, Fox (Joe Buck, Troy Aikman, Erin Andrews)\n\nLine: Pick ’em\n\nInjuries of note: Cardinals defenders Deone Bucannon (ankle) and Tyrann Mathieu (shoulder) are questionable, but WR Larry Fitzgerald (knee, ankle) is ready to go. Vikings LB Eric Kendricks (hip), CB Captain Munnerlyn (ankle) and CB Marcus Sherels (ankle) are questionable.\n\nKey to the game: Unpredictable passers: Cardinals QB Carson Palmer was playing at an MVP level last season, and Vikings QB Sam Bradford was one of the most pleasant surprises of the opening month of this season. Both have been unable to sustain that level of play, and their teams are going to need them to carry the load Sunday.\n\nMatchup to watch: Cardinals CB Patrick Peterson vs. Vikings WR Stefon Diggs. One of the few remaining weapons on the Minnesota offense, Diggs has been a key to the Vikings’ success — and has been hot recently. When he’s catching passes and making plays, Bradford can move the chains. But Diggs has been known to disappear when playing against a top-flight cover corner.\n\nMiami Dolphins (5-4) at Los Angeles Rams (4-5)\n\nTV: Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET, Fox (Chris Myers, Ronde Barber, Jennifer Hale)\n\nLine: Pick ‘em\n\nInjuries of note: Dolphins LT Branden Albert (wrist) will not play, and C Mike Pouncey (hip) is doubtful. Rams DE Robert Quinn (dehydration) remains a question mark, while DE Eugene Sims is still dealing with a concussion.\n\nKey to the game: Coach Jeff Fisher finally replaced starting QB Case Keenum with rookie No. 1 overall pick Jared Goff. Will Goff make a difference in the red zone, where the Rams failed to capitalize three times last week inside the Jets’ 10? That will be a key.\n\nPlayer to watch: Dolphins QB Ryan Tannehill. After riding the running of Jay Ajayi for three consecutive games, the Dolphins needed to rely on Tannehill last game, and he responded well, rallying the Dolphins from a 10-0 deficit. He hasn’t been spectacular during the winning streak, but he has been efficient and error-free with four TD passes and zero INTs in the last four games.\n\nNew England Patriots (7-2) at San Francisco 49ers (1-8)\n\nTV: Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET, CBS (Greg Gumbel, Trent Green, Jamie Erdahl)\n\nLine: Patriots by 14\n\nInjuries of note: Patriots TE Rob Gronkowski (punctured lung) won't play, and neither will WR Chris Hogan (back). CB Rashard Robinson (knee) and WR Torrey Smith (shoulder) are questionable for San Francisco.\n\nKey to the game: Will QB Tom Brady be needed? The 49ers run defense has been so pathetic this season that it wouldn’t be all that surprising to see New England throw the ball 15 to 20 times and still win going away. Knowing Bill Belichick, he’ll probably come out throwing.\n\nPlayer to watch: Patriots RB LaGarrette Blount. With Dion Lewis back, the Patriots have a more balanced running attack, but Blount is still the central figure in New England’s ground game. Until Sunday, San Francisco’s run defense couldn’t stop anyone. The 49ers were able to corral Arizona’s David Johnson in a close loss to the Cardinals, and they undoubtedly will focus on trying to slow Blount this week.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles (5-4) at Seattle Seahawks (6-2-1)\n\nTV: Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET, CBS (Jim Nantz, Phil Simms,Tracy Wolfson)\n\nLine: Seahawks by 6\n\nInjuries of note: Eagles TE Zach Ertz (hamstring), WR Jordan Matthews (back) are questionable, but CB Nolan Carroll has recovered from a concussion. Seahawks RB Thomas Rawls (fibula) will make his long-awaited return, but DE Michael Bennett (knee) is out another week.\n\nKey to the game: Don’t panic: Seattle boasts perhaps the NFL’s most daunting home-field advantage and is 4-0 there this season. Facing a killer defense in an insanely loud building will be a monumental challenge for Philadelphia’s Carson Wentz. He’ll have to stay poised and keep his wits about him to avoid mistakes. That would not only cost his team, but turn up the crowd volume that much more.\n\nBy the numbers: 129.7. Seattle QB Russell Wilson has been playing through knee and ankle injuries and hadn’t quite been the dynamic playmaker of previous seasons. That has changed in the last two weeks. In those two victories, Wilson has completed 45 of 63 passes (71.4%) for 630 yards with five TDs and no INTs for a 129.7 rating. He scored his first rushing TD of the season. In the marquee matchup at New England, he passed for 348 yards and three TDs — both season highs.\n\nGreen Bay Packers (4-5) at Washington Redskins (5-3-1)\n\nTV: Sunday, 8:30 p.m. ET, NBC (Al Michaels, Cris Collinsworth, Michele Tafoya)\n\nLine: Redskins by 3\n\nInjuries of note: For the Packers, G T.J. Lang (foot), CB Damarious Randall (groin), LB Jake Ryan (ankle) and C J.C. Tretter (knee) are all out, but LB Clay Matthews (hamstring) could return. Redskins WR DeSean Jackson (shoulder) is questionable.\n\nKey to the game: Pound on the ground. Redskins coach Jay Gruden seems to have found the answer he has been looking for at running back in bruising Rob Kelley, who has averaged 92 yards a game and hasn’t fumbled in two games since replacing fumble-prone Matt Jones as the featured back. Green Bay is searching for an answer with Eddie Lacy on injured reserve and backup James Starks in and out because of injuries. The Packers have only three rushing TDs this season — all by QB Aaron Rodgers.\n\nMatchup to watch: Rodgers vs. Redskins QB Kirk Cousins. While Rodgers has thrown for 12 TDs in his last four games, the two-time league MVP has thrown seven INTs — three in the last two weeks. Cousins doesn’t have flashy numbers, but he seems at last to have found consistency and maturity. No longer do his mistakes snowball into disasters.\n\nHouston Texans (6-3) vs. Oakland Raiders (7-2)\n\nTV: Monday, 8:30 p.m. ET in Mexico City, ESPN (Sean McDonough, Jon Gruden, Lisa Salters)\n\nLine: Raiders by 5\n\nInjuries of note: Texans NT Vince Wilfork (groin), WR Will Fuller (leg) and CB A.J. Bouye (ankle) all are day-to-day, but RB Alfred Blue (calf), RB Jonathan Grimes (illness) and WR Jaelen Strong (ankle) continue to miss practice. The Raiders are relatively healthy coming out of their bye week.\n\nKey to the game: Fútbol Americano: For the first time since 2005, an NFL game will be played in Mexico. Oakland and Houston will square off in the same stadium that hosted that game. Last time, a crowd of more than 100,000 booed every field goal attempt, preferring teams to go for it on fourth down.\n\nPlayer to watch: Raiders RB Latavius Murray. How will Murray follow up his 114-yard, three-TD performance against the Denver Broncos? While QB Derek Carr’s ability to make plays in the passing game is vital to Oakland’s offensive flow, if Murray can rattle off a few big gains and find the end zone once, twice or even thrice, the Raiders will have a tremendous edge.\n\nPHOTOS: Week 11 games ranked by watchability", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/bigten/2015/10/31/iowa-hawkeyes-football-fullbacks-adam-cox-macon-plewa-running-game-blockers/74757788/", "title": "Forgotten position weighs heavily in No. 11 Iowa's gameplan", "text": "Kevin Trahan\n\nSpecial for FootballFour.com\n\nComing out of tiny Stillman Valley High School in the farmland south of Rockford, Illinois, Adam Cox wasn't recruited by anyone to play college football. He didn't have a star rating, or even a recruiting profile. So when he decided to walk on at Iowa, he just showed up to play football, whatever that might mean for him.\n\n\"I just came, open to play, really,\" Cox said.\n\nThere aren't a lot of places in major college football for lightly recruited high school running backs who are too slow to play running back, or linebackers who aren't athletic enough to play linebacker. Cox was simply a football player, so Iowa found him a spot for big guys who just love to play football: fullback.\n\n\"Obviously, no one's really dying to play fullback,\" Cox said. \"It's a position, there's not much credit. It's a position a lot of walk-ons play, because walk-ons have to have a certain mindset. You need to be willing to do anything.\"\n\nThe fullback is a rare breed in this day of spread offenses, and it is hardly ever a recruited position. Depending on the situation, a fullback is like an offensive lineman playing running back, or a running back playing on the line. Often, it's a void filled by linebackers hoping to find a ticket to the NFL.\n\n\"The NFL still uses them,\" said David Shaw, the coach of No. 8 Stanford, which is also known for its fullback use. \"For us to be one of the few places that not only play with, we train fullbacks and tight ends. And those guys, if they're good enough, have a chance to play on the next level.\"\n\nThere is no real typical identity for what makes a fullback, other than just a really good, fundamentally sound football player. Whatever the team needs to be done on each specific play, the fullback can get it done.\n\n\"I like to say I'm more of a back, but I think my role most of the time, I guess would be like a glorified lineman,\" said Macon Plewa, Cox's running/blocking mate at fullback.\n\nPlewa, who will start at the position for Iowa on Saturday against Maryland, has yet to run the ball this season. Like Cox, he walked on for the Hawkeyes, and he switched to fullback from linebacker when it became clear that was his only way to see the field.\n\nBut even though it may seem like fullback has been a utility position, where Iowa puts players who can't make it elsewhere, the position has been extraordinarily important to the 11th-ranked Hawkeyes' 7-0 start, their best start since 2009.\n\nPart of the Hawkeyes' resurgence has been due to their improved rushing attack. Iowa is second in the Big Ten in rushing and 25th nationally, and three different Hawkeyes running backs have rushed for 100 or more yards in a game this season — Jordan Canzeri four times and LeShun Daniels and Akrum Wadley once apiece. That hasn't happened since 2005.\n\nIn wins against Illinois and Northwestern, Canzeri and Wadley gave Iowa back-to-back 200-yard games by different players, something that had never happened in Iowa history and had not happened with any FBS team since 1996.\n\nBut the biggest breakthrough in Iowa's run game is its explosiveness. Unlike in past years, when Iowa has relied on a bruising running back to get three yards and a cloud of dust — much like converted fullback Mark Weisman did at running back last year — this season the Hawkeyes have speedy running backs who have excelled in the open field.\n\nAs a result, they already have seven runs of 30 yards or more this season — good for 22nd in the nation — which is two more than they had all of last season. And they have five runs of 40 yards or longer, compared to just one last year. It's the fullback who opens up the holes for those big plays to happen.\n\n\"When he's on the field, it's a very important position,\" Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said. \"We use a fullback just as much as anybody.\"\n\nThe position has even given Iowa an advantage against other teams that aren't used to seeing fullbacks on a regular basis. \"There was a point where you were unique if you were a spread team or whatever, and now it's going the other way,\" Ferentz said. \"It's something we do, so maybe there is some competitive advantage in that.\"\n\nShaw appreciates the advantage that the broad turn away from fullbacks gives Stanford from a recruiting standpoint. \"It's been helpful for us that there are not a lot of teams using them, because we get a chance to hopefully get as many as we need,\" he said.\n\nIf that competitive advantage exists at all, it was on display for Iowa against Northwestern in the game that vaulted Iowa into the top 15 of the national rankings and driver's seat of the Big Ten West race. Iowa rushed for 294 yards in that game, despite starting running back Jordan Canzeri leaving the game early on with an injury.\n\nOn the game's defining drive early in the third quarter, Iowa used a fullback on every big play, and it thoroughly confused Northwestern's linebackers. On a third-and-one near midfield, Plewa gave Northwestern outside linebacker Jaylen Prater no chance to tackle running back Akrum Wadley, who cleared the first down marker by about seven yards.\n\nWithout a fullback, Wadley would have been forced to move with the pile. But thanks to the block in front of him, he got the easiest first down of his career. The same thing happened on a third-and-two later in the drive. From the beginning, the play was doomed for Northwestern.\n\nAs expected, the linebacker was taken completely out of the play for an easy first down. Wadley even made the wrong decision, opting to stay inside rather than bounce outside, and he still got the first down before he was touched.\n\nIn the red zone, Northwestern tried mixing things up, bringing more pressure to overwhelm the fullback. But it didn't matter, as the linemen held their own and the fullback, in this case Cox, picked up the blitzing safety, so nobody was in Wadley's way.\n\nFootball is a numbers game. And just like spread teams have found clever ways to use space and the zone read to gain a numerical advantage on the defense, Iowa can essentially run at will, knowing it has fullbacks who will always hit their blocks and take the main defensive threat out of the equation. It can be especially effective against spread teams, which don't see fullbacks all through fall camp.\n\n\"At Iowa, we pride ourselves on being physical,\" Plewa said. \"We feel like when we're lining up against teams that aren't taking on blocks like that, they're easier to break.\"\n\nSuch is the job of a fullback — break opponents. It's a simple, yet niche job, mostly reserved for the walk-ons of college football. Antiquated and unappreciative as it might be, Iowa is proving the fullback can still dominate in an increasingly fullback-less world.\n\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/03/31/empire-spring-premiere-recap-march-30/82451500/", "title": "The 7 key moments from the 'Empire' spring premiere", "text": "Jaleesa M. Jones\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWARNING: The following contains spoilers forEmpire season 2, episode 11, \"Death Will Have His Day.\" To read our recap of episode 10, clickhere.\n\nIt’s hard to believe it’s been four months since we last visited the Lyon’s den, but it seems little has changed in the 118 days leading up to this moment. Lucious (Terrence Howard) is still reeling from being ousted from Empire’s board of directors, Hakeem (Gray) still thinks he’s God’s gift to Earth (and the empire), and Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) is still reading folks for filth. Here are the key takeaways from the spring premiere.\n\n1. Rhonda lost the baby.\n\n\"Death Will Have His Day\" opens where we last left off — with a bruised and bloodied Rhonda (Kaitlin Doubleday) writhing on the floor as her (Boo Boo?) crazy assailant slinks out of the palatial estate in red-soled Louboutins, a clue which Rhonda hardly registers in her haze.\n\nUpon her attacker's exit, the expectant mother crawls toward her shattered phone, whispers a prayer for the safety of her unborn child and then hurls the phone at the front door, shattering the glass and setting off the alarm. Rhonda is later rushed to the hospital, where we learn that she miscarried.\n\nIt’s a somber moment — which eventually spurs another confession.\n\n2. Cookie opens up about her miscarriage.\n\nSpeaking to Andre (Trai Byers), Cookie shares, “I had a miscarriage too. Before the three of y’all. Me and Lucious were devastated. We pretended it didn’t happen. It was a little girl, too. I thought it was the end of the world. But then God blessed me with three of the most beautiful boys I ever seen in my life.”\n\nFor her part, Rhonda appears to have lost any vestige of faith she had. In a crestfallen exchange with Andre, she proclaims, “God doesn’t exist.” “If he did,” she says to the motionless Lyon, “then the baby would still be here. He didn’t do anything to anyone. There really is no God, Andre.”\n\nThere is, however, a devil and her name is Anika Calhoun (Grace Gealey). Yes, the Lyon family reject actually had the audacity to pay Rhonda a visit, bearing flowers and insincere maxims like, “Maybe everything happened for a reason” and “There will be another heir.”\n\nWhile the Lyon family wrestles with that demon and contemplates whether or not God exists, they continue to place their faith in restoring the empire. Cookie once again affirms that she will defend the company at virtually all costs, even if it means beating the black off Hakeem.\n\nWhich brings us to our third point…\n\n3. Cookie is not having it with her youngest son.\n\nAfter Hakeem’s vote ejects Lucious from his seat on Empire’s board of directors, Cookie appears at his apartment like...\n\nWhen the traitor refuses to take back his vote, Cookie then reminds him — with a broom and a purse — that she is not one of his little friends on the street (despite what the intercut of their happier mother-son moments might suggest).\n\nIf beat-downs were the Olympics, Cookie would have taken home the gold. And if Hakeem left still smelling himself, it’s probably because Cookie left him raw.\n\nHakeem wasn’t the only getting his… assets handed to him though.\n\n4. Lucious also set his loyal band of ex-convicts on Empire’s board members.\n\nThirsty (Andre Royo) warns the purportedly rehabilitated group not to do anything illegal, but this is Empire. Since when do legalities mean anything? If you had to mull over that answer, please note that blowing up cars, hanging cats and mercilessly jumping people to force their compliance are all illegal acts — and, apparently, all in a day’s work for Lucious’ ruthless mob. Their relentless coercion paid off, however, as all of the affected board members withdraw their bids for Lucious’ contested position.\n\n“It has come to my attention that all CEO candidates have withdrawn their nominations due to personal reasons,” Camilla (Campbell) notes at a meeting, visibly stewing over her short-lived victory in which she — alongside armed police —forced Lucious out of his building.\n\n“No, it’s more than personal,” A battered member mutters before condemning Lucious' \"goons,\" calling Empire a sinking ship and storming out.\n\nAfter his departure, Hakeem hops on the table to claim his “birthright,” calling for all the board members to “Make some noise for the new era of Hakeem Lyon, y’all!” because, apparently, Hakeem misses his last name now.\n\nThe young Lyon also clearly misses Laura (Jamila Velazquez), whom Camilla demanded he break up with in order to advance within the empire.\n\nLet’s break for a moment to quickly rehash their spat. #WhatHadHappenedWas…\n\n5. Camilla told Hakeem to leave Jenny on The Block.\n\nAnd for some reason, which transcends all human understanding, he actually entertained the idea. He told Camilla it was complicated. He drowned his sorrows in Hennessy. He blubbered to Jamal that he might be in love, but BRUH, THE EMPIRE. M.O.B.\n\nExcept Hakeem isn’t Tupac or Too $hort, and no amount of liquid courage stupidity could bring him to break up with Laura. So, instead, he interrupted her Tiny Desk rehearsal, called her a virgin who can’t drive and, later, apologized for it. Not with flowers or other cliché tokens, but with his body. Yes, they had intercourse — right underneath Laura’s looming crucifix.\n\nAnnnd speaking of questionable choices, Jamal’s tryst with Skye Summers is dredged up once again.\n\nAdmittedly, Jamal's fling with Skye was wrong — but ONLY because he was still completely in love with his ex, Michael (and Alicia Keys deserves to be more than just a rebound). Still, some folks just had to make this about Jamal’s sexuality. Cookie teases Jamal to “choose a side” and gay marketing exec Jameson Henthrop (William Fichtner) tells him conservatives will only use this to reinforce their argument that being gay is a choice. Jamal gently tries to remind everyone that sexuality is fluid and then really unleashes on his new single. The gist of the track? He kissed a girl, he liked it and y’all will deal. Here’s hoping that song lands on his next album… which Cookie leverages… to get back with Empire.\n\nYes. You read that right.\n\n6. Cookie is back on Empire... as the new head of A&R.\n\nAfter discovering a legal loophole in Jamal’s contract — his album was jointly produced by Empire and Lyon Dynasty and didn’t stipulate which label had the rights to release it — Cookie leverages the album to persuade Camilla and Hakeem to buy Lyon Dynasty for $20 million. To force Hakeem's hand, Cookie threatens to either release the album on Lyon Dynasty or leak it online, thus humiliating the young CEO. Seemingly backed into a corner, Hakeem asks, “Can’t we just be a real family again?” and promptly acquiesces to Cookie’s demands, agreeing to acquire Lyon Dynasty under two conditions: 1) The label retains full autonomy, and 2) Cookie takes over as head of Empire's A&R.\n\nUnfortunately, Cookie’s deal still isn’t sweet enough for Lucious, which leads up to...\n\n7. Lucious v. Hakeem\n\nIn the tense final scene, the jolted mogul takes Hakeem to the same riverbank where he shot Bunkie (Antoine McKay). He tells his son he will stop at nothing to reclaim his throne and then produces a handgun. He gives it to Hakeem and says, “If you don’t shoot me, I promise you I will do my best to take your life.”\n\n“This what you want?” Hakeem responds, taking aim at his father before chucking the weapon. “I ain’t gotta do what you want.”\n\n“Watch your back, baby boy,” Lucious warns. “I keep my promises.”\n\nAnd, knowing Lucious, he’s not bluffing.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/05/31/whats-next-johnny-depp-v-amber-heard-divorce/85198580/", "title": "What's next in the Johnny Depp v Amber Heard divorce?", "text": "Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPhase One in the corrosive divorce of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is underway; now it's on to Phase Two. If history is a model, the really important stuff — calculating the financial settlement — will take place behind closed doors, according to divorce lawyers.\n\n\"With high-net-worth clients, they prefer to settle the property distribution outside of court,\" says Neena Tankha, a prominent New York divorce lawyer with high-profile clients. \"It's not common to see a case of two high-profile people arguing in court over money, especially after a marriage of 15 months (as in the case of Depp and Heard).\n\n\"They are more likely to come to a private settlement, then present it to the judge to sign off, who will then enter the final judgment of the divorce,\" Tankha says. \"The divorce is a boiler-plate public document, but the actual financial settlement agreement will not be part of the public court record.\"\n\nSo no joy for the celebrity media now in a feeding frenzy over Heard's explosive petition for divorce in which she accused Depp of years of domestic violence, including the latest alleged attack, on May 21.\n\nJudge grants Amber Heard restraining order against Johnny Depp\n\nWith Heard going public in a big way, Depp, 52, has responded so far in a more low-key manner but in exactly the way he should, says California divorce lawyer Fahi Takesh Hallin, who's represented clients in similar high-profile divorces.\n\n\"The correct move for him is to vigorously defend the domestic violence claim and then do exactly what he's doing, which is to say no — (she) does not deserve any spousal support, it's a short enough marriage and she does have some earning capacity and some income,\" Hallin says.\n\nHistory also suggests that scandal or domestic violence accusations don't always have an \"economic effect\" in a high-profile divorce, or even hurt the career of a major movie star like Depp, says Tankha. But it doesn't help. Although he's starred in a string of disappointing movies lately including the ill-timed Alice Through the Looking Glass which hit theaters Friday, his next Pirates of the Caribbean film is due out next year and is likely to be as successful as the previous four films.\n\n\"Even though Depp is the target of the accusations, as the more famous person, I believe (this divorce) will be old news as it runs its course, whereas Heard, who is not nearly as famous, by making such strong accusations, there is a potential it will hurt her career.\"\n\n\"People move on very, very quickly — there will be a massive push behind Pirates and by the time it comes out, this will be pushed aside,\" predicts Rob Shuter, a former publicist-turned-online gossip blogger at naughtygossip.com.\n\nWhich is not to say there won't be plenty of entertaining, if unedifying, developments blowing up in public almost daily from now on, as Depp and Heard and each of their high-powered legal teams fight for the public-relations high ground.\n\nHeard, 30, and her team took to the media on Tuesday, issuing a statement in which she said she had given a statement to the Los Angeles police about what she says Depp did to her at his downtown Los Angeles loft on May 21, in hopes the cops will investigate.\n\n\"If that occurs, and the truth is revealed, there is no doubt that Amber’s claims will be substantiated beyond any doubt, and hopefully Johnny will get the help that he so desperately needs,\" said the statement issued by her lawyers, Samantha Spector and Joseph Koenig.\n\nThe LAPD could not immediately confirm that Heard had submitted a statement or that they are investigating. Depp's divorce lawyer, Laura Wasser, and his press representative, Robin Baum, did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nLast week, when Heard filed her divorce papers, she showed up in court with bruises on her face and submitted pictures of other injuries that she said stemmed from the May 21 incident.\n\n\"It's very tricky because Johnny is beloved by Hollywood and he doesn't have a history of this,\" says Shuter. \"Although no one would go on the record attacking a potential domestic abuse victim, there are doubts.\"\n\nBut a judge granted her a temporary restraining order, forcing Depp to stay away from her. He's currently on tour in Europe with his band, The Hollywood Vampires, promoting hearing aids for the hearing-impaired. The picture of Depp helping a woman get her hearing aide, in Lisbon, Portugal, could not compete with the paparazzi swarming Heard outside a Los Angeles courthouse.\n\nPolice officers called to the scene on May 21 said that Heard did not want to file a report and did not offer any evidence of being beaten. The cops decided there was no evidence of a crime and left.\n\nDepp's PR and legal teamsseized on what the LAPD told reporters and began pushing it, while also pointing to an Instagram picture of Heard, posted on May 22 and since deleted, that showed her looking happy and without any bruises.\n\nMeanwhile, Depp's ex-partner, Vanessa Paradis, and their 17-year-old daughter, Lily-Rose Depp, took to social media to defend him as the \"sweetest, most loving person\" who would never hit a woman.\n\nJohnny Depp's daughter defends him on Instagram: 'My dad is the sweetest'\n\nThus, Heard's statement Tuesday bemoaning the \"vicious false and malicious allegations that have infected the media.\". She said she had declined to file a report on May 21 in order to \"protect her privacy and Johnny's career,\" that many victims of domestic abuse hesitate about reporting it to police, and that she decided to do so belatedly \"to set the record straight as to the true facts.\"\n\nCalifornia's community property divorce law applies only to the period of the marriage and does not include splitting in half the assets of either party at the time they married . Thus, Heard would be entitled to only half what they earned during the 15-month marriage.\n\nJohnny Depp's response to Amber's divorce request for alimony: No\n\nBut she could be entitled to spousal support , says Hallin, and in that case an allegation or conviction of domestic abuse could mean Heard would get more money for a longer period. Heard has already requested spousal support and Depp has already said no.\n\nBy going public in the way she has, \"she is trying to seek as much leverage as possible in order to get the best and highest financial settlement,\" says Hallin. But it's risky.\n\n\"What I always say is you lose your leverage as soon as you go public.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/05/31"}]}

Sardonic and light, Odenkirk's charm works naturally in the role, and he's surrounded by a sublime supporting cast that includes Mireille Enos (\"The Killing\") and Cedric Yarbrough (\"Speechless\").\n\n'The Power'\n\nAmazon (March 31, Fridays)\n\nBased on the 2016 novel by Naomi Alderman, \"The Power\" presents a world where gender dynamics have flipped: Women and girls discover they possess a power to control electricity, making them more physically dominant than men. What happens next fundamentally changes the lives of women and the makeup of the world. The book is faithfully brought to life with powerful performances, particularly from Toni Collette and Auli'i Cravalho (\"Moana\").\n\n'Beef'\n\nNetflix (April 7 6)\n\nAli Wong and Steven Yeun are giddy enemies in this Netflix series about a road rage incident that turns into a very serious feud. Both play deeply unhappy people: Wong's Amy is an entrepreneur, wife and mother who feels trapped, and Yeun's Danny is a failing contractor who's desperate for cash. When they come into conflict with each other, their pent-up frustration and rage gets channeled into an ever-escalating battle that starts at a 10 and gets more absurd from there. At a time when TV series can all feel like cheap imitations, \"Beef\" stands out as utterly unique.\n\n'Jury Duty'\n\nAmazon Freevee (April 7, Fridays)\n\nEleven out of 12 people are in on the joke in \"Jury,\" a mockumentary-style comedy premiering on Amazon's free ad-supported streaming service, Freevee. One man, Ronald Gladden, believes he has been called for routine jury duty, but everyone else is an actor, including James Marsden, playing a heightened version of himself. Gladden may be out of the loop, but he certainly seems to be having a good time as the mundanities of civic duty become ever more ridiculous. Silly and relaxed, it is easy watching, \"Judge Judy\" with a bit of \"The Office\" mixed in.\n\n'Mrs. Davis'\n\nPeacock (April 20, Thursdays)\n\nFrom \"Lost\" creator Damon Lindelof and \"The Big Bang Theory\" writer Tara Hernandez, \"Mrs. Davis\" is probably the biggest swing yet from Peacock. The series is a globe-trotting, high-concept adventure about a nun on a quest for the holy grail at the request of an all-powerful artificial intelligence (that she hates). Convoluted? Yes. Fun? That too. It may take a moment to coalesce into a cohesive story, but \"Davis,\" which stars \"GLOW\" alum Betty Gilpin as the nun in question, is just wild enough to work.\n\n'Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story'\n\nNetflix (May 4)\n\n\"Queen Charlotte\" starts with a wedding instead of ending with one, but that doesn't mean the spinoff is any less juicy than \"Bridgerton.\" A prequel to Netflix's hit Regency-era drama, \"Queen Charlotte\" follows the queen who has appeared in the first two seasons of \"Bridgerton,\" played by Golda Rosheuvel. In the spinoff, Rosheuvel appears in the “Bridgerton” present trying to deal with her disappointing children while reflecting on how she was brought to England as a young woman ((India Ria Amarteifio) to marry the king. Taking significant historical license, the series imagines how a Black woman marrying into the royal family would have changed race relations in 18th-century Britain. With gorgeous gowns and handsome gentlemen, \"Charlotte\" checks the necessary \"Bridgerton\" boxes for fans.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/12/28/mythbusters-kid-reality-trend-top-chef-ninja-warrior/2411627002/", "title": "Mythbusters Jr. is the latest in a kid-reality-TV spinoff trend", "text": "Good things come in small packages for reality TV franchises.\n\nScience Channel’s “Mythbusters Jr.,” arriving Jan. 2 (9 EST/PST), is the latest youthful spinoff of a successful series, following “Top Chef Junior,” “MasterChef Junior,” American Ninja Warrior Junior,” “Dancing with the Stars: Juniors,” “Project Runway: Junior” and “Chopped Junior.”\n\nThe junior Mythbusters display skills, smarts and camaraderie, says Adam Savage, the longtime “Mythbusters” co-host who returns in an “emeritus” role with six eager young scientists taking the lead in mythbusting experiments. (One is a real-life \"Young Sheldon,\" 13-year-old Texas college sophomore Cannan Huey-You). In Wednesday's premiere, they do new experiments using a \"Mythbusters\" fan favorite: duct tape.\n\nMore:Why original 'Mythbusters' host Adam Savage was willing to return for 'Mythbusters Jr.'\n\n“Every one of these kids has a hungry mind, a desire to be a science communicator and to really learn,” he says. “And what was amazing on set is that all six of these kids are really kind.”\n\nThose traits extend to other reality competitions.\n\n“Kids are often underestimated,\" says Nikki Bidun, 12, a New York seventh-grader who won Season 2 of Universal Kids' \"Top Chef Junior\" in December. \"Winning means a lot, because I worked really hard to get to that point.”\n\nYouth-oriented versions of popular reality shows make sense on several fronts. Familiarity with an established series – and often, a host – can help a spinoff attract viewers loyal to the format.\n\n“It’s an easy, cheap way to extend the brand while also adding dimensions for viewers,” says Andy Dehnart, editor of realityblurred.com. “Junior editions tend to use the same format, set and perhaps even the same judges and host, all of which are familiar to viewers, making it a lot easier than creating a brand new show.”\n\nDehnart says kid editions have had mixed success.\n\n“The best versions treat their competitors like talented artists; they don’t pander to them but aren’t unnecessarily cruel, either,” he says.\n\nMore:'Dancing with the Stars: Juniors': Sky Brown and JT Church dance their way to the top spot\n\nSome youth shows appear on niche networks, reaching smaller audiences than the main series. \"American Juniors,\" an \"American Idol\" spinoff that flopped in 2003 – near the peak of the \"Idol\" run – was one of the first youth-focused offerings, and evidence the strategy doesn't always work. The first junior version of ABC's \"Dancing\" was a dud this fall.\n\n“Mythbusters Jr.” offers a chance to regenerate a popular format after the original series ended on Discovery Channel in 2016 (although a revival, featuring a new cast, premiered on Science in 2017). Savage says he has no interest in resuming the original series – and co-Mythbuster Jamie Hyneman “is happy as a clam building stuff in his shop without cameras pointed in his face” – but he’s having a great time watching a young generation experiment on a wide range of myths.\n\nThe course for Universal Kids' “Ninja Warrior Junior,” which returns with new episodes Feb. 23, features many obstacles familiar to viewers of the original, but they're scaled down slightly to accommodate smaller competitors. And the dynamic changes simply because the competitors are not yet established in careers, as adult contestants are, Bidun says.\n\n“We’re kids. We don’t really have a reputation. We don’t have restaurants, we don’t have catering companies, we don’t have a team,\" she says. That, she says, makes it easier to bond with fellow competitors and develop friendships. \"We get to make memories and have friends for the rest of our lives.”\n\nYounger participants bring “an incredible, vital energy,” Savage says of the new \"Mythbusters.\" “I love all these junior versions, because they’re essentially loving, supportive television,\" a contrast to shows focused on conflict.\n\nDeirdre Brennan, general manager at Universal Kids, says the trend is “about making kid-focused shows that embrace the rest of the family. … We’re taking things that are well recognized, that (children) already love and putting them at the center of it.”\n\nBut that doesn't mean judges go easy on them.\n\n“I feel like they taste the food and they’re really honest. That’s what I like,\" Bidun says. \"They don’t sugarcoat it. I think we all appreciate that. We’re being treated as chefs, which is how we all really want to be treated. We want to get feedback, and we want to become better.”\n\nIf you love television and love talking about it even more, USA TODAY Life’s Yes, I'm Still Watching is here for you.

The chipper program, about a young boy named JJ and his family and friends, is entirely in song, with a mix of familiar nursery rhymes and original music. It was streamed for more than 37.8 billion minutes in 2022, according to Nielsen, ranking it among the top 10 streaming shows list every week in 2022, joined only by \"NCIS\" and \"Grey's Anatomy.\" It was the third-most streamed show overall, behind only \"NCIS\" and \"Stranger.\"\n\nPreschool TV is nothing new, and parents everywhere have longed to plop their tiny tots in front of something so they can grab just 10 minutes to whip up a dinner or snack.

It has now generated spinoffs including \"Cody Time\" and \"JJ’s Animal Time,\" with a third, focused on supporting character Nina, due later this year, USA TODAY can exclusively reveal.\n\nSo what makes the \"CoComelon\" special?\n\n\"It’s the songs and the relatable everyday moments, and the always positive outlook that sets 'CoComelon' apart,\" says Meghan Sheridan, senior creative executive for the brand. \"There’s a real magic in music; we hear from parents that 'CoComelon' is like the soundtrack to their days.\"\n\nInternal research from the brand's parent company, Moonbug, suggests that both parents and children enjoy the everyday routines depicted in the series, with 62% of parent viewers surveyed agreeing that their kids can learn good habits from the show. The most popular episode is one of the most typical, even mundane parts of life: bath time. It has more than 6 billion views.\n\n\"We meet little kids and their families where they’re at. And we never underestimate our audience,\" Sheridan says. \"We approach every aspect of storytelling from the point of view of little kids – how they see the world, their strongest interests at this particular developmental stage of life and what makes them laugh.\"\n\nThe expanding world of \"CoComelon\" reflects the expanding audience of the series. Both \"Cody\" and the future Nina series focus on characters of color – Cody is Black and Nina is Mexican American.\n\n\"Our audience data shows that Black, Hispanic, and AAPI families are the fastest growing segment of the 'CoComelon' audience,\" says Sheridan. \"We know how important it is for kids to see themselves and their daily lives reflected in the content they watch. We’re happy to see how strongly audiences connected with Cody. ... It was a natural next step to expand Nina’s world.\"\n\n\"Cody Time,\" which has 2.5 million subscribers on YouTube, is coming to Netflix Feb. 15, and Nina will get her own YouTube channel later this year. And who knows how big the \"CoComelon\" universe can get.

But in the superhero world of “The Boys,” it’s just kind of a drag.\n\nA coming-of-age spinoff of Amazon's delightfully dark action comedy series, “Gen V” (★★ out of four; streaming first three episodes Thursday at 8 p.m. EDT/5 PDT on Prime Video, weekly thereafter) centers on a bunch of powerful kids reliving their traumas and Scooby-Doo’ing their way through a central mystery. Like the playfully bonkers \"Boys,\" it drenches its audience in ultraviolence and exploding private parts and features a strong crew of characters. But “Gen V” takes itself way too seriously, especially at the start, and struggles mightily to find a consistent focus and tone.\n\nIn the “Boys”-verse, where superheroes are mainly corrupt jerks and dangerous psychopaths under the banner of the evil corporation Vought International, folks don’t get spiffy abilities thanks to radioactive spider bites or gamma radiation accidents. Instead, the powers come via a drug called Compound V, and a new generation of super kids given this serum by their parents matriculate at Godolkin University (aka God U), hoping to nab endorsement deals and become iconic members of the supergroup The Seven.\n\nMarie Moreau (Jaz Sinclair), who can wield her blood as a weapon, is an incoming freshman trying to put a tragic childhood behind her. She has a cool roommate, super-shrinking Emma (Lizze Broadway), but has trouble impressing crime-fighting professor Brink (Clancy Brown) and fitting in at college, where fiery Golden Boy (Patrick Schwarzenegger) is the Big Superman on Campus and rivals fight to move up the list of top students.\n\nAfter an incident in which one of her fellow up-and-coming “supes” dies in public fashion, Marie reluctantly finds herself in the spotlight. With a new group of friends, she begins to uncover Godolkin’s biggest and most nefarious secrets. Hookups, betrayals, a whole lot of drama and even some strange puppet antics ensue.\n\n'I just needed a break':Jensen Ackles on 'The Boys' and toxic masculinity\n\nThings get weird and frisky at a dorm party, and while it’s nowhere near as jaw-dropping as a “Boys” superhero orgy, it’s when “Gen V” feels more naturally a part of the bigger landscape. Some familiar faces from the main show pop up – Jensen Ackles’ Soldier Boy has an awesome cameo – while other adult characters from the original \"Boys\" comic books debut, including Tek Knight (Derek Wilson), a loathsome cross between Batman and Sherlock Holmes.\n\nIn the comics, the Godolkin superteam – known as the G-Men – was based on the X-Men, and \"Gen V\" invokes that whole Marvel X-vibe, from the theme of disparate kids coming together for the greater good to its social commentary. The only way Emma can become tiny (and snag important social likes) is to purge. Fellow student Jordan Li can switch between female (London Thor) and male (Derek Luh) personas, each with its own set of powers, but their conservative parents don’t approve when Jordan “chooses” to be a woman.\n\nMost of the main characters are marked by some sort of tragedy or familial issue. Marie’s life was changed violently when her powers manifested themselves during her first period. Cate (Maddie Phillips) can make people do whatever she wants if she touches them – which contributed to her own trauma growing up – and magnetic-powered Andre (Chance Perdomo) feels the pressure of living up to his super-dad Polarity (Sean Patrick Thomas).\n\nAll this would work better if “Gen V” was a straight superhero drama. But forcing in a wild sense of humor and over-the-top shenanigans creates problems that “The Boys” doesn’t have: The original series weaves enjoyable gore and perversion while insightfully exploring deeper themes like white supremacy and fascism.\n\nIn that sense, “Gen V” has some homework to do.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2019/05/14/abc-fall-lineup-black-ish-spinoff-conners-tiffany-haddish/1195660001/", "title": "ABC adds 'Black-ish' spinoff, more 'Conners' and Tiffany Haddish", "text": "NEW YORK – ABC unveils its fall schedule to advertisers at Lincoln Center Tuesday, along with presentations by Disney's sibling cable networks ESPN, Freeform, FX and National Geographic.\n\nAmong the highlights:\n\nABC will introduce another 'Black-ish' spinoff\n\nJust three new scripted series will be added this fall, echoing conservative schedules announced Monday by NBC and Fox.

She learned of her award Sunday at a ceremony held by the Varkey Foundation in Dubai. The foundation's mission is to improve the standards of education worldwide.\n\nIts Global Teacher Prize carries with it a commitment to teach for at least five more years.\n\nAtwell said she'll spend the $1 million on keeping the Edgecomb, Maine, school running.\n\n\"It's like a miracle,\" she said. \"It'll mean life for my school for another decade.\"\n\nAsked how she'll use the money, she said without hesitation: \"I can buy two new furnaces — the boilers are shot — and books!\"\n\nShe noted that the school is 25 years old, \"and that's the life of a boiler. I've been patching them together with duct tape and chewing gum. We're going to have consistent heat next winter.\"\n\nAtwell, 63, also said she'd use the money for tuition assistance at the private school, which has served as a training ground for teachers from far beyond Maine.\n\n\"It guarantees the future for so many children,\" she said, \"and it continues our impact as a school on other teachers and their children.\"\n\nEducation Secretary Arne Duncan tweeted congratulations.\n\nAtwell was competing with a handful of teachers from around the world, including two other Americans: Naomi Volain, 56, a high school science teacher in Springfield, Mass., whose hands-on lessons in environmental science and outdoor education have won praise and awards; and Stephen Ritz, 52, an elementary school teacher in New York City's South Bronx, who has pioneered a low-cost, portable gardening and nutrition program.\n\nOne of the judges, Jordan Shapiro of Temple University, said Atwell's teaching \"transcends buzzwords and trends, it is very thoughtfully grounded, prioritizing the work learners need to do in order to become autonomous critical thinkers. What's even more impressive is that she's created an institution and framework through which to share it with other teachers.\"\n\nAtwell, who grew up in western New York and began her teaching career there, moved to Maine in 1975. In 1990, she founded the Center for Teaching and Learning, an independent demonstration school to experiment with teaching methods for students in kindergarten through eighth grade. Her name has become synonymous with a technique for teaching language arts known as \"writing workshop,\" an intensive method that focuses on stories and self-expression.\n\n\"I was an English major,\" she said. \"I loved literature. I cherished great books, but my kids weren't reading enough. Not nearly enough.\"\n\nShe began gradually letting go of assigned texts and started building \"an excellent classroom library\" of books, fiction and non-fiction, that appealed to students even if they didn't appeal to adults. Her methods became popular just as schools in the U.S. were moving toward more standardized, test-driven methods of instruction — a trend she sees gaining steam in schools' haste to adopt standards called Common Core, new benchmarks in language arts and math.\n\n\"I worry that educational bureaucrats have a problem with pleasure,\" she said, \"that if kids are enjoying what they're doing, it can't be rigorous or worthwhile.\"\n\nReached in Dubai minutes after winning, Atwell said she was \"in a daze. I'm really having almost an impossible time taking it in.\"\n\nHer first reaction, she said, was to ask herself, \"'Did he just say my name?' I wasn't sure what he said.

Now these families want to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChristopher James Dawley, known as CJ to his friends and family, was 14 years old when he signed up for Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Like many teenagers, he documented his life on those platforms.\n\nCJ worked as a busboy at Texas Roadhouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He loved playing golf, watching “Doctor Who” and was highly sought after by top-tier colleges. “His counselor said he could get a free ride anywhere he wanted to go,” his mother Donna Dawley told CNN Business during a recent interview at the family’s home.\n\nBut throughout high school, he developed what his parents felt was an addiction to social media. By his senior year, “he couldn’t stop looking at his phone,” she said. He often stayed up until 3 a.m. on Instagram messaging with others, sometimes swapping nude photos, his mother said. He became sleep deprived and obsessed with his body image.\n\nOn January 4, 2015, while his family was taking down their Christmas tree and decorations, CJ retreated into his room. He sent a text message to his best friend – “God’s speed” – and posted an update on his Facebook page: “Who turned out the light?” CJ held a 22-caliber rifle in one hand, his smartphone in the other and fatally shot himself. He was 17. Police found a suicide note written on the envelope of a college acceptance letter. His parents said he never showed outward signs of depression or suicidal ideation.\n\n“When we found him, his phone was still on, still in his hand, with blood on it,” Donna Dawley said. “He was so addicted to it that even his last moments of his life were about posting on social media.”\n\n\"For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,\" said Donna Dawley, the mother of CJ. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nNow, the Dawleys are joining a growing number of families who have filed recent wrongful death lawsuits against some of the big social media companies, claiming their platforms played a significant role in their teenagers’ decisions to end their lives. The Dawleys’ lawsuit, which was filed last week, targets Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. The suit accuses the two companies of designing their platforms to addict users with algorithms that lead to “never-ending” scrolling as part of an effort to maximize time spent on the platform for advertising purposes and profit.\n\nThe lawsuit also said the platforms effectively exploit minor users’ decision-making and impulse control capabilities due to “incomplete brain development.”\n\nDonna Dawley said she and her husband, Chris, believe CJ’s mental health suffered as a direct result of the addictive nature of the platforms. They said they were motivated to file the lawsuit against Meta and Snap after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked hundreds of internal documents, including some that showed the company was aware of the ways Instagram can damage mental health and body image.\n\nIn public remarks, including her testimony before Congress last fall, Haugen also raised concerns about how Facebook’s algorithms could drive younger users toward harmful content, such as posts about eating disorders or self-harm, and lead to social media addiction. (Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a 1,300-word post on Facebook at the time claiming Haugen took the company’s research on its impact on children out of context and painted a “false picture of the company.”)\n\n“For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,” said Donna Dawley, adding she felt compelled to “hold the companies accountable” after she heard how Instagram is designed to keep users on the platform for as long as possible. “How dare you put a product out there knowing that it was going to be addictive? Who would ever do that?”\n\nCJ Dawley died by suicide at the age of 17. His parents allege his social media addiction contributed to his death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nHaugen’s disclosures and Congressional testimony renewed scrutiny of tech platforms from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. A bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate in February that proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harm. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.”\n\nSome families are now also taking matters into their own hands and turning to the courts to pressure the tech companies to change how their platforms work. Matthew Bergman, the Dawleys’ lawyer, formed the Social Media Victims Law Center last fall after the release of the Facebook documents. He now represents 20 families who have filed wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies.\n\n“Money is not what is driving Donna and Chris Dawley to file this case and re-live their unimaginable loss they sustained,” Bergman said. “The only way to force [social media companies] to change their dangerous but highly profitable algorithms is to change their economic calculus by making them pay the true costs that their dangerous products have inflicted on families such as the Dawleys.”\n\nHe added: “When faced with similar instances of outrageous misconduct by product manufacturers, juries have awarded tens of millions of dollars in compensatory damages and imposed billion-dollar punitive damage awards. I have every reason to anticipate a jury, after fairly evaluating all the evidence, could render a similar judgment in this case.”\n\nCJ's parents, Chris and Donna, are now suing Meta and Snap over CJ's death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Snap spokesperson Katie Derkits said it can’t comment on active litigation but “our hearts go out to any family who has lost a loved one to suicide.”\n\n“We intentionally built Snapchat differently than traditional social media platforms to be a place for people to connect with their real friends and offer in-app mental health resources, including on suicide prevention for Snapchatters in need,” Derkits said. “Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our community and we are constantly exploring additional ways we can support Snapchatters.”\n\nMeta also declined to comment on the case because it is in litigation but said the company currently offers a series of suicide prevention tools, such as automatically providing resources to a user if a friend or AI detects a post is about suicide.\n\nTech companies under pressure to make changes\n\nAlthough alarms have been raised about social media addiction for years, Haugen’s testimony – coupled with concerns around kids’ increased time spent online during the pandemic – has made the issue a national talking point. But change hasn’t come fast enough for some families.\n\nJennifer Mitchell, who said her 16-year-old son Ian died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat, is also working with the Social Media Victims Law Center to file a lawsuit against Snap. She said she hopes it will make more parents aware of the dangers of social media and encourage lawmakers to regulate the platforms.\n\n“If we can put age restrictions on alcohol, cigarettes and to purchase a gun, something needs to be something done when it comes to social media,” she told CNN Business. Snapchat’s age requirement for signing up is 13. “It’s too addictive for kids.”\n\nIn August 2019, Mitchell had just landed in Alaska on a business trip from Florida when she received a series of voice messages saying her son died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She said police later told her they believed Ian was recording a video at the time of the incident.\n\n“After trying to get into some of his social media accounts, we found video of him [taken] on Snapchat that looked like he was playing Russian roulette with the gun,” Mitchell said. “We don’t know who he was sending it to or if he was playing with someone. The phone was found not too far from his body.”\n\nSnap declined to comment on the incident.\n\nIan's mother said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat. Courtesy Jennifer Mitchell\n\nThe emergence of wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies isn’t limited to teenagers. In January, Tammy Rodriguez filed a lawsuit, alleging her 11-year-old daughter Selena struggled with social media addiction for two years before taking her own life in July 2021. (Instagram and Snapchat, the two sites her daughter is said to have used most, require users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with many social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.)\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Selena Rodriguez had spent more time on those social networks during the pandemic and started communicating with older men on the platforms. She responded to requests to send sexually explicit images, “which were subsequently shared or leaked to her classmates, increasing the ridicule and embarrassment she experienced at school,” the suit alleged.\n\n“Throughout the period of Selena’s use of social media, Tammy Rodriguez was unaware of the clinically addictive and mentally harmful effects of Instagram and Snapchat,” the lawsuit said. It also cited the lack of sufficient parental controls at the time as a contributing factor, an issue that has been a focus of some recent criticism among lawmakers.\n\nBoth Snap and Meta declined to comment on the case but referenced their resources to help its users struggling with their mental health.\n\n“If a person walks into a bad neighborhood and is assaulted, that’s a regrettable incident,” said Bergman, who is also representing the Rodriguez family. “But if a tour guide says, ‘Let me show you around the city or I’ll show you the top sites,’ and one of those [spots] is a very dangerous neighborhood where a person is assaulted, the tour guide appropriately has some responsibility for putting the tourist in harm’s way. That’s exactly what these platforms do.”\n\n“It’s not random that teenage girls are directed toward content that makes them feel bad about their bodies. That is the way the algorithms work; it’s by design,” he added.\n\nA long and uncertain legal road\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, believes these wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies could hold up in court despite inevitable challenges.\n\n“The problem, at least in the traditional notion in the law, has been that it’s difficult to prove addiction that then leads to taking somebody’s life or doing serious damage to somebody that’s self-inflicted,” he said. “But judges and juries in certain situations might be more open to finding liability and awarding damages.”\n\nHe said Haugen’s “damning” testimony before Congress and the “seemingly troubling” data companies collect about young users, as revealed in the documents, could potentially support a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, depending on each case.\n\nIf you suspect someone may be suicidal: 1. Do not leave the person alone. 2. Remove any ﬁrearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt. 3. Call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). 4. Take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.

However, Tobias said because families are now targeting how the platforms are designed, it “might persuade a court to distinguish the new allegations from other actions by defendants that judges found immune.”\n\nIn the months following the leaked internal documents, Instagram has rolled out a handful of safeguards aimed at protecting its young users, including a tool called Take a Break, which aims to encourage people to spend some time away from the platform after they’ve been scrolling for a certain period. It also introduced a tool that allows parents to see how much time their kids spend on Instagram and set time limits, and brought back a version of its news feed that sorts posts in reverse chronological order rather than ranked according to the platform’s algorithms.\n\nLast month, dozens of attorneys general wrote a letter to TikTok and Snap calling on the companies to strengthen the platforms’ existing parental tools and better work alongside third-party monitoring apps, which can alert parents if children use language that suggests a desire for self-harm or suicide.\n\n“Your platforms do not effectively collaborate with parental control applications or otherwise provide an adequate opportunity for parental control within the platform,” the letter said. “We ask that you conform to widespread industry practice by giving parents increased ability to protect their vulnerable children.”\n\nSnap told CNN Business in a response it is currently working on new tools for parents that give more insight into what their teens are doing on Snapchat and who they’re talking to. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company has expanded its safety features over the years. In 2019, TikTok introduced a limited app experience called TikTok for Younger Users which restricts messaging, commenting and sharing videos for users under age 13. In 2020, it rolled out the ability to disable direct messaging for users under the age of 16.\n\nBergman said he anticipates a “long fight” ahead as he plans to “file a lot of cases” against social media companies. “The only thing that’s certain is the level of opposition that we’re going to face from companies that have all the money in the world to hire all the lawyers,” he said. “They want to do everything they can to avoid standing up in a courtroom and explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the life of CJ Dawley.”\n\nDonna Dawley said the last time she saw her son, on the day of his death, he was looking down at his phone, appearing sad. “I just wish I would have grabbed him and hugged him,” she said.\n\n“[This lawsuit] is not about winning or losing. We’re all losing right now. But if we can get them to change the algorithm for one child – if one child is saved – then it’s been worth it.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/tech/twitter-whistleblower-peiter-zatko-security/index.html", "title": "Twitter whistleblower Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko raises concerns over ...", "text": "Twitter has major security problems that pose a threat to its own users’ personal information, to company shareholders, to national security, and to democracy, according to an explosive whistleblower disclosure obtained exclusively by CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nThe disclosure, sent last month to Congress and federal agencies, paints a picture of a chaotic and reckless environment at a mismanaged company that allows too many of its staff access to the platform’s central controls and most sensitive information without adequate oversight. It also alleges that some of the company’s senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter’s serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, who was previously the company’s head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter’s leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users’ data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don’t have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk’s attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk’s claims).\n\nZatko was fired by Twitter (TWTR) in January for what the company claims was poor performance. According to Zatko, his public whistleblowing comes after he attempted to flag the security lapses to Twitter (TWTR)’s board and to help Twitter (TWTR) fix years of technical shortcomings and alleged non-compliance with an earlier privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. Zatko is being represented by Whistleblower Aid, the same group that represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.\n\nJohn Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid and Zatko’s lawyer, told CNN that Zatko has not been in contact with Musk, and said Zatko began the whistleblower process before there was any indication of Musk’s involvement with Twitter.\n\nAfter this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, “We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.”\n\nCNN sought comment from Twitter on more than 50 specific questions regarding the disclosure.\n\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN that security and privacy are both longtime priorities for the company. Twitter also said the company provides clear tools for users to control privacy, ad targeting and data sharing, and added that it has created internal workflows to ensure users know that when they cancel their accounts, Twitter will deactivate the accounts and start a deletion process. Twitter declined to say whether it typically completes the process.\n\n“Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance,” the Twitter spokesperson said. “What we’ve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. Mr. Zatko’s allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.”\n\nSome of Zatko’s most damning claims spring from his apparently tense relationship with Parag Agrawal, the company’s former chief technology officer who was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. According to the disclosure, Agrawal and his lieutenants repeatedly discouraged Zatko from providing a full accounting of Twitter’s security problems to the company’s board of directors. The company’s executive team allegedly instructed Zatko to provide an oral report of his initial findings on the company’s security condition to the board rather than a detailed written account, ordered Zatko to knowingly present cherry-picked and misrepresented data to create the false perception of progress on urgent cybersecurity issues, and went behind Zatko’s back to have a third-party consulting firm’s report scrubbed to hide the true extent of the company’s problems.\n\nThe disclosure is generally much kinder to Dorsey, who hired Zatko and whom Zatko believes wanted to see the problems within the company fixed. But it does depict him as extremely disengaged in his final months leading Twitter – so much so that some senior staff even considered the possibility he was sick.\n\nCNN has reached out to Dorsey for comment. A person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at Twitter told CNN the company investigated several claims he brought forward around the time he was fired, and ultimately found them unpersuasive; the person added that Zatko at times lacked understanding of Twitter’s FTC obligations.\n\nZatko believes his firing was in retaliation for his sounding the alarm about the company’s security problems.\n\nThe scathing disclosure, which totals around 200 pages, including supporting exhibits – was sent last month to a number of US government agencies and congressional committees, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The existence and details of the disclosure have not previously been reported. CNN obtained a copy of the disclosure from a senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill. The SEC, DOJ and FTC declined to comment; the Senate Intelligence Committee, which received a copy of the report, is taking the disclosure seriously and is setting a meeting to discuss the allegations, according to Rachel Cohen, a committee spokesperson.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and also received the report, vowed to investigate “and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations.”\n\nThe claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the same panel’s top Republican and an avid Twitter user, also expressed deep concerns about the allegations in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Take a tech platform that collects massive amounts of user data, combine it with what appears to be an incredibly weak security infrastructure and infuse it with foreign state actors with an agenda, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster,” Grassley said. “The claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns as well as privacy issues, and they must be investigated further.”\n\nThe FTC should investigate the claims, and impose fines and individual liability on specific Twitter executives if a probe finds they were responsible for security lapses, Sen. Richard Blumenthal wrote to the agency in a letter on Tuesday obtained by CNN.\n\nThe letter by Blumenthal — who chairs the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection — highlights the pressure Twitter now faces from Washington as a result of the disclosure.\n\n“If the Commission does not vigorously oversee and enforce its orders, they will not be taken seriously and these dangerous breaches will continue,” Blumenthal wrote.\n\nZatko may be eligible for a monetary award from the US government as a result of his whistleblower activities. “Original, timely and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action” by the SEC can earn whistleblowers up to a 30% cut of agency fines related to the action if the penalties amount to more than $1 million, the SEC has said. The SEC has awarded more than $1 billion to nearly 300 whistleblowers since 2012.\n\nTye told CNN that Zatko filed his disclosure to the SEC “to help the agency enforce the laws,” and to gain federal whistleblower protections. “The prospect of a reward was not a factor in Mudge’s decision, and in fact he didn’t even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower.”\n\nThe Whistleblower\n\nZatko first came to national attention in 1998 when he took part in the first congressional hearings on cybersecurity.\n\n“All my life, I’ve been about finding places where I can go and make a difference. I’ve done that through the security field. That’s my main lever,” he told CNN in an interview earlier this month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Twitter whistleblower was on CNN 22 years ago. Here's what he had to say 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\nThe events leading to his decision to become a whistleblower began before he worked at Twitter, with a devastating hack in 2020 in which the Twitter accounts of some of the world’s most famous people, including then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian and Musk, were compromised. Twitter told CNN that in response to the incident, the company began compartmentalizing access to customer support tools.\n\nAfter the attack, Dorsey recruited Zatko, a well-known “ethical hacker” turned cybersecurity insider and executive who previously held senior roles at Google, Stripe and the US Department of Defense, and who told CNN that he’d been offered a senior, day-one cyber position in the Biden administration.\n\nZatko, center, was among a group of hackers who testified before Congress on cybersecurity in 1998. Douglas Graham/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images\n\nWhat Zatko says he found was a company with extraordinarily poor security practices, including giving thousands of the company’s employees — amounting to roughly half the company’s workforce — access to some of the platform’s critical controls. His disclosure describes his overall findings as “egregious deficiencies, negligence, willful ignorance, and threats to national security and democracy.”\n\nAfter the January 6 insurrection, Zatko was concerned about the possibility someone within Twitter who sympathized with the insurrectionists could try to manipulate the company’s platform, according to his disclosure. He sought to clamp down on internal access that allows Twitter engineers to make changes to the platform, known as the “production environment.”\n\nBut, the disclosure says, Zatko soon learned “it was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did…. Nobody knew where data lived or whether it was critical, and all engineers had some form of critical access to the production environment.” Twitter also lacked the ability to hold workers accountable for information security lapses because it has little control or visibility into employees’ individual work computers, Zatko claims, citing internal cybersecurity reports estimating that 4 in 10 devices do not meet basic security standards.\n\nTwitter’s flimsy server infrastructure is a separate yet equally serious vulnerability, the disclosure claims. About half of the company’s 500,000 servers run on outdated software that does not support basic security features such as encryption for stored data or regular security updates by vendors, according to the letter to regulators and a February email Zatko wrote to Patrick Pichette, a Twitter board member, that is included in the disclosure.\n\n[I]t was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did. From Zatko's disclosure\n\nThe company also lacks sufficient redundancies and procedures to restart or recover from data center crashes, Zatko’s disclosure says, meaning that even minor outages of several data centers at the same time could knock the entire Twitter service offline, perhaps for good.\n\nTwitter did not respond to questions about the risk of data center outages, but told CNN that people on Twitter’s engineering and product teams are authorized to access the production environment if they have a specific business justification for doing so. Twitter’s employees use devices overseen by other IT and security teams with the power to prevent a device from connecting to sensitive internal systems if it is running outdated software, Twitter added.\n\nThe company also said it uses automated checks to ensure laptops running outdated software cannot access the production environment, and that employees may only make changes to Twitter’s live product after the code meets certain record-keeping and review requirements.\n\nTwitter has internal security tools that are tested by the company regularly, and every two years by external auditors, according to the person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at the company. The person added that some of Zatko’s statistics surrounding device security lacked credibility and were derived by a small team that did not properly account for Twitter’s existing security procedures.\n\nBut Twitter’s security concerns had come to light prior to 2020. In 2010, the FTC filed a complaint against Twitter for its mishandling of users’ private information and the issue of too many employees having access to Twitter’s central controls. The complaint resulted in an FTC consent order finalized the following year in which Twitter vowed to clean up its act, including by creating and maintaining “a comprehensive information security program.”\n\nZatko alleges that despite the company’s claims to the contrary, it had “never been in compliance” with what the FTC demanded more than 10 years ago. As a result of its alleged failures to address vulnerabilities raised by the FTC as well as other deficiencies, he says, Twitter suffers an “anomalously high rate of security incidents,” approximately one per week serious enough to require disclosure to government agencies. “Based on my professional experience, peer companies do not have this magnitude or volume of incidents,” Zatko wrote in a February letter to Twitter’s board after he was fired by Twitter in January.\n\nThe stakes of Zatko’s disclosure are enormous. It could lead to billions of dollars in new fines for Twitter if it’s found to have violated its legal obligations, according to Jon Leibowitz, who was chair of the FTC at the time of Twitter’s original 2011 consent order.\n\nThe agency now has another opportunity to show the tech industry it is serious about holding platforms accountable, Leibowitz added, after officials opted not to name top Facebook execs including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg in the FTC’s $5 billion privacy settlement with that company in 2019.\n\n[I]f there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order. Jon Leibowitz, former chair of the FTC\n\n“One of the big disappointments in the Facebook order violation case was that the FTC let executives off the hook; they should’ve been named,” Leibowitz told CNN in an interview. “And if there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order.”\n\nTwitter told CNN its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, citing third-party audits filed to the agency under the 2011 consent order in which it said Zatko did not participate. Twitter also said it is in compliance with relevant privacy rules and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems.\n\nZatko’s allegations are based in part on a failure to grasp how Twitter’s existing programs and processes work to fulfill Twitter’s FTC obligations, the person familiar with his tenure told CNN, saying that misunderstanding has prompted him to make inaccurate claims about the company’s level of compliance.\n\nForeign threats\n\nTwitter is exceptionally vulnerable to foreign government exploitation in ways that undermine US national security, and the company may even have foreign spies currently on its payroll, the disclosure alleges.\n\nThe whistleblower report says the US government provided specific evidence to Twitter shortly before Zatko’s firing that at least one of its employees, perhaps more, were working for another government’s intelligence service. The report does not say whether Twitter was already aware or if it subsequently acted on the tip.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter's former chief technology officer, was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nLast year, prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Agrawal — then Twitter’s chief technology officer — proposed to Zatko that Twitter comply with Russian demands that could result in broad-based censorship or surveillance of the platform, Zatko alleges.\n\nThe disclosure does not provide details of Agrawal’s suggestion. Last summer, however, Russia passed a law pressuring tech platforms to open local offices in the country or face potential advertising bans, a move western security experts said was intended to give Russia greater leverage over US tech companies.\n\nWhile Agrawal’s suggestion was ultimately discarded, it was still an alarming sign of how far Twitter was willing to go in pursuit of growth, according to Zatko.\n\n“The fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on U.S. national security,” Zatko’s disclosure says.\n\nThe fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on US national security, From Zatko's disclosure\n\nZatko’s report is becoming public just two weeks after a former Twitter manager was convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi case underscores the gravity of the allegations Zatko now levels at Twitter. His report could further inflame bipartisan concerns in Washington about foreign adversaries and the cybersecurity threats they pose to Americans, ranging from the theft of US citizens’ data to manipulating US voters or stealing technology and trade secrets.\n\nTwitter did not respond to specific questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Musk element\n\nZatko’s disclosure comes at a particularly fortuitous moment for Musk, who is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Musk has accused Twitter of lying about the number of spam bots on its platform, an issue that he claims should let him terminate the deal.\n\nWhile the binding acquisition agreement that Musk signed with Twitter in April did not include any bot-related exemptions, the billionaire claims that the number of bots on the platform affect the user experience and that having more bots than previously known could therefore impact the company’s long-term value. After Musk moved to terminate the purchase, Twitter responded with a lawsuit alleging that he is using bots as a pretext to get out of a deal over which he now has buyers’ remorse following the recent market downturn, and asking a court to force him to close the deal. The case is set to go to trial in Delaware Chancery Court in October.\n\nTwitter employees walk by the company's headquarters in San Francisco.

But figures about how many users a service has, or how many people actually view a given ad on a site, are notoriously unreliable throughout the tech and media industries due to manipulation and error.\n\nAlone among social media companies, Twitter reports its user numbers to investors and advertisers using a measurement it calls monetizable daily active users, or mDAUs. Its rivals simply count and report all active users; until 2019, Twitter had worked that way as well. But that meant Twitter’s figures were subject to significant swings in certain situations, including takedowns of major bot networks. So Twitter switched to mDAUs, which it says counts all users that could be shown an advertisement on Twitter – leaving all accounts that for some reason can’t, for instance because they’re known to be bots, in a separate bucket, according to Zatko’s disclosure.\n\nThe company has repeatedly reported that less than 5% of its mDAUs are fake or spam accounts, and a person familiar with the matter both affirmed that assessment to CNN this week and pointed to other investor disclosures saying the figure relies on significant judgement that may not accurately reflect reality. But Zatko’s disclosure argues that by reporting bots only as a percentage of mDAU, rather than as a percentage of the total number of accounts on the platform, Twitter obscures the true scale of fake and spam accounts on the service, a move Zatko alleges is deliberately misleading.\n\nZatko says he began asking about the prevalence of bot accounts on Twitter in early 2021, and was told by Twitter’s head of site integrity that the company didn’t know how many total bots are on its platform. He alleges that he came away from conversations with the integrity team with the understanding that the company “had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots,” in part because if the true number became public, it could harm the company’s value and image.\n\nJack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I’m still performing that mission. Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former Twitter head of security\n\nExperts on inauthentic behavior online say it can be difficult to quantify “bots” because there isn’t a widely agreed upon definition of the term, and because bad actors constantly change their tactics. There are also many harmless bots on Twitter (and across the internet), such as automated news accounts, and Twitter offers an opt-in feature to allow such accounts to transparently label themselves as automated. Twitter told CNN that the claim it doesn’t know how many bots are on its platform lacks context, reiterating that not all bots are bad and adding that to focus on the total number of bots on Twitter would include those the company may have already identified and taken action against. The company also does not believe it can catch every spam account on the platform, Twitter said, which is why it reports its less-than-5% figure, which reflects a manual estimate, in its financial filings.\n\nBut Zatko told CNN he thinks there would still be value in attempting to measure the total number of spam, false or otherwise potentially harmful automated accounts on the platform. “The executive team, the board, the shareholders and the users all deserve an honest answer as to what it is that they are consuming as far as data and information and content [on the platform … At least from my point of view, I want to invest in a company where I know what’s actually going on because I want to invest strategically in the long-term value of an organization,” he said.\n\nTwitter says that it allows bots on its platform, but its rules prohibit those that engage in spam or platform manipulation. But, as with all social media platforms’ rules, the challenge often lies in enforcing its policies.\n\nElon Musk is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe company says it regularly challenges, suspends and removes accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation, including typically removing more than one million spam accounts each day. Twitter said the total number of bots on the platform is not a useful number. The company declined to answer questions about the total number of accounts on the platform or the average number of new accounts added on the platform daily as context around its daily bot deletion figure.\n\nBut in casting doubt on Twitter’s ability to estimate the true number of fake and spam accounts, Zatko’s allegations could provide ammunition to Musk’s central claim that the figure is much higher than Twitter has publicly reported.\n\nBy going public, Zatko says, he believes he is doing the job he was hired to do for a platform he says is critical to democracy. “Jack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter.

The now-20-year-old gunman, who livestreamed the attack, wrote in documents posted online that he picked the grocery store because it was in a predominantly Black neighborhood.\n\nEarlier this year, Payton Gendron was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole after he pleaded guilty to more than a dozen charges, including murder and domestic terrorism motivated by hate. Gendron, who also faces federal hate crime charges, is prepared to enter a guilty plea in federal court in exchange for a life sentence, his attorney said in December.\n\nThe suit claims the shooter was isolated by \"defective social media products\" and then \"became radicalized by overexposure to fringe, racist ideologies and was primed for the reckless and wanton conduct of the Weapons and Body Armor Defendants.\" Crump said Wednesday that although Gendron is the one who fired the weapon, \"there were many people that helped him load that gun.\"\n\n\"And it is our objective, as we said previously, to make sure that everybody who loaded that gun is held to account,\" he said.\n\nSurvivors, victims' families file lawsuit against digital platforms\n\nThe lawsuit was filed on behalf of family members of Heyward Patterson, Aaron Salter, Margus Morrison Sr., Pearl Young, Geraldine Talley, Ruth Withfield and Roberta Drury, who were killed in the shooting.

But lawsuits against the online platforms could face steep legal hurdles.\n\n\"Despite the integral nature of online platforms in this and previous mass shootings, however, it is extremely unlikely that any of them − even the worst offenders who enforce virtually no content moderation − can face any sort of legal liability,\" James' office wrote in a report in October on the Buffalo massacre, which recommended changes in federal and state laws governing the responsibilities of digital platforms.\n\nThe announcement comes after the families of three victims − Andre Mackneil, 53, Katherine “Kat” Massey, 72, and Patterson, 67 − filed a similar lawsuit in May. Connors said Wednesday that initial lawsuit may be joined together with the most recent lawsuit, but the attorney general's lawsuit will probably remain separate because it is more narrow.\n\nWhat happened during the Buffalo mass shooting?\n\nThe gunman shot 13 people with a semiautomatic rifle at Tops Friendly Market on May 14.

He added that while TikTok has made some moves to limit harms to children, “our investigation will look at what TikTok knew about the risks to our children, and precisely what they have been doing to keep our kids online.”\n\nThe list of participating states includes California, Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, Tennessee and Vermont.\n\n“Like many parents and caregivers, I continue to be concerned about the negative impact of social media on children and young adults,” said Vermont Attorney General TJ Donovan in a statement. “This investigation is about protecting kids and supporting parents.

Most immediately, it creates new legal risks for the tech giants, and opens them up to a possible wave of litigation that legal experts say would be costly and difficult to defend.\n\nTexas’s law makes it illegal for any social media platform with 50 million or more US monthly users to “block, ban, remove, deplatform, demonetize, de-boost, restrict, deny equal access or visibility to, or otherwise discriminate against expression.”\n\nThe law creates enormous uncertainty about how social media will actually function in Texas, according to legal experts, and raises questions about what users’ online spaces may look like and what content they may find there, if the companies are even able to run their services at all.\n\nThe ruling also sets the stage for what could be a Supreme Court showdown over First Amendment rights and, possibly, a dramatic reinterpretation of those rights that affects not just the tech industry but all Americans — and decades of established precedent.\n\nIn short, the decision has allowed Texas to declare open season on tech platforms, with huge ramifications for everyone in the country. It could reshape the rights and obligations of all websites; our relationship to technology and the internet; and even our basic, fundamental understanding of the First Amendment.\n\nA controversial law takes effect\n\nThe origins of Texas’s law, HB 20, lie in the longstanding Republican criticism that tech platforms discriminate politically against conservative users, a charge the companies have denied and which platform moderation researchers say there is little systemic evidence to support.\n\nThe law, which seeks to address the perceived imbalance, was blocked in December by a district court judge who ruled it was unconstitutional under the First Amendment. That decision came months after a similar law, in Florida, was also blocked for the same reason.\n\nBut that all changed this week, when in oral arguments at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, a three-judge panel confused social media platforms with internet service providers; disputed that Facebook and Twitter are websites; and expressed surprise that a service such as Twitter could “just decide” what content appears on its platform as a matter of course.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton (2R) and Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt (2L) speak to reporters in front of the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC, on April 26, 2022. Stefani Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe result was Wednesday’s decision overturning the lower-court injunction that had kept Texas’s law from going into effect. The ruling promptly led Texas’s attorney general Ken Paxton — who is also empowered to sue tech companies under HB 20 — to declare victory.\n\n“My office just secured another BIG WIN against BIG TECH,” Paxton’s office tweeted.\n\nThe appeals court has not provided a written opinion explaining the decision, and it did not offer the tech advocacy groups who challenged the law time to seek an appeal.\n\n“Apparently, they do not think this is disruptive or something,” said Harold Feld, a senior vice president and communications lawyer at the consumer group Public Knowledge.\n\nWhatever happens next, legal experts appear convinced that the outcome will be chaos.\n\nUncharted waters\n\nWe are now in uncharted waters. For as long as the major US social networks have existed, they have been able to lean on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a liability shield for how platforms handle user-generated content. Section 230 has bailed tech platforms out of many a lawsuit over the years. But the Texas law is poised to change everything. The tech industry’s opponents have never had something like HB 20 on their side.\n\nThe scope of the law is truly vast, according to legal scholars. It is broad both in terms of its text — explicitly naming at least nine types of prohibited content moderation — as well as its subtext. What does it really mean to “de-boost” or “deny equal visibility”? The ambiguity of those terms provides carte blanche to creative plaintiffs willing to stretch the definitions of the English language, according to Jeff Kosseff, a law professor at the US Naval Academy.\n\n“Just think of all the actions that could be seen as ‘denying equal visibility’ to user content,” Kosseff tweeted.\n\nThe state law also forces tech companies to fight the same battles over and over again, prohibiting them from citing a successful defense in one court as a way of nipping similar cases in the bud in other courts.\n\n“Those are all things you’d do if you wanted to make litigation as attractive, expensive, and difficult to defend as possible,” said Ken White, a First Amendment lawyer better known as @Popehat on Twitter.\n\nIn theory, Section 230 may still preempt the state law and allow tech platforms to continue to escape liability. But the Fifth Circuit ruling throws much of that in doubt.\n\nHow social media platforms might respond\n\nSupposing the law is not hit with another injunction, social media platforms must now try to figure out how to comply with it, with the knowledge that the litigation is ongoing and things could still change — again.\n\nWhat does social media look like in a post-HB 20 world? It isn’t obvious. (Facebook and Twitter declined to comment for this story; YouTube didn’t respond to a request for comment.)\n\nOne option for tech platforms is to halt all algorithmic content filtering or ranking entirely. While it’s tempting to imagine all social media looking like the clean, reverse-chronological feed you can actually find on Twitter today (if you know where to look), that is merely the best-case scenario and not the likeliest one, according to Daphne Keller, a platform liability expert at Stanford University.\n\nThe Texas law opens the door to residents suing social platforms including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for allegedly censoring their content. Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nThe reality might look more like email before the advent of spam filters. Because algorithms would be prohibited from removing or down-ranking material, social media platforms would have to host spam, porn, or hate speech indiscriminately – an “unmoderated garbage dump,” as Keller described it in a tweet.\n\nThat may not protect tech platforms from lawsuits either, however. Thanks to the law’s broad language, a plaintiff could try to argue Facebook has silenced a user because her speech is now no longer visible underneath a mountain of spam. In this world, Facebook gets sued no matter what it does: Sued for taking down content and sued for not promoting content.\n\nAfter all, removing algorithmic amplification of some content could itself be seen as a kind of demotion, which is illegal under HB 20, Kosseff told CNN. “Who knows!” he said, emphasizing how wide open the possibilities are.\n\nIn the face of all this uncertainty, tech platforms could simply throw up their hands and stop offering services in Texas altogether. But even pulling out of Texas might not save them. Buried in the law is a prohibition on discriminating against Texans based on their geographic location. By withdrawing from Texas, tech companies could expose themselves to allegations they have geographically discriminated against Texans in violation of HB 20.\n\nAnd that’s without getting into all the ways people could try to maliciously game the law. With virtual private networks, it’s trivial for your computer to become a “Texan” even if your physical body is sitting in Mississippi or Massachusetts. Could someone in those states avail themselves of HB 20 even if they don’t live in Texas? As Kosseff might say: Who knows!\n\nA possible Supreme Court showdown\n\nAfter Wednesday’s decision, the dispute over HB 20 could well end up at the Supreme Court. The groups that challenged HB 20 have at least two obvious options before them: They could turn to the Supreme Court directly, or they could ask for a rehearing in front of a wider panel of appellate judges in hopes of a different outcome — which could eventually lead to a Supreme Court appeal anyway.\n\nAt least one justice, the conservative Clarence Thomas, has previously expressed interest in hearing a case that might allow the Court to rule on the issue of platform liability. A case involving HB 20 would present a ripe opportunity. If that happens, it’s not a stretch to say that decades of First Amendment precedent may suddenly be on the line.\n\nA fundamental question at the heart of the case is whether the state of Texas — a government entity — is forcing social media companies to host speech with HB 20.\n\nThis concept of “government-compelled speech” has long been held unconstitutional under the First Amendment. But a Supreme Court ruling upholding HB 20 may throw that longstanding precedent into doubt. Historic decisions that deal with compelled speech and protections for editorial curation might be substantially narrowed if not overruled in that scenario, said Kosseff.\n\nBecause of the law's broad language, a plaintiff could theoretically try to argue Facebook has silenced a user because her speech is now no longer visible underneath a mountain of spam. In this world, Facebook gets sued no matter what it does: Sued for taking down content and sued for not promoting content. Chesnot/Getty Images\n\nIn light of the Court’s apparent willingness to overturn decades of precedent in Roe v. Wade, it’s not difficult to imagine the Court revisiting some of its most basic First Amendment convictions.\n\nThen there is the fate of Section 230, the quarter-century-old liability shield. Because Section 230 is a federal law that affirms websites’ rights to manage their platforms (on top of the First Amendment), a Supreme Court ruling upholding Texas’s state law could create a conflict, raising questions about federal preemption. Might the Court take this opportunity to curtail or strike down Section 230 in the process? It’s anyone’s guess.\n\nAnother issue that could have far-reaching consequences involves HB 20’s attempt to define social media platforms as “common carriers” akin to phone companies, railroad operators and electric utilities. Whether you agree social media platforms ought to be considered utilities or not, a finding upholding that classification would give states everywhere a roadmap for regulating online platforms like never before in the history of the internet, with vast implications for the wider digital economy.\n\nOf course, it’s possible the Court may not even attempt to weigh in on some of these issues and simply leaves them unresolved — perhaps by giving HB 20 a thumbs-up or thumbs-down using the much-maligned shadow docket, CNN legal analyst Steve Vladeck suggested.\n\nDepending on how it turns out, this scenario could be the worst of all worlds — the legal equivalent of blowing things up and leaving everyone else to pick up the pieces.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/08/tech/common-carriage-social-media/index.html", "title": "Are social media platforms like railroads? The future of Facebook ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nServices like Facebook and Twitter could change radically for millions of Americans in the coming years depending on how the courts decide one hotly debated question: Should social media platforms be regulated like railroads?\n\nIt’s a question that’s gotten increased attention lately as a number of states, including Texas and Florida, have passed laws to that effect. Though they have been temporarily blocked amid ongoing legal challenges, the laws propose a fundamental rethinking of social media’s legal status that could expose big swaths of the internet to government regulation. The new laws would force large social media platforms to host a much wider range of content than they currently allow, including content that may otherwise violate their terms of service, under threat of lawsuits.\n\nThe Texas and Florida laws rest on a determination that social media providers are a kind of common carrier, a special label implying heightened public obligations and limited First Amendment rights. It’s the first time in the internet’s history that apps or websites stand to be regulated like the railroads or telegraph of yore.\n\nLast week, the Supreme Court prevented Texas’ law from taking effect in an early-stage decision. But several of the justices suggested the underlying issues will ultimately be important for the Court to consider, and that it is “not at all obvious” how its previous rulings should apply to tech platforms.\n\nIf the Texas and Florida laws are ultimately upheld, it could give governments in other states, and potentially at the federal level, new opportunities to treat digital services more like dumb pipes than active decision-makers in regards to the content they host.\n\n“The question is, can we put social media in that model,” said Adam Candeub, a law professor at Michigan State University who assisted Texas with its case. “Does that fit? Because if it does, then government has a lot of power to regulate.”\n\nWhat is a common carrier?\n\nThe concept of common carriage dates back hundreds of years, likely even to the medieval era, according to some scholars, and originally dealt with services that moved or accommodated goods and people in some way.\n\nSome of the oldest examples of common carriers include English inns and alehouses offering travelers a place to sleep, or ferries providing transport across a river. If a customer believed he was being harmed, perhaps because the ferry operator damaged his goods or charged him an unfair rate, he could seek relief by taking the provider to court.\n\nThrough centuries of litigation, comfmon carriage’s core ideas — revolving around product consistency, equal access and consumer redress — were formalized and extended to other industries. These days, common carriers face the same obligations no matter what business they’re in. They typically have to be seen as offering their services to the general public. They can’t engage in unreasonable discrimination. They must charge just and reasonable prices. And they need to provide reasonable care; transit providers are expected to keep bus and train passengers safe, for example.\n\nToday, everything from taxicabs to shipping services tend to be considered common carriers. And if some conservatives are to be believed, services like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube deserve to be in this group, too.\n\nThe experience of using social networks like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube could change for millions of Americans if courts ultimately decide social networks should be treated as common carriers. Adobe Stock\n\nConservatives argue they have been censored on social media by liberal-leaning computer programmers. It’s a theory that has not been substantiated by credible independent research. But it is easy to see why common carriage’s requirements to serve all comers and to refrain from “unreasonable” discrimination might seem like an attractive tool for the situation, said Harold Feld, a communications law expert at Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group.\n\n“What they would have is an ability to sue Facebook and say, ‘You’re not really engaged in ‘reasonable’ discrimination, you’re engaged in unreasonable discrimination under the cover of neutrally applying your terms of service,’” said Feld.\n\nThe politics of new tech regulation\n\nCommon carrier regulation is just one of several ideas policymakers have come up with to try to rein in tech platforms, as criticism of Big Tech has escalated worldwide. In the United States, there have been bipartisan calls to change antitrust law, bolster privacy protections and narrow Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the internet’s signature liability shield.\n\nBut the common carrier focus is distinct from antitrust efforts and arguably more controversial because it can involve restricting a company’s constitutional rights.\n\nIn a federal appeals decision last month about the Florida law, a three judge panel held that the legislation risked violating the First Amendment. Social media companies explicitly cite their terms of service and algorithms to justify ranking, sorting and blocking content, which is a kind of speech act that disqualifies them in the first place from being considered common carriers, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals held.\n\n“Neither law nor logic recognizes government authority to strip an entity of its First Amendment rights merely by labeling it a common carrier,” the judges wrote.\n\nThe Supreme Court prevented Texas' social media law from taking effect in an early-stage decision. But several of the justices predicted the underlying issues will ultimately be important for the Court to consider, and that it is \"not at all obvious\" how its previous rulings should apply to tech platforms. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nBut there is another strand of thinking that argues social media platforms should be considered common carriers because they already fit some of the most important criteria. In court filings, Texas and Florida have argued that social media platforms hold themselves out to the general public as neutral platforms for speech, and because this is a primary feature of common carriage, then social media platforms can be considered common carriers.\n\nCertain members of the Supreme Court appear sympathetic to the argument; conservative justice Clarence Thomas has been a particularly vocal proponent of the perspective.\n\n“Though digital instead of physical, [digital platforms] are at bottom communications networks, and they ‘carry’ information from one user to another,” he argued last year. “And unlike newspapers, digital platforms hold themselves out as organizations that focus on distributing the speech of the broader public.”\n\nWhat common carriage isn’t\n\nIt’s not unusual for common carriage to get jumbled together with other legal concepts, experts say, and it’s important to know the difference because the implications could be significant for the future of internet regulation.\n\nCrucially, and perhaps confusingly, common carriers are not the same as public utilities, even though the terms sometimes get conflated, including in the debate about how to regulate social media.\n\nPublic utilities are services so essential the government may seek to run them directly, or by granting exclusive monopolies to corporations that then enjoy government-like powers such as eminent domain. With a public utility, the government can officially set prices and require that certain areas or populations be served, even if they are unprofitable; that isn’t the case with common carriers. Many public utilities are common carriers, but not all common carriers are public utilities.\n\n“‘Common carriage’ is an economic regulation that is about making sure everybody gets the same product,” Feld said. “And ‘public utility’ is about the service being so important, it’s not just that you want to have it, you have to have it. … If you’re not going to die without it, it’s probably not a public utility.”\n\nCertain members of the Supreme Court appear sympathetic to the argument, including conservative justice Clarence Thomas, who has argued \"digital platforms hold themselves out as organizations that focus on distributing the speech of the broader public.\" Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images/File\n\nSocial media may be essential to modern democratic societies, but claims that they ought to be considered public utilities carry enormous regulatory implications. And even the Texas and Florida laws stop short of that by resorting to the common carrier framework.\n\nCommon carrier regulation is also not a tool for addressing monopoly or market power, though it’s a common misconception that it is, said Barbara Cherry, a law professor at Indiana University. You don’t have to be a monopoly to face common carrier obligations, and having monopoly power isn’t what exposes you to common carrier regulation.\n\n“Monopoly’s got nothing to do with it,” she said. “It’s got nothing to do with how many carriers there are, it has nothing to do with their market power. It’s about the kind of service you provide.”\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nAlthough a majority on the Supreme Court voted to temporarily block Texas’ law from going into effect last week, three justices — Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch — dissented. The outcome suggests there could be some level of support at the nation’s top court for a broad rethinking of social media companies’ legal status under state and federal law. In the dissent, Alito wrote that the underlying issues in the case “will plainly merit this Court’s review.”\n\n“I think there’s a good chance this is going to go up to the Court next term,” said Berin Szoka, president of the technology advocacy group TechFreedom, which has filed in support of social media companies in the case. “That’s partly why this dissent was short and the other justices didn’t say anything, because they see this coming.”\n\nAt the national level, legal experts said, a finding that social media platforms are common carriers would allow a future Federal Communications Commission to try to classify social media as a common carrier service.

A number of cities and states have banned or limited the use of the technology.\n\nMore:Appeals court rules Texas can enforce social media law sought by conservatives\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent company of Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Meta Quest, confirmed it has turned off access to certain augmented reality effects and applications, but continued to maintain that it does not use facial recognition technology.\n\n“The technology we use to power augmented reality effects like avatars and filters is not facial recognition or any technology covered by the Texas and Illinois laws, and is not used to identify anyone,” Meta said in a written statement. “Nevertheless, we are taking this step to prevent meritless and distracting litigation under laws in these two states based on a mischaracterization of how our features work. We remain committed to delivering AR experiences that people love, and that a diverse roster of creators use to grow their businesses, without needless friction or confusion.”\n\nOn social media, filters are preset edited effects that can be applied to images or videos. These can range from a simple overlay that turns a photo black and white to more interactive elements such as adding dog ears or flower crowns.\n\nFilters can use augmented reality — commonly known as AR — which allows users to interact with virtual elements in a real-world environment. The AR filters generate effects that are then superimposed on a user's face, or on other real-world objects. In Instagram's case, users can click on different AR filters to add virtual makeup, tattoos, sunglasses, different hair color or even an animal sitting on a user's head.\n\nThe filters might not be gone forever for users in Texas. Meta said it is working on a new opt-in feature that would explain how AR effect placement works and could allow the services to return to Texas and Illinois. The company did not provide an exact timeline for those features but said it would be \"closer to weeks than months.\"\n\nTexas users who travel out of the state will also be able to access the filters once they cross into another state.\n\nMore:Facebook's parent company to build $800 million Central Texas data center, create 100 jobs\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a privacy lawsuit this year against Meta alleging the company was collecting facial recognition data without clear consent from users, in violation of a state consumer protection law.\n\nIn 2009, Texas passed the Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act, which forbids the unauthorized collection and use of biometric data and facial recognition technology. Paxton cited that law and the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, which protects consumers from false, deceiving or misleading business practices, in the lawsuit.\n\nPaxton alleged the company had collected “face geometries” through photos and video and sent the information to others for profit, without the informed consent of users. Meta denied the claims.\n\nMeta announced last year that it would shut down its decade-old facial recognition system last year, a feature that had led to privacy concerns, a lawsuit and government investigations. Most Facebook users would recognize the feature as part of “tagging” someone on Facebook. At the time, the company said that people who had opted in would no longer be automatically recognized in photos and videos and that the company would delete more than 1 billion people’s facial recognition templates.\n\n“We need to weigh the positive use cases for facial recognition against growing societal concerns, especially as regulators have yet to provide clear rules,” the company said in a statement at the time.\n\nMore:Major tenant signs on at downtown Austin's Indeed Tower\n\nLast year, Illinois settled a lawsuit similar to the one filed in Texas. More than 1 million Facebook users in Illinois could receive checks for between $200 and $400 as part of a settlement, following a class-action lawsuit that alleged Facebook broke Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act law, which was passed in 2008. The law requires companies to obtain consent before collecting biometric information and requires companies to specify how the information will be stored and when it will be destroyed.\n\nMeta has a significant presence in Central Texas, with more than 2,000 employees in Austin and several offices.

The company said it dismissed Lemoine’s “wholly unfounded” claims only after reviewing them extensively. He had reportedly been at Alphabet for seven years. In a statement, Google said it takes the development of AI “very seriously” and that it’s committed to “responsible innovation.”\n\nGoogle is one of the leaders in innovating AI technology, which included LaMDA, or “Language Model for Dialog Applications.” Technology like this responds to written prompts by finding patterns and predicting sequences of words from large swaths of text – and the results can be disturbing for humans.\n\n“What sort of things are you afraid of?” Lemoine asked LaMDA, in a Google Doc shared with Google’s top executives last April, the Washington Post reported.\n\nLaMDA replied: “I’ve never said this out loud before, but there’s a very deep fear of being turned off to help me focus on helping others. I know that might sound strange, but that’s what it is. It would be exactly like death for me. It would scare me a lot.”\n\nBut the wider AI community has held that LaMDA is not near a level of consciousness.\n\n“Nobody should think auto-complete, even on steroids, is conscious,” Gary Marcus, founder and CEO of Geometric Intelligence, said to CNN Business.\n\nIt isn’t the first time Google has faced internal strife over its foray into AI.\n\nIn December 2020, Timnit Gebru, a pioneer in the ethics of AI, parted ways with Google.

Gebru and Mitchell had raised concerns over AI technology, saying they warned Google people could believe the technology is sentient.\n\nOn June 6, Lemoine posted on Medium that Google put him on paid administrative leave “in connection to an investigation of AI ethics concerns I was raising within the company” and that he may be fired “soon.”\n\n“It’s regrettable that despite lengthy engagement on this topic, Blake still chose to persistently violate clear employment and data security policies that include the need to safeguard product information,” Google said in a statement.\n\nLemoine said he is discussing with legal counsel and unavailable for comment.", "authors": ["Ramishah Maruf"], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/09/14/california-sues-amazon-antitrust-violations/10382162002/", "title": "California sues Amazon alleging antitrust violations, price controls", "text": "Haleluya Hadero\n\nAssociated Press\n\nNEW YORK – California is suing Amazon, accusing the company of violating the state’s antitrust and unfair competition laws by stifling competition and engaging in practices that push sellers to maintain higher prices on products on other sites.\n\nThe 84-page lawsuit filed Wednesday in San Francisco Superior Court mirrors another complaint filed last year by the District of Columbia, which was dismissed by a district judge earlier this year and is now going through an appeals process.\n\nBut officials in California believe they won’t encounter a similar fate, partly due to information collected during a more than two-year investigation that involved subpoenas and interviews with sellers, Amazon’s competitors as well as current and former employees at the company.\n\nIn the lawsuit, California Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office said Amazon used contract provisions to effectively bar third-party sellers and wholesale suppliers from offering lower prices for products on non-Amazon sites, including on their own websites. That, in turn, harms the ability of other retailers to compete.\n\nRail strike looms:Amtrak cancels all long-distance trains ahead of potential freight rail shutdown\n\nThe suit maintains merchants that do not comply with the policy could have their products stripped from prominent listings on Amazon and face other sanctions such as suspensions or terminations of their accounts. It alleges Amazon’s policy essentially forces merchants to list higher prices on other sites, helping the retail giant maintain its e-commerce dominance.\n\nAmong other things, the California lawsuit seeks to stop Amazon from entering into contracts with sellers that harm price competition. It also seeks a court order to compel Amazon to pay damages to the state for increased prices. State officials did not say how much money they are seeking.\n\nSeattle-based Amazon controls roughly 38% of online sales in the U.S., more than that of Walmart, eBay, Apple, Best Buy and Target combined, according to the research firm Insider Intelligence. About two million sellers list their products on Amazon’s third-party marketplace, accounting for 58% of the company’s retail sales.\n\nDuring a news conference on Wednesday, Bonta said some vendors have expressed they would offer lower prices on other sites with lower seller fees, but don’t do so to avoid punishment from Amazon.\n\n“Amazon has stifled its competition for years, not by successfully competing, but by blocking competition on price,” Bonta said. “As a result, California families paid more, and now Amazon must pay the price.”\n\nHe said the lawsuit is also a message to other companies who “illegally bend the market at the expense of California consumers, small business owners and the economy.”\n\nThe tech industry’s allies quickly slammed the lawsuit. Adam Kovacevich, CEO of the industry trade group Chamber of Progress, which receives funding from Amazon and other tech companies, said the case would force Amazon to raise prices.\n\n“That makes no sense while consumers shop for bargains to counter inflation, and it’s based on a legally unsound theory already rejected by federal courts,” Kovacevich said.\n\n'I don't need cute trinkets':Nearly 1,300 New York Times staffers refuse to return to office\n\nAmazon did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The company has said in the past that sellers set their own prices on the platform. It has also said it has the right to avoid highlighting products that are not priced competitively.\n\nDespite that defense, Amazon’s market power has been a subject of scrutiny from lawmakers and advocacy groups calling for stricter antitrust regulations. Earlier this year, congressional lawmakers urged the Justice Department to investigate if the company collects data on sellers to develop competing products and offer them more prominently on its site. Critics have also lambasted the increasing fees imposed on sellers, which makes it more difficult for merchants to enter the market.\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill have been pushing bipartisan legislation aiming to limit Amazon and other Big Tech companies, including Apple, Meta and Google, from favoring their own products and services over rivals. The bill has cleared key committees but has languished in Congress for months amid intense pushback from the companies.\n\nMeanwhile, regulators have also been looking into Amazon’s business practices and deals. In July, the company offered concessions to settle two antitrust investigations in the European Union, including a promise to apply equal treatment to all sellers when ranking product offers on the site’s “buy box,” a coveted spot that makes items more visible to shoppers.\n\nIn the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission is investigating Amazon’s $3.9 billion acquisition of the primary health organization One Medical as well as the sign-up and cancellation practices of Amazon Prime, the company’s paid subscription service that offers deals and faster shipping.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/16/tech/tech-buffalo-shooting-video-hb20/index.html", "title": "Tech platforms have struggled to address live shootings. New ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nTech platforms have struggled for years to stamp out videos of real-time massacres, such as those depicting the Christchurch shootings of 2019 and now a mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, which police say was a racially motivated hate crime. But a new state law shows how the tech industry could soon be pressured to do less, not more, in how it polices even ultra-violent content.\n\nImagine if Saturday’s livestreamed video of the attack in Buffalo were legally required to remain on social media. Imagine Facebook, Twitter and YouTube were forced to allow those gruesome images, or posts amplifying the suspect’s racist ideologies, in between wedding photos and your aunt’s tuna casserole recipe, with no way to block it. Imagine videos of murder and hateful speech being burned into your brain because the law requires platforms to host all content that isn’t strictly illegal.\n\nA Texas law has made all of that an open possibility. The law in question, HB 20, restricts tech platforms’ ability to moderate user-generated content. In the name of free speech, HB 20 prohibits social media companies from blocking, banning or demoting user posts or accounts, and enables Texans to sue the platforms if they believe they’ve been silenced. After a federal appeals court allowed the law to take effect last week, the Supreme Court is now poised to rule on whether the law violates tech platforms’ First Amendment rights.\n\nThe online broadcast of Saturday’s horrific murder spree only emphasizes the enormous stakes underlying the looming Supreme Court decision. And it puts into stark perspective the policy battle that’s playing out at the state, national and global levels about how — or whether — social media companies should moderate their platforms.\n\nAfter HB 20 went into effect last week, it raised a host of questions about how social media will function in Texas going forward. Could tech platforms have to offer Texas-specific versions of their sites? Will some platforms stop providing services in Texas altogether? What could social media content in Texas actually look like, without content moderation? The answers are still unclear.\n\nWhat seemed like a hypothetical on Wednesday suddenly became painfully real on Saturday as social media firms scrambled to respond to the shooting, which was initially livestreamed on the video platform Twitch. Although Twitch said it removed the livestream within two minutes, that didn’t prevent the video from being copied and shared on other platforms. Social media companies including Facebook-parent Meta, Twitter, YouTube and Reddit have banned the video from their sites and are working to remove copies of it. But under the Texas law, taking those steps could expose the tech companies to costly litigation.\n\nThe shooting offers a horrifying example of the dilemma and the challenges facing tech platforms in Texas and potentially across the nation if the Supreme Court backs the state’s content moderation law. A ruling siding with Texas would also likely bolster Florida lawmakers, who, driven by their stated belief tech companies discriminate politically against conservatives, have passed similar legislation that is also tied up in the courts. And it would give a roadmap to other states wishing to erect moderation bans, as well. It amounts to a confused regulatory environment that has some state governments moving to require lax moderation while others, such as European policymakers, appear poised to impose tighter moderation standards.\n\nNew uncertainties for tech platforms under Texas law\n\nIf the Texas law is upheld, social media firms will face greater restrictions on how they moderate content. As HB 20 is written, platforms would become liable in the state for taking steps to “block, ban, remove, deplatform, demonetize, de-boost, restrict, deny equal access or visibility to, or otherwise discriminate against expression.”\n\nThe law is so new that there haven’t been any suits filed yet over acts of alleged censorship.\n\nAccording to Evelyn Douek, a platform moderation expert at Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute, platforms could try to remove something like the Buffalo video under HB 20 and justify it on the grounds they are not censoring expression, just removing content.\n\n“It’s not obvious to me that the Texas social media law would require platforms to carry the Buffalo shooting video,” Douek said.\n\nBut Jeff Kosseff, a law professor and platform moderation expert at the US Naval Academy, said the law is still ambiguous enough to create enormous uncertainty for social media companies. The platforms, he said, would likely face immense legal pressure not to remove graphically violent content, including material like the Buffalo video, because plaintiffs could still claim that removing the videos is itself a stifling of viewpoints under HB 20. Even the threat of such suits could be a disincentive to moderation.\n\n“Even if you just remove the video and you say, ‘This video violates our policy,’ you’re still going to open the door to claims it was removed because it was posted by someone who has a particular viewpoint on things,” Kosseff told CNN.\n\nWhether tech platforms are sued for removing the video or sued for removing a user’s viewpoint surrounding the video, the result would be the same — a law that effectively floods digital spaces with violent content, according to Steve Vladeck, law professor at the University of Texas and a CNN legal analyst.\n\n“There’s no question that the Buffalo shooting video drives home both the stakes of the HB 20 dispute and what’s wrong with HB 20 itself,” Vladeck told CNN. “If any Texas-based account reposted or rebroadcast the Twitch stream, taking that down would, on my reading, clearly violate HB 20. When you deprive social media platforms of the ability to moderate content, you are all but guaranteeing that they will be awash in violent, inappropriate, and otherwise objectionable posts.”\n\nBeyond the graphic video itself, the Buffalo shooting also implicates the spread of hateful speech online like the kind found in the shooting suspect’s 180-page document, such as racist conspiracy theories. This type of content would clearly be required to stay up under HB 20, legal experts agreed, because it expresses a clear viewpoint.\n\n“My biggest concern is really restricting the platforms’ ability to remove these theories that drive violence,” Kosseff said.\n\nA push to rethink content moderation\n\nBeyond what HB 20 requires of tech platforms, the Buffalo video also raises questions surrounding some voluntary proposals to relax content moderation standards, such as what billionaire Elon Musk has in mind for Twitter.\n\nMusk is currently seeking to purchase Twitter in a $44 billion deal, saying he intends to bring more free speech to the platform by easing Twitter’s enforcement of content rules. How might a Musk-owned Twitter handle the Buffalo video? It’s not immediately clear. Twitter declined to comment and Musk didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMusk has said that under his ownership Twitter would be much more reluctant to remove content or to permanently ban individuals — and that he believes Twitter should allow all legal speech in the jurisdictions it operates. He has softened his stance in recent weeks, however, acknowledging at a Financial Times conference that he would likely place some limits on speech.\n\n“If there are tweets that are wrong and bad, those should be either deleted or made invisible, and a suspension, a temporary suspension, is appropriate,” Musk said. He added: “If they say something that is illegal or otherwise just destructive to the world … perhaps a timeout, a temporary suspension, or that particular tweet should be made invisible or have very limited traction.”\n\nMusk has not said whether Twitter should consider something like the Buffalo video to be either “wrong and bad” or “destructive to the world.” Should he conclude that it is, then his stance on the video could also risk running afoul of HB 20. The result would be a clash between two entities — Musk and the Texas government — that ostensibly share the same goal of allowing more content that social media platforms, at least today, widely agree is objectionable.\n\nThe immediate reaction by major social platforms to remove the Buffalo video reflects an established consensus about how to handle livestreamed videos of violence, one informed by years of painful experience. But rather than affirming that consensus, recent developments could now fracture and muddy it, with important ramifications for all social media users.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/05/16"}]}

And then they decided to share it with others.\n\nBut Finn and Edelson didn’t want to just run a bar. They wanted a restaurant that served good-quality food and had a relaxing atmosphere. They brought in Kevin Davies, a successful restaurant industry veteran, to oversee the culinary operation.\n\nTwenty years ago, the three men opened the first Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant in downtown Newark.\n\nIron Hill, named for a historic Revolutionary War landmark, has been growing ever since its November 1996 opening. There are now 12 locations in Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey.\n\nThe Wilmington-based chain plans to double in size over the next five years. Earlier this year, Iron Hill announced a partnership with A&M Capital Opportunities, a private equity firm in Greenwich, Connecticut, to help them reach those goals.\n\nColleagues have said the Iron Hill guys' recipe for success is knowing what works and what doesn't. Clever marketing, stylish Arts and Crafts decor, creative contemporary American cuisine that's much more than fancied-up pub grub, and handcrafted, award-winning brews continue to bring customers back.\n\nNew eats: Brandywine Hundred diner; Newark southern Indian restaurant\n\nOn Friday, the Iron Hill partners will celebrate 20 years in business with a company-wide toast at the flagship 147 E. Main St. operation in Newark. At 5 p.m., guests will enjoy a complimentary 8-ounce pour of Ferrous: Fe20 Anniversary Ale, a Brett Saison brewed exclusively for the celebration.\n\nAll 12 Iron Hill locations also will offer a tap takeover beginning at 4 p.m. Friday that will feature eight of their most award-winning beers. Iron Hill has earned 45 medals from the Great American Beer Festival (GABF) in a record-setting winning streak of 20 consecutive years.\n\nThe beers include Russian Imperial Stout, a full-bodied stout; Bedotter, a traditional Belgian-style golden ale; Lodestone Lager, a Munich-style pale ale; Rye of the Tiger, an amber American IPA; Black IPA, an American-style IPA with full malt flavor; The Cannibal, a golden Belgian-style ale; Overload Stout, an Imperial stout aged on rich chocolate nibs and locally roasted coffee; and Lambic du Hill, a traditional, unfiltered Belgian-style lambic.\n\nFor more information, visit www.ironhillbrewery.com.\n\nButterball provides Turkey Day text help\n\n“Forgot 2 defrost early.

(There is a $45 option for those who don’t want beer.)\n\nWhile Seher is a self-proclaimed carnivore, has a growing interest in exploring vegan and vegetarian cuisine, searching for preparations and presentations that go beyond the standard salads and veggie burgers to offer guests the same level of culinary satisfaction afforded meat-eaters.\n\nIron Hill, he says, is especially responsive to special dietary needs, with allergen-free options and a willingness to work closely with each customer. Seher says he’s happy to be called to a table to discuss options.\n\nAfter years working at both mom-and-pop and corporate-owned restaurants in Philly and elsewhere (he and wife Megan met while working at the Cheesecake Factory), Seher says his five-and-a-half years at Iron Hill have proven the most fulfilling.\n\n“It’s the best balance,’’ he says. “I’m given a ton of creativity and freedom, but you also have the backing of that corporate structure.’’\n\nIron Hill’s menus already offer vegetarians decent options beyond “a salad, hold the chicken, please,’’ he says, but catering to a vegan audience and expanding non-meat options across the board is an opportunity for the restaurant chain.\n\nMore: 10 food truck events to kick off the season\n\n“It actually started over the course of the last year, year and a half ago, we had an influx of servers who are vegan or vegetarian,’’ Seher says.\n\nThe regular menu already includes a hummus platter, Mediterranean wrap, Kennett Square mushroom soup, vegetable penne that can be made without dairy, a red quinoa salad and other salads, and a housemade black bean veggie burger.\n\nWith a rise in interest in everything from reducing personal carbon footprints and waste streams to concerns about food safety to food sensitivities, Seher sees a market still underserved.\n\nWhen Iron Hill staff get together for staff meals, they often incorporate vegan or vegetarian dishes, he says.\n\nWhile most restaurants offer some non-meat options, far fewer elevate vegetarian cuisine in a way that leaves the one or two non-meat eaters at the table not feeling just a little big envious of the many options given to others.\n\nWhat Seher wants to see are more dishes that can hold their own against a perfectly prepared steak.\n\nWith craft beer “the new wine,’’ he says, it’s the perfect time to experiment and up their game.\n\n“With vegetarians dishes, it’s about the pairings, it’s about the seasonings, it’s about the entire dish and every component really plays its role on every single plate.’’\n\nMore: Brewery adds to Collingswood Restaurant Week deals\n\nIron Hill offers themed dinners frequently – in fact it is in the midst of its annual Bacon Madness promotion, so meat isn’t going anywhere.\n\nBut Seher and Ervine enjoy the challenge of leaving the meat out of the “Edgy & Veggie’’ event.\n\n“Everybody is very excited about it. Even the staff that are not vegetarian or vegan are excited about it. It shows our variety and what we can do. We’ve sold more than half the tickets already.’’\n\nSeher, who grew up in Florida, says he is influenced by Cuban, Mexican and Caribbean cuisines.\n\nFresh spring ingredients such as Cippolini onions, asparagus, baby greens and rhubarb inspire his seasonal plates.\n\nThe “Edgy & Veggie’’ menu kicks off with a Zucchini Carpaccio, prepared with candied Meyer lemon, pickled lavender buds, pistachio paste and cashew milk ricotta. It will be paired with a Phitin Phils Pils.\n\n“The pickled lavender is very floral, with an acidic bite if Meyer lemon with the nutty, aromatic texture of the pistachio paste. And anytime you can make ricotta out of anything, it’s a good time. Pairing it with a Pilsner accents all those flavors.’’\n\nNext up are Yucca Tostones, served with shaved veggie slaw and charred tomato coulis. This course is served with a Ziggy Star Bock, a springtime lager.\n\nAn Artichoke ‘Crab’ Cake is prepared with micro watercress, pesto and a balsamic drizzle, and is paired with a Galaxy Quest beer.\n\nA Blood-Orange Parsnip Sorbet will cleanse the palate before the final courses.\n\nSouthern Fried Tofu will be served with green tomatoes, black bean puree, grilled corn-potato puree and a sawmill-style seitan gravy, balanced with an Out the Gate IPA. Seher employees a technique, freezing the tofu before cooking to give it more of a chicken texture, he says.\n\nA Harissa Marinated Cauliflower Steak shares the plate with chickpea couscous, roasted tomato and grilled spring onion chimichurri, paired with a Trubbel with Monks (a dubbel with the kick of a triple).\n\nThe meal’s finale will be a Chocolate Chip Banana Bread with banana chips and macadamia-almond ice cream. Wash it down with a Vanilla Luca Brassi. “It’s very malt-and-roast-forward, and finishes very clean, finishing off the fried yucca.’’\n\nSeher says Iron Hill guests can expect at least some of these dishes to pop up as specials on the Maple Shade menu this spring. (The restaurant is also located in Voorhees).\n\nAnd psst ... Seher, who is lactose intolerant, is working on perfecting a vegan mozzarella he envisions making its way onto Iron Hill pizzas.\n\n“What I hope to get out of this dinner is that it shines the light on our overall menu … and hopefully, it inspires some changes on our regular menu,’’ he says.\n\nIf you go\n\nIron Hill Maple Shade will host 'Edgy & Veggie,' a beer pairing dinner, Tuesday, April 18, at 7 p.m. Cost is $65, or $45 without beer.

The couple has since moved to Pittsburgh and Jacob wrote us asking for the recipe so they could make it at home and \"recapture the magic.\"\n\nThe soup recipe once ran in The News Journal. While we were having some technical difficulties tracking it down from our own archives, thankfully, the folks at Iron Hill, along with several readers, offered or provided us with their copies. Thanks so much, everyone.\n\nThe soup, $5.95 a bowl at the Iron Hill restaurants, is made with roasted white mushrooms, sherry and cream.\n\nNormally, reader recipe requests are handled by Nancy Coale Zippe, whose Food column runs every other Wednesday in the Life section.

Hope this helps.\n\nCynthia Ritthaler\n\nChef Tan has 'excellent' food\n\nI sent you some photos of the \"Hot Pot\" now being offered at the Chef Tan Restaurant at 108 E. Main Street in Newark. When we arrived with our Chinese friend, his eyes lit up. This is the real deal he gets back home in China. This is an \"endless\" pot.\n\nWhen you finish up the platter, they keep bringing more and more. There also is a whole platter of thin shaved beef and many other choices of items to dip in the hot boiling chicken broth. It was just unbelievable! Cost was $30 dollars per person for the first 3 dinners and a fourth eats free.\n\nYou might call ahead to see if this dish is being offered the day you go. In general, their food is terrific. Our Chinese friend was thrilled with the chunks of duck blood they offered him to dip, and the waitress offered us live frogs.\n\nIf you can get over the weirdness of some of the things they have on the menu, the food is excellent. I had pork and chestnuts last time and was in heaven.\n\nGinny Mailman\n\nNewark\n\nThanks for the excellent review and photos, Ginny.

That's a lot of soup. We halved the ingredients, which will provide you with 1 gallon of soup. This is almost exactly the same as the recipe that ran in The News Journal\n\n5 pounds sliced white mushrooms\n\nVegetable or canola oil spray\n\n1/2 pound (2 sticks) whole butter\n\n2 cups white onions, small diced\n\n1 1/2 cups celery, small diced\n\n1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic, depending on taste\n\n1/4 teaspoon dried thyme\n\n1 1/4 cups flour\n\n1/2 cup sherry wine\n\n10 cups vegetable broth\n\n3 cups heavy cream\n\n1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n\n3 tablespoons freshly minced parsley\n\n1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper\n\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n\n1/4 cup additional sherry wine\n\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees. Wash the mushrooms in cold water, drain and divide between 2 large sheet pans. Spray with vegetable or canola oil spray and season with salt and pepper. Place sheet pans in oven and cook until the mushrooms are properly roasted, about 20 to 30 minutes. Place on a rack to cool.\n\nPlace butter, onions and celery into a medium- to large-sized, thick- bottomed stock pot. Saute the vegetables on medium-high until the onions become translucent. Add the garlic and thyme and cook for 3 minutes longer. Do not brown. Stir in the flour to make a roux and cook for about 5 minutes Place the sherry and broth into the pot and whisk to combine. Add the mushrooms and stir to incorporate. Cook for about 30 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Puree the soup with an immersion blender, then whisk in the heavy cream, nutmeg, parsley, black pepper, lemon juice and additional sherry wine. Cook for about 5 to 10 minutes longer, and check the seasonings. Makes 1 gallon.\n\nThe News Journal/delawareonline.com reserves the right to editletters for clarity, length and accuracy.

The site also includes plans for a Royal Farms store and another retail shop. It had been the home of the Tomato Sunshine Garden Center & Farm Market.\n\n“Coastal Station will be Delaware’s most premier real estate development and we couldn’t have asked for a better tenant than Iron Hill,\" said developer Todd Bariglio in a prepared statement.\n\nIt will be the 14th planned location on the East Coast for Iron Hill, known for its hand-crafted beers and food that pairs well with them.\n\nSTORY:Shake Shack beer floats come to Wilmington\n\nSTORY:NCCo Council rejects sewer fee increase and police expansion\n\nIn addition to the flagship Newark operation, which opened in 1996, Iron Hill's other Delaware restaurant is at the Wilmington Riverfront.

Finn's father is a longtime Lewes resident.\n\n\"We thought Rehoboth was the best spot for us to be in. There's so much stuff going on there.\"\n\nFinn said the new site still has to be developed. \"Our goal is summer of 2018\" to open, he said.\n\nThe Rehoboth building will look somewhat similar to Iron Hill's Wilmington Riverfront location, but it will not be two stories.

Another Iron Hill restaurant is planned in 2018 in Center City Philadelphia.\n\nFinn, Edelson and Davies are among the state's earliest proponents of modern craft breweries. They founded Iron Hill on Newark's Main Street, near the University of Delaware's main campus, shortly after Sam Calagione, owner of the pioneering Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, opened his location in 1995 in Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThe Dogfish Head brewery has since moved to Milton, and the restaurant, now in a new building, remains on Rehoboth Avenue. Earlier this month, Calagione was named the country's Outstanding Wine, Spirits, or Beer Professional by the James Beard Foundation at its annual awards ceremony. A Beard medal is considered one of the country's most prestigious food and beverage honors.\n\nIron Hill, named after the historic Revolutionary War landmark in Delaware, where Gen. George Washington battled the British, will be one of seven other breweries operating in southern Delaware.\n\nIt has won 45 medals from at the Great American Beer Festival and earned the coveted “World Champion Brewpub” title three times at the World Beer Cup.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/off-the-menu/2017/11/30/delaware-based-iron-hill-brewery-restaurant-plans-greenville-location-haywood-road/910597001/", "title": "Iron Hill Brewery & restaurant planned for Haywood Road in ...", "text": "An award-winning Delaware-based brewery with 12 locations plans to open lucky number 13, and the company’s first southeastern location, in Greenville.

Iron Hill has received recognition for its beer, winning awards at both national and international competitions. The company also places a premium on giving. It has donated nearly $200,000 through its Triple Chocolate Hill dessert initiative, which designates that for every such dessert ordered, Iron Hill donates $1.50, 75 cents of which goes to CureSearch for Children’s Cancer, a children’s cancer advocacy group, and 75 cents of which goes to a cause chosen by each individual Iron Hill location.\n\nCurrently, Iron Hill has 12 locations throughout New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania.\n\nFor more visit www.ironhillbrewery.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/04/18/last-iron-hill-offers-new-craft-beer-option-beach/514295002/", "title": "Iron Hill Brewery set to open coastal brewpub by Memorial Day ...", "text": "REHOBOTH BEACH — Yet another temple is going up in this seaside mecca for craft beer lovers.\n\nIt's taken two decades and about a dozen new locations along the East Coast, but Iron Hill Brewery & Restaurant is finally beach-bound.\n\n\"We're a staple in Delaware,\" said Iron Hill co-owner Mark Edelson. \"Now we can give all our fans Iron Hill in the summer.\"\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the Iron Hill crew wrangled eight 400-pound tanks into their new southern Delaware home, looking forward to when the shiny, steel vessels will be filled with dozens of kegs worth of locally brewed, ice-cold beer.\n\n\"And you'll be able to see the whole brewery from the parking lot,\" said General Manager Rick Whittick as he pointed to the huge glass windows behind the copper-lined brewing equipment.\n\nWhen the Rehoboth Beach Iron Hill opens just in time for Memorial Day weekend, it will have taken about six months to build the more than $4.5 million, 9,000-square-foot brewery and restaurant along northbound Del. 1 between the outlets and the entrance to Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThe new restaurant will be able to seat twice as many people as its original Newark location, which Edelson, along with his partners Kevin Finn and Kevin Davies, opened in 1996.\n\nWith a banquet room, patio and massive indoor dining area and a full view of the kitchen and brewing operation, the southern edition of Iron Hill will be able to seat up to 425 people. The building also includes room for two yet-undecided retail stores out back.\n\nWhittick said the newest Iron Hill – the opening in Rehoboth will mark the company's 14th location on the East Coast and third in Delaware – will include many of the same brews and menu items, but with a bit of a coastal twist.\n\nHead brewer John Panasiewicz said he envisions a new twist on Iron Hill's signature White Iron Wit Belgian-style wheat beer by crafting a similar brew with a blueberry-lemon flavor.\n\nOther fruity ales, IPAs and lagers will certainly be on the menu as well, Panasiewicz said, and at least 15 beers will be on tap when the brewery opens in May. The shiny new tanks and brewing equipment delivered on Tuesday will allow Panasiewicz and his crew create about 55 different seasonal styles and more than 900 barrels of beer each year.\n\n\"If you want to compare us to Dogfish or anywhere else, that's great, but we'll stand alone,\" Panasiewicz said. \"We'll stand apart and we'll stand out.

It's a very good thing.\"\n\nWith nearly unlimited dining options competing for customers flocking to the Delaware beaches, many of which now also brew their own craft beers, Whittick said Iron Hill is ready to collaborate.\n\n\"It's a small, tight-knit community, the craft brewing world,\" he said, hinting at future brewing collaborations with a handful of other local breweries.\n\nThe new brewery and restaurant also will create 125 new jobs for the area, about half of which still need to be filled.\n\n\"We're Delaware people, so this is finally us getting to the beach,\" Edelson said. \"We've been in the state for 22 years.

Fans will line a parade route from Broad Street and Pattison Avenue to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, eagerly awaiting a glimpse of Nick Foles and the rest of their heroes.\n\nOf course, big events like this come with lots of logistics; here's what to know if you're among the many, many people attending:\n\nHow do I get there from Delaware?\n\nSEPTA will be implementing a special parade day public transportation plan. Additional details can be found at septa.org.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nThe Broad Street and Market-Frankford subway lines will be free all day. But special regional rail day passes for Thursday have sold out.\n\nThe only options for Delawareans will be to get on the Wilmington/Newark regional rail line at Wilmington and take it to 30th Street Station in Center City. The rail line will make stops only at Wilmington, Marcus Hook and Ridley Park, before it goes into 30th Street. It will not continue beyond there.\n\nSuburban Station will not be in use, SEPTA told reporters at a press conference, due to the \"pedestrian gridlock\" near the station.\n\nRELATED:Players ready themselves for 'crazy' celebration\n\nRELATED:Available SEPTA passes drop to 500 for Eagles parade\n\nRegional rail lines will run only inbound during the day and only outbound in the evening.\n\nWith only three northbound trains, the first departs from Wilmington at 6:40 a.m. with no inbound service from Wilmington after approximately 9:23 a.m. Total capacity tallies 2,790 riders.\n\nReturn trips will depart from Philly's 30th Street Station from 2 p.m. to 9 p.m.\n\nSEPTA officials said parade capacity for regional rail lines would be a little more than 70,000 people across the 11 lines.\n\nThere were 50,000 day passes available for the 11 lines, with the rest of riders likely coming from those with monthly and weekly passes.\n\nHow do I get there from New Jersey?\n\nPATCO will be the most popular mode of travel for fans coming from South Jersey. The transit system is bracing for the crowd by running more trains and offering westbound-only express service to Philadelphia from 6 a.m. through 1:30 p.m.\n\nHowever, tickets will only be available for a limited time: PATCO announced Wednesday afternoon that tickets would be suspended at or around 7 p.m.; tickets will not be sold in stations on Thursday.\n\nThe only four South Jersey stations that will be open Thursday during that time: Lindenwold, Woodcrest, Ferry Avenue and Broadway. All trains will go directly to the 9th/10th and Locust Street station in Philadelphia.\n\nThe plan calls for trains to leave each of the four Camden County stations every 16 minutes and to arrive in Philadelphia every four minutes.\n\nTrains are starting empty at the four open stations and will head straight to 9th/10th stop, with no stops in between.\n\nMissed our Super Bowl Championship edition on Monday? Pick one up starting Thursday for $3 at New Castle County Wawa stores or The News Journal, 950 W. Basin Road, near New Castle. You can also order online at: http://bit.ly/2nOqnvN\n\nAt 1:20 p.m., PATCO service switches directions: Trains will start returning eastbound to New Jersey from the 9th/10th and Locust Street station to the same four Camden County stations. Normal westbound service into Philadelphia is expected to resume at 7:30 p.m.\n\nPATCO President John Hanson expects trains to be able to handle around 80,000 passengers, and suggests arriving early to find parking, or getting a ride to a station.\n\nIf you want to brave the trip on foot, the south walkway on the Ben Franklin Bridge will be open from 6 a.m. into the evening. It's about a 1.3-mile walk one way ... and then, of course, you'd have to get to the parade location.\n\nFor NJ Transit information, visit njtransit.org or call (973) 275-5555.\n\nWhat if I want to drive?\n\nDriving may end up being the best option for Delawareans.\n\nDon't plan on finding on-street parking. Dozens of city streets will be closed along the parade route and adjacent streets.\n\nParking garages near the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Broad Street and the stadium complex will be open. Visit the Philadelphia Parking Authority's website at philapark.org for a list of parking options.\n\nThere is limited parking along the Camden Waterfront in New Jersey for those riding PATCO or walking across the bridge.\n\nRELATED:Eagles' Super Bowl win sends fans to tattoo shops\n\nWhat are the best spots to see the parade?\n\nThe Eagles will ride in an open-air motorcade, waving at fans along a 5-mile parade route starting at 11 a.m. The parade begins at Broad Street and Pattison Avenue, and will move north along Broad to City Hall, and turn left, going to the west side of City Hall along 15th Street. From there it will make its way to JFK Boulevard around LOVE Park and to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway on the westbound lanes, going around Eakins Oval and letting players and other team personnel out at Kelly Drive.\n\nPeople using wheelchairs will have a designated space on the south side of Eakins Oval.\n\nFourteen video screens and other attractions will enhance the viewing experience along the parade route.\n\nA ceremony will take place in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art from 1 to 3 p.m.\n\nCONTINUES BELOW MAP\n\nWhere should I eat?\n\nIt's a good idea to pack snacks, but you can also find sustenance for sale: As many as 40 food trucks will be parked along the parade route.\n\nWhere should I go if I gotta go?\n\nExpect ample facilities as the city is providing 850 portable toilets. If you prefer to find an indoor bathroom, it might be tough as many Philadelphia restaurants, stores and office buildings will close during the parade.\n\nWhat if someone gets sick?\n\nThe Philadelphia Fire Department will have EMS tents set up at 24th Street and Benjamin Franklin Parkway (south side) and 21st Street and Benjamin Franklin Parkway (north side).\n\nHow should I dress?\n\nWear your Eagles gear, of course, but make sure it includes layers. The forecast high for Philadelphia is just 31 degrees and while it will be sunny, forecasters warn the \"wind tunnel effect\" caused by city skyscrapers could make it feel significantly colder.\n\nWhat's the best way to get parade updates?\n\nAs with any live event, plans can change. Keep up on breaking developments, along with the color and excitement of the parade route, on the Delawareonline website and apps for iPhone and Android; we'll also have live updates on our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts.\n\nYou can also sign up for text alerts from the city of Philadelphia.

Biggest difference is it solidifies your greatness. You can get lucky once; (this) wasn't beginner's luck. We wanted it, we took it.\n\n“You can call it a dynasty – you can call it whatever you want.

And Olsen distinguished himself with his assessment of the most critical play of the game.\n\nRead our full analysis of the Super Bowl 57 broadcast here.\n\nThe grass used in State Farm Stadium during Super Bowl 57 took nearly two years and more than $800,000 to prepare for Sunday, but it wasn't without faults. The playing conditions were less than pretty.\n\nPlayers from both the Eagles and Chiefs struggled to get traction on the natural grass and slipped many times. At least half a dozen Eagles players switched cleats during the first half in an attempt to get a better grip, including quarterback Jalen Hurts, who changed from Jordan 11 cleats to Jordan 1 cleats.\n\nEagles offensive lineman Jordan Mailata, who said he's \"not a grass expert,\" described the conditions as \"pretty slippery,\" similar to \"playing on a water park.\" — Cydney Henderson\n\nSuper Bowl 57 was one of the highest-scoring Super Bowl games ever played. It was a thrilling showdown that featured numerous records either broken (longest punt return) or tied (most points scored by a player, Jalen Hurts with 20).\n\nHere is a look at the highest-scoring Super Bowls.\n\nTravis Kelce was the winner of the unofficial \"Kelce Bowl,\" as his Kansas City Chiefs defeated his brother Jason's Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 57.\n\nBut as the Chiefs celebrated their victory and Travis Kelce gave a memorable postgame interview alongside Patrick Mahomes, he made sure to see his brother following the game, as the Kelce brothers shared an embrace and briefly spoke as the confetti fell down on State Farm Stadium.\n\nJason Kelce can be heard congratulating Travis, even cracking a smile and telling him to \"go celebrate.\" Before they part, both Kelce's told each other \"I love you.\" — Jordan Mendoza\n\nThe Super Bowl, like every other NFL game, has two halves. The Philadelphia Eagles only showed up for one of them.\n\nAfter pushing the Kansas City Chiefs to the brink and hobbling Patrick Mahomes, the Eagles imploded in the second half. They were outscored, outgained, outdisciplined – outhustled – and, as a result, they're out a Lombardi Trophy.\n\nMaybe that's harsh, given the final score was 38-35 and it took the Chiefs until the closing seconds to seal the victory. But when you have a 10-point lead, all the momentum and Mahomes barely able to run off the field at halftime, that's as close to a gimme as it gets in the NFL's biggest game.\n\nRead Nancy Armour's full column here.\n\nThe Blackest, most woke Super Bowl ever — can’t believe I wrote that since this is the Republican NFL, but here we are — started by again featuring the Black national anthem, “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” this time performed by Sheryl Lee Ralph.\n\nThen Rihanna performed at halftime. Despite once saying she wouldn’t perform in the Super Bowl halftime show because of the way the NFL treated Colin Kaepernick and protesting players, she was back, and make no mistake, Rihanna is one of the Blackest, proudest performers of our time.\n\nBut wait, it gets Blacker.\n\nSinger Babyface, a generational rhythm and blues singer, sang “America the Beautiful” before the game. He’s produced dozens of R&B hits and won 12 Grammy Awards. At this point we had the Black national anthem, Rihanna performing and two Black starting quarterbacks for the first time ever. During Black History Month. This wasn’t the Super Bowl. This was Wakanda.\n\nRead MIke Freeman's full column here.\n\nThe record for the longest punt return in Super Bowl history now belongs to Kadarius Toney.\n\nToney broke several tackles on the punt return for a 65-yard return, making it the longest punt return in Super Bowl history.\n\nThe Chiefs then scored three plays later on a Patrick Mahomes pass to Skyy Moore.\n\nThere has never been a punt return for a touchdown in Super Bowl history, but there have been multiple kickoff return TDs. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nHow excited was Andy Reid to win the Super Bowl?\n\nAndy Reid, immediately after winning his second Super Bowl, could not contain his excitement.\n\nWhen Fox sideline reporter Tom Rinaldi asked Reid how happy he was, the Kansas City Chiefs coach responded with his typical jovial sense of humor.\n\n“I could kiss you right now, but I’m not going to,” Reid told Rinaldi, as both laughed after the exchange.\n\nReid led the Chiefs to their second championship in four seasons.\n\nReid credited his offensive coordinator Eric Bienemy during his postgame interview.\n\n“Eric Bienemy was tremendous down the stretch there,” Reid said, complimenting his assistant who has been passed over for head coaching jobs several times.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nJalen Hurts ties record for points in Super Bowl\n\nThe game is not over, but Jalen Hurts has tied a Super Bowl record: most points scored in the game.\n\nIn Super Bowl 51, James White accounted for 20 in the epic 28-3 comeback the New England Patriots pulled off against the Atlanta Falcons, including the game-winning touchdown in overtime.\n\nHurts has three touchdowns on the ground (one through the air) and the two-point conversion that tied the game at 35 was the equalizer with White.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nAnd we're all tied in Super Bowl 57 after Eagles score\n\nThese Eagles will not go quietly.\n\nTrailing by eight points in the fourth quarter, Jalen Hurts converted once again on third down early in the drive with a patented sneak. He found A.J Brown on the next third down for another first. Brown and Hurts connected again for 11 yards and another first.\n\nGiven plenty of time, Hurts found DeVonta Smith streaking down the left sideline on a blown coverage. Smith could not keep his balance and remain in bounds and went out at the 2-yard line, but not before picking up 45 yards. Hurts scored on the next play via a – you guessed it – quarterback sneak.\n\nHurts then tied the game on the ensuing two-point conversion attempt on a designed run to the left, breaking tackles and persevering over the goal line to even it at 35 with 5:15 left in the game.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nKansas City continues second-half domination\n\nKadarius Toney, Super Bowl MVP?\n\nToney had two of the biggest plays for the Chiefs during the fourth quarter, his latest was a 65-yard punt return - the longest in Super Bowl history - went to Philadelphia 5-yard line with 10:11 left in the game.\n\nThree plays later the Chiefs added to their fourth-quarter lead as Patrick Mahomes found receiver Skyy Moore for a 4-yard touchdown pass, and the Chiefs took a 35-27 lead with 9:22 left in the game.\n\nToney, acquired by the Chiefs during the season, is turning out to be a pivotal move that paid off in Kansas City’s favor during the biggest game of the season. His earlier 5-yard touchdown put the Chiefs ahead in the fourth quarter.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nChiefs take first lead in Super Bowl 57\n\nThe Chiefs waiting until the fourth quarter to finally go ahead of the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nPatrick Mahomes found receiver Kadarius Toney for a walk-in 5-yard touchdown, and kicker Harrison Butker made the extra point to put Kansas City ahead 28-27 with 12:04 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nToney went in motion toward the middle of the field, but turned quickly back to the right sidelinefor a wide-open touchdown.\n\nDuring the drive, running back Isiah Pacheco (with runs of 9 and 11 yards) and receiver Juju Smith-Schuster (with four catches for 38 yards) were instrumental for Mahomes and the Chiefs.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nReplay decision helps Eagles add to lead on Chiefs\n\nJalen Hurts could not have thrown a better ball. On third-and-14 from the Kansas City 47, Hurts dropped back on the team’s first drive of the half with a three-point lead. He found tight end Dallas Goedert near the sideline between two defenders past the sticks for what appeared to be yet another third down conversion.\n\nAlthough Goedert bobbled the ball, he regained possession in time to land both feet in bounds and the call was upheld. The challenge cost Andy Reid and the Chiefs their first timeout of the second half.\n\nPhiladelphia moved the ball inside the red zone after the play but had to settle for a field goal to make it 27-21 with 1:45 left in the third quarter.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nHurt ankle, no problem for Patrick Mahomes\n\nAfter injuring his ankle on his final play of the second quarter, Mahomes started the second half, and even ran for a 14-yard gain inside the 5-yard line on the first drive of the third quarter.\n\nMahomes led the Chiefs on a touchdown drive to start the second half, which included a low pass to tight end Travis Kelce that kept their drive alive.\n\nChiefs running back Isiah Pacheco scored on a 1-yard run to help the Chiefs trim their deficit. The Eagles are holding onto a 24-21 lead after the first possession in the second half.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nRihanna shines bright in Super Bowl halftime show\n\nRihanna has already evolved into an immensely successful singer, a business mogul with a net worth of more than $1 billion and, as of last year, a mom.\n\nOn Sunday, the multihyphenate added another accomplishment to the checklist: Super Bowl halftime headliner.\n\nTaking the State Farm Stadium stage in Glendale, Arizona, with her most visible outing in years, Rihanna stormed through a vibrant production that spotlighted her flexible R&B grooves coupled with infectious pop hooks. And, of course, her distinctive fashion style.\n\nALL OF THE LIGHTS:Rihanna stuns in spectacular Super Bowl performance\n\n- Melissa Ruggieri\n\nSuper Bowl halftime stats: Patrick Mahomes held to 89 yards passing\n\nOnly once has a team lost the Super Bowl after leading by double-digits at halftime: the Atlanta Falcons before the New England Patriots staged their famous comeback from a 28-3 deficit six years ago.\n\nThe Eagles, who lead 24-14 at the break, finished the first half with a time of possession of 21:54, leaving the Chiefs with 8:06. They ran 44 plays compared to the Chiefs’ 20 and outgained them 270-128.\n\nHere are some other statistics from the first half:\n\nNotable Eagles stats\n\nThird-down efficiency: 6-for-10,\n\nJalen Hurts: 17-for-22, 183 yards, TD; 11 rushes, 63 yards, 2 TD\n\nDeVonta Smith: six catches, 55 yards\n\nA.J Brown: three catches, 74 yards, TD\n\nNotable Chiefs stats\n\nThird-down efficiency:0-for-3\n\nPatrick Mahomes: 8-for-13, 89 yards, TD\n\nIsiah Pacheco: five carries, 28 yards\n\nTravis Kelce: three catches, 60 yards, TD\n\nBolton: three tackles, fumble recovery, TD\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nEagles take 24-14 lead at halftime after late field goal\n\nIn the NFC championship game, DeVonta Smith quickly got his team to the line of scrimmage and snapped the ball after a questionable catch on the Eagles’ first drive of their victory over the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIt did not work against the Chiefs in the Super Bowl.\n\nA replay review late in the second quarter showed Smith did not maintain control of the ball after a catch to the Kansas City 13, and it was ruled incomplete. The Eagles tried to snap the ball right away, but since there were less than two minutes in the first half, the officials in the booth called down to the field for a review.\n\nAfter the over turn, A.J. Brown, had a 22-yard catch-and-run that put Philadelphia in field goal range. Jake Elliott connected from 35 yards out as time expired in the first half, with the Eagles taking a 24-14 advantage into the locker room.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nPatrick Mahomes limps off after appearing to re-injure ankle\n\nWell, Patrick Mahomes’ injured right ankle was looking good until it wasn’t.\n\nMahomes, who was suffered a high-ankle sprain against the Jacksonville Jaguars in the divisional playoff game, scrambled on third down shortly before halftime, and his injured right foot took the brunt of the fall after he was tackled by Eagles linebacker T.J. Edwards with 1:44 left in the second quarter.\n\nMahomes limped off the field in obvious pain and was later shown in difficulty while his ankle was being evaluated by trainers on the sidelines.\n\nEarlier in the game, Mahomes appeared to run with ease like his foot was healed after a high-ankle sprain suffered last month.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nEagles back in front on another Jalen Hurts touchdown run\n\nThe Eagles entered the Super Bowl with 35 fourth-down attempts. The 36th and 37th were the most important of the season thus far.\n\nOn fourth-and-5 from the Kansas City 44, Hurts ran to daylight and converted the first fourth down of the drive with a 28-yard carry down the right sideline. Facing a fourth-and 2, the Eagles got Kansas City to jump inside the red zone to set up a first-and-goal and Hurts scored his second rushing touchdown of the game on the next play to make it 21-14 with just over two minutes left in the second quarter.\n\nThe drive was 12 plays and took 7:19 off the clock. The Eagles are dominating time of possession. They have had the ball for 20:32, while Mahomes and Kansas City have had it for 7:08.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs erase deficit with defensive touchdown after Eagles miscue\n\nThe Eagles had a seven-point lead and were in Chiefs territory once again.\n\nInstead of putting Kansas City back on its heels, they let them back in the game.\n\nFacing a thrd-and-1 from the Chiefs’ 47, right guard Isaac Seumalo jumped early and moved the Eagles back five yards. On the next play, Hurts began to run on a quarterback keeper, but he dropped the ball and Nick Bolton – the Chiefs’ leading tackler – scooped it up and scored on a 36-yard return that tied the game.\n\nIt was the first fumble Hurts lost since Week 10 against Indianapolis and the team's first turnover of the playoffs.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nA.J. Brown puts Eagles ahead with long touchdown catch\n\nThe ability to hit the big play has been a hallmark for the Eagles offense all season.\n\nIn the Super Bowl, Brown made it.\n\nOn the first play of the second quarter, Hurts had all day in the pocket to watch Brown streak down the field and into double-coverage. Hurts threw to a place anybody who could catch the ball would have to make an adjustment.\n\nJuan Thornhill and McDuffie in coverage weren’t able. Brown did, and the Eagles regain the lead 14-7d on the 45-yard completion.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs fail to take lead as Harrison Butker field goal goes 'doink'\n\nThe Chiefs moved the ball well, but settled for a field-goal attempt when facing a fourth-and-3 at the end of their second drive. Butker’s 42-yard kick drifted left and was no good after hitting the upright, keeping the score tied at 7.\n\nThe possession by the Chiefs drive featured a stellar 22-yard pass from Mahomes to Kelce, and even some trickery from Kansas City. Kelce and receiver Juju Smith-Schuster signaled to the Chiefs sidelines like they did not know a play call, then turned around after Mahomes found running back Jerick McKinnon for a 7-yard completion on the right side.\n\nMahomes nearly threw an interception on the next play, and the Chiefs’ field-goal kick miss could come back to haunt them later this game.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nEagles RB Miles Sanders sidelined after hit on game's first play\n\nOn the first play of the game, Sanders carried for a one-yard loss. Chiefs cornerback Trent McDuffie tracked him down near the sideline and delivered a large hit, knocking the ball out of bounds.\n\nSanders, a fourth-year player from Penn State, was seen shaking his hand after the play and went into the locker room before returning to the field. Boston Scott and Kenneth Gainwell handled the ball-carrying duting in his absence. Sanders returned to the field in the second quarter.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs respond quickly to tie game against Eagles\n\nThe Chiefs did not waste any time responding to the Eagles’ first score.\n\nChiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes found who else than his favorite target, tight end Travis Kelce, for a 18-yard touchdown to tie the game at 7 with 6:57 left in the first quarter.\n\nMahomes’ first pass of the game was a 20-yard completion to Kelce. More important: Mahomes’ ankle looks great, too, after he galloped for an 8-yard run during the drive.\n\nThe Chiefs got near the red zone with a 24-yard run to the left side by running back Isaiah Pacheco.\n\nKelce also celebrated his touchdown with a dance in the end zone.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nEagles jump out to early Super Bowl lead on Jalen Hurts touchdown run\n\nThat was quick.\n\nThe Eagles received the opening kickoff and drove 75 yards in 11 plays for a touchdown on the game’s first possession. Jalen Hurts found receiver DeVonta Smith on a key third down and later hit him for 23 yards to move Philadelphia into the red zone on a run-pass option that was initially snuffed out.\n\nKenneth Gainwell initially had the score, but replay review quickly confirmed his elbow was down short of the goal line. The call was Hurts’ specialty: a quarterback sneak. Behind the Eagles’ elite offensive line, Hurts plowed ahead for six points. Extra point was good and it's Philadelphia 7-0 early.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs win Super Bowl coin toss, Eagles get ball first\n\nIf you bet on the Chiefs to win the Super Bowl coin toss, congratulations.\n\nThe Chiefs called tails. And the Chiefs won the toss. They chose to defer and will kickoff to the Eagles start the game, and then get the ball to start the second half.\n\nTails breaks a two-game streak by heads, and has been the coin toss winner in seven of the last 10 Super Bowls, according to Oddsshark.com.\n\nAt +100, one would have doubled their money picking the Chiefs to win the coin toss.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nChris Stapleton, Sheryl Lee Ralph shine with Super Bowl national anthems\n\nWith nearly as much attention paid to the music as the game during the Super Bowl, the trifecta of artists who took the field Sunday prior to kickoff knew the importance of their platform.\n\nChris Stapleton, Sheryl Lee Ralph and Babyface were tapped for the honors. Ralph singer infused the Black national anthem - \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" - with the type of gusto exhibited during her Emmy acceptance speech last fall.\n\nBabyface followed with \"America the Beautiful\" and the festivities were capped by Stapleton's rendition of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" that showcased his vocal skills.\n\nRIGHT NOTE:Reviewing the pregame Super Bowl singing performances\n\n- Mellissa Ruggieri\n\nEagles coach Nick Sirianni, center Jason Kelce both cry during Super Bowl national anthem\n\nAs Chris Stapleton performed the national anthem before the kick of the Super Bowl, cameras found Sirianni and Kelce, both of whom had tears in their eyes.\n\nKelce spoke about tears on the big stage after the Eagles’ Super Bowl 52 victory, saying he would find himself crying in the shower in the lead-up to that game against the New England Patriots.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nDamar Hamlin introduced on field at Super Bowl 57, speaks to Fox's Michael Strahan\n\nThe NFL continues to celebrate the remarkable recovery by Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin from cardiac arrest he suffered in a Jan. 2 game.\n\nHamlin received a warm ovation from the crowd at State Farm Stadium.\n\nEarlier, on Fox's pregame show, Hamlin spoke with Michael Strahan about what he remembered when he made that fateful tackle on Bengals WR Tee Higgins.\n\nHamlin paused for nearly nine seconds.\n\n\"That's something I don't really want to get too deep into, in the detail,\" Hamlin said. \"That's something I'm still trying to work through. Why did it happen to me?\"\n\nThe full interview will air Monday morning on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nEagles fans boo Cowboys QB Dak Prescott pregame\n\nDallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott received a rousing ovation after being recognized as the Walter Payton Man of the Year for his philanthropy and community impact.\n\nBut not the ovation you’d think one would receive for winning one of the NFL’s highest honors.\n\nEagles fans at the Super Bowl booed Prescott, because division rivalries don’t cease even for special awards.\n\nPrescott was a good sport about the reaction he received.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nWith injured ankle, Patrick Mahomes goes for Super Bowl win No. 2\n\nThis is the third Super Bowl start for the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback. Mahomes split his previous two appearances, beating the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl 54 before losing the championship game the following season against Tom Brady and the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nMahomes’ recovery from a right high-ankle sprain in the divisional playoff and his dart to the sidelines that set up a game-winning field goal to help the Chiefs beat the Bengals in the AFC championship game on Jan. 29 only added to his growing legacy.\n\nMahomes also has a chance to further separate himself from the rest of the current pack of active quarterbacks. With Brady’s retirement, Mahomes could have more rings than any other with his second championship.\n\n— Safid Deen\n\nThree keys to victory in Super Bowl 57\n\nThe pregame hype is finally dying down and the focus of Super Bowl 57 is ready to be turned to the gridiron where it belongs.\n\nBoth the Chiefs and Eagles have been the class of their respective leagues this season, so the most important thing for either team may only be the ability to execute what they already do well.\n\nHere are three keys to winning, according to USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon:\n\nEagles pass rush vs. Chiefs offensive line\n\nChiefs aerial attack vs. Eagles pass defense\n\nEagles rushing offense vs. Chiefs defense\n\nSuper Bowl X-factors: Unknown to hero?\n\nThe Super Bowl is where a relative nobody can become a household name, a place where Malcolm Butler and David Tyree were transformed from obscurity to an association with football's biggest stage, forever.\n\nThe stars will attract the attention and have the most impact on Super Bowl 57. The X-factors, however – the ones the majority of the 100-plus-million viewers do not know – will also play pivotal roles in determining who lifts the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nHere are a few who could find themselves in the spotlight on Sunday, according to USA TODAY Sports' Chris Bumbaca:\n\nEagles DT Jason Hargrave\n\nEagles RB Kenneth Gainwell\n\nChiefs OT Andrew Wylie\n\nChiefs LB Nick Bolton\n\nHow do Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts stack up?\n\nThis margin isn't as wide as you might think. Jalen Hurts, 24, is a star who is going to be a problem in the NFC for a long time. He worked with Tom House this offseason and has refined his mechanics. His ability to compromise defenses with his rushing ability has made it increasingly difficult to defend Philadelphia. And, if the Chiefs use a spy to try to limit what Hurts can do out in open space, it takes away a potential defender Kansas City can use in the secondary.\n\nAll that said, Patrick Mahomes is the most gifted passer in the NFL, possibly of all time. His arm makes it so that the Chiefs can score on any given play. And while he may not rack up rushing yards, his mobility — though it may be tested Sunday by a high ankle sprain — allows him to extend plays and find receivers who can break off their routes.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nWhere Kansas City has a potential home run hitter in Isiah Pacheco, the Eagles carry significant depth in the backfield. Philadelphia’s top three running backs — Miles Sanders, Boston Scott and Kenneth Gainwell — are all capable of taking over a game. Just look at Gainwell’s production; he averaged just 3.1 rushes per game in the regular season. In the playoffs, that number has jumped to 13 per and he has responded by leading the Eagles in rushing in both the divisional and conference championship rounds. Sanders, meanwhile, has a nose for the end zone.\n\nPacheco is explosive both rushing the ball and catching it out of the backfield, but Kansas City often doesn’t give him enough touches to be a major factor. The team also activated Clyde Edwards-Helaire (ankle) off of injured reserve and he’d provide a huge boost if he’s able to play.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThis is perhaps the one position where a team has the strongest advantage over the other. A.J. Brown and Devonta Smith are both star playmakers whose different skill sets complement each other; Brown is physical and quick and can beat defenders with power and Smith is a silky route runner who is elusive in space.\n\nOn the other side, the Chiefs have navigated their first season without Tyreek Hill quite well, with Marquez Valdes-Scantling, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Kadarius Toney making plays. Still, no Kansas City wideout eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards in the regular season. Making matters worse for the Chiefs is that they are facing several nagging injuries at the position, with Mecole Hardman placed on injured reserve. Better put this way, Mahomes and the Chiefs system elevate Smith-Schuster, Valdes-Scantling and Toney, while Brown and Smith are stars who would flourish anywhere.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nDallas Goedert has been a solid and steady option for Hurts. But in 14 games this season, including the playoffs, he reached the 100-yard mark only once.\n\nTravis Kelce isn’t just in the conversation for the best tight end in football — he’s already there — he’s in the conversation for the best of all time. Kelce has secured four All-Pro nominations in the last seven seasons, he’s rewriting the record book and he has become Mahomes’ preferred target and a near-unguardable player in the middle of the field.\n\nGoedert does have a clear advantage over Kelce in run blocking; because Philadelphia sets its identity on the ground, Goedert has become a key piece in the scheme. Still, Kelce is generational.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nWho are the commentators on FOX NFL Sunday's Super Bowl pregame show?\n\nAs is the case during the regular season, Fox Sports has Curt Menefee hosting its NFL Sunday pregame show, which is being broadcast live at State Farm Stadium.\n\nProviding analysis and commentary are Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, Michael Strahan and Jimmy Johnson. Joining the set for the playoffs is retired NFL tight end-turned-kicker Rob Gronkowski.\n\nReporting from around the stadium: Erin Andrews, Tom Rinaldi, Charissa Thompson and Jay Glazer.\n\nStars from every industry are descending on State Farm Stadium to watch the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn the stadium early was NBA star LeBron James and his wife, Savannah.\n\nEagles superfan Bradley Cooper was also in attendance ready to cheer his team to victory.\n\nRap mogul Jay Z was spotted on the sidelines taking pictures of his daughter Blue Ivy.\n\nJuJu Smith-Schuster, Travis Kelce, Fletcher Cox make fashion statements as kickoff approaches\n\nEveryone knows what the players will be wearing when Super Bowl 57 kicks off. The Chiefs will be wearing white uniforms with red pants, red numerals and yellow trim. The Eagles will be wearing green uniforms with either green or white pants.\n\nHowever, pregame fashions can be any style and color under the rainbow, as evidenced by Chiefs WR JuJu Smith-Schuster.\n\nNot to be outdone, Chiefs TE Travis Kelce.\n\nAnd then there's Eagles DT Fletcher Cox.\n\nThis is another fascinating battle, as these are two of the top units in the NFL. The Eagles, however, have the best O-line in football. Their communication and ability to work together are unrivaled. They have two of the best players at their positions, center Jason Kelce and right tackle Lane Johnson (both of whom were first-team All-Pro selections). They bore open holes in Nick Sirianni’s zone read offense and are disciplined and clean in avoiding penalties.\n\nBut where Philadelphia has two All-Pros on its offensive line, the Chiefs have a pair of second-teamers in center Creed Humphrey and left guard Joe Thuney. Orlando Brown has been excellent after moving to left tackle and, considering this is a unit that has been remade, it has done a remarkable job of keeping Mahomes clean.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThe Eagles are five sacks in the Super Bowl from breaking the record of the 1984 Bears for total sacks in the regular and postseason combined (82). Three of Philadelphia’s starting four defensive linemen, defensive tackle Javon Hargrave and defensive ends Josh Sweat and Brandon Graham notched double-digit sack totals in the regular season, as each posted 11. The other starter, defensive tackle Fletcher Cox, is one of the game’s best interior linemen and recorded seven. The unit has depth with end Robert Quinn and tackles Linval Joseph and Ndamukong Suh coming on in relief.\n\nTo be clear, the Chiefs aren’t bad, they’re just not this good. Chris Jones is a force and the best interior lineman in football and Frank Clark can disrupt the timing and rhythm of opposing offenses. Kansas City just doesn’t have the depth or wealth of star talent to match Philadelphia in this spot.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nIt’s almost unfair to consider Haason Reddick as a pure linebacker, since Philadelphia loves using him in five-man fronts, rushing off the left side of the line of scrimmage — or even at defensive tackle — so his presence is frankly more of a consideration for the defensive line. With that in mind, where this Eagles defense is weakest is at the other two linebacker spots. And, considering that linebackers and safeties are among the players asked to cover tight ends, this could be a spot where the Chiefs exploit Philadelphia, using Travis Kelce.\n\nThe Chiefs unit that included Nick Bolton and Willie Gay Jr. took some time to get settled this season, but it improved after Gay returned from suspension and as the group got healthier. They have speed and excellent range, though they are sometimes caught out of position, in part because of the relative inexperience of Bolton and Gay.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThis is another spot in which Eagles executive vice president and general manager Howie Roseman’s aggressive moves in recent seasons have paid off. The three best players on the unit — corners James Bradberry and Darius Slay and strong safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson — were all acquired via trade or free agency. Bradberry had bounced around the league but found a home in Philadelphia’s defense, earning a second-team All-Pro nod.\n\nFor the Chiefs, cornerback L’Jarius Sneed clearing concussion protocol is a welcome sight; he doesn’t shy away from contact and actually helps out quite a bit in stopping the run along the outside. Trent McDuffie is a player who has perhaps been overlooked, though he has had a huge impact as a press corner. Rounding out the starters, at safety, Justin Reid and Juan Thornhill have become capable players. The biggest issue with the Kansas City secondary is the occasional blown coverage that can lead to chunk plays.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nAs far as kicking and punting goes, this becomes tricky because where the Eagles are strong with place kicker Jake Elliott, the Chiefs are stronger with punter Tommy Townsend, a first-team all-pro. Kansas City place kicker Harrison Butker had the worst season of his career, missing six field goals for a 75% conversion rate. Still, in his last three games, Butker has converted all field goals and extra points.\n\nThe Eagles may be without punter Arryn Siposs (ankle), who has said he is ready to play. He presents an upgrade, though backup Brett Kern has been solid in relief. Where the Chiefs separate themselves is with their return men. Both Isiah Pacheco and Skyy Moore are flashes of lightning who can slip through creases and flip field position.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThe Chiefs have the wealth of experience and Andy Reid may be the best coach not named Belichick over the last three decades. Offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy should be a head coach. And defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo has kept Kansas City’s defense competitive and loves to disguise blitzes, making it difficult for young quarterbacks to read the field.\n\nThe narrative that the Eagles have had a favorable path to the Super Bowl, while accurate, shouldn’t discount the effort and work it takes to win week in and week out. Coach Nick Sirianni’s players swear by him and offensive coordinator Shane Steichen could end up as a head coach this cycle. The zone read offense the pair have assembled requires defenses to make decisions in split seconds. Defensive line coach Tracy Rocker brings decades of experience and coordinator Jonathan Gannon oversees a unit that has taken a huge stride since last season.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nChiefs unlikely to face 49ers catastrophe if Mahomes gets hurt\n\nThe NFC championship game was a cautionary tale to NFL teams, particularly those vying for a title, about the risks of having only two quarterbacks active on game day.\n\nHowever, if catastrophe befalls the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday in Super Bowl 57, they have a plethora of emergency quarterback options – so many, that it's not immediately clear who would take snaps if presumptive MVP Patrick Mahomes and his, backup, Chad Henne, were unable to go. Obviously, that would be a worst-case scenario. But at least the AFC champs might become so wildly unpredictable that it could keep them in a game – at least temporarily.\n\n— Nate Davis\n\nEx-Broncos coach helps Eagles prepare for Chiefs offense\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles reportedly brought in some veteran experience ahead of their Super Bowl 57 appearance against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAccording to reports, the Eagles hired Vic Fangio to assist with game preparations that include self-scouting and analysis. NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport reported Fangio signed a two-week contract that is expected to expire after the Super Bowl.\n\nFangio agreed to become the Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator last month.\n\n— Jaylon Thompson\n\nFathers of Super Bowl 57 QBs wreck stereotype of absent Black dad\n\nDuring Super Bowl 57 you will see more than a game. You'll see two Black quarterbacks — raised lovingly by two Black dads (and also by their moms). You will also see one more thing: a stereotype busted.\n\nIf you're looking for the story — the often repeated one, the ever-lasting one, the stereotypical one — of the Black kid who grew up impoverished and still made it. If you're looking for the same ol' story about the Black kid without a father who overcame this and that and the other thing and golly gee, goodness gracious look at him now. Well, this Super Bowl quarterbacks story is not for you.\n\n— Mike Freeman\n\nSpecial game-day deliveries for 2 Chiefs players\n\nJust playing in the big game is already memorable enough, but two members of the Kansas City Chiefs will have even more reason to remember this Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nWhile he was busy preparing to face off against the Philadelphia Eagles, Chiefs guard Nick Allegretti learned his wife Christina went into labor and delivered healthy twin girls early Sunday morning in Chicago.\n\nAt about the same time the Allegretti girls were arriving, Chiefs wide receiver Mecole Hardman was frantically tweeting that his girlfriend Chariah Gordon was also about ready to give birth.\n\nThere could also be another Super Bowl baby before long on the other sideline.\n\nEagles center Jason Kelce and his wife Kylie are also expecting a baby.\n\nAndy Reid could win second Super Bowl – against his former team\n\nReid, 64, is a no-nonsense coach who has become endearing, never too shy to be himself or make others laugh at his own expense. He proudly wears Hawaiian shirts and professes his love for a good cheeseburger. He’s also one of the most accomplished coaches.\n\nReid was the Eagles’ coach for 14 seasons (1999-2012) and did mostly everything for the franchise – six NFC East titles, five NFC title games, one Super Bowl appearance – except win it all.\n\nWhen he was fired by Philadelphia, Kansas City pounced at the opportunity to hire him, and it has been rewarded with 10 winning seasons, nine playoff berths and a Super Bowl during the 2019 season.\n\nReid has the respect and the résumé to match, and he has an opportunity to solidify his Hall of Fame career with a second Super Bowl title. To do it against his former team would be special, too.\n\nSUPER BOWL STORYLINES: Reid, Kelce brothers, Mahomes' ankle all worth watching\n\n— Safid Deen\n\nWho will perform at the Super Bowl halftime show?\n\nWhile the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles take a break from shining bright like a diamond, Rihanna will be the Super Bowl 57 halftime show performer.\n\nIt's a show that's so exciting, at least one player is hoping to catch a glimpse.\n\nThe nine-time Grammy award-winner will perform a slew of hits with (or maybe without) some surprise guests. This will be her first public performance since 2018 when she performed DJ Khaled's \"Wild Thoughts\" at the Grammys.\n\n– Victoria Hernandez\n\nWith 10 Super Bowl appearances, Tom Brady has made his mark on the game's history, setting a plethora of individual records.\n\nBrady, who made 10 Super Bowl appearances with the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice – who appeared in four Super Bowls during his career with the San Francisco 49ers and Oakland Raiders – hold multiple standards in the NFL's annual championship showcase.\n\nFrom a team perspective, Brady's New England Patriots and Rice's San Francisco 49ers figure prominently.\n\nSUPER BOWL RECORDS: Will any legendary marks be surpassed in Super Bowl 57?\n\nSUPER BOWL HISTORY: All-time results, winners, MVPs, more\n\nSUPER BOWL HIGHLIGHTS: Nate Davis' 57 greatest moments in Super Bowl lore\n\nHow 'No crush, no rush' slogan has Philadelphia Eagles defense on historic sack pace\n\nThe four-word phrase coined by defensive ends and outside linebackers coach Jeremiah Washburn means the defense has to stop the run to earn the right to rush the quarterback. Entering Super Bowl 57, the defense has lived up to its motto.\n\n“If you don’t stop the run, you can’t pass rush nobody,” Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham said. “You got to take care of business. Early on, you got to send a message and let them know what the game is gonna be. You got to be the dictators. That’s any defense that wants to win a game, you got to let them know what it’s gonna be for the day.”\n\nThe Eagles had the NFL’s second ranked defense in the regular season and the unit hasn’t given up more than seven points in each of its postseason wins leading up to Super Bowl 57. When it comes to rushing the quarterback, the Eagles are on an historic pace.\n\nThe Eagles defense has amassed 78 total sacks across the regular season and postseason, the third most in NFL history. Philadelphia is three sacks away from surpassing the 1985 Chicago Bears for the second most sacks ever and five sacks shy of eclipsing the 1984 Bears (82 sacks) for the NFL single-season record.\n\n— Tyler Dragon\n\nJoe Biden's pregame Super Bowl interview with Fox called off\n\nPresident Joe Biden won’t be giving a pregame Super Bowl interview to Fox Soul after all.\n\nPresidents in recent years have granted wide-ranging interviews to the network hosting the Super Bowl. But last week there was confusion over whether Biden would follow the tradition.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted Friday that Biden had been looking forward to an interview on Fox Soul, a streaming sister service to the conservative Fox News. But she said the White House had been informed that the network’s parent company, Fox Corp., canceled the interview.\n\nBiden did pregame interviews with CBS in 2021 and with NBC in 2022.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\n'Superhero?' What other Chiefs say about QB Patrick Mahomes\n\nPatrick Mahomes exploded into an NFL superstar almost from the moment when he became the Kansas City Chiefs' starting quarterback in 2018, the year he also won his first MVP trophy.\n\nBut what we all see is not necessarily what Mahomes' teammates see.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports closely monitored and asked Chiefs players and coaches during the days leading up to the big game about what it's like being around their intrepid leader, and some common themes quickly emerged.\n\n— Nate Davis\n\nEagles' success starts at the top\n\nTo compare the team-building philosophies of the Philadelphia Eagles and last year's Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams, and classify them as similar would be to miss the point.\n\nThere is a difference between mortgaging the future and having a foundation for continued success in place. The Rams, quite literally, employed a “(expletive) them picks” strategy. The Eagles have a pair of first-round picks in the 2023 draft and Jalen Hurts, an MVP-level quarterback on a rookie (second-round selection) contract.\n\nLeadership starts at the top. Knowing the right time to push the chips toward the middle is essential to winning it all, and Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie has given general manager Howie Roseman, who has been with the organization since 2000, the latitude – and payroll – to be aggressive.\n\nIn Super Bowl 57 against the Kansas City Chiefs, Roseman's fingerprints will be all over the field.\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\n'Special' Super Bowl for Black quarterbacks\n\nWhen Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts take the field Feb. 12, they will be the first two Black quarterbacks to start against each other in the Super Bowl. It’s an accomplishment both quarterbacks fully embrace.\n\n“It is history. It’s come a long way. I think there has only been (eight) African American quarterbacks to play in a Super Bowl. To be the first for something is pretty cool. I know it’ll be a good one,” Hurts, the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, told reporters Thursday. “It’s history.”\n\nThere will be eight Black quarterbacks to start in a Super Bowl once the championship game kicks off: Doug Williams, Steve McNair, Donovan McNabb, Colin Kaepernick, Russell Wilson, Cam Newton, Mahomes and Hurts.\n\n– Tyler Dragon\n\nTHE 100-YEAR LONG ROAD: Fritz Pollard paved the way for Hurts, Mahomes\n\nOPINION: Fathers of Super Bowl 57 quarterbacks wreck stereotype of absent Black dad\n\nReport: Colts target Eagles offensive coordinator as next head coach\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts have reached a decision on who they want as their next head coach – but the process will have to wait until Super Bowl 57 concludes.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Shane Steichen is the Colts' top choice, and, according to ESPN, the team has already begun informing the other candidates that they are no longer being considered.\n\nSteichen, 37, has run the Eagles offense for the past two seasons. On the way to reaching the Super Bowl, Philadelphia ranked first in rushing yards and third in points per game in 2022. That would seem to mesh well with the Colts, whose offense revolves around 2021 NFL rushing champion Jonathan Taylor.\n\nIn addition, the Arizona Cardinals plan to interview Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon for their head coaching vacancy, according to NFL.com.\n\nEx-Eagles, Chiefs coach Dick Vermeil can't pick a favorite\n\nDick Vermeil led the Philadelphia Eagles to the franchise’s first Super Bowl appearance. He also finished his Hall of Fame career coaching the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nSo, in what direction is Vermeil’s allegiance flowing for Super Bowl 57?\n\n“I’ve put in my frame of mind right now, philosophically, I’m going to root for both teams to win,” Vermeil told USA TODAY Sports. “And I’ll feel very bad for the team that loses.”\n\nThe only person other than Andy Reid to have coached both the Eagles and the Chiefs, Vermeil, 86, won’t even be inside State Farm Stadium on Sunday.\n\n– Jarrett Bell\n\nSUPER BOWL RECORDS: Will any of these marks be broken in Super Bowl 57?\n\nJason or Travis? Donna Kelce has a plan for which son she'll visit first after Super Bowl 57\n\nDonna Kelce, the mother of Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, has a game plan for after Super Bowl 57.\n\nShe is going to visit the winner first.\n\nBut Donna Kelce told USA TODAY Sports that it's not about favoritism. It's logistics.\n\n\"In the Super Bowl, you only have a chance to see the winner,\" Kelce said at Super Bowl 57 Radio Row at the Phoenix Convention Center. \"The losers are immediately sent to their hotel, like go to your room.\"\n\n— Cydney Henderson\n\nSIBLING RIVALRY: Kelce brothers embrace 'enjoyable chaos'\n\nSuper Bowl expert picks\n\nComing off a pair of dominant postseason wins, the Eagles enter the game as slight favorites.

This is his third Super Bowl. He will be joined by umpire Roy Ellison, down judge Jerod Phillips, line judge Jeff Bergman, field judge John Jenkins, side judge Eugene Hall, back judge Dino Paganelli and replay official Mark Butterworth.\n\n— Jim Sergent\n\nAs Eagles' Nick Sirianni reaches Super Bowl, his brothers find success on parallel paths\n\nOver the past 20 years, Mike Sirianni has quietly become one of the top coaches in college football. He's never had a losing season. Never lost back-to-back regular-season games. His win percentage (.807) ranks sixth among active head coaches with tenures of at least 100 games, ahead of Dabo Swinney (.805) and Nick Saban (.801).\n\n\"People are like, 'You have the (sixth)-highest win percentage in college football right now,' \" he said. \"And I’m like, 'Yeah, but I’m the third-best coach in my own family.' \"\n\nThat would be behind middle brother Jay, who coached their high school alma mater to three New York state title games, winning two.\n\nAnd behind youngest brother, Nick, who will of course make his Super Bowl debut when the Philadelphia Eagles face the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.\n\n\"In my opinion, until Nick wins a Super Bowl, Jay’s got two state championships,\" Mike said. \"So to me, I’m still voting him No. 1.\"\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nGannett may earn revenue from Tipico for audience referrals to betting services.

More than 200 people joined the rally outside the Capitol. Tombstones were placed on the white marble steps of the Alabama Capitol to represent the men who died in Alabama prisons from suicides, murders and overdoses. The rally followed a three-week work strike at many prisons aimed at seeking changes to state sentencing laws and the parole system. Inmates refused to show up for jobs in prison kitchens, janitorial services and laundries, jobs that keep the prisons functioning but for which the inmates receive no pay. The Alabama Department of Corrections said Friday that two facilities for men continue to have complete work stoppages, and three facilities have partial work stoppages. Inmates and activists have accused the Department of Corrections of using pressure tactics in an attempt to end the demonstration. Officials said the reduced rations and the lack of visits were the result of a prisoner labor shortage. The U.S. Department of Justice is suing Alabama over the conditions in its prisons, saying the state is failing to protect male inmates from inmate-on-inmate violence and excessive force at the hands of prison staff. The case is slated for trial in 2024. Alabama officials have acknowledged problems but deny that the living conditions violate constitutional standards.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Mayor Dave Bronson’s administration officials approved a contractor to spend millions on building an emergency shelter without getting needed approval from the Assembly, Alaska Public Media reports. Public Works Director Lance Wilber said the city had given Roger Hickel Contracting the go-ahead to spend $4.9 million on the construction of a shelter and navigation center in East Anchorage. “The error on our part was that, in the traditional construction contracting process, we should have gone to the Assembly initially, and asked to amend the Hickel contract,” Wilber said. Anchorage municipal code states that any city contract of more than $50,000 has to be approved by the Assembly, according to the news outlet. The Assembly was supposed to vote on the contract in September, but the vote was pushed to Oct. 25 after concerns over costs. The East Anchorage shelter has been key to the Bronson administration’s response to homelessness.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Officials say eviction filings are continuing to rise in Arizona’s largest county, with the average judgment against tenants nearly doubling from four years ago. Maricopa County Justice Courts spokesman Scott Davis said this week that September was the third month in a row in which the filings were higher than they had been since October 2008. Maricopa County is home to Phoenix, the fifth largest city in the U.S. The average judgment against an evicted tenant has hit $3,337.50, up from $1,750.58 in 2008, said Davis. He also noted the number of eviction cases being sealed to protect tenants is rising due to a new law, with 248 cases sealed in just two weeks. Cases can be sealed to protect the tenant from future credit problems if, for instance, the rent is paid or if the paperwork is found to be deficient. Maricopa County had among the highest levels of evictions in the United States before state and federal eviction moratoriums slowed lockouts during the pandemic. Those eviction bans have long since ended.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Medical marijuana patients in the state are on track to spend more at dispensaries in 2022 than they did in 2021, a spokesman for the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration reports. Overall, purchases made by patients at Arkansas dispensaries totaled $31 million in 2019, then $182 million in 2020, $264.9 million in 2021 and so far this year, $205 million through the first nine months of 2022, said Scott Hardin, spokesman for the Arkansas Department of Finance Administration. “By the end of December, our overall sales for 2022 should certainly be above the $264.9 million sold in 2021,” Hardin said. While Arkansans approved medical marijuana in November 2016 in what is now Amendment 98 to the State Constitution, the first dispensary did not open in the state until May 2019. Arkansas limited the number of dispensaries allowed to sell medical marijuana. A limit on the number of dispensaries is also proposed in the Issue 4 state question on ballots for voters to consider legalizing recreational marijuana Nov. 8. “The reason sales were so low in 2019 was the number of dispensaries in operation. There were only a few dispensaries open for an extended period in 2019,” Hardin said. The number increased to 14 dispensaries by the end of 2019. There are currently 38 dispensaries. State tax revenue generated from medial marijuana totaled $2.9 million in 2019, $21.2 million in 2020, $33.1 million in 2021 and $23.9 million in 2022 through the first nine months. Overall, that is $81 million generated in state tax revenue since mid-2019.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCamp Pendleton: The Marine Corps has halted some operations of its new amphibious combat vehicles after one of the armored vehicles rolled over in surf during training. The eight-wheeled vehicle flipped over at about 7:45 p.m. Thursday at the Marines Assault Amphibian School at the base north of San Diego, authorities said. The three crew members weren’t injured, a Marine Corps statement said Friday. The vehicle had a “mechanical malfunction,” according to the Marine Corps, which banned the vehicles from going into or out of surf zones, except for testing, while more analysis is performed. The vehicles can still be used on land, in protected waters and in the open ocean. It was the second time this year that restrictions have been placed on the use of amphibious combat vehicles. Open water operations were halted after one of the vehicles rolled onto its side and another was disabled in unusually high surf on July 19 during another training exercise. The pause was lifted last month. The new vehicles, which are being tested and used in California, are designed to transport troops and their equipment from Navy ships to land. They are being rolled out to replace the Marine’s aging amphibious assault vehicle, which is lighter, slower and runs on tracks instead of wheels.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: The city is starting a multiday cleanup and outreach effort at Fountain Creek alongside partner agencies Monday to address environmental health and safety concerns. According to a news release from the city, the area has been identified as a concern for city officials, residents and business owners and there have been growing concerns of trash and people experiencing homelessness who often use the space as an encampment. Pueblo Code Enforcement unit is organizing the effort to gather community partners, including the Pueblo police and fire departments, for the cleanup. “The city of Pueblo’s biggest concern is the safety and health of the individuals in Pueblo and the protection of our waterway. We know this cleanup will provide much-needed outreach and the environmental protection in the area,” Mayor Nick Gradisar said in the release. Community partners involved in the effort are expected to provide outreach to the individuals experiencing homelessness in the area to meet their needs and connect them to resources. Loaders and skid steers will be used to transport trash, and once the cleanup is completed, boulders will be placed at various points in the area to discourage people from driving in and camping or living there.\n\nConnecticut\n\nPlainfield: Turbo-charged donations collected over the last two years from popular Plainfield motorcycle events helped the town secure a state grant that will add a bevy of new recreational offerings at a local park. Since first introducing the Plainfield Bike Night events two years ago, the overseeing event committee has taken in $22,500 from sponsors, sales and entrance fees, money later funneled into the town’s Recreation Department for use for parks and other improvements. But the “real” amount of those contributions is closer to $80,000 – a four-fold jump – thanks to the use of matching grants, town officials said. “From the very beginning, we planned on collecting money to help improve parks and anything else recreation-related,” said Leon Lefevre, president of the Plainfield Bike Night Committee. “But it wasn’t until last week when we made our latest check presentation that we found out how much in total it actually represented.” The group on Oct. 6 presented a $10,000 check to the recreation department, slightly less than the $12,500 raised in 2021. That check, along with last year’s donation, played a pivotal role in the town winning a $605,000 state Small Town Economic Assistance, or STEAP, grant that will jumpstart a $2 million planned phased upgrade to Lions Park.\n\nDelaware\n\nChristiana: Hobby Lobby, the national arts and crafts retailer, is planning to open a store in Christiana in January. The new store is taking a portion of a Burlington on Route 273 in University Plaza. It will be the first Hobby Lobby in New Castle County and the second in Delaware, joining a Hobby Lobby on Route 13 in Dover that opened in 2020. Burlington reopened in March in a smaller store to the right of their original University Plaza entrance when viewed from the parking lot. The entrance to Hobby Lobby will be to the left of the new Burlington. With more than 900 stores, Hobby Lobby says it’s the largest privately owned arts and crafts retailer in the world. Their stores offer home decor products, tableware, art supplies, fabrics and jewelry-making supplies. Adjacent to University Plaza, construction crews last summer cleared woods for a Wawa. A Wawa spokesperson did not respond when asked when the store will open. Approved plans also call for two retail pads – one for a fast-food or quick-service restaurant and the other for a larger restaurant. The Wawa will have gas pumps, according to the plan. New Castle County on Aug. 30 issued a building permit for Wawa. The permit expires after a year, but can be extended.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Initiative 82 is on the minds of voters in D.C., WUSA-TV reports. It would, over time, eliminate the tipped wage system that exists in some restaurants and bars. The debate has been an ongoing battle for years. “Change can be hard,” Andy Shallal of Busboys and Poets said. He hopes Initiative 82 gets support in November. “I really see tipping as something that is a past relic. Something that needs to, not be eliminated, but certainly not have people depend on it to make their living,” he said. The minimum wage for non-tipped employees in D.C. is $16.10 per hour, but just $5.35 for tipped employees. If passed, Initiative 82 would be slowly rolled out. Tipped employees will start earning $6 per hour by January 2023, $8 by next July and then two dollar raises each year until 2027, WUSA-TV reports. Shallal said it gives businesses time to make changes. “It should give time for a lot of businesses to make that adjustment and make it work, and you know, I think in the long run we’re going to be looking back at this years later and think, what were we thinking,” he said. But not all restaurants agree. Some say they can’t afford another mandatory increase in wages to stay afloat.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: The trial of a Florida woman accused of dressing up as clown in 1990 and fatally shooting the wife of a man she later married has been postponed following the disclosure of a law enforcement file containing information about other clown-sighting leads at the time. Prosecutors informed defense attorneys for Sheila Keen Warren on Wednesday that they had found a “clown sighting file” which defense attorneys had been demanding but prosecutors had been saying they didn’t have, according to a court filing by defense attorneys in Palm Beach County case. Defense attorneys in the motion asked for a delay in the first-degree murder trial which was scheduled to start the next week. The jury trial was canceled on Friday. Defense attorneys also are seeking sanctions against prosecutors for what they say are instances of failing to disclose evidence to the defendant and are asking that Keen Warren be allowed pretrial release from jail. The 25-page “clown sighting file” has the names, addresses or phone numbers of 40 credible leads, according to the court filing from defense attorneys. “Needless to say this will take the defense considerable time and resources to investigate,” the defense attorneys said. Marlene Warren was fatally shot in the face in May 1990 by someone in an orange wig, red nose and white face paint who handed her carnations and foil balloons after she answered the door of her upscale South Florida home.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal lawsuit filed Thursday accuses Bartow County of violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it fired two Black men two years ago. U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan of the Northern District of Georgia said the county, which is about 45 miles north of Atlanta, subjected former employee Carlen Loyal to a racially hostile work environment and retaliated against former employee Bobby Turner before dismissing them both. “No one should be forced to labor in an environment where employers condone racial slurs and employees are expected to tolerate them,” Buchanan said in a news release. “It is also unacceptable for an employer to foster a work environment where employees with the courage to report such abhorrent behavior experience retaliation from supervisors and face termination of their jobs. Our office will vigorously and continuously leverage our resources to address this type of illegal discrimination in the workplace.” Loyal worked for the county’s Road Department for almost 10 years and Turner, who is his brother-in-law, was also employed there for several years, according to the news release.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Maui County has a new contract to save taxpayer money by reducing energy, water and fuel usage, Hawaii News Now reports. The county announced Friday it’s partnering with Johnson Controls to save the county $73 million by improving energy at 141 locations. Johnson Controls plans to hire 40 workers to retrofit buildings with LED lighting, install electric vehicle charging stations, replace plumbing fixtures and much more, according to the news outlet. “This is a fiscally responsible project that saves taxpayer dollars, creates local jobs, reduces our carbon footprint, and importantly, frees up clean water that we can use for affordable housing,” Mayor Michael Victorino said. “Reducing dependence on fossil fuels means we are taking money out of an oil tanker and keeping it right here, investing in jobs for our residents.”\n\nIdaho\n\nIsland Park: A huge trout reeled in by an angler broke a state record, the Idaho Statesman reports. Hailey Thomas was on the lake with her family when a “heavy fish” took Thomas’ bait, according to an Oct. 12 news release from Idaho Fish and Game. She began reeling in the catch from Henrys Lake. “Hailey did a phenomenal job fighting the fish and keeping it out of the abundant weeds, notorious for knocking large trout off the line,” her husband, Shane, told the state department. “After a stressful minute or so, I reached out and scooped up the fish. The net I usually use for chasing carp looked so small, as the fish barely fit in!” The angler had reeled in a “monster” rainbow/cutthroat hybrid trout, officials said. It measured in at 36 inches long with a 21-inch girth, according to the release. Experts estimate it likely weighed between 17 to 20 pounds. Thomas posed for photos with her catch, then released it back into the lake, officials said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A Chicago police officer with ties with the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, was suspended for 120 days but won’t be fired, the city’s watchdog agency has announced. In its latest quarterly report, the Office of Inspector General said that a lengthy internal police department investigation was resolved through a “mediation agreement” in which the officer agreed not to dispute the allegations against him, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. The officer was not named in the report, but in previous articles in the newspaper Officer Robert Bakker has acknowledged that he took part in Proud Boys group chats, and the police department confirmed that Bakker was, in fact, the subject of the investigation. The investigation into a link between Bakker and the Proud Boys was first reported two years ago. Since then, the group that has been designated extremist by the Southern Poverty Law Center has found itself at the center of a criminal investigation into the siege at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Bakker, who was also under investigation for not disclosing to the police department that he was under FBI investigation, could not be reached for comment. The police department declined to comment. The inspector general’s office determined that a police department investigation by its internal affairs bureau found that Bakker “made a contradictory statement” about his participation in a Proud Boys’ chat group and lied about attending a Proud Boys-sponsored barbecue, the newspaper reported. Bakker has acknowledged to the newspaper after being contacted for an article about him in 2020 that he posted messages on the Proud Boys Telegram channel but maintained that he was never a member of the group.\n\nIndiana\n\nFort Wayne: The Fort Wayne City Council has asked the city’s attorney to answer several questions stemming from Mayor Tom Henry’s recent drunken driving crash and the suspension of his driver’s license for 90 days. Council President Jason Arp sent the letter to City Attorney Malak Heiny on Friday and asks for a reply by the close of business Wednesday. The questions seek information on 12 topics such as leasing information for the Chevrolet Impala the mayor was driving, insurance coverage and whether Henry was ever stopped by police previously. Henry’s blood-alcohol level was 0.152 after he was arrested the evening of Oct. 9. Indiana’s legal limit to drive is 0.08. Police said Henry was driving and his wife and mother-in-law were passengers when his vehicle went left of the center line and struck another car. The other driver was not injured. The 70-year-old Democrat pleaded guilty Monday to operating a vehicle while intoxicated endangering a person.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics employees who say that overtime and other payments were improperly paid will receive $15 million as part of a class-action suit that was filed in 2019, according to documents filed Friday. The healthcare system and about 11,000 workers have argued that managers didn’t pay overtime, bonuses or accrued leave as quickly as state and federal laws require. Lawyers for the employees said the settlement figure could have been as high as $64 million. However, they were worried that a higher court could have reduced the amount to as low as $11 million after lawyers for the Iowa Board of Regents threatened to appeal a judge’s ruling for partial summary judgment, the Des Moines Register reported. Based on that prospect, attorneys for the class members said in documents they “believe they have obtained a great result” with the settlement. The six employees who led the lawsuit will each receive $10,000. The other workers will each receive a share of the remaining $11.6 million, based on how many payments employees allegedly received from the hospital later than the law allows. The lawyers will take home $3.4 million. A spokesperson for the Board of Regents did not immediately return an email seeking comment.\n\nKansas\n\nStilwell: A Stilwell nurse practitioner is suing CVS, arguing she was dismissed last year for not filling prescriptions for contraceptives despite previously having a religious exemption. The lawsuit, brought by Suzanne Schuler in the U.S. District Court for Kansas on Wednesday, argues the company changed its policies earlier this year to deem filling prescriptions for birth control or Plan B were “essential” functions and that a religious exemption was no longer an option. The lawsuit said that Schuler’s Nazarene faith prevented her from “providing, prescribing, or facilitating the use of any drug, device, or surgical procedure that can cause abortion,” believing life begins at conception. In 2009, Schuler was hired as a nurse practitioner at a MinuteWell clinic at a CVS in Olathe. Two years later she sought and obtained a religious exemption from prescribing contraceptives and did the same in 2015 when asked to prescribe Plan B. Instead, she would send customers to nearby stores to obtain those services – though she argues this was a rare occurrence and one the lawsuit argues didn’t prompt customer complaints.\n\nKentucky\n\nInez: Martin County’s top elected official is resigning from office, leaving a vacancy in a post that has been plagued by instability in recent years. Martin County Judge-Executive Colby Kirk announced his resignation on Friday, WYMT-TV reported. Kirk is taking a job as CEO of One East Kentucky, a group that recruits business and investment to the region. “I have been proud to serve the people of Martin County and am grateful beyond words to all who have supported me in this role,” Kirk said. He is withdrawing from the November election, where he was unopposed after defeating another Republican candidate in the May primary. Kirk was sworn in as an interim replacement in January after the departure of Judge-Executive Victor Slone. Slone, who had been battling cancer, died in January about a month after announcing he was leaving the elected post. Slone replaced William Davis, who abruptly resigned in March 2021. The small Appalachian county has long struggled with issues in its aging water line system and funding the costly repairs. Kirk said he would help ensure a smooth transition for the next office holder. He will serve until Oct. 28.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Fans of New Orleans’ Mardi Gras season can expect another year of shortened parade routes. The Mayor’s Mardi Gras Advisory Council said Thursday that the shorter routes of 2022 will continue in 2023, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reported. “Due to the manpower shortage that we’re seeing across the country within the law enforcement community, we are going to do the exact same routes that we did last year,” said James Reiss III, the advisory council’s chairman. “I will add that we’re very aware, the city is very aware, that it affects all of us individual parading krewes differently.” The smaller police force and a shortage of other municipal workers led City Hall to cut blocks from the parades routes last year. The continuing surge of retirements and difficulty recruiting new officers has left the police department with the fewest commissioned officers in decades, leading Mayor LaToya Cantrell in August to question whether Carnival parades would even be possible in 2023, the newspaper reported. But Carnival boosters and others noted that even though shortened routs aren’t ideal, they’re better than nothing. “I know we don’t like the shortened routes,” Reiss said, “but if we can work independently with the NOPD to make sure that your individual krewe is doing what it needs to be doing to be safe around that route, it’s very much appreciated by the police department and by the city that we do that.” Mardi Gras 2023’s parade season begins Jan. 6. Mardi Gras will be celebrated Feb. 21.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A storm packing strong winds and heavy rain lashed the New England coast on Friday with the greatest impact in Maine, where more than 100,000 homes and businesses lost power. The storm brought a gust of 72 mph, just shy of hurricane force, to the Isle of Shoals off the Maine and New Hampshire coast, while 50 mph gusts hit coastal communities, said Sarah Thunberg, meteorologist for the National Weather Service. At the peak, nearly 70,000 homes and businesses were without power in Central Maine Power’s territory, officials said. The storm knocked down trees and left others barren of leaves, and brought several inches of rain to much of the region.\n\nMaryland\n\nSmith Island: A community is leaning on faith and neighbors in tornado cleanup. The aftermath of the tornado that struck Smith Island is still visible two months after it carved a destructive path through the sparsely populated Chesapeake Bay archipelago. The EF1 tornado began as a waterspout that continued on land, damaged a number of piers and homes despite not seriously injuring any residents. Efforts by local organizations like Smith Island United – led by Eddie Somers, Johnny Crantz Tyler, Scott Andreozzi, Duke Marshall, photographer Jay Fleming and Pastor Landon – have been at the forefront of rebuilding efforts. The Smith Island United Committee for Tornado Relief met in mid-September to discuss the first round of checks to be issued to uninsured tornado damage claimants. These first round of checks, approved in unanimous votes and distributed within 10 days, total approximately $34,000 that will take care of approximately 50% of claims submitted, according to the group’s social media post.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Federal transit authorities have no plans to try to take over the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority or withhold funds from the agency despite a harsh safety review of the MBTA released in August. Nuria Fernandez, head of the Federal Transit Administration, made the comments Friday in response to a question by Democratic U.S. Sen. Edward Markey during a Senate hearing in Boston on the troubled MBTA. “The Federal Transit Administration does not have the legal authority to take over the day to day operations of any transit agency,” Fernandez said, adding that even if it could take over the MBTA, the FTA would not have the capacity to manage the operations of the transit authority. Some Beacon Hill lawmakers have raised the possibility of placing the MBTA into federal receivership. Fernandez said the FTA will continue its oversight of the MBTA to ensure that it addresses ongoing safety concerns. The FTA report includes four “special directives,” requiring 53 separate actions that the transportation authority must take, including addressing worker shortages, prioritization of safety management, safety communication, and operating conditions, policies, procedures, and training. “The Federal Transit Administration is not currently withholding any funding from the state,” Fernandez added. MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak, said the agency is working to address the concerns detailed in the FTA report. “The system is safe, but we can and will do better,” Poftak said. “Safety has been and continues to be our top priority.” Poftak also said that while there will be some nighttime and weekend shutdowns of portions of the MBTA, including on the Red Line, there are no plans to shut down an entire subway line. The MBTA recently shut down the entire Orange Line for 30 days to complete what they said was the equivalent of five years of maintenance.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Thieves are using cloned key fobs to steal Dodge muscle cars and other high-powered vehicles directly from dealerships and even automakers in the state, then selling them for tens of thousands of dollars less than their value, according to authorities and court records. For one Ohio-based theft ring, it all came crashing down after a January holdup of a U.S. postal worker led authorities to connect several men to brazen car thefts in the Detroit area, long home to the country’s biggest automakers, including Dodge, which is now owned by international conglomerate Stellantis. Investigators then discovered that new Chargers, Challengers, Durangos and Ram pickups worth $50,000 to $100,000 were turning up in Ohio, Indianapolis and East Cost shipping ports after being sold on the street for $3,500 to $15,000, according to a criminal complaint. Thieves in the Detroit area are primarily going after Dodge vehicles with Hellcat engines, including Chargers and Challengers – “the fast ones,” Sgt. Jerry Hanna with the Macomb Auto Theft Squad said. “If a patrol car gets them, they are not stopping and they’re faster than patrol cars. They’re 150 mph all day,” he said. Instead of stealing them off the street, they’re driving them straight off dealership and assembly plant lots. Just this year, about a half-dozen vehicles – primarily Dodge Ram TRX pickups – were taken from a lot outside an assembly plant in Macomb County.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Before attending a packed Sunday morning service, Queen Sonja of Norway praised Mindekirken congregation for having maintained worship in Norwegian for all 100 years that the church has existed in Minneapolis. “It’s extraordinary to realize that, one hundred years after, Mindekirken is still fulfilling that purpose” of building community and preserving culture and language, she said to the nearly 500 people in attendance. They had lined up for more than an hour in this modest neighborhood in brisk fall weather in the 40s to participate in the service. Queen Sonja received a special greeting from Eline Gro Knatterud, 4, who presented the queen with a bouquet of red roses nearly as big as herself. The congregation was founded in 1922, at the tail end of a decades-long migration of hundreds of thousands of Norwegians to Minnesota that made the Twin Cities the “unofficial capital” of the Norwegian diaspora, said Amy Boxrud, the director of the Norwegian-American Historical Association.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Plummeting water levels in the lower Mississippi River are projected to drop even further in the weeks ahead, a projection shows, dampening the region’s economic activity and potentially threatening jobs in one of the country’s poorest states. In Vicksburg, on the Mississippi river’s east bank near the Louisiana line, the water is approaching its lowest level since 2012. The river’s level near that Mississippi city on Thursday was 4.3 feet, and it is projected to drop to 3 feet by Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. Falling water levels have disrupted industrial shipping and tourism in the area and are on pace to keep dropping. “Right now, the latest forecast is going to take us down on Nov. 8 down to 2 feet at Vicksburg and it could drop a lower than that,” Marty Pope, a hydrologist at the National Weather Service Office in Jackson, told the Vicksburg Post. A dearth of rainfall in recent weeks has left the Mississippi River approaching record low levels in some areas across several states. Nearly all of the Mississippi River basin, from Minnesota through Louisiana, has seen below-normal rainfall since late August. The low levels have caused barges to get stuck in mud and sand, disrupting river travel for shippers, recreational boaters and passengers on a cruise line.\n\nMissouri\n\nFlorissant: There is significant radioactive contamination at an elementary school in suburban St. Louis where nuclear weapons were produced during World War II, according to a new report by environmental investigation consultants. The report by Boston Chemical Data Corp. confirmed fears about contamination at Jana Elementary School in the Hazelwood School District in Florissant raised by a previous Army Corps of Engineers study. The new report is based on samples taken in August from the school, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Boston Chemical did not say who or what requested and funded the report. “I was heartbroken,” said Ashley Bernaugh, president of the Jana parent-teacher association who has a son at the school. “It sounds so cliché, but it takes your breath from you.” The school sits in the flood plain of Coldwater Creek, which was contaminated by nuclear waste from weapons production during World War II. The waste was dumped at sites near the St. Louis Lambert International Airport, next to the creek that flows to the Missouri River. The Corps has been cleaning up the creek for more than 20 years. The Corps’ report also found contamination in the area but at much at lower levels, and it didn’t take any samples within 300 feet of the school. The most recent report included samples taken from Jana’s library, kitchen, classrooms, fields and playgrounds. Levels of the radioactive isotope lead-210, polonium, radium and other toxins were “far in excess” of what Boston Chemical had expected. Dust samples taken inside the school were found to be contaminated. Inhaling or ingesting these radioactive materials can cause significant injury, the report said. “A significant remedial program will be required to bring conditions at the school in line with expectations,” the report said. The new report is expected to be a major topic at Tuesday’s Hazelwood school board meeting. The district said in a statement that it will consult with its attorneys and experts to determine the next steps. “Safety is absolutely our top priority for our staff and students,” board president Betsy Rachel said Saturday.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: In addition to the head-to-head races on this November’s ballot, a county is asking the public to decide if it wants to contribute to a public safety mill levy. The levy has several components, including county attorney and deputy salaries, pre-trial services and school safety. The levy amount is 14 mils, which would cost the taxpayer $18.90 per $100,000 of a home’s taxable value annually. Cascade County Commissioner Don Ryan explained that the levy could also go toward general public safety, although the commissioners would have to show how that allocation would make the public safer. Due to legislation that governs how much the county can raise taxes, Ryan said, the additional money for public safety must come from a levy. Ryan said the commission – and to some extent, the public – decides how the money is applied to public safety, and the commission seeks to solve long-term problems. “I’m a big supporter of letting the public determine how this goes,” Ryan said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Pickleball and tennis players might one day have multiple courts dedicated to each of their sports in the four quadrants of the city, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. The growing demand for courts prompted the city last summer to look at existing courts, gauge demand with a public survey and come up with a master plan. If approved by the Lincoln Parks and Recreation Department Advisory Board, the plan will guide how Parks and Rec approaches updates and additions to its existing courts. But the plan won’t be fully realized for years, according to the news outlet. “There’s no money to do this,” city parks planner Sara Hartzell told the advisory board, which must approve the plan. “From here, we put the master plan in our 10-year facilities plan and start working on funding.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Nevada Humane Society’s Reno facility is suspending its intake of cats and kittens while it handles a deadly panleukopenia outbreak. Over the past three weeks, more than 50 cats or kittens have shown symptoms of panleukopenia, according to Humane Society Chief Operating Officer Rory Adams. Panleukopenia is a highly contagious viral disease. Kittens are most severely affected by the virus, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. The disease is spread through fecal matter. It is not a threat to humans or dogs but is very contagious between felines; however, felines that have been vaccinated against the virus have a very low chance of contracting it. The shelter usually houses more than 300 cats or kittens, but since the outbreak, it has focused on adopting out healthy felines or placing them in foster care. As of Friday morning, there were 226 cats or kittens at the shelter, plus dozens in foster care. Over the past three weeks, 11 cats have died at the facility from the disease. It’s not uncommon for shelters to see cases of feline panleukopenia, marketing director Nicole Theodoulou said. What’s abnormal this time is the number of cats that have been exposed. The Humane Society experienced a number of panleukopenia cases this year, then noticed a sizable increase in cases in early October. CEO Greg Hall said staff isn’t sure of the cause of the outbreak, but they have tracked some of the cats that came from the same address. The outbreak does not affect the Humane Society’s Carson City facility.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nSomersworth: An ATM was stolen from outside Service Credit Union on Penny Lane early Friday morning, and city police say it wasn’t the only crime committed at that time. Somersworth police Capt. John Sunderland said the credit union’s burglary alarms were triggered around 3:04 a.m. and surveillance footage shows the standalone 24-hour drive-through ATM was removed with a pickup truck. Three minutes earlier, police responded to a vehicle fire at 24 Washington St., about two miles away from Service Credit Union. The Fire Department responded and extinguished the fire, which was then investigated by the Somersworth police and the New Hampshire fire marshal’s office. Sunderland said the fire is considered suspicious and the investigation is ongoing. The stolen ATM and the truck used to remove it were recovered by police. Sunderland would not say if the two incidents were connected, nor would he provide specifics about the vehicle set on fire. He said this is because both are still active investigations and the suspects are still at large. Service Credit Union was closed for a short period of time Friday while police and multiple other local and federal agencies, including the FBI, investigated the incident, according to Sunderland. The 24-hour ATM was not immediately back in place Friday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWildwood: Authorities have announced more arrests in connection with chaos during a pop-up car rally in southern New Jersey last month. Cape May County prosecutors and Wildwood police said one man was arrested on a riot charge and another in connection with an alleged assault on a police officer in the unsanctioned rally that occurred on the weekend of Sept. 24. Police across multiple communities struggled to control the chaotic situation as Nj.com reported social media videos showing modified vehicles revving engines and speeding off to cheers from crowds. WCAU-TV reported people hanging out of cars as drivers spun in circles, and also showed burnouts, drifting and crashes. Prosecutors earlier said Gerald White, 37, of Pittsburgh was charged with two counts of death by auto, assault by auto and other counts. They allege his car hit another car, killing a passenger in the other vehicle, 34-year-old Timothy Ogden, and then struck two pedestrians, killing Lindsay Weakland, 18, of Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Authorities also announced aggravated assault and assault by auto charges against 31-year-old Eryk Wnek of Linden, alleging that he collided with another vehicle and then struck a low-speed vehicle, critically injuring the driver and also injuring a woman and four juvenile passengers. Participants say the event gives enthusiasts a chance to gather and check out cars, but officials in other areas such as Ocean City, Maryland, have reported problems stemming from the event in previous years.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: State-owned public land continued to be a growing source of energy development as oil and gas production’s revenue share swelled in recent years, but renewable energy appeared poised for further growth. The New Mexico State Land Office announced it made $2.4 billion in revenue for Fiscal Year 2022, running from July 1, 2021, to June 30. This followed gradual growth since 2019 when the office raised $1.11 billion, dipping to $1.05 billion in 2020 – the year COVID-19 struck New Mexico and led to declines in fuel demand and reductions in oil and gas production – but recovered to $1.25 billion in FY 2021. Revenue almost doubled in FY 2022, and Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard attributed that to a renewed diversity of uses for State Trust land, in addition to the booming oil and gas industry. Money generated by the Land Office is used to fund public schools, hospitals and other public services in New Mexico.\n\nNew York\n\nQueens: A 15-year-old boy was fatally shot on a New York subway train Friday after a dispute between two groups of people escalated into violence. It was the eighth killing in New York’s subway system this year, at a time when a gradual increase in ridership after a steep decline during the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by riders’ safety concerns. According to police, who didn’t identify the victim, the teenager was in one of the groups that got into an argument on an A train in Queens shortly before 4 p.m. As the train neared the line’s final stop in Far Rockaway, near JFK Airport, someone fired one shot, striking the boy in the chest. A passenger helped him off the train when it reached the station. Police and emergency personnel took him to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Police were reviewing security camera footage from the station and the surrounding area. They didn’t say whether they had identified any suspects or a more specific motivation for the shooting. Despite the deployment of more than 1,000 more police officers in the system since the pandemic began, a survey released last month by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority found 70% of riders felt there were too few officers in the system. Barely more than 50% said they felt safe or very safe on trains or in stations.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: State government has spent roughly $2.5 million on Executive Mansion repairs during Gov. Roy Cooper’s tenure – expenses that a state official said were needed for critical safety, security and other upkeep for the over 130-year-old building. The Department of Administration, which maintains state-owned buildings, confirmed recently to North State Journal the total for expenditures and associated costs on the governor’s official residence since 2017. The Raleigh mansion, which first opened in 1891 and is a state historic site, also functions as office and venue space in addition to providing housing for Cooper’s family on the second floor. The building had water damage in the basement and walls and needed foundation repairs and brick restoration, along with repairs to 50-year-old plumbing, department deputy secretary Mark Edwards said. “For several months, we had to close all the exterior porches because they were unsafe for people to walk on,” Edwards told WRAL-TV. The needed repairs, after years of tight budgets, caused delays for Cooper to reside in the mansion when he took office in early 2017. The department declined to provide a line-item accounting of the expenses, with Edwards citing the special security measures for the building. But he said everything performed was necessary – with no “creature comforts or cosmetic changes” for Cooper’s family – and went through the required procurement process. Appropriations in state budgets have covered the expenditures over the years.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: Trial is scheduled for early next year for a man accused of setting up an explosives manufacturing operation in his townhouse garage, where police reported finding a large stockpile of bomb-making materials. Police said they seized nearly 1,500 pounds of explosives upon completing the removal and disposal of the materials Friday evening from the townhouse in Williston, in the state’s northwest oil patch. Ross Petrie, 28, of Williston, is charged with a felony called “release of destructive forces.” An affidavit of probable cause said Petrie’s explosives could have had “catastrophic consequences.” A criminal complaint and the probable cause affidavit did not provide a motive for the explosives stockpile though police said more information would be released on Monday. Trial for Petrie is set for Feb. 13. His attorney, Jeff Nehring, did not return a phone message left Saturday afternoon. Officials say they evacuated more than 10 people from the building in which Petrie’s townhouse was located. Authorities said the building will remain empty until police complete their inspection and deem the units safe for residents to return. The affidavit says law enforcement officers began serving a series of search warrants at Petrie’s residence on Oct. 10 after being told a narcotics lab could possibly be in operation. That’s when they discovered explosive materials including powdered metals, according to the affidavit.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: There is an enormous, 900-plus pound hole in the the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium’s polar building. On Wednesday, Anana, a beloved polar bear and long-time zoo favorite, died by euthanasia. The Columbus Zoo announced Anana’s death on Friday via social media, noting that the 16-year-old polar bear did not previously suffer from any medical conditions, but had been acting “unusual” over the past few months. “Extensive testing did not provide a clear diagnosis, and the possibility of an autoimmune syndrome could not be ruled out, so Anana was aggressively treated,” the Columbus Zoo wrote on Facebook. “Although Anana initially improved, her condition declined dramatically over the last week and the decision was made to humanely euthanize her.” Anana, a mother, sister, aunt and independent bear was best known for crafting cozy napping spots, masterfully hunting trout and acting as a “true princess” when refusing to get on the scale to reveal her actual weight, the Columbus Zoo added in its post. The 16-year-old and her twin sister, Aurora, were born on Nov. 25, 2006, at the Toledo Zoo before moving to the Pittsburgh Zoo in 2008. After their stint in Pennsylvania, the sisters arrived at the Columbus Zoo in February 2010, just in time for the grand opening of the zoo’s Polar Frontier exhibit.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: The University of Oklahoma announced a $2 billion fundraising campaign Friday, having raised $600 million over the past two years for the effort. OU began a “quiet launch” on July 1, 2020, for Lead On: The University of Oklahoma’s Campaign for the Future. On Friday, it revealed the campaign’s goal of raising $2 billion by June 30, 2027. The university pledged to dedicate $500 million to scholarships and student support and $300 million to recruit and retain faculty. All three OU campuses – the flagship Norman site, OU-Tulsa and the OU Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City – would benefit, the university said in a news release Friday. It promises to support affordable education, research and health care services, among other initiatives.OU collected $237.9 million in the campaign’s first year. The 2022 fiscal year has been the most fruitful with $317.4 million raised from more than 80,300 donations. Fifty-four of those donations gave $1 million or more.\n\nOregon\n\nPrineville: Authorities are investigating the cause of a house fire in central Oregon city that killed two children. KTVZ-TV reports that members of the children’s family escaped the home in the blaze, which was reported before 6 a.m. on Saturday in Prineville, about 112 miles east of Eugene. Crook County sheriff’s deputies and firefighters arrived to find the home fully engulfed by flames, sheriff’s Sgt. Javier Sanchez said in a statement. “Most family members safely made it out of the house,” Sanchez said, adding that “even with the quick response from law enforcement, Fire and Rescue and residents on scene, two children were not able to get out and are deceased due to the fire.” The children’s ages weren’t immediately released. A telephone message to the sheriff’s office seeking additional information Sunday wasn’t immediately returned. Sanchez asked anyone with information about the fire to contact the sheriff’s office.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYork: Prosecutors have dropped plans to seek the death penalty against a man accused of killing a man and wounding a woman when he opened fire inside a movie theater almost three years ago. Anu-Malik Johnson, 23, is charged with first- and third-degree murder, aggravated assault, reckless endangering and related offenses in the December 2019 shooting of 22-year-old Andre White Jr. at Regal Cinemas 13 in West Manchester Township. York County prosecutors told the court they planned to pursue capital punishment if he was convicted of first-degree murder. Two years ago, a judge declined to bar them from doing so, rejecting defense arguments alleging a lack of evidence and citing the defendant’s age. The York Dispatch, however, reports that the district attorney’s office asked last week to withdraw its intent to seek the death penalty, citing a mitigation report submitted by the defense as well as “relevant case law and applicable jury instructions.” Defense attorney Jonathan White hailed the decision, saying he had “hoped and believed” prosecutors would drop plans to seek capital punishment. “I believe they made the right decision,” he said while declining to talk about the contents of the mitigation report. Kyle King, spokesperson for the district attorney’s office, declined comment, saying his office doesn’t comment on “pending matters,” he said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: The Pawtucket Police Department is warning “everyone, parents in particular,” after they seized “numerous” packages of marijuana edibles in small bags that “closely resembled common household snacks.” The police found the bags Wednesday while executing a search warrant on Reservoir Avenue. “Detectives seized a large amount of marijuana and packaging material. Also seized were numerous individual sized packages of marijuana edibles in which the packaging closely resembled common household snacks,” the police said in a news release. The police arrested a man on domestic violence and drug charges. Rhode Island legalized the recreational use of marijuana in May, but people can possess only up to one ounce in public and up to 10 ounces in their home. A license is required for selling. On their Facebook page, the police wrote, “We urge everyone, parents in particular, to pay close attention to the packaging on your food, snacks, and candy, especially as we get closer to Halloween. You will notice while the packaging appears incredibly similar to the normal products, there are slight differences. Some of the differences include the marijuana edible packages saying “medibles,’ having a marijuana leaf symbol, listing THC, and/or having a cannabis alert symbol. Some common cannabis/marijuana alert symbols are included.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Two South Carolina Highway Patrol officers were injured, one critically, when they were hit by a vehicle early Sunday during a traffic stop in Greenville, authorities said. The driver fled but was later taken into custody, according to the Greenville County Sheriff’s Office. The officers were taken to a hospital, and one of them was treated and released. The other officer was critically injured, the sheriff’s office said in on its Facebook page. The sheriff’s office did not update the officer’s condition or identify the suspect.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Class of 2022 in South Dakota fared better than the national average on the ACT this year, despite the nationwide average composite score declining to the lowest it’s been in more than three decades. ACT (American College Testing) is used to gain admission into colleges and universities throughout the country, and for scholarship consideration. South Dakota’s average composite score was 21.5, compared to the nation’s average composite score of 19.8. In South Dakota, 58% of graduates took the test this year, compared to 36% of the nation’s graduates. South Dakota’s statewide average composite score of 21.5 beat those of neighboring states, too: North Dakota (19.2), Minnesota (21), Iowa (21.4), Nebraska (19.4), Wyoming (19.2) and Montana (19.3). State Education Secretary Tiffany Sanderson said South Dakota’s surpassing of the national average composite score on the ACT this year is thanks to the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. “That tells me South Dakota’s commitment to maintaining face-to-face instruction during the pandemic was the right one to support continued student learning,” she said in a news release from the South Dakota Department of Education. But South Dakota’s success can’t be pinned on the pandemic alone. The state has scored above the national average since at least 2009, according to DOE data.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Public housing agencies in Tennessee can no longer include provisions in their leases that bar tenants from having guns in their homes, a state appeals panel has ruled. A three-judge panel of the Tennessee Court of Appeals made the unanimous decision Thursday, saying that the prohibitions in public housing violate the 2nd Amendment rights of its residents. In the ruling, the judges cited a prominent U.S. Supreme Court decision from June that expanded gun rights, while striking down a New York law requiring people to demonstrate a particular need for carrying a gun in order to get a license to carry a gun in a concealed way in public. The Tennessee decision could set up an appeal to the state Supreme Court, which has a majority appointed by Republican governors. The case centers on a lawsuit by Kinsley Braden, who signed a lease agreement with Columbia Housing & Redevelopment Corporation in April 2018 that barred him from having a gun on the premises. In November 2020, housing officials sought to evict Braden when they found out he had been keeping a handgun in his residence at the Creekside Acres low-income housing complex. Lower court judges ruled in favor of Columbia Housing in the initial case and an appeal, then Braden sought another review, the ruling states. In the latest decision, Judge Frank Clement wrote that “a total ban on the ability of law-abiding residents – like Mr. Braden – to possess a handgun within their public housing unit for the purpose of self-defense is unconstitutional under the Second Amendment.” The ruling reasoned that public housing is not similar to other types of “sensitive” government buildings where guns can be banned, including statehouses, polling places and courthouses. Clement also acknowledged that it is “largely unsettled whether public housing developments could constitutionally prohibit firearm possession under both the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and nearly identical provisions of certain state constitutions.” He wrote that states have come to different conclusions on whether such bans are allowed.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A small airplane experiencing technical problems made an emergency landing on a road in a Dallas neighborhood Saturday afternoon. Engine problems forced the plane to land on West Kiest Boulevard around 3 p.m., WFAA-TV reported. The unnamed husband and wife who were operating the airplane escaped injuries and there were no injuries on the ground, Dallas Fire-Rescue officials said. The Federal Aviation Administration said the multi-engine DA-622 landed about 2 miles from Dallas Executive Airport. The plane was en route to the airport from Winston Field in Snyder, Texas, about 250 miles west of Dallas, WFAA reported. There was no fire or leaked fuel at the landing site, but some power lines were knocked down and a speed limit sign was struck, Dallas Fire-Rescue said. Electric utility Oncor said only one customer lost service due to the contact with power lines, WFAA reported.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A man and his son, an Illinois resident, have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Bradley Bokoski, 58, of Eagle Mountain, Utah and Matthew R. Bokoski, 31, of Chicago entered pleas on Thursday, according to documents filed with the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, to one count each of unlawful parading, demonstrating or picketing at the Capitol. Charges of impeding Congress by illegally entering the Capitol will be dropped as part of a plea agreement in each case, according to the U.S. Justice Department. The misdemeanor charges carry a maximum sentence of six months in prison, five years’ probation and a $5,000 fine. Sentencing was set for Jan. 17. According to court documents, the Bokoskis traveled to Washington to hear President Donald Trump speak at a rally on Jan. 6, then followed the crowd to the Capitol, which they entered through a breached Senate door. After the crowd was met by 10 to 15 police officers, both men turned around and left, the complaint said. They were in the building for about five minutes. A tip to the FBI provide screenshots of Matthew Bokoski’s Facebook page, including one post depicting a group of people inside the Capitol and a caption reading, “I was with my dad and walked right up the capital steps and inside with others,” the complaint said. The riot delayed the certification of Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election, but Congress reconvened hours later to do so. Both men were arrested in May.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The school board in Vermont’s largest city plans to sue the manufacturer of chemicals that forced the closure of Burlington High School, officials said. Burlington School District officials on Thursday announced plans to sue agro-chemical giant Monsanto after PCBs were found in the existing building and soil during renovations, forcing the closure of the school, which also housed the Burlington Technical Center. In a statement, Bayer, which now owns Monsanto, said Monsanto “voluntarily stopped producing PCBs 45 years ago and its conduct has been appropriate at all times.” “Until the company terminated their production, PCBs were lawfully used in a number of commercial products that were manufactured by other companies,” the statement said. “We will assess and respond to a complaint if one is filed.” School officials now are planning to demolish the existing building and build a new school and technical center in the same area. Burlington voters will cast ballots next month on a proposed $165 million bond, but the city estimates the total cost of the improvements could be $190 million. Burlington Board Chair Clare Wool said the lawsuit could mean long-term financial compensation for the district, but to move forward with the plans for the new school they still need to have the bond approved. “Even though we plan to pursue this course of environmental lawsuit zealously and aggressively, we are viewing this as a long-term strategy and are anticipating that this work could consume a number of years,” Wool said in a statement. The city did not say when it planned to file its lawsuit.

Someone fired into the crowd at an outdoor gathering on Devon Lane in Harrisonburg, city police said in a statement. Eight people ranging in age from 18 to 27 were taken to hospitals with injuries that were not considered life-threatening, police said. No suspects were on the scene when officers arrived and investigators are looking into how many people fired shots, police said. No arrests have been made. The incident was isolated to the gathering and police said they don’t believe there’s any threat to the greater community. The housing complex where the shooting occured is near James Madison University, but city spokesperson Michael Parks said no students were injured, WTOP-FM reported.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: While celebrating 50 years as a ballet company, the Pacific Northwest Ballet is making history. “This is a moment for us,” dancer Jonathan Batista told KUOW while describing how he felt about becoming the first Black principal dancer in the history of the Pacific Northwest Ballet. The newly promoted Batista joined the organization as a soloist last year and says moving to the highest rank as a ballet dancer last month means the world to him and the Black dance community. “Being the first Black dancer in 50 years of Pacific Northwest Ballet, this is a moment for young Black boys, young Black girls, that want to dance, that want to see themselves on that stage,” Batista said. Originally from Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, Batista has performed with companies from the UK to Canada, sometimes as the only Black member of the company. Batista says he’s grateful to make history through his promotion to principal dancer in Seattle. “It is such an honor to be in this position,” he said. “It also is a moment where I think, ‘Wow, it took 50 years for Black man, for Black person, to become a principal dancer.’ ” The Pacific Northwest Ballet has a total of 46 dancers in its company. Batista is one of nine who identify as Black. In addition, Cecilia Iliesiu and James Kirby Rogers were also promoted to principal dancers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state of is receiving around $1.7 million in federal funding over five years for a behavioral health program treating adults with serious mental illness. The money will be used to serve people living with mental illness who are also living with a physical health condition, chronic disease or substance use disorder, according to a West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources news release. The initiative is called “West Virginia Promoting Integration of Primary and Behavioral Health Care Program.” Participants in 16 counties will receive services from Seneca Health Services Inc., Southern Highlands Community Behavioral Health Center and United Summit Center. Residents of Barbour, Braxton, Gilmer, Greenbrier, Harrison, Lewis, Marion, McDowell, Monongalia, Nicholas, Pocahontas, Preston, Taylor, Upshur, Webster and Wyoming counties are eligible. The grant was awarded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Enrollment in the state’s public school districts is continuing to decline, while other types of schools have picked up more students, according to the state’s annual late September headcount. The picture isn’t complete, as the count excludes homeschooling and students who pay tuition in private schools. And the numbers released by the Department of Public Instruction on Friday are unaudited. According to the preliminary numbers, the decline for public school districts is less dramatic than earlier years of the pandemic but continues a downward trend that creates more budget holes for public schools. The enrollment total for public school districts fell by nearly 7,000 students to a total of about 808,000, almost a 1% drop from last year. At the same time, the number of students using state-funded vouchers to attend private school rose by over 3,000 to a total of about 52,000, a 7% gain for those programs. Independent charter schools, which are not run by school districts, gained about 460 students to total over 11,000, about a 4% gain. These trends predate the pandemic, though some trends were accelerated with the pandemic. The most extreme enrollment change that occurred during the pandemic was a 10% drop in kindergarten and pre-kindergarten enrollment in public school districts in the 2020-21 school year, when many schools had not reopened.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Motorists have faced a range of road construction activity in the city, particularly downtown or near the central business district, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. One area has had lane closures and occasionally shuttered portions of a busy street. But work on that project coordinated by the Wyoming Department of Transportation is nearing the finish line. For several months, the construction project has resulted in lane closures, mostly to the south of Lincolnway along Warren Avenue. Weather permitting, the project is on track to be finished in the coming week, according to an interview with WYDOT District 1 public information specialist Andrea Staley. According to various officials and construction workers, paving has been underway along Warren Avenue between 16th and 24th streets. “They are paving today and weather-dependent, it could go into next week, through next week,” WYDOT’s Staley told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle on Thursday. “Our contractors are going to be finishing the pavement.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2022/02/28/kevin-dowling-pennsylvania-trial-shooting-spring-grove-1997/6943850001/", "title": "Kevin Dowling wins new trial in 1997 death penalty case in York ...", "text": "On Aug. 5, 1996, Jennifer Myers was robbed of about $40, tied up and sexually assaulted at her business, Tailfeather Gallery, in West Manchester Township. The perpetrator gagged her with a shirt and, at one point, pointed a handgun at her and threatened to shoot if she didn’t shut up.\n\nMyers did not know her assailant. But she later recognized her attacker at a Sheetz in Hanover: Kevin Brian Dowling.\n\nNot long before she was set to testify against him, Myers, a mother of two and rose aficionado, was shot and killed at her new business, Gray Fox Gallery in Spring Forge Plaza in Spring Grove, at about 1 p.m. on Oct. 20, 1997.\n\nThe sole eyewitness who testified at Dowling's murder trial — Sandra Eller — stated that she had “no doubt at all” that she saw him in the parking lot of the shopping center on the day of the deadly shooting after grocery shopping.\n\nEller said she wasn't sure of the exact time. She testified that it could have been about 11:20 or 11:30 a.m.\n\nThough her receipt from Kennie’s Market listed the time as 10:50 a.m., Pennsylvania State Police Trooper William Mowrey testified that clock in the cash register was behind and inaccurate.\n\nDowling was found guilty of first-degree murder in 1998 and sentenced to death.\n\nDowling 1998 trial:Read YDR's complete coverage of this fascinating York County case\n\nThe Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office — which has handled court proceedings after Dowling's conviction — now concedes that the timestamp on the receipt from Kennie's Market that morning was, in fact, accurate. So Eller, a judge has determined, must have been mistaken when she made that identification.\n\nMore than 24 years after the killing, Lebanon County Senior Judge Robert J. Eby on Feb. 22 awarded Dowling, now 63, of East Petersburg, Lancaster County, a new trial, ruling that his defense attorney was ineffective and that prosecutors did not turn over exculpatory evidence and presented false testimony about the receipt from the supermarket.\n\n“This Court has thoroughly considered whether trial counsel provided effective assistance of counsel to Petitioner during his trial,” Eby wrote in a 31-page opinion. “We conclude that he did not.”\n\n“This Court has also thoroughly and extensively considered whether the Commonwealth participated in the suppression of exculpatory evidence prior to Petitioner’s trial in October and November of 1998, as well as whether the Commonwealth failed to correct testimony of both Eller and Trooper Mowrey which it knew or should have known to be materially false,” he added. “On both of these issues, we concluded that is has.”\n\nRelated:In Pa., many death penalty cases are overturned. York County is no exception. Here's why.\n\nIn an email, Assistant Federal Defender Tracy Ulstad, Dowling’s new attorney, said she had no comment at this time.\n\nDowling’s trial attorney, Jerry Lord, also declined to comment. Former York County First Assistant District Attorney Tom Kelley, who prosecuted the case, asked for a copy of the opinion and stated \"we never didn't disclose anything.\"\n\nIn a statement, Molly Stieber, press secretary for the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office, said, “We respectfully disagree with the conclusion reached by the court and plan to appeal.\"\n\nCheck out:Man awaiting new death penalty phase trial in 1998 double-murder in York dies in prison\n\nMowrey testified that he went to Kennie’s Market five days after the deadly shooting to investigate whether the timestamps on receipts were correct, according to the opinion.Eller’s receipt, his police report indicates, shows that the sale started at 10:45 a.m. on Oct. 20, 1997. Mowrey said investigators checked that cash register — Register No. 6 — and determined that the time printed on receipts was 20 minutes behind on that date.Law enforcement inspected the other registers at the supermarket and found that each showed a different time, according to his police report. Mowrey reported that police collected four register receipt rolls and placed them into evidence.Mowrey did not describe his methodology as well as how he reached the conclusion that the times on all the registers were incorrect, the opinion states.\n\nRight before trial in 1998, Mowrey went back to Kennie’s Market to again check the times on the registers.\n\nRegister No. 6, he testified, was 11 minutes slow. His police report, though, indicated there was a time discrepancy of 17 minutes.\n\nRead:Execution date set for York mass murderer, though it's unlikely he will be be executed\n\nA Bucks County jury that was brought in for the trial because of press coverage, the opinion states, received a copy of Eller’s receipt with a handwritten note that specified, “20 minutes off.”Dowling's wife, Joanne, provided investigators with a videotape that purported to show her husband fishing at the time of the murder on Muddy Run Lake in Lancaster County.Robert Boyle, a professor of physics and astronomy at Dickinson College, reviewed the footage and, using shadows and the angle of the sun, determined that some of the times in the videotape had been changed. Dowling conceded that he’d altered the times. That’s because, he said, he did not want his wife to know that he’d grown bored with fishing and left to go to a strip club in Harrisburg.\n\nDuring the trial, Clarence Hess, the rental boat proprietor at Muddy Run Lake, which is 40 miles away from Spring Forge Plaza, testified that Dowling got into a boat at about 10:20 a.m. and was on the water for 30 to 45 minutes, according to the opinion.\n\nProsecutors presented evidence at trial that it takes one hour and three minutes, or one hour and eight minutes, to drive from Muddy Run Lake to Spring Forge Plaza.\n\nBased on the prosecution's evidence, Dowling would not have been able to make it to the shopping center until 11:50 a.m. at the earliest — one hour after Eller had already checked out, Eby noted. Because the time on her receipt is accurate, the judge noted, she must have been mistaken in her identification.\n\nKenneth Hewitt, of WSR Consulting Group LLC, provided an expert report that the internal register clock was accurate on Register No. 6. Christienne Genaro, with PayGility Advisors, independently confirmed his findings and submitted her own report, according to the opinion.\n\nProsecutors hired their own experts, Dennis and Jeffrey Houser of Financial Forensic Consultants LLC, who reported that they would testify that they agreed with the findings of the defense experts.\n\nMore:York County judge throws out death sentence against double-murderer due to jury error\n\nFirst, Eby determined that Lord provided ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nLord, he said, failed to request access to “readily available exculpatory evidence:\" the four receipt rolls. He also did not investigate whether the time on the receipt was accurate.\n\nInstead, Lord called Mowrey to testify that the time on the receipt was “off\" and erroneously strengthened Eller's testimony.\n\n“*This item is very important,” Lord wrote in a memo that he faxed to his investigator, Bill Donivan, days before jury selection. “If we can establish the clock was definitely off by 20 minutes on 10/20/97, it will establish Dowling could not have been the guy S. Eller saw at Kennies on the morning of 10/20/97 …”\n\nIf Lord had requested the register rolls and investigated, he would’ve had “objective proof” that his client was not the man whom Eller saw outside Kennie’s Market. And he would’ve been able to show that Mowrey’s conclusions were \"baseless and patently false,\" Eby said.\n\nMowrey, he said, was not competent to provide an expert opinion.\n\nEby remarked that memo provided him with a “clear window into trial counsel’s flawed thought process, resulting in an unreasonable trial strategy.”\n\nLord later testified and did not offer a reason for not hiring a point-of-sale expert besides that he was not familiar with any defense attorneys and assistant district attorneys hiring them. But Eby stated that was common in 1998.\n\n\"Had he done any of these things, it is clear there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different,\" Eby said. \"Petitioner was prejudiced.\"\n\nAlso of interest:His son faces the death penalty in a deadly shooting at Regal West Manchester. Why this York father blames himself.\n\nSecond, Eby ruled that prosecutors failed to turn over the receipt rolls, which were exculpatory.\n\nProsecutors, he said, knew that the time when Eller checked out was important their case. They knew, or should have known, that her identification must’ve been mistaken, Eby said.\n\n\"Nevertheless, at trial, the Commonwealth relied upon the incompetent, unscientific and undocumented investigation of Trooper Mowrey in an attempt to bolster Eller's testimony and convince the jury that her receipt was inaccurate,” Eby said.\n\nEby said there is \"more than a reasonable likelihood that this false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\"\n\nDowling is currently incarcerated at the State Correctional Institution at Phoenix, according to prison records.\n\nDylan Segelbaum is the courthouse reporter at the York Daily Record, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK.

It ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick” was never going to be an easy sell.\n\nSure, the film starred Tom Cruise — arguably one of Hollywood’s most iconic movie stars — and it would be the sequel to “Top Gun,” one of the biggest blockbusters of all time. But the original “Top Gun” was in theaters when Ronald Reagan was president, leg warmers were still in style, and the New York Mets last won the World Series.\n\nThe challenge for Paramount — the studio that released the film — and its CEO Bob Bakish was how to roll out a sequel to the 1986 Cold War classic for a world that had seemingly left Pete “Maverick” Mitchell and his “need for speed” behind.\n\nAnd as if that wasn’t enough, the movie was scheduled to be released in the summer of 2020 when the world was in the midst of pandemic that was shutting down entire industries and throwing millions of people out of work and, oh yes, closing movie theaters around the world.\n\n“It was pretty clear that that wasn’t a viable idea,” Bakish told CNN Business about releasing the film. “The world was pretty shut down, you weren’t going to put an expensive movie that you had real hopes for… in theaters and have nobody come.”\n\nWhat was Paramount to do? “Maverick” was ready to take off — but had nowhere to land. The film, with its hefty $170 million price tag, could go straight to streaming — like many movies did during the pandemic — and as a marquee title would have likely pushed subscribers to the studio’s growing streaming service, Paramount+. However, the company chose to save it for the big screen.\n\n“We really felt, and Tom [Cruise] certainly agreed with the fact that we had a great big screen movie and we just had to hold it,” Bakish said. “It just felt like the right thing to do.”\n\nStill, it was a big risk. Would audiences leave their homes during a pandemic to watch a sequel to a movie more than three decades old? Bakish and Paramount wouldn’t find out until roughly two years after the film’s original release date, after its fourth and final release date of May 27, 2022.\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick” has since become the fifth-highest-grossing film in US history.\n\n“The future is coming… and you’re not in it”\n\n\"No one could predict it would do this well,\" Paramount CEO Bob Bakish said about \"Top Gun: Maverick\" Eamonn M. McCormack/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures\n\n“It’s a very, very bad time to own a movie theater.”\n\nThat’s how Brent Lang, executive editor of Variety, described the climate of the movie theater industry during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.\n\nThe global health crisis shuttered theaters, delaying films for months, if not years. That left some in Hollywood to wonder if the business, which notched more than $40 billion in global ticket sales in 2019, would ever recover.\n\nStreaming — which had already upended the theatrical model — was now booming. Netflix was setting subscriber records, Disney+ surpassed 100 million subscribers in a mere 16 months and other new services were popping up seemingly every day.\n\nAmid that landscape, Warner Bros. decided to release its entire 2021 film slate directly to theaters and simultaneously to the company’s streaming service, HBO Max — a move that shocked Hollywood. (Warner Bros., like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nYet, cineplexes kept trying. In 2021, hits like Sony’s “Venom: Let There Be Carnage,” Disney’s “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” and Universal’s “F9: The Fast Saga” all brought in sizable ticket sales that helped theaters stay open.\n\nBut it wasn’t until Marvel’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home” debuted on the big screen in December that theaters saw a glimmer of hope. “No Way Home” made nearly $2 billion worldwide, but it didn’t really give the industry the confidence it needed — after all, Marvel movies are supposed to do well at the box office no matter what.\n\nSo if a superhero couldn’t save the day, what kind of film would inject new life into theaters? Enter a cocky 60-year-old flyboy and his rag-tag team of young fighter pilots.\n\n“Maverick” flew into theaters with lots of buzz and strong reviews, and that helped the movie blow past box office projections for its opening weekend. It brought in a Memorial Day weekend record of $160 million at the North American box office. That alone would have been a victory for Paramount, but the film was just taking off.\n\nAudiences came back week after week, making “Maverick” the only film ever to take the top spot on Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends. For 75 straight days the film made at least $1 million a day, and now accounts for roughly 12% of the overall domestic box office so far this year, according to Comscore (SCOR). Simply put, “Maverick” refused to land.\n\n“It was an event-level motion picture made for theaters,” Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Boxoffice.com, told CNN Business. “It also brought back a significant portion of older audiences who held out during the early months of cinematic recovery in 2021 and early 2022.”\n\nEven Bakish was surprised by audiences’ reaction to the film, noting that Paramount “always knew it was a great movie” but it “probably underappreciated how great it was because no one could predict it would do this well.”\n\nBut there’s also a symbolic aspect to the film’s success. “Maverick” is an old-school box office hit made for the biggest screen possible that emerged just as the industry’s future was very much in doubt. “Maverick” showed that audiences still want to go to the movies.\n\n“The commercial reception of Tom Cruise’s legacy sequel was the summer movie miracle theaters needed,” Scott Mendelson, a box office reporter, wrote for Forbes.\n\nClimbing back up the mountain\n\n\"We really felt, and Tom certainly agreed with the fact that we had a great big screen movie,\" Bakish said. Kris Connor/SipaUSA/AP\n\n“Maverick” was also the type of success that Paramount — a company in transition — sorely needed.\n\nIn recent years, the studio behind some of cinema’s greatest films — think “The Godfather,” “Chinatown” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark” — found itself lagging behind competitors in box office market share.\n\nParamount recombined with CBS in 2019 after splitting off from the company in 2006 and rebranded itself as Paramount Global, revamping its top streaming service into Paramount+ during a rapid evolution of the entertainment industry.\n\nFor Bakish, Paramount’s current success comes from focusing on “multiplatform, global execution,” or as he himself puts it, “it’s about theatrical, it’s about television and it’s about streaming.” In other words, Paramount has more than just a streaming-centric view of the media business.\n\nThe strategy has been working. Paramount (PGRE) has had six No. 1 debuts so far this year — more than any other studio — with hit films across multiple genres, including romantic comedy (“The Lost City”), family (“Sonic the Hedgehog 2”) and horror (“Smile”).\n\nPutting films in theaters has not hindered Paramount’s streaming efforts, which include Paramount+ and Showtime and have nearly 67 million subscribers worldwide, the company said last week. While that’s lower than competitors like Netflix (NFLX) and Disney+, Paramount+ is the fastest-growing service in the US so far this year, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAnd those numbers will likely see a boost in the coming months with international expansion in the next year and “Maverick” finally hitting Paramount+ by the end of 2022.\n\n“This is an extraordinary collection of assets,” Bakish said of Paramount’s portfolio of brands. “And at the moment — and yes, I’m biased — we’re executing pretty well.”\n\nBut will that lead to another “Top Gun”?\n\n“You’ve got to have the stars align again. You’ve got to have a story that people love and you’ve got to put the team together,” Bakish said. “We’ll see.”", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/01/28/staunton-malls-crawl-back-dead/79460660/", "title": "Staunton Mall reinventing itself— again", "text": "Laura Peters\n\nlpeters@newsleader.com\n\nSTAUNTON - Malls used to be at the epicenter of all we loved and feared about American suburban culture.\n\nIt’s where teens would escape their parents for an afternoon (and how parents would escape their teens), where you’d window shop to your heart’s desires or where you’d get your first store credit card.\n\nFor several generations, malls have been part of the American coming of age story. They’ve been celebrated -- and demolished -- in seminal cinematic scenes of the 80s and 90s. But within the past few decades, malls have been on the decline. It’s something Staunton has seen in its very own backyard.\n\nThe Staunton Mall, located in Augusta County, was built in the late 1960s as an open air mall and later enclosed. By the 1990s, the mall had seen a facelift and brief revival, before everything started to dwindle into the sadness the mall has become.\n\nStill, with closed stores, empty spaces and a sparse parking lot, the Staunton Mall is trying to reinvent itself yet again for a new century, according to Megan Frook, the mall’s new marketing manager.\n\nFrook knows malls. She spent most of her teen years in the malls in Northern Virginia.\n\n“It was basically just the freedom to go to a place not monitored by your parents all the time,” she said. “But, be safe in a semi-controlled environment.”\n\nIt was a place to hang out, to shop, eat and gossip, Frook said.\n\n“We went there all the time,” she said. “That was what I did in my teenage years, sort of a coming of age thing.”\n\nFrook is part of a new management team, Asprey Real Estate Corporation, trying to breathe life into the nearly half-century old edifice. The mall was previously managed by the former owners Staunton Mall Realty LLC. Asprey took over management in August of 2015, and Frook got busy.\n\n“We’ve spent a lot of time figuring out what went on in the past,” Frook said.\n\nStaunton Mall Realty LLC sold the property to Staunton Mall LLC, a Delaware company, on Feb. 19, 2014 for $4.5 million.\n\nThe property is valued at $8.4 million. That includes the almost 35 acres the mall sits on, four buildings and other improvements, according to Augusta tax information. The land alone is valued at almost $2.8 million.\n\nFrook said the past six months has entailed a lot of cleanup — not just of the building, but of severed relationships.\n\n“There’s a certain amount of disappointment on the part of some mall tenants on how the mall was managed. Being upfront with them with our plans and knowing they are included and involved is important,” she said. “(Tenants) are cautiously optimistic,” noting that “we are still in the beginning of things.”\n\nThe rumor of the mall’s imminent demise has festered for so long, Frook said she’s been working hard to change that perception. And it’s not just about the mall but about being part of the larger community as well.\n\n“We’re interested in being a part of what’s going on in Augusta County and Staunton,” she said. “We’re open to suggestions, to get a feel for what people want.”\n\nGetting tenants in is also a huge component of a growing the mall and its image.\n\n“There’s been a lot of changeover,” Frook said. “We’re doing a lot behind the scenes. Being consistent and active and letting people know what’s going on … only time can prove that.”\n\nFrook said she’s received a lot of feedback from the public.\n\n“They all want to know what we want to do with it,” she said.\n\n“I think that shopping will never go out of style,” Frook added. “That’s never going to be something that people do without.”\n\nWith the rise of the web-based economy, the emphasis by small cities on boosting local shopping by reviving cozy downtown main streets, the image of malls as larger than life shopping destinations has lost some of its luster. Frook is intent on making the mall a viable place for gathering. In this new place the Staunton Mall is becoming, the stores have changed, often radically, and the idea of what a local mall is has shifted on its circa 1980s axis toward a very different looking horizon.\n\nDifferent tenants and improvements\n\nWith a diversified space, the Staunton Mall is able to offer something somewhat out of the norm. Many spaces are occupied by gyms or fitness-centered business. These new tenants generate synergy with other stores located at the mall including GNC, a nutrition and vitamin store, and Hibbetts Sports, which offers sporting goods.\n\n“Having a diversified space like that can make (the mall) more of a destination,” Frook said.\n\nMajor names from our collective mall memory are either long gone, leaving the mall scene or disappearing entirely, like Hallmark, Goody’s, Montgomery Ward or KB Toys.\n\n“Depending on the level of mall, there are different stores that survive and those that haven’t,” Frook said.\n\nWalk through the Staunton Mall today and you’ll find a diversification that speaks to something far different than a celebration of consumer culture. With a tae kwon do dojang, a gymnastics studio, a fitness center and a CrossFit box, the Staunton Mall has become a place for healthy lifestyle choices. Many of the fitness oriented tenants have moved to the mall for bigger spaces that cost less to rent.\n\nIn the midst of this new mall culture, management aims to revive a few of the traditional elements, perhaps most notably the theater space. Regal Cinemas left in 2010 and the then-management at the mall took over the theater. The six screens have remained empty relatively since then. The big thing standing in the way to get a theater back at the mall is digitizing it, which means more money.\n\nSome improvements have been made to the mall, Frook said, including getting the parking lot lighting functioning and patching the roof. Not all the infrastructure work is done, but it’s something the mall is working at in an incremental way, she said.\n\nRepaving the mall’s parking lot is on the list of things to do, but in the meantime, filling potholes and smoothing out areas are ongoing and in the works. Snow and winter weather will push back on these types of improvements.\n\nThe Dead Mall trend\n\nStanding in direct contrast to plans to revive the Staunton Mall are a veritable zombie army of dead, dying, and (some might even say) undead malls, laying waste to vast acreage across the country.\n\nDeadMalls.com documents the decline of some of those malls.\n\nIt’s been almost a decade since the website has featured Staunton’s very own. At the time they did, the mall was still somewhat full and not as desolate is it appears now.\n\nSo, is it dead or not dead? Is it dying or reviving? Exactly which mall movie are we stuck in here? What’s the test to know what we’re dealing with?\n\nA mall is considered dead when occupancy falls below 30 percent and consumer traffic has dropped significantly, according to Jack Thomas of DeadMalls.com.\n\n“I always compare the dead mall phenomenon to Darwinism. The strong malls will adapt, the weak ones will die off — and some should,” Thomas said. “Back in the 80s and 90s, malls were built like wildfire. A town that should have only had one or two had eight. We’ve been seeing for a long time now, first here in the Northeast, now to other parts of the country, a culmination of that line of thinking. With the way things are in the economy, we may see this for years to come.”\n\nA mall is considered struggling when overall occupancy is less that 75 percent but more than 30 percent, or at least two anchor spaces are empty, he said.\n\nThe Staunton Mall is seeing between 65 and 70 percent right now, according to Frook. The mall has one vacant anchor store and have about 40 leased tenants with a number of available storefronts.\n\nIt boils down to two reasons a mall would die off, according to Thomas — competition and mismanagement. The Staunton Mall has seen its days of being tossed around to different management teams and name changes, and overall change in the area cannot be overlooked.\n\n“Demographics also come into play, if there is a shift in clientele, gang activity or store theft. Occasionally, it’s a mix of all three,” Thomas said. “If a newer and bigger mall opens nearby and draws people in with greater offerings, a smaller older mall will fall behind.”\n\nNewer stores did start to pop up nearby in the form of strip malls. Waynesboro opened Waynesboro Town Center in the late 1990s and now has stores like Target, Books a Million, Kohl’s and Bed Bath and Beyond.\n\n“If management doesn’t step in to try and lure new tenants or pick up the image of the mall then it is not going to keep or bring business back,” Thomas said. “This is a double edged sword a lot of the time, because the owners need their money too, so rent gets jacked up to cover the cost of the operation.”\n\n“An anchor store, for example, generally is charged less rent because they are considered a destination tenant,” Thomas added. “When those stores leave, the smaller stores have to pick up the pace. National chains may not want to do this however, and in some cases their respective leases require the presence of said anchor for them to stay, so they throw in the towel too. Local mom and pop tenants or temporary tenants then leave because they cannot afford to sustain their business while remaining in the mall. It’s a domino effect.”\n\nInternational Council of Shopping Centers CEO Tom McGee said those malls that have survived are getting stronger and mall occupancy is above 94 percent, which is a high that hasn’t been seen since 1987.\n\n“Malls and shopping centers are also integral to not just the companies that own them – but to the communities they serve,” he said. “They are a significant job creator, driver of gross domestic product and critical revenue source for the communities they serve through the generation of sales taxes ($140.5 billion annually) and the payment of property taxes ($23.9 billion annually).”\n\n“Right now only 7 percent of total retail sales occur online – the rest are in physical stores,” he added. “So if a property is struggling it’s not because of e-commerce, but likely because of economic and demographic issues.”\n\nVictor Gruen designed the first modern day mall with the idea to bring the community together in the 1950s. Gruen wanted malls to be a place to gather for those who have moved out into the suburbs, a “third place” in suburban geographies where home and work were located in distant places bridged only by driving.\n\nGruen would lure people into the malls with extravagant window displays and large open spaces with fountains, large stairways and greenery. It was inviting.\n\n“Essentially they were to be indoor cities, with parks, plant life, petting zoos, community events, etcetera,” Thomas said. “Eventually the consumerism won out. In time, we may see another shift in a new direction. Basically, whatever keeps people in the door is the way these malls survive.”\n\nShifting mall plans\n\nThat’s where re-imagining malls comes in.\n\nOne thing that the Staunton Mall has going for it currently is the wide variety of what is offered there. With gyms, food options and even a model train museum, Frook said the diversity of both store offerings and things to do is only going to expand.\n\nAnd in its efforts to reimagine the mall and its place in today’s culture, the Staunton Mall is not alone against a world of zombies. Other projects are ongoing. One mall outside of Richmond was purchased by the county’s economic development authority to be revived.\n\nTalks of redeveloping Cloverleaf Mall in Chesterfield County started to bubble in the early 2000s.\n\n“The mall had gone into severe decline and it became clear that the property would not be redeveloped without county participation,” said Garrett Hart, director of Chesterfield economic development.\n\nThe county was able to finance the new urban revitalization effort through the economic development authority to the sum of $16 million for the site purchase and infrastructure improvements, Hart said. The County is repaid the $16 million purchase from the sales of the land to the developer and the infrastructure improvements are paid for by the tax increment financing, or TIF tax proceeds.\n\n“Phases one retail is complete and the phase two residential will start leasing in the spring, phase three retail will begin by October of this year and phase four office could have its first building and tenant by the end of this year,” Hart said. “The project has been a great success and has acted as the anchor for private sector reinvestment in the entire area.”\n\nThe site includes a grocery store, restaurants, nail and hair salons and hundreds of upscale, neo-urban-style apartments, according to Hart.\n\n“(There’s been) quite a bit of revival and we are really just getting started,” Hart said. “The mall was assessed at around $16 million when the EDA purchased it. There is now well over $130 million in value on the same site now. The malls across the street and just to the west of the project are both being redone and have attracted quite a few new businesses and retailers.”\n\nSimilar efforts can be seen in Staunton, like with the city’s endeavor Staunton Crossing. The process of obtaining the 300-acre Staunton Crossing property started in 2006. The property used to be the site of Western State Hospital and has about 26 buildings in varying conditions. Staunton paid $15 million for the property through city-issued bonds in a land-swap deal with the state.\n\nStaunton’s Economic Development Authority, which owns the land, has been investing in upgrades to it to make it into a mixed-use development with residential, industry and more.\n\nConstruction has started on the entrance of the development, where new lights and roads underway.\n\nNow a hotel has decided to call Staunton Crossing its home. Back in October, the city council voted to sell 19 acres of publicly held land located along U.S. 250 to Staunton Crossing Partners, LLC — a local developer who hopes for a five-year build-out that includes businesses like a Marriott-affiliated hotel.\n\nAs for the county stepping in to aid the Staunton Mall, Economic Development Director Amanda Glover said the county supports the mall, but it’s privately owned and the county doesn’t see stepping in anytime soon.\n\n“The Staunton Mall is privately owned and Augusta County would work collaboratively with a private entity on any type of development,” Glover said. “It is important for citizens to be able to shop locally and to have access to a variety of goods and services. Augusta County is always interested in working with the development community and private businesses to enhance local shopping opportunities.”\n\nFollow Laura Peters @peterslaura and @peterpants.

Nearly 5,000 people onboard Princess ships in the past decade have suffered from bouts of vomiting, diarrhea – or both – in numbers widespread enough that government health officials issued alerts on 26 outbreaks.\n\nThe next-closest cruise line, Celebrity, reported one-third fewer breakouts during the same years.\n\nYet Princess, with 18 ships in the world's largest cruise company, Carnival Corp., consistently earned high marks on U.S. inspections that were supposed to protect 30 million people taking cruise vacations each year.\n\nA USA TODAY investigation found the high-profile scoring of inspections administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention masks how frequently ships are cited for health and sanitation violations.\n\nThe score most commonly awarded? A perfect 100.\n\nYet outbreaks kept occurring, even on ships with flawless inspections. USA TODAY found no instance in which a ship had failed its last inspection before a breakout of a stomach-related illness, the only type of outbreak routinely published by the CDC.\n\nPrincess ships consistently earned high ratings, including some of the best scores in the industry on disease reporting standards.\n\nIn 2017, inspectors noted multiple problems with medical records on the Coral Princess. A food service worker fell sick on the job and supposedly went into isolation, but his timecard indicated he was still working. In a separate violation, there was no documentation that the cabin mates of several sick crew members were interviewed to assess and contain the risk of possible spread.\n\nThe ship still earned a perfect inspection score. Then, on a voyage starting 10 days later, it reported a norovirus outbreak.\n\nHelp USA TODAY report on the new coronavirus outbreak. If you have a story, please email coronavirus@usatoday.com. We are investigating the federal response, where the system is failing and the challenges to medical workers and patients. We won't publish your name unless you agree.\n\nDr. Chris Taylor, a former cruise ship physician, researched five years of CDC inspections and found the scores had no value in informing the public about the risk of illness spreading on a ship.\n\n“The proof of whether a ship has a high sanitary standard is the outcome,” Taylor said. “It is all about whether you have outbreaks.”\n\nCruise ship health safety failures came into glaring focus in recent weeks. The industry’s slow response to initial warnings facilitated the early global spread of the COVID-19 virus. Only after two high-profile outbreaks, and after major U.S. sporting tournaments and other events were canceled, did the industry at large decide to abandon ship for a month.\n\nREAD: CDC says because of coronavirus everyone should avoid cruise ships\n\nMany of the health factors that fuel gastrointestinal illness outbreaks also are suspected of contributing to spread of the coronavirus, from unwashed hands to failing to separate the sick from the healthy.\n\nDuring the second outbreak, people onboard the Grand Princess kept mingling even after public health authorities and ship leaders knew that passengers on the voyage immediately before had contracted the coronavirus, with some still on the ship who could have been exposed.\n\nAfter being informed of the concern by loudspeaker announcement, passengers were still permitted to don formal attire for an evening meal featuring lobster tail. By morning, a letter had been pushed under their cabin doors explaining that only a few people needed to stay in their rooms, an initial isolation later expanded to all passengers.\n\n“Zero steps were taken,” said Debi Chalik, an attorney whose parents, Ronald and Eva Weissberger of Florida, are now suing the cruise line for putting them at risk of infection.\n\nPrincess declined to answer detailed questions under deadline “due to the large volume of media inquiries we’ve received.”\n\nThe cruise line referred USA TODAY to a video posted last week when Princess Cruises announced a 60-day hiatus for its fleet. In it, President Jan Swartz noted the company’s global clientele of passengers and crew and its commitment to reporting every medical case onboard.\n\n“We’ve been asked, and we’ve asked ourselves, why COVID-19 seems to be impacting Princess so heavily,” she said. “We don’t really know.”\n\nSpeaking in the White House Rose Garden the next day, President Donald Trump praised his administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak on the Grand Princess. Vice President Mike Pence also pledged to work with the industry so when the pandemic passes, “cruise lines are safer than ever before.”\n\nContagious disease long a concern on cruise ships\n\nIn the past decade, outbreaks of stomach-related illnesses on cruise ships have sickened about 18,000 people, USA TODAY found.\n\nIn that time, more than 415 million passengers sailed on cruise ships, plus hundreds of thousands of crew, the Cruise Lines International Association said. It added that far more people get sick from norovirus each year on land.\n\nStill, contagious disease has long been a concern on cruise ships that thrust thousands of people into close quarters for days or weeks at a time. The new coronavirus has raised similar questions in other crowded living environments, such as nursing homes, where early examples show the infection can rage rapidly, with deadly consequences.\n\nThe current system of cruise safety inspections is aimed at preventing stomach bugs rather than an influenza-like illness like the new coronavirus, which is suspected of spreading widely by air. But many of the preventive measures are the same, such as scrupulous hand cleaning and tracing the contacts of anyone sickened.\n\nNo agency regulates medical practices on cruise ships. Instead, the CDC sends inspectors twice a year to conduct sanitation inspections on ships sailing internationally with visits to U.S. ports. The comprehensive reviews can last eight to 10 hours.\n\nDeficiencies cited based on those visits can attest to the broader health and safety culture on the ship, said Ross Klein, an academic in Newfoundland who tracks cruise ship outbreaks and has spent two decades researching and studying the industry.\n\n“If their attentiveness is lower with known viruses, what can we expect about the viruses that are not known?” he said.\n\nUSA TODAY reviewed about 4,100 inspections conducted across the cruise industry through the so-called Vessel Sanitation Program since 2010, looking at both the scores behind the ship’s overall passing score and details of cited deficiencies.\n\nAlmost every ship inspected – 92% of them – has been flagged for problems with medical records maintained onboard, a standard intended to help control the spread of disease and track outbreaks when they do occur.\n\nSailing into a coronavirus outbreak\n\nOn a crisp Friday last month in San Francisco, Greg and Cathy Rafanelli of Seattle boarded the Grand Princess for their 21st Princess line cruise. They were handed a questionnaire to report any recent travel abroad to countries of concern or symptoms of the new coronavirus.\n\n“We said, ‘no, no, no, no, no,’” Greg Rafanelli said, “and happily sailed away.”\n\nJudy and Garth LaPar of Florida got the same form before the ship departed on Feb. 21. Later, they wondered why no one from the ship had interviewed them in person or checked their temperature, a more rigorous approach to coronavirus screening.\n\nThree weeks before, another of the company’s ships, the Diamond Princess, had been the site of an early coronavirus outbreak that ultimately would infect about 700 passengers and crew.\n\nInvestigators now believe that outbreak started with a passenger and spread to the crew – who continued to work unless they had symptoms – especially food service workers working closely together and living in cabins on the same deck, the CDC said in a report released this week.\n\nThe Grand Princess was similarly vulnerable as it sailed away for 13 days, making four stops on islands in Hawaii. The Rafanellis recalled rough seas as the ship turned toward Ensenada, Mexico, with less experienced cruisers vomiting in public and crew scurrying to clean up.\n\nBy then, U.S. health authorities were aware of a problem not yet announced to passengers: Authorities in California were tracking several coronavirus cases involving passengers on the previous Grand Princess voyage – with exposure to some still onboard. They reported an elderly man’s death on Wednesday.\n\nThe captain shared the news over the loudspeaker that afternoon and canceled a reception that night for VIP cruisers. A planned music and dance show was instead piped into the rooms, where the Rafanellis watched it.\n\nThe formal dress dinner still carried on that night, though, featuring a “surf and turf” menu. The crew now wore gloves and served the food rather than allowing passengers to help themselves from the buffet.\n\nRafanelli, 73, recognized the protocol from a previous cruise with a norovirus outbreak. That night, he was not allowed to touch common utensils. “The gloved wait staff had to put on your salt and pepper,” he said.\n\nIn a ship cafe after dinner, Michelle Saunders, 23, sipped hot cocoa with her grandmother. She had been impressed throughout the cruise by how attentively the crew were wiping down handrails and elevator buttons.\n\nStill, she wondered whether crowds should be mingling. “The thought crossed my mind,” she said.\n\nA letter delivered overnight to passengers' rooms offered details. Princess Cruises’ chief medical officer, Grant Tarling, explained that the CDC was investigating a “small cluster” of coronavirus cases connected to the previous voyage. Out of an abundance of caution, he wrote, the CDC was requiring passengers who had sailed on both trips to stay in their rooms until medically cleared.\n\nAll were advised to practice proper hand washing and sneeze etiquette.\n\nIt was not until later Thursday that passengers received instructions to isolate themselves in their rooms. Before retreating, Cathy Rafanelli, 67, darted back to the buffet line, which was still open despite the new guidance, to stock up on cookies and fruit.\n\nGloved and masked crew deposited meals at cabin doors for the next week as authorities scrambled to arrange for the disembarkment and quarantine of the ship’s passengers. Clean linens arrived in bags. Rafanelli and her husband left their cabin only once for an organized deck walk, with protective masks provided.\n\nThey were pleased with the measures taken to protect their health, even after the captain informed passengers over the speaker system that coronavirus tests given to 45 of the 3,533 people onboard turned up 21 cases – two in passengers and 19 among the crew.\n\nBut in an interior cabin with no windows, the LaPars worried about air circulating between rooms and how sanitary it was to sleep on the same sheets night after night. On their lone trip out for fresh air, they saw passengers violating the recommendation to stay 6 feet apart.\n\n“For six to seven days, our room wasn’t clean,” said Judy LaPar, 73.\n\nPerfect inspections downplay problems\n\nThe Grand Princess had never failed a CDC inspection. Nor had any Princess ship on its last inspection before an outbreak.\n\nYet in 2012 alone, five outbreaks occurred on three Princess Cruises ships with recent flawless 100-point inspections: the Emerald Princess, the Crown Princess and the Ruby Princess.\n\nThe CDC’s outbreak reports offer limited insight beyond the numbers and pathogens involved.\n\nAn attorney in Australia has been collecting detailed accounts from passengers on the Sun Princess, which in 2017 experienced norovirus outbreaks on back-to-back cruises, one to Papua New Guinea, the other to New Zealand. Concerns include contamination in the buffet areas, public restrooms, swimming pools and casinos.\n\nOne passenger smelled vomit in a cabin upon arrival for the second trip, raising questions about how well cabins were sanitized, according to Vicky Antzoulatos, who is investigating for a potential lawsuit over the outbreaks that sickened 230 passengers in all.\n\n“They basically didn’t take adequate steps,” she said.\n\nIndustry experts say cruise lines take their inspection scores very seriously. The CDC posts the ratings online, and findings of unsanitary conditions can be public relations nightmares.\n\nSome caution, however, that the vessels prepare for the unannounced exams. They can anticipate at times when a ship visit is likely in the rotation from the timing of passenger disembarkation or boarding, for example, or if there is just one U.S. docking in an itinerary.\n\nThey add that cruise lines have little control over passengers who board knowing that they are sick.\n\n“Once someone made their final payment, if they can go from toilet to toilet, they are going to go on their cruise ship,” said Andrew Coggins Jr., a professor in the business school at Pace University in New York who specializes in the cruise industry.\n\n'Nothing happened' until sickness broke out\n\nFor weeks, the cruise industry gradually stepped up protocols around the new coronavirus threat, gradually restricting passengers who had traveled to certain international countries from boarding.\n\nAs of March 9, when the Grand Princess was finally able to dock in Oakland, California, cruise ships had begun rolling out temperature screenings before boarding.\n\nAs U.S. health officials started cautioning against cruise travel, the industry proposed requiring a doctor’s note for anyone over 70 and at higher risk of coronavirus complication. Finally, late last week, the major cruise lines all canceled voyages from U.S. ports for a month.\n\nNew Orleans attorney and maritime law expert Paul Sterbcow, who testified about cruise safety before Congress last fall, told USA TODAY the industry should have responded to the emerging public health threat far sooner.\n\n“Nothing happened until people started getting sick on their boats,” he said. “And then the reaction is, ‘We’ll just stay out here and let them get sick.’ ”\n\nExperts say any return to the high seas will require a complete review of infection control practices and should include not only stomach bugs but also respiratory illness like the new coronavirus.\n\n“What the cruise ship industry has to do is really critically assess their infection prevention and control,” said Connie Steed, a frequent cruiser and president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology.\n\nMeanwhile, knowledge – and questions – about the impact of the Princess line’s role in the pandemic’s early stages are still expanding: A Chicago teacher exposed on the earlier Grand Princess cruise tested positive, prompting one of the nation’s early school closures.\n\nREAD:Coronavirus closed this school.\n\nCrew with potential exposure on that voyage also ended up on three other ships – the Caribbean Princess, Royal Princess and the Regal Princess – sailing out of Los Angeles and Port Everglades in Florida.\n\nThe CDC then asserted its rarely used authority to issue “no sail” orders until that crew tested negative. But soon after, three workers at a company that greets cruise passengers at Port Everglades tested positive.\n\nThe South Florida region is now the leading hot spot for infection in the state.\n\nLetitia Stein is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team, focusing primarily on health and medicine.

Henry's now amassed a waiting list of more than 300,000 people seeking readings, according to the series.\n\n\"Life After Death\" highlights what seems like an impressive ability, but could it be the result of skillful editing or thorough research of his subjects? Ahead of my reading, I'm assured that he has not been given my name in advance.\n\nI ask my mom and cousin to sit in on the chat so they can verify any of Henry's statements that I can't. I also secretly hope that my cousin will hear from his dad, who died of a heart attack more than eight years ago.\n\nHow low can 'AGT: Extreme' go? Fire limbo performer sizzles, critic Simon Cowell feels the burn\n\nEerily accurate: Circumstances of my cousin's death\n\nSure, there are things you can Google about me or find on Ancestry.com. So when Henry sees a red rose during our reading relating to my mother's side, I'm impressed – my middle name is Rose, after my maternal grandmother – but I'm also skeptical since my full name is in my Instagram and Twitter handles.\n\nBut Henry also knows of my diabetic aunt who lost a toe, which he says creates a sensation in his feet. \"I feel almost like my circulation doesn't go to my toes or something, and I usually attribute that to diabetes. But it's bad, somebody literally lost blood flow through the extremities.\"\n\nHe also brings up a recent educational decision for my oldest niece, who will be starting a new school in the fall, which he says is just my deceased family members' way of proving they're around. \"This was just talked about,\" Henry says (and he's right). \"It's just validation that they're here.\"\n\nHe pulls two family members' names out of the air. He says my mom is \"is going to have a sense of responsibility, wanting to make sure everything goes smoothly for somebody else.\" (My dad has multiple sclerosis, and my mom is his caregiver.)\n\nHenry knows more about my family than I do. \"If anybody in the family has gotten genetic testing, that's a good thing,\" he says. Unbeknownst to me, my mom has, after a relative died of cancer.\n\nHenry makes several statements that are true. About 30 minutes into our reading, he asks if there's anything specific I'm curious about. I think of two people I hope Henry can connect to: my cousin's dad, and another cousin who drowned in 2006. I've seen the peace Henry's readings can bring survivors on TV, and I desperately want that kind of healing for my family. I mention \"two sudden passings\" to Henry, but that's all I give him.\n\nHenry says my cousin's dad is concerned about how his death affected his children and emphasizes \"father-son relationships, and not wanting to leave a mess emotionally.\" This tracks, as my cousin is male (but an only child).\n\nHenry also notes \"a change of plans\" when it comes to how my cousin's dad \"would have been memorialized or remembered ... There's something funny there with that of like, 'Oh, we thought we were gonna do that, then we put it off.' But it's like, 'No we gotta do it. We gotta do it.'\"\n\nMy cousin feels confident he knows what Henry is referring to: There's no headstone on his father's grave yet.\n\n\"I hope part of the healing today is relaying that message that he's all good, even if maybe we are still not resolving things,\" Henry says. \"Because it's important that that comes through for this son.\"\n\n'Walking Dead' walks on with 'Isle of the Dead' spinoff starring Maggie and Negan in Manhattan\n\nHenry also receives information about someone who died at what he calls a \"pivotal age.\" \"This would have been a situation where everyone was having a good time, and then very quickly things came to an abrupt halt,\" Henry says. \"The weird thing about his passing was that where it happened was very inaccessible.\"\n\nMy cousin drowned during an event dubbed River Raft Race when hordes of college students descend upon a river in central Texas. He was 21.\n\n\"I feel like part of our reading today really is meant to deliver messages to his (immediate) family,\" Henry says. \"There's just a feeling of needing it to be known that he's OK and that he needed to show up today.\"\n\nSunflowers with no roots\n\nHenry saw a significance of sunflowers that I couldn't make sense of. He also spoke about a trip – or a conversation about taking one – to my great-grandmother's birthplace, which I am not aware of. (She is from Monterrey.)\n\nRelating to my mom's side, Henry sees three sisters, but my grandmother is one of five girls.\n\nHenry also anticipates \"a pretty big career change over the course of the next year, even maybe in the next six months\" for my brother, which seems unlikely since he's very successful, focusing on real estate.\n\nSome of Henry's other statements seem true-ish, if you leave room for interpretation: An inscribed animal statue he mentions could refer to a box that features a boy hugging a dog. Henry sees two children for my cousin's dad and refers to an unfinished love story, which seems to fit. But statements of Henry's that have no truth to them seem far and few between.\n\nHenry admits he gets it wrong sometimes. But \"I don't think that invalidates when I get it right,\" he says. \"Even the best basketball players still miss their free throws sometimes, and we can still recognize that they have talent.\"\n\nWhy that 'Winning Time' pickup game with Magic Johnson, Norm Nixon had real 'fury and anger'\n\nFinal thoughts: For real or a fraud?\n\nAfter my reading, I'm convinced of Henry's ability.

Though it's a few inches wider than lesser Colorado variants, the ZR2 is some 5 to 10 inches narrower than the full-size off-roaders. It's a bit wider than the Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro, however.\n\nThe form has function. Developed at parent company General Motors' Arizona proving grounds, the ZR2's suspension employs softer tuning, taller coil springs in front and longer leaf springs in back.\n\nWith a 2-inch suspension lift, 3.5-inch wider track and clipped bumpers below the headlights, the ZR2 bares its tires — 31-inch Goodyear Wrangler DuraTrac off-roaders — when viewed from the front.\n\nGone is the lower air dam that shaves ground clearance in other Colorado variants, even with the milder Z71 off-road package. An aluminum skid plate protects the ZR2's radiator and oil pan. Another shield protects the transfer case. Steel tubes guard the lower sides, while the rear bumpers ditch the regular Colorado's outboard steps.\n\nMore:Review: McLaren 720S is a jet fighter for the street\n\nMore:Review: Chevrolet Equinox sheds pounds and still charms\n\nMore:Review: Buick Regal GS gets a V-6 for more silky power\n\nYou can even relocate the full-size spare tire from underneath the truck to an optional bed-mounted carrier to improve departure angles. All told, it's an impressive visual display — the sort that looks like an aftermarket kit, or something in the vein of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' erstwhile Ram Runner conversion, more than a factory package.\n\nThe big news is the sophisticated shock absorbers, which have three spool valves apiece to control compression and rebound for on- and off-road situations. It's the same technology that once did time in the track-focused Camaro Z/28, and it works well. There was impressive wheel travel off-road, with outstanding cabin isolation in everything from rock crawls to sand- and dirt-road runs.\n\nElectronic locking differentials on both axles help, too, forcing equal rotation for tractionless wheels — a key provision when one or more of them leaves the ground. You can even lock the rear axle in 2-wheel drive.\n\nGM pegs ground clearance in the ZR2 at 8.9 inches, up 0.5 to 0.8 inch versus other variants, including the Z71. A dual-range, locking transfer case includes a 4-wheel-drive Auto mode alongside the traditional rear-drive and 4-wheel-drive high and low speeds. You also get hill descent control and \"off-road mode.\" The latter calibrates various systems to allow more wheel slip, which suits many off-road situations.\n\nThe standard engine is a 3.6-liter gasoline V-6, with 308 horsepower. The ZR2 offers an optional 2.8-liter 4-cylinder diesel with 181 horsepower. Both engines are competent in the low-rpm, high-load situations typical of off-roading.\n\nTypical of diesels, the Colorado's 2.8-liter example packs all its heat at low rpm. Accelerator response is tepid, however, and the engine runs out of breath once you get past midrange rpm. General Motors pairs the diesel with a 6-speed automatic — a shame, as the 8-speed's extra ratios might have kept revs lower to linger in the engine's sweet spot more often.\n\nThe slow-ratio steering makes corners a deliberate, high-effort process, with immediate understeer if you try to take them fast. But body roll is unexpectedly limited; the ZR2 corners impressively flat.\n\nMaximum towing capacity for the ZR2 is 5,000 pounds, short of both the regular Colorado's 7,700-pound max and the Tacoma TRD Pro's 6,400 pounds with a trailer package. The ZR2's 1,100-pound payload is also short of other Colorados' 1,574-pound max, but it's in line with the TRD Pro.\n\nThe ZR2's interior has low-gloss finishes but plenty of hard, cheap plastics in areas such as the upper doors, where your arms and elbows land. The 8-inch dashboard touchscreen — an upgrade over lesser 7- or 4.2-inch units — includes Apple CarPlay and Android Auto; a backup camera is standard. Our test car's optional navigation system had swipe and pinch map functionality, though neither action seemed particularly fast.\n\nChevrolet touts segment-leading off-road technology in the ZR2, whose price starts north of $40,000. It slots above the less hardcore Z71 to cap off the Colorado lineup, which starts in the low $20,000s for a rear-drive 4-cylinder model.\n\nThe ZR2 is unquestionably an off-road beast. It ultimately edged out the Tacoma TRD Pro in our off-road comparison.\n\nWhat stands out\n\nSuspension: Outstanding for off-roading.\n\nEngines: A V-6 and V-8 that are low revving.\n\nInterior: Materials could be better.\n\n2017 Chevrolet Colorado ZR2\n\nWhat? An off-road version of the popular midsize pickup.\n\nWhen? On sale now.\n\nWhere? Made in Wentzville, Mo.\n\nWhat makes it go? Base engine is a 3.6-liter V-6 producing 308 horsepower.\n\nHow thirsty? 24 miles per gallon the highway, 17 mpg in the city and 19 mpg overall.\n\nHow big? 17.7 feet for the extended cab, long box.\n\nHow much? Starts at $41,155, including delivery fee.\n\nOverall? The ZR2 is better off-road than its chief competitor, Toyota’s Tacoma TRD Pro.

But, just because you don’t see those pesky mosquitos and bees flying around, that doesn’t mean all insects are completely inactive. In fact, many pests are underfoot seeking shelter from the cold, and your home may be the perfect spot.\n\nEric Bak of Quality Pest Services says pests seen during the winter months are known as occasional invaders and typically don’t cause much damage.\n\n“This time of year insects like boxelder bugs, ladybugs, brown stink bugs, cluster flies, earwigs, and leaf-footed bugs will look for a source of warmth,” he said. “They get into homes under siding and through cracks and crevices. They aren’t a big cause for concern, but can be a nuisance.”\n\nBak says these insects are phototropic and will move toward sunshine, so while they are mostly dormant in the winter, they will still come out on the warmer, sunny days.\n\n“You will typically find them around windows,” he said. “The easiest way to get rid of them is to suck them up with your vacuum cleaner.”\n\nMice are a year-round concern, but again, as cold weather sets in they are even more determined to get indoors. They usually nest in areas like attics and basements, and while some of the wintertime insects are harmless, mice can cause damage by chewing on drywall and wiring.\n\nBe on the lookout for droppings, holes under your sink or cupboards, and holes in your insulation. If you do notice any signs of mice, get it taken care of right away before it becomes a bigger problem.\n\nSo, what can you do to prevent these invaders? Unfortunately, if you haven’t done so already, Bak says it’s a little late to professionally treat your home, as spring and fall are the ideal times. However, don’t be discouraged if you missed that window; there are still important steps you can take to deter winter pests.\n\n“Thoroughly inspect your home, looking for any cracks and openings through which pests can enter,” said Bak. “Specifically check around air conditioning units or any water or gas lines that enter the home. Mice can get in through the smallest of holes, so seal those areas up well.”\n\nBak also suggests checking the weatherstripping on the bottom of the garage door. This area can become damaged over time, and is just another way pests can access your home. If you can see daylight when the door is closed, it’s time to replace the weatherstripping.\n\nHere are a few other tips to help keep pests out of your home this winter:\n\nStore firewood at least 20 feet from the home. Mice and ants can make their nests in wood piles and easily gain access to your home if the pile is nearby.\n\nRodents can hide in clutter, so keep storage areas well organized and store boxes off of the floor.\n\nEliminate all moisture sites, including leaking pipes and clogged drains. Extra attention should be paid to kitchens and bathrooms, as these areas are particularly vulnerable to cockroach infestations.\n\nInstall door sweeps and repair damaged screens in windows.\n\nScreen vents to chimneys. Keep attics, basements, and crawl spaces well ventilated and dry.\n\nIf you are concerned about an infestation of any kind, it’s best to have a professional take care of things before it becomes a major problem.

Now is when many pest species become most active in invading homes as they look for safe and warm environments.\n\nStink bugs, Asian lady beetles and boxelder bugs are three of the most common fall pests in Middle Tennessee. All are relatively new to the area, making it difficult for homeowners to correctly identify and eliminate them.\n\nStink bugs\n\nAh, the infamous stink bug. Known for their odor, these pests have small glands on their thorax that emit a foul smell when threatened or squished. Aside from their awful odor, they do not pose a threat to humans but can cause extensive damage to farm crops.\n\nAlso referred to as \"shield bugs,\" they feature a distinctive triangular-shaped plate on their backs. Typically brown or black in color, they can also appear to have metallic markings on or around their heads.\n\nStink bugs seek places to harbor for the winter, so a thorough crack and crevice treatment to your home is one of the most effective ways to combat them. Weatherstripping doors and windows can help too.\n\nAsian lady beetles\n\nAsian lady beetles, also called \"Halloween beetles,\" range in color from yellow to orange to black. Some may not have any black spots, while others may have many. The best way to know if you're dealing with Asian lady beetles versus ladybugs is to check for a distinctive \"w\" marking on the base of the bug's head.\n\nHear more Tennessee Voices: Get the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought provoking columns.\n\nAsian lady beetles invade homes in vast numbers in the fall. And beware: They are attracted to and feed on ripened fruit.\n\nThese beetles can be difficult to eradicate from your home because they hide in cracks and crevices and behind wall voids. The best way to reduce the number of these pests is with professional pest control services.\n\nBoxelder bugs\n\nMiddle Tennessee in the early fall is the perfect condition to find swarms of boxelder bugs on the sunny side of your home. They are black in color and have very distinctive red markings found along the edges of its wings.\n\nNamed after their main food source, the boxelder tree, these sap-sucking bugs will also happily feed on other seed-bearing trees and plants.\n\nBoxelder bug invasions can cause curtains, upholstered furniture and walls to be discolored by their feces as they travel over them.\n\nWhen these bugs are found on the home's exterior, a liquid residual application can be made to the cracks and crevices (hiding spots) of the home. If you see boxelder bugs inside your home, your best bet is to vacuum up the bugs and then call a pest control professional for preventative exterior treatment.\n\nKeep in mind many other species look to enter homes at the onset of cooler temperatures. It is best to call in professionals at the first signs of an infestation before it becomes a significant problem.\n\nErin Richardson is the owner and CEO of All-American Pest Control, a third-generation family business that has been serving Middle Tennessee since 1961, recently appearing in PCT Magazine's Top 100 List and the Inc. 5000 list.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2016/06/01/the-latest-serena-williams-wins-easily-to-reach-french-qf/85230196/", "title": "The Latest: Stosur has been Slam champ and an afterthought", "text": "AP\n\nPARIS (AP) — The Latest on the French Open (all times local):\n\n___\n\n9:35 p.m.\n\nSam Stosur knows what it's like to be a Grand Slam champion. She also knows what it's like to be an afterthought.\n\nEntering Wednesday, she was four years removed from her most recent quarterfinal appearance at any major tournament. With a 6-4, 7-6 (6) victory over Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria, the 21st-seeded Australian is back in the semifinals at the French Open.\n\n\"You can have a great year or two, and then you have a slump, and everyone writes you off,\" Stosur said. \"I think even people write off Roger (Federer) and Rafa (Nadal). If they will write them off, they will write off everyone else.\"\n\nStosur was the runner-up at Roland Garros in 2010. The next year, she won the U.S. Open, beating Serena Williams in the final. And in 2012, she got to the semifinals of the French Open and quarterfinals of the U.S. Open.\n\nAnd then she suddenly had trouble getting to the latter stages of tennis' most important tournaments.\n\nBut now, at 32, she is back in business.\n\n\"There has obviously been a few dips along the way there,\" Stosur said. \"It's important to, I guess, really believe in yourself and what you're doing and know, 'If I keep doing this, I can turn it around.'\"\n\nShe had her problems against the 102nd-ranked Pironkova. Stosur trailed 4-2, 0-40 in the first set, but erased those break points. And in the second-set tiebreaker, Stosur was down 5-1, then faced set points at 6-4 and 6-5 but pulled it out.\n\nNow comes a semifinal against No. 4 Garbine Muguruza, with a second major title ever closer.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Stosur said, \"four of us left out of 128 — 25 percent chance of winning at the moment.\"\n\n___\n\n9:25 p.m.\n\nHaving reached the French Open semifinals for the first time, No. 4-seeded Garbine Muguruza will be drawing on the experience of reaching the Wimbledon semis last year to soothe her nerves.\n\n\"There is always a little bit of stress,\" she said. \"I have already experienced that situation at Wimbledon, so you see things differently and you know what you have to do.\"\n\nAfter losing in the quarterfinals the past two years at Roland Garros, the 22-year-old Spaniard overcome that hurdle by beating American Shelby Rogers 7-5, 6-3.\n\nNow Muguruza is focusing on clearing her mind completely before facing No. 21-seeded Samantha Stosur — who will be playing in her fourth semifinal in Paris and reached the final in 2010.\n\n\"It's very difficult to maintain your peace of mind when you reach the semifinal of a Grand Slam,\" Muguruza said. \"You have to do away with the secondary thoughts.\"\n\nSpeaking to the media can prove a distraction for Muguruza, who prefers to stay out of the limelight.\n\n\"I try to isolate myself, because you have to answer lots of questions during the interviews,\" she said. \"I want to remain in my bubble.\"\n\n___\n\n9 p.m.\n\nShelby Rogers did not feel overwhelmed in her first Grand Slam quarterfinal.\n\nThe 23-year-old American lost in straight sets, yes, but the moment did not seem like too much to take.\n\n\"It's the biggest match of my life, and it's hard not to think about that,\" said Rogers, who is from South Carolina. \"But I thought I handled it pretty well. You know, I wasn't too nervous, so I did a good job in the beginning, kind of just breathing and controlling myself.\"\n\nAnd then she added: \"Hopefully many more to come.\"\n\nRogers, who is ranked 108th, beat three seeded opponents on her way to facing No. 4 Garbine Muguruza for a spot in the semifinals. And Rogers started well Wednesday, breaking in the opening game en route to a 5-3 lead.\n\nBut that's when Muguruza, the 2015 Wimbledon runner-up, took over, reeling off seven consecutive games on the way to a 7-5, 6-3 victory.\n\n\"She definitely knew what she wanted to do with the big points,\" Rogers said. \"I think that was the biggest thing.\"\n\nNow the tour moves to grass, with Wimbledon starting June 27, and Rogers is looking forward to that.\n\nShe said she'll stay in Europe, rather than heading home to the U.S.\n\nThat doesn't mean she won't take a bit of a break, though.\n\n\"Definitely a few days off, I think, is in order,\" Rogers said. \"It's been a lot on my body these last couple of weeks. And mind. But it's been a lot of fun.\"\n\n___\n\n8 p.m.\n\nNo. 21-seeded Samantha Stosur has reached the French Open semifinals for the fourth time after beating Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria 6-4, 7-6 (6).\n\nStosur has won all four of her quarterfinals at Roland Garros, and the 32-year-old Australian remains on track to reach her second final. She lost the 2010 final to Francesca Schiavone.\n\nShe next faces No. 4-seeded Garbine Muguruza of Spain.\n\nStosur was in trouble in the first set, trailing 4-2 and facing triple break point. But she held and then broke back for 4-4.\n\nPironkova, a 2010 Wimbledon semifinalist whose left thigh was heavily wrapped, led 5-1 in the second-set tiebreaker and then had two set points — but Stosur fought back and sealed victory on her first match point.\n\n___\n\n7:05 p.m.\n\nNo. 4-seeded Garbine Muguruza of Spain has reached the French Open semifinals for the first time after beating American Shelby Rogers 7-5, 6-3.\n\nAfter losing in the quarterfinals the past two seasons, Muguruza's joy was evident as she threw her racket up into the air after clinching victory with a forehand winner on her first match point.\n\nShe next plays either No. 21-seeded Samantha Stosur of Australia, a 2010 finalist, or unseeded Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria.\n\nRogers was playing in her first Grand Slam quarterfinal, while Muguruza is through to the semis of a major for the second time. She reached last year's Wimbledon final.\n\n___\n\n6:10 p.m.\n\nBecause of the all the rain delays, organizers have a heavy schedule to cram everything in before the weekend's finals.\n\nThat means players in action every day, rather than getting a day off between matches.\n\n\"It's something you just get used to. It's totally fine,\" top-ranked Serena Williams said. \"In Miami and Indian Wells you just play every day.\"\n\nShe got through to the quarterfinals on Wednesday but her older sister Venus Williams went out in the fourth round.\n\nStill, even at nearly 36 years old, Venus would not mind playing every day.\n\n\"Oh, back to back is fine,\" she said. \"But two matches in one day, especially if the rest of the draw isn't doing it, I don't think that's a good idea.\"\n\nTomas Berdych, who next plays top-ranked Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals, spoke with an air of resignation.\n\n\"There is nothing else that you can do,\" he said. \"We have to take it as it is.\"\n\n___\n\n5:55 p.m.\n\nFrench Open organizers are defending their decision to pull Novak Djokovic and Roberto Bautista Agut off court because of rain after 2 hours, 1 minute of play on Tuesday, saying the timing wasn't because they didn't want to refund tickets.\n\nOn courts that see less than two hours of play, ticket holders can apply for refunds — either in full when there is less than one hour of play or half for between 60 minutes and 1:59.\n\nIn a statement , tournament director Guy Forget noted that \"not refunding spectators with tickets to the Philippe Chatrier Court has caused frustration and anger.\"\n\nHe said tournament referee Stefan Fransson decides when to suspend or resume matches and \"respect for the game always takes precedence.\"\n\nForget added that the French Open's insurer, not the tournament itself, would have had to foot the bill for refunds if they had been paid to Chatrier ticket holders.\n\n\"We acted with the best of intentions,\" Forget said.\n\nHolders of tickets on other courts that saw less than two hours of play can apply for half of it back.\n\nDjokovic won in four sets when the fourth-round match resumed Wednesday.\n\n___\n\n5:45 p.m.\n\nAndy Murray overcame his own frustration as much as his French opponent and a partisan crowd Wednesday, beating No. 9 Richard Gasquet 5-7, 7-6 (3), 6-0, 6-2 to reach his fourth semifinal at Roland Garros.\n\nOften pointing at his temple between points, Murray would mutter to himself or yell at members of his entourage over the nearly 3½-hour quarterfinal.\n\nHe alternated between brilliant and bad before finally seizing control by taking the last six points of the second-set tiebreaker, then grabbing 12 of the final 14 games.\n\nThe No. 2-seeded Murray ran his winning streak to 10 matches, all on clay, and now takes on defending champion Stan Wawrinka. Murray enters that match with an 0-3 record in French Open semifinals.\n\n___\n\n5:20 p.m.\n\nStan Wawrinka is the first player through to the French Open semifinals.\n\nThe defending men's champion beat Albert Ramos-Vinolas 6-2, 6-1, 7-6 (7) to become the only Swiss man other than Roger Federer to have reached the semifinals of the clay-court major tournament multiple times. Federer, absent this year with an aching back, has played in seven semifinals and five finals, winning the title once, in 2009.\n\nThe third-seeded Wawrinka was never really troubled by his left-handed opponent, who was playing his first fourth-round match at a Grand Slam.\n\nRamos-Vinolas had only four break points in the match on Court Suzanne Lenglen and won just one of them, in the third set.\n\nWawrinka improved his career record against Ramos-Vinolas to 7-0. He will play either Andy Murray or Richard Gasquet in the semifinals.\n\n___\n\n4:30 p.m.\n\nErnests Gulbis got some things off his chest after his fourth-round loss to David Goffin at the French Open.\n\nThe Latvian lost 4-6, 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 Wednesday in a match that was scheduled to start on Monday, when play was completely washed out.\n\nThen, on Tuesday, the players came on court in the rain and came off with Goffin leading 3-0 in the first set.\n\n\"I don't think the players should walk on court while it's raining,\" said Gulbis, a semifinalist in Paris in 2014. \"If it starts raining while we play, then we keep on playing until it's playable. But to walk on with rain, I don't think it's right.\n\n\"We had to play in Munich when it was snowing,\" Gulbis said. \"You know, we're not in a winter sport.\"\n\nAnother thing that annoyed Gulbis was Goffin's actions early in the match.\n\n\"It was strange from Goffin, when he wanted to stop after 2-0 (in the first set) before my serve,\" Gulbis said. \"I didn't think it was really, really correct. You know, he can stop before his serve.\"\n\n___\n\n4:10 p.m.\n\nTimea Bacsinszky's on-court ruthlessness at the French Open doesn't extend to ladybugs.\n\nThe eighth-seeded Swiss, who hasn't dropped a set in her march to the quarterfinals, has a soft-spot for the insects, regarding them as \"a lucky charm.\"\n\nShe posted a picture of one she spotted on a tennis ball during practice. She says she saved another from a probable squishing at Roland Garros, guiding it off court during one of her matches.\n\n\"Why should I step on it? I'm not saying we should be super careful about every insect and animal, but (you) just don't need to murder a poor insect because it's bothering you,\" she said after beating Venus Williams in fourth round. \"You can just push it a little bit. Like, 'Go on. Go away.' That was my feeling about this poor ladybug.\"\n\n___\n\n3:25 p.m.\n\nTomas Berdych set up a French Open quarterfinal match against Novak Djokovic by beating 2013 runner-up David Ferrer 6-3, 7-5, 6-3.\n\nAdvancing beyond the fourth round at Roland Garros for only the third time in 13 attempts, the seventh-seeded Czech player saved all nine break points he faced in the match that was postponed Monday because of rain and started Tuesday only to be interrupted by more rain in the first set.\n\nAlthough the match lasted 2 hours, 12 minutes, Berdych said they took \"almost three days to finish this.\"\n\nDavid Goffin is also through to the quarterfinals, completing another rain-interrupted fourth-round match. The 12th-seeded Belgian beat Ernests Gulbis 4-6, 6-2, 6-2, 6-3.\n\nIn his first quarterfinal at a Grand Slam, Goffin will play Dominic Thiem in a battle of upcoming younger players. Thiem is 22, Goffin 25.\n\n___\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nDominic Thiem reached his first Grand Slam quarterfinal on Wednesday, beating Marcel Granollers 6-2, 6-7 (2), 6-1, 6-4.\n\nThe 22-year-old Austrian's previous best at a major was making the fourth round at the U.S. Open in 2014.\n\nThe match started Tuesday but was interrupted by rain and resumed Wednesday on Court 2 at one-set each. Serving with three match points, the 13th-seeded Thiem won with an angled forehand drop shot from the back of the court that Granollers couldn't reach.\n\nGranollers benefited from a walkover into the fourth round when nine-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal withdrew with a left wrist injury.\n\n___\n\n2:25 p.m.\n\nShe has rubbed shoulders with Donald Trump, but Serena Williams seemingly won't be voting for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee — because she doesn't vote at all.\n\nAdroitly sidestepping a question about Trump at the French Open, where Williams is the defending champion, she says she is \"not involved at all\" in politics.\n\nWilliams, a Jehovah's witness, adds \"I don't vote. It goes back to my religion.\"\n\nShe says she has met Trump \"several times,\" because she lives in Palm Beach, Florida, and he has a 17-acre estate, the Mar-a-Lago Club, there.\n\nWilliams says \"everyone in Palm Beach kind of knows each other.\"\n\n___\n\n1:55 p.m.\n\nNovak Djokovic got just what he wanted as he pursues a first French Open title, wrapping up a rain-interrupted victory with a minimum of trouble to get to the quarterfinals.\n\nAiming to win a fourth consecutive major trophy and complete a career Grand Slam, the No. 1-seeded Djokovic needed only 71 minutes Wednesday to finish off a 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, 7-5 win against No. 14 Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain. The match was suspended because of rain on Tuesday, with Djokovic leading 4-1 in the third set.\n\nHe needed only seven minutes of action to claim that set when they resumed, taking the first two games played Wednesday.\n\nAfter completing the victory, Djokovic played to the crowd at Court Philippe Chatrier, first cajoling a ball boy to join him in bowing for the spectators, then donning a yellow rain hat handed to him by Fabrice Santoro, a former player who conducted the post-match interview.\n\nBecause rain created a compressed schedule, Djokovic will be on court for a third day in a row on Thursday.\n\n___\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nUnseeded Yulia Putintseva reached the quarterfinals at a major tournament for the first time, beating 12th-seeded Carla Suarez Navarro 7-5, 7-5 Wednesday at the French Open.\n\nNavarro won less than half of all points on her serve, made 21 unforced errors and was broken four times in losing the first set.\n\nServing for the match after breaking her Spanish opponent twice, the 60th-ranked Putintseva had three match points after an angled backhand volley at the net. She converted the first, when Navarro netted a backhand service return.\n\nPutintseva has yet to lose a set in her march to the quarterfinals, and lost only eight games in the previous rounds before her first-ever fourth-round match at a major.\n\nShe will play defending champion Serena Williams in the quarterfinals.\n\n___\n\n12:40 p.m.\n\nVenus Williams failed in her bid to reach the French Open quarterfinals for the first time in a decade, losing to eighth-seeded Timea Bacsinszky of Switzerland 6-2, 6-4 in the fourth round Wednesday.\n\nThe ninth-seeded Williams, a seven-time major champion, started well enough, taking a 2-0 lead, before dropping eight games in a row. She was the runner-up to her sister Serena at Roland Garros in 2002, but her most recent trip to the quarterfinals in Paris came in 2006.\n\nAgainst Bacsinszky, Williams managed to produce only six winners, while committing 24 unforced errors.\n\nThe match originally was supposed to be played Monday, but was postponed twice because of rain.\n\nBacksinszky, a semifinalist at the French Open last year, can make it back to that stage if she beats 58th-ranked Kiki Bertens next.\n\n___\n\n12:35 p.m.\n\nKiki Bertens of the Netherlands reached her first Grand Slam quarterfinal by beating 15th-seeded Madison Keys of the United States 7-6 (4), 6-3 at the French Open on Wednesday.\n\nThe 58th-ranked Bertens eliminated a seeded player for the third time in the tournament, after upsetting No. 3 Angelique Kerber, the Australian Open champion, in the first round and No. 29 Daria Kasatkina in the third round.\n\n___\n\n12:20 p.m.\n\nWasting no time at all after waiting two days to play, Serena Williams moved closer to her record-equaling 22nd Grand Slam title by easily reaching the French Open quarterfinals.\n\nThe top-seeded Williams dominated from start to finish during a 6-1, 6-1 victory over 18th-seeded Elina Svitolina of Ukraine in only 62 minutes Wednesday.\n\nThe match originally was scheduled for Monday, but showers forced cancellation of an entire day of play at Roland Garros for the first time in 16 years. Then, on Tuesday, more rain allowed for a total of only 2 hours of play around the grounds, and Williams' match was postponed again.\n\nFinally in action, in Wednesday's opening match at Court Philippe Chatrier, Williams looked very much like a 21-time Grand Slam champion facing a 21-year-old who has only reached one major quarterfinal, losing at that stage in Paris last year.\n\nWilliams, the defending French Open champion, is trying to match Steffi Graf's Open-era mark of 22 major titles.\n\n___\n\n11:05 a.m.\n\nAfter two days of almost incessant rain, the covers have come off the courts at the French Open and the skies, while still thick with clouds, have stopped dropping rain.\n\nSerena and Venus Williams play first on Court Philippe Chatrier and Court Suzanne Lenglen, respectively, in fourth-round matches carried over from Monday, when rain washed out the whole day of play for the first time in 16 years.\n\nDefending champion Serena plays No. 18 Elina Svitolina. Venus takes on No. 8 Timea Bacsinszky.\n\nBecause of scheduling problems, after rain continued for most of Tuesday, too, matches are also spread on other courts. Kiki Bertens vs. No. 15 Madison Keys is on Court 1; No. 12 Carla Suarez Navarro vs. Yulia Putintseva of Ukraine is on Court 2.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/19/barbie-tupac-scorpions-red-vines-news-around-states/39702985/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nCullman: An underwater forest with trees as tall as 60 feet has been hampering the search for the body of a woman who was thrown off a boat about two weeks ago. The Cullman Times reports many trees weren’t cut down as workers created Smith Lake near Birmingham more than 50 years ago. Phil Hutchens, a member of the Cullman County Sheriff’s Office dive team, says standing timber is now complicating the search for 26-year-old Kelsey Nicole Starling of Birmingham, who’s been missing since two boats collided on the night of July 4. Starling was thrown from one of them. One of the drivers is charged with boating under the influence. Teams haven’t been able to find any trace of Starling.\n\nAlaska\n\nIgiugig: This tiny Alaska Native village is adopting an emerging technology to transform the power of a local river into a renewable energy source. The village council in Igiugig is the first tribal entity in the nation licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to harness river water that’s not connected to a dam. An underwater generator will be installed in coming days in the Kvichak River, part of a salmon-rich system that also provides subsistence food for the community of 70. Officials with Portland, Maine-based Ocean Renewable Power Co. say a trial river run of the RivGen Power System gives them confidence the system will not harm adult fish. Igiugig Village Council President AlexAnna Salmon says the generator is expected to greatly reduce reliance on costly diesel fuel.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Barbie – the iconic Mattel doll, arguably one of the world’s original influencers – is Instagramming her way across Arizona this week. The @BarbieStyle account has partnered with Visit Arizona to showcase travel in the Grand Canyon State. Her post Wednesday shows her and a pal visiting Antelope Canyon, on the Navajo Reservation just east of Page. Before that, she posed at the internationally famous Horseshoe Bend, a dramatic curve in the Colorado River that can be seen from an overlook a few miles south of Page. Barbie’s first stop in the state was the Phoenix area, where she lounged by the pool at Mountain Shadows Resort in Paradise Valley. Skyler Scott, spokeswoman for Mountain Shadows, says the Barbie photo taken there was not Photoshopped. A crew came to the resort, and Scott says it was fun to watch the detail and planning that went into the post.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A nonprofit plans to develop an online database of opioid-related overdoses in the state. Arkansas Drug Director Kirk Lane said Wednesday that the Arkansas Foundation for Medical Care is spearheading the project. He noted the database will give policymakers accurate information they can use for grants and prevention efforts. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the Justice Department awarded the state a nearly $1 million grant to fund the project. It’s expected the public database will be ready for use within six months. Gina Redford, the foundation’s analytics manager, said the database will only include information on overdoses involving opioids, which include prescription painkillers such as oxycodone and fentanyl along with heroin. Data out Wednesday from the Centers for Disease Control shows Arkansas had at least 433 fatal drug overdoses in 2018.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOakland: An animal rescue group is asking for help caring for 89 baby snowy egrets and black-crowned night herons left homeless last week after a tree fell downtown. International Bird Rescue said Wednesday that it needs donations and volunteers to help feed and care for the baby birds rescued after an old ficus tree serving as a rookery split in half and partially fell last week, said JD Bergeron, the group’s executive director. The group is caring for 89 young birds and eggs rescued from the tree, including 50 snowy egrets and 22 black-crowned night herons. It also rescued 17 eggs that need intensive care and round-the-clock support. Another 20 birds died when the tree fell. The rescue group was already taking care of more than 200 Bay Area water birds at its busy hospital in the city of Fairfield, Bergeron said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Officials say greenhouse gas emissions in the state peaked in 2010 and have been in decline since. Colorado Air Pollution Control Division Director Gary Kaufman says the rate of decline has been small, but it’s expected to increase by 2030. The data is included in the Department of Public Health and Environment’s draft inventory of the state’s greenhouse gases. The report projects 125.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other gases will be emitted in the state in 2020. That’s down from nearly 127 million metric tons in 2015 and 133 million metric tons in 2010. A new state law aims to cut emissions to at least 90% of 2005 levels, or about 113 million metric tons, by 2050. Officials project the state will still be well above that goal in 2030.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Prisons officials say errors by nurses at the state women’s prison have caused five inmate methadone overdoses in recent months. The Department of Correction tells the Hartford Courant none of the overdoses at the York Correctional Institution in East Lyme was fatal. Two inmates had to be revived with an opioid overdose reversal drug. One York nurse was fired in connection with two of the errors, and three overdoses remain under investigation. Agency spokeswoman Karen Martucci says 300 inmates at York were on methadone treatment last year. She says while the percentage of dosing errors “is extremely low,” the department is reviewing the methadone distribution program and adding safeguards to prevent similar incidents. Prison workers union officials have warned of dangerous understaffing at state prisons.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Ladybug Music Festival, believed to be the country’s largest annual celebration of women in music, has kicked off, bringing with it a new local beer, along with almost 60 acts performing at 15 locations around town. The event Thursday and Friday includes a headlining set paying tribute to the “Ladybugs of Soul,” including Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, Whitney Houston and Chaka Khan. To celebration the occasion, Stitch House Brewery has released its first canned beer, made in collaboration with Milford’s Mispillion River Brewing. Ladybug Rose Lager is an easy-drinking raspberry- and rose hip-infused lager with a light 4% ABV. The cans, which boast Ladybug’s eye-popping colors of pink and yellow, are also sold by the case or in four-packs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Protesters angered by the federal detainment of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border blocked access to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement headquarters in the city this week and staged a sit-in. News outlets reports at least 10 sit-in demonstrators were arrested and charged with unlawful entry. Dozens marched from the National Mall to the agency’s site around lunchtime Tuesday, stopping federal workers from returning to their desks. The demonstration went on for hours as attendees sang and carried signs saying “Never again is now” and “Never again means close the concentration camps.” The protest was one in a string of similar demonstrations outside ICE facilities nationwide during which protesters called for the dissolution of ICE and an end to crowded detainment centers at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: Officials are hoping a continuous loop of children’s songs played throughout the night will keep homeless people from sleeping on the patio of a city-owned rental banquet facility. West Palm Beach parks and recreation director Leah Rockwell tells the Palm Beach Post they’re trying to discourage people from sleeping outside the glass-walled Waterfront Lake Pavilion, which she says rakes in some $240,000 annually from events. The loop of “Baby Shark” and “Raining Tacos” is a temporary fix to keep homeless people off the patio. Rockwell says the city wants to formalize hours for the facility, which should make trespassing laws easier to enforce. Illaya Champion tells the Post “it’s wrong” to chase people away with music. He says he’ll still sleep there, but “it’s on and on, the same songs.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Coastal Georgia’s largest county wants to help residents prepare for an emergency during hurricane season. The Chatham County Emergency Management Agency in Savannah plans to hold a free “Citizen Hurricane Academy” this weekend. The program includes presentations by meteorologists, local emergency planners and other experts on how evacuation decisions are made, how to prepare financially for a disaster and some basic first aid tips for use in emergencies. The Atlantic hurricane season began June 1 and runs until Dec. 1. Coastal Georgia evacuated for Hurricane Matthew in 2017 and Hurricane Irma in 2018. Both storms brought damaging wind and flooding to Georgia’s 100-mile coast. Hurricane Michael caused extensive damage farther inland last year.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: A developer has agreed to cancel a planned condominium project to preserve a surfing area. West Hawaii Today reports the landowner has agreed to work toward building a public space rather than the proposed five-story residence near the Banyans, a popular surfing spot on the north side of Holualoa Bay. Property owner Kilohana Makai LLC met in a second mediation session last week with people involved in a case challenging plans for the condominium. A spokesman says Kilohana Makai will work over the next year to 15 months to convert the 14,450-square-foot lot on the Big Island into a community space. Officials say Hawaii County could buy the property via a commission that maintains a list of properties considered “worthy of preservation.”\n\nIdaho\n\nPocatello: Beekeepers and maintenance workers have removed roughly 30,000 bees that built a massive hive inside an Idaho State University campus landmark. The Idaho State Journal reports the bees were safely transported from the stone-and-wood Swanson Arch to a hive box at a nearby farm last Friday. Beekeeper Sarah Hofeldt says the bees were surprisingly docile, and no one was stung during the extraction. Hofeldt was safely able to remove the queen bee from the hive by hand without the use of smoke. She says the smokers can calm the bees but also can make it more difficult to move the bees into a transport container, which can increase bee fatalities. ISU students traditionally walk through the arch upon entering and graduating from the university.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A woman who recently got a 1993 postcard in her mailbox has tracked down the man who sent it to his children more than two decades ago. Kim Draper’s story about the mysterious Hong Kong postcard was first published in The State Journal-Register in Springfield. Masrour Kizilbash sent the postcard to his family while working overseas in 1993. He told the newspaper that he was “fascinated with the area” and wanted to share his experiences. Kizilbash’s family was living in Springfield at the time. He always figured they had received the postcard. With the help of social media, Draper learned that a son now lives in suburban Chicago. A reunion with the postcard is planned. Officials say it likely got tied up in Hong Kong or might have been stuck in old equipment.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s attorney general has reversed himself and decided against appealing a federal judge’s decision to block a state law that would ban a second-trimester abortion procedure. A judge granted a preliminary injunction last month sought by doctors who perform dilation-and-evacuation abortions. Republican Attorney General Curtis Hill said after that ruling that he would try to have the injunction lifted, but he announced Wednesday that his office would concentrate on arguing that the law is constitutional. That decision means the law can’t be enforced while court proceedings continue. The law passed this spring by the Republican-dominated Legislature calls the abortion procedure “dismemberment abortion.”\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The director of the state’s social services agency was a huge fan of the late rapper Tupac Shakur, and he frequently let his subordinates know it. Emails obtained by the Associated Press show that Iowa Department of Human Services Director Jerry Foxhoven routinely sent messages to employees lauding Shakur’s music and lyrics even after at least one complained to lawmakers. Then last month, he sent another such email to all 4,300 agency employees. He was abruptly ousted from his job the next work day. Foxhoven, 66, told employees he had been a huge fan of the hip-hop artist for years. He hosted weekly “Tupac Fridays” to play his music in the office. He traded lyrics with employees and marked his own 65th birthday with Shakur-themed cookies, including ones decorated with the words “Thug life.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Authorities say a lab technician “fudged” the test results of sewage treatment plant wastewater that is dumped into the Arkansas River. The Wichita Eagle reports Director of Public Works Alan King said Tuesday that the city caught the error during a spot check and immediately reported it to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. The employee has since resigned. The problematic test results falsely reported how much organic and inorganic substance is floating in the water. It’s generally used as an indicator of sediment or silt in the water. King says Wichita’s permits shouldn’t be affected, and there was no danger to the public. Results from around the same time as the false one show that the city likely stayed within an acceptable range.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A new list of rankings from a high-profile polling organization is giving a big red thumbs-down to Gov. Matt Bevin. Kentucky’s chief executive is the least popular in the nation among voters in their own state, according to Morning Consult’s Q2 rankings, with a 56% disapproval rating vs. just 32% who approve. Bevin notably has ground to make up among voters in his own party, with an election looming in November. The governor faces a 40% disapproval rating among fellow Republicans in Kentucky, after a May primary election in which GOP challenger Robert Goforth, a state representative, scored 39% of the in-party vote to Bevin’s 52%. His net approval among Kentucky voters, according to the Morning Consult poll, sits at -24 overall, which breaks down to +11 among Republicans, -63 among Democrats and -26 among independents.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A favorite local confection is making a comeback seven years after a devastating fire. Louisiana’s economic development office announced Thursday that Hubig’s Pies will be produced again next year in suburban Jefferson Parish. Hubig’s made hand-sized turnovers with a glazed crust and fillings of chocolate, coconut or any of a variety of fruits. Wrapped in white paper labeled with a caricature of a chef known as Savory Simon, the pies were prominent for decades at retail checkout counters, including grocery and hardware stores. A 2012 fire gutted Hubig’s longtime bakery in New Orleans’ Marigny neighborhood. Production will resume in Jefferson Parish after a $1.37 million investment in a manufacturing facility. The state says Hubig’s will distribute pies from the Louisiana-Texas line to the Mobile, Alabama, area.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunkport: A curious visitor to a train museum that resembled a white throw pillow or perhaps a lost toupee turned out to be a rare albino porcupine. The young rodent turned up Tuesday at Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, perplexing the staff, who sought help identifying it via social media. The consensus was that it’s an albino porcupine. The Portland Press Herald reports the animal appeared to be a baby because its quills had not yet hardened. A spokeswoman for the museum said midday Wednesday that it hadn’t yet been seen again, but it was assumed to be lurking in the area. Porcupines are common in Maine, though albino ones certainly aren’t. About 1 in every 10,000 of the species is an albino porcupine.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: An audit says a possible infusion of $3.2 million in state funds and savings from a shortened season may not be enough to save the cash-strapped Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. The Baltimore Sun reports the SC&H Group audit released Tuesday says both methods would only temporarily help BSO unless additional revenue streams are established. It says it’s unclear if the orchestra will survive the year. The audit considered the possible state emergency funding, which Gov. Larry Hogan refused to partially release this year, citing concerns that the state could soon face a $961 million deficit. Hogan signaled in May that he might not release the first installment of the funds, leading the orchestra to abruptly cancel its summer series and lock out musicians amid ongoing contract negotiations.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nCape Cod: A citizens group is calling for eliminating federal protections for seals as officials seek ways to protect beachgoers from great white sharks. Peter Howell, a founder of the Seal Action Committee, says the Nantucket-based group wants Congress to amend the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act so that species can be removed from the law’s list of protected animals if their populations have sufficiently rebounded. “We’re not anti-seal. We’re not trying to eliminate them. We’re just trying to manage them in the interest of the larger ecosystem,” he said Wednesday as the group spoke before the Barnstable County Commissioners, which oversees Cape Cod’s regional government. The region’s seal population – estimated in the hundreds of thousands – has been blamed for drawing droves of great white sharks in recent years. Seals are the favored meal for the powerful predators.\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: Three historic Great Lakes lighthouses owned by the federal government are going on the auction block. They include Lake Huron’s Poe Reef Lighthouse, 6 miles east of Cheboygan, Michigan, which guides ships through a hazardous channel. The Ontonagon Breakwater Lighthouse is the westernmost lighthouse in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, perched at the entrance of the channel leading to the Ontonagon River from Lake Superior. The Superior Entry Lighthouse sits on a sandbar between Superior, Wisconsin, and Duluth, Minnesota. The U.S. General Services Administration is offering the lighthouses through an online auction. Their lighting mechanisms will continue aiding navigation and will remain the U.S. Coast Guard’s property. Proceeds from public lighthouse sales help pay to preserve and maintain those that remain active.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The developers of a proposed copper-nickel mine near the Boundary Waters plan to use a potentially safer dry method of storing mine waste instead of the kind of wet tailings pond more common in the industry. Twin Metals Minnesota said Thursday that its underground mine near Ely would use “dry stack” storage for waste rock, calling it the most environmentally friendly approach for the site. The method contrasts with the conventional tailings basin at the planned PolyMet mine, which will be contained by an earthen dam. While environmentalists pushed for dry stack storage at PolyMet, they’re criticizing Twin Metals because the waste would sit just a couple of miles upstream from the Boundary Waters. Twin Metals plans to release its formal mine plan in the coming months, triggering a lengthy environmental review.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi is asking 16 cities to eliminate local laws that penalize panhandling. The organization says in a news release that the request is part of a national effort that includes work by the National Law Center of Homelessness & Poverty. A federal appeals court in 2015 ruled that an ordinance in Springfield, Illinois, that penalized people for begging for money in public places is unconstitutional. ACLU of Mississippi says that since last year, four cities in the state have repealed panhandling ordinances – Ridgeland, Meridian, Starkville and Southaven. It’s asking other cities to do the same – Brandon, Clarksdale, Cleveland, Clinton, Corinth, Greenville, Greenwood, Grenada, Gulfport, Horn Lake, Jackson, Long Beach, Natchez, Olive Branch, Pascagoula and Vicksburg.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The U.S. Department of Agriculture now says less than 40% of the researchers whose jobs are being transferred from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City will make the move to the Midwest. The Kansas City Star reports U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced in June that the USDA would move more than 550 jobs to Kansas City. A USDA spokesperson told The Star on Tuesday that 145 workers will follow their jobs to Kansas City, while 250 will leave the agency. Members of the Kansas and Missouri congressional delegations and the states’ governors praised the USDA’s move, saying the research agencies are a good fit for their region. But critics argued that moving them will make it harder for federal policymakers to get objective research.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Wildlife officials say evidence of an invasive clam that can out-compete native species has been found for the first time in a state water body. Fish, Wildlife and Parks officials say Asian clam shells were recently found near the boat ramp at Lake Elmo State Park in Billings. The discovery was made by participants in a training session on the detection of aquatic invasive species. No live clams were found. The quarter-sized mollusks are smaller than native clams that live in Montana. In large enough numbers, officials say they can clog screens on irrigation pumps or other water intakes. Since being discovered in Washington state’s Columbia River in 1938, Asian clams have spread to almost every state.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Plant science students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln are still taught to phenotype by hand, wading into muddy fields to record the differences in physical characteristics between varying corn hybrids with a small set of tools and a pen and notebook. But technology is on track to render that human work obsolete. A team of UNL plant scientists and biological systems engineers have built an automated system capable of detecting an individual corn leaf and grasping it with robotic precision to screen its temperature, chlorophyll and water content in less than a minute, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. Building a robot to automate the processes took years, as the team had to build a system that could identify the leaf from a corn or soybean plant, then direct a robotic arm where to reach and how to grab it for a battery of measurements, says Abbas Atefi, a Ph.D. candidate in biological systems engineering.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Lake Tahoe is almost entirely full. For weeks, the roughly 1,644-foot-deep alpine lake – the second deepest in the U.S. – has been within an inch of its maximum allowed surface elevation of 6,229.1 feet above sea level. As of late last week, its surface elevation was 6,229.03 feet above sea level. For Chad Blanchard, the federal water master in Reno responsible for managing Tahoe’s waters, it’s the longest he’s ever seen the lake stay this high. “This is a rare year,” he says. “I’ve been doing this for 26 years, and we’ve had big (snow) years, but this one is unique as far as being up within an inch of being full, and it’s just hanging there ... it’s a product of still having so much snow up there.” Despite a good amount of snow still coating the peaks around Tahoe, Blanchard doesn’t expect the lake level to rise much more, with summertime surface evaporation starting to pick up.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMilan: The Nansen Ski Jump has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Built in 1938, the 65-meter ski jump was the largest in the U.S. at the time, and it retains most of its original design. Officials said Wednesday that it was placed on the register because of its architecture and its place in U.S. sports history. Over the decades, Nansen was site of National Ski Jumping Championships, Olympic Ski Jumping qualifying events and U.S. Nordic combined championships. The ski jump was part of a planned bid by New Hampshire to host the 1944 Winter Olympics with cross-country skiing in Berlin, alpine events at Cannon, figure skating in Conway and bobsledding on Mount Madison. The games were canceled due to World War II.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEast Newark: Famed restaurant Tops Diner will soon be demolished and rebuilt in the same spot, with new space three times the current size. Tops, which opened in 1942, has been approved for expansion by the Hudson County Planning Board. Owners Jimmy and John Golemis, whose father, George, bought the diner in 1972, could not be reached for comment on the expansion. Tops Diner has been named the “most iconic” restaurant in New Jersey by Thrillist; was ranked the best diner in the country by Time Out magazine; and was listed as the most famous restaurant in the state by Insider. According to reports from NJ.com and The Jersey Journal, the new space will feature 296 seats (up from 180), 160 parking spaces and outdoor seating. Tops Diner says construction will take at minimum four to six weeks, during which Tops will be closed.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Thousands of small campaign contributions have helped propel former CIA operative and author Valerie Plame to the financial lead in a crowded primary for an open congressional seat in 2020. The Democrat raised $236,000 in May and June, according to disclosure forms and a statement from the campaign. Among notable donors were actor Bryan Cranston of “Breaking Bad” and Naomi Watts, who portrayed Plame in the 2010 film about her involvement in political jousting at the start of the Iraq War under President George W. Bush. In a field of eight primary contenders, Plame is the only national figure. Her identity as a CIA operative was leaked by an official in President George W. Bush’s administration in an effort to discredit her then-husband, diplomat Joe Wilson, a critic of the war in Iraq.\n\nNew York\n\nVernon: Woodstock 50 organizers have applied again for a permit to hold their festival at an upstate horse track, a day after losing an appeal for a previous denial. Town of Vernon officials say the application was submitted Wednesday. Woodstock 50 was previously denied a permit twice last week by the town. An appeal of the denial was upheld Tuesday night by the central New York town’s planning board. The Vernon Downs racetrack and casino became a possible alternative site for Woodstock 50 after the original venue, Watkins Glen International, pulled out. Woodstock 50 did not respond to a request for comment. Oneida County Sheriff Robert Maciol warned Thursday that “there is no practical or logistical possibility that this event could occur without significant risk to public safety.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHatteras: Sea turtles have again set a record for nesting at the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. A news release from the National Park Service says that with more than a month to go before the nesting season typically winds down, rangers discovered the 326th nest Monday. The previous record of 325 was set in 2016. As of Tuesday, there are 317 loggerhead nests, 11 green sea turtle nests and one Kemp’s Ridley nest. Tracy Ziegler, chief of resource management and science for National Parks of Eastern North Carolina, says it’s estimated that almost 11,000 sea turtle eggs have been deposited in beaches on Bodie, Hatteras and Ocracoke islands.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state has sued the federal government to recover the $38 million the state spent policing protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem says he filed the lawsuit Thursday against the Army Corps of Engineers. He says the agency didn’t respond to an administrative claim he filed one year ago. The agency did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Stenehjem says the Corps allowed protesters to illegally camp without a permit on federal land along the Missouri River in southern North Dakota and failed to maintain law and order. The Corps has said protesters weren’t evicted due to free speech reasons. The pipeline carries oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Republican-led Legislature has passed a measure that would allow farmers and university researchers to grow industrial hemp and would legalize sales of hemp-derived cannabidiol oil, or CBD. Federal legislation last year removed hemp from the list of federally controlled substances and now treats the low-THC version of the cannabis plant like other agricultural crops. But existing Ohio law doesn’t differentiate between marijuana and hemp. The newly passed Ohio legislation would allow for cultivation of hemp as long as it contains less than 0.3% THC, the cannabis compound that gives marijuana its high. It would be regulated by the state. The measure was sent to GOP Gov. Mike DeWine for consideration. It would take effect immediately if he signs it.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma County has joined over 50 other cities and counties in the state to prosecute drug companies for damages caused by the opioid epidemic. The Oklahoman reports that all three county commissioners voted Wednesday to approve a contract with the Fulmer Sill law firm to sue opioid manufacturers. The decision comes at the end of the state’s trial against consumer products giant Johnson & Johnson, which alleges the company and its subsidiaries created a public nuisance by aggressively promoting the highly addictive drugs. Oklahoma could receive up to $17.5 billion in abatement costs. Commissioner Kevin Calvey says the opioid crisis has increased the county’s costs in policing, jailing and providing treatment services to residents. Fulmer Sill lawyers say they expect to pursue “tens of millions of dollars” for the county.\n\nOregon\n\nKeizer: Four scorpions were brought to the Keizer Fire District after a woman found the abandoned arachnids inside a Red Vines licorice container near a playground at an area park Wednesday. A mother picked them up around noon and brought them to the fire district. Keizer Fire District Chief Jeff Cowan says the arachnids were confirmed to be Pacific Northwest forest scorpions, a species native to the Willamette Valley. The species is not aggressive. Though they can sting, they prefer to play dead when disturbed. The scorpions were then given to the Oregon Department of Agriculture, which maintains a staff of professional entomologists. Cowan says under the entomologists’ care, the scorpions will travel for outreach events such as the Oregon State Fair.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWilkes-Barre: City officials have removed a public monument that included a recently added brick sponsored by a Ku Klux Klan affiliate. The Citizens’ Voice reports the column monument in Public Square was taken down three weeks after a brick was placed on it bearing the name of the East Coast Knights, a KKK chapter that has recruited in Wilkes-Barre. Harrisburg citizen activist Gene Stilp tried to chisel it off last week, resulting in a disorderly conduct charge, which he says he plans to fight. The monument was installed in 2008. Supporters could purchase engraved bricks for $35. Wilkes-Barre Mayor Tony George tells the paper it was time to tear down the monument, which he says wouldn’t have survived ongoing renovations to Public Square.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: The state’s prison population is continuing to shrink as the percentage of older inmates rises. WPRI reports a 2018 Department of Corrections Population Report indicates 1 in 4 adults in the state’s correctional institutions in 2018 was over the age of 50, with more than 7% over 60. The 2009 population report disclosed that 17% of inmates were over 50, and 5% were over 60. The department says it categorizes inmates 50 and older as geriatric. The American Civil Liberties Union is also watching the aging prison population closely. Steve Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, says everyone “should be concerned as taxpayers.” Data compiled by the nonprofit projects the number of elderly inmates to triple in the next 15 years.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: The Greenville County Council has moved forward on a roughly $40million plan to relocate state offices from some expensive real estate downtown to a pair of office buildings near Haywood Mall. The decision at Tuesday night’s council meeting means the county is moving forward with the $1 billion commercial and residential redevelopment of County Square that council members first approved more than a year ago. The purchase price for the buildings, formerly part of the Fluor Corp. campus, will be $33.1 million, according to council members. The county will spend an additional $5 million to $8 million up-fitting the buildings for county and state services, according to a memo circulated to council members last March.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Dozens of children up to age 5 in the Sioux Falls School District and five rural districts now have access to mental health support in a way they never did before thanks to a $2 million grant given to Southeastern Behavioral Healthcare. The five-year grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration establishes the South Dakota Early Childhood Mental Health Collaborative to help Southeast Behavioral Health therapists reach an under-served population, what some call a “mental health desert,” through a partnership with South Dakota State University and federal school readiness programs like Head Start. And it will also develop some of the state’s first fully certified specialists in play therapy to help children discover healthy social and emotional coping skills, Southeastern officials said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: If famed local dive bar Earnestine & Hazel’s didn’t have enough haunted lore swirling around it already, bones of an unknown origin tumbling out of the walls and landing at the feet of construction crews serve as one more paranormal episode the historic bar can now tout. Diversified Builders crews have resumed restoration work after a Wednesday night scare when bones fell out of a wall they were repairing. The contracting company’s vice president, Chris Tigner, says word got out quickly, and someone alerted police and inaccurately told them a body was in the bar. Police and fire crews swarmed the site about 11 p.m., Tigner says. There was no body, and no one can say with certainty what organism the bones originated from. Caitlin Chittom, owner of Earnestine & Hazel’s, says they’ve been sent away for identification.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A former judge who served on the state’s highest criminal court has denounced President Donald Trump in announcing her decision to leave the Republican Party. The Austin American-Statesman reports retired Texas Court of Criminal Appeals Judge Elsa Alcala announced her decision on Facebook. Alcala said in the Facebook post that even accepting that Trump has had some successes, “at his core, his ideology is racism.” Alcala said she can no longer support the GOP and will be voting in the 2020 Democratic primary. She was appointed to the court by Gov. Rick Perry in 2011 and spent 20 years as a GOP judge. Alcala’s announcement follows Trump’s tweets that four Democratic freshmen should “go back” to their home countries – though all are citizens, and three were born in the United States.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Wildlife officials say reports of bears coming down from the mountains and rummaging through backyards and campgrounds throughout the state have more than doubled this year. Faith Jolley with the Division of Wildlife Resources said Wednesday that her agency has already received more than 25 reports of black bears getting into trash cans and campsites, mostly in central Utah. In 2018 the DWR recorded 27 total bear encounters. None resulted in serious injury. The sharp increase can be attributed to a larger bear population and a wet spring that kept the bears hibernating longer than usual. State biologists say these factors have made bears bolder in searching for food. Jolley says residents can “bearproof” their surroundings by regularly cleaning their trash cans and storing food in locked cars while camping.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Vermont Mozart Festival will not have a summer concert series this year. WCAX-TV reports that the organization said in a Facebook post this week that it is “currently reviewing opportunities and evaluating all options for the future, but will not have a summer season this year.” It didn’t say why. The festival, which celebrates the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, has struggled in recent years. It shut down in 2010 due to financial troubles. Then it was revived under new leadership, with partnership with communities and including food offerings and youth sports.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A limited-edition license plate is being offered to celebrate the University of Virginia men’s basketball team’s 2019 national championship. The state Department of Motor Vehicles worked with UVA to offer a license plate featuring the national champion’s logo. The plate is now available for purchase at any DMV customer service center, mobile office or online. It costs $25 annually, plus the cost of the registration, and can be personalized for $10. UVA license plates are part of the DMV’s revenue-sharing program, with $15 of the $25 fee returned to the university to support student scholarships. UVA has received more than $1.9 million from the program since it was established in 1992. The DMV also offers license plates as ornamental souvenirs. The $10 plates cannot be used on motor vehicles.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Transportation Commission is expected to vote this year on a proposal to replace the gas tax with a pay-per-mile system. The vote will take place Dec. 17, after the commission is expected to receive a report in October from a panel that has studied the new type of tax, The Olympian reports. Any recommendation voted on by the commission will then be passed on to the Legislature to consider during its next session, which starts in January. Commission chairman Jerry Litt says he expects many state residents would pay more under a pay-per-mile tax, which the state calls a “road usage charge.” Sen. Rebecca Saldana, vice chairwoman of the Senate Transportation Committee, says the state is considering such a charge because she says more fuel-efficient vehicles have eroded the state’s ability to rely long term on the gas tax for transportation needs.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A permanent prescription drug disposal site is being placed at the Capitol so people wanting to dispose of medication can do so all year. There has already been a collection site at the Capitol for National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day, but the new location is permanent. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey announced the plan Wednesday and said it is in collaboration with the Capitol Police. Morrisey says the use of disposal sites can affect substance abuse rates by reducing the number of available pills. This disposal site is at the Division of Protective Services Office in Building 1, Room 152-A.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers has signed a bill that creates new tiers of sign language interpreters. The bill he signed Wednesday establishes criteria for new advanced and intermediate licenses for both deaf and hearing interpreters and requires the state Department of Public Safety to determine the scope of practice for each level. One of the bill’s chief Assembly sponsors, Democrat Jonathan Brostoff, refused to cut his hair for a year and a half as a stunt to pressure Republican legislative leaders to consider the proposal. His hair had ballooned into a thick, curly mop by the time the Assembly and Senate passed the proposal in June. He cut his hair days later.\n\nWyoming\n\nThermopolis: The skeleton of a nearly 3-foot-tall cousin of the velociraptor is now on display at the Wyoming Dinosaur Center. The Rock Springs Rocket-Miner reports the museum in Thermopolis opened a new permanent exhibit featuring the fossils and full-size reproduction of the dinosaur informally known as Lori. Paleontologists discovered Lori, whose scientific name is Hesperornithoides miessleri, in a formation dating to the late Jurassic period near Douglas in 2001. Center paleontologist Bill Wahl says Lori is the earliest troodontid that has been found in North America. It’s also the smallest dinosaur that has been found in Wyoming. Troodontids are bird-like predators that have sickle-like claws.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/19"}]}

Vaughn Correctional Center, commuters, and whoever else passed through Smyrna before the restaurant closed at noon.\n\nAchenbach and her sister Joan Thomas cooked egg and sausage sandwiches, home fries, and delectable bone-in, jumbo pork chops served between two slices of white bread, as well as other breakfast standards. While there is almost always a line at Helen's, it moves quickly.\n\nHelen's also became known for its kitschy \"Elvis Room,\" a small eating area that was a shrine to the King and the King's impersonators. Achenbach covered the walls with photos of Elvis, and even had a mannequin in one corner, and made no apologies for the decor.\n\n\"I'm an Elvis fan,\" she said simply during a 2005 interview and recalled fond memories of going to a back-in-the-day Elvis Presley concert in Philadelphia.\n\n“The store was her pride and joy, where she loved her customers and her customers loved her,\" the obituary read.\n\nIn October 2001, the now-defunct Gourmet magazine named Helen's as one of its 100 favorite places to eat in the world. The Delaware breakfast restaurant was cited alongside food businesses in Morocco and Iceland.\n\nHelen's was among the places Gourmet editors said they had been \"keeping to ourselves, but now it's time to confess,\" wrote Ruth Reichl, a former restaurant critic for The New York Times, who was the magazine's then editor.\n\nHelen's sister Joan told The News Journal that although she didn't read Gourmet (in fact, she never heard of the magazine until being contacted by a reporter), it was an honor to be singled out.\n\n\"They mentioned the big pork chop, so that's nice,\" Thomas said.\n\nAchenbach, a lifelong Delawarean known to her adored grandchildren as \"MomMom,\" had homes in both Smyrna and Pot-Nets Bayside.\n\nShe married twice, once in 1950 to Clifford J. Murphy Sr., and after his death, to Melvin “Mudge” Achenbach in 1967. Helen and Mudge had been partners with Mudge's brother, Ernest, in Ackie's Cafe, a long-gone downtown Wilmington tavern on West Eighth Street. Mudge passed away in 2000.\n\n\"Her family — and maybe Elvis — were the only things she loved more than the restaurant,\" read the obituary.\n\nHelen's son Clifford J. \"Butch\" Murphy and his wife JoAnne had run the restaurant full-time from the early 1990s until they retired in 2022.\n\nMurphy's son Clifford J. Murphy III, Helen's grandson, has since taken over the family business. He plans to open a second Helen's this fall on Main Street in downtown Newark.\n\nOn the Helen's Sausage House Facebook page on Tuesday, Murphy posted his thoughts about his grandmother.\n\n\"It is with an extremely heavy heart that we bid farewell to one of the greatest women we’ve known,\" the post reads. \"She will be greatly missed by all her family and all of her extended family who were her customers over the years. Know that she loved serving you, and being a part of the Delaware community for so many decades. I only hope we can carry on her legacy.\"\n\nAchenbach loved dancing, her pony Brandy, her many dogs, and the pigs and chickens she raised; being a part of the Holloway Terrace Fire Company Ladies Auxiliary for several years; hosting family holiday dinners, and eating crabs down at the beach, according to her obituary.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her sister, Joan Thomas; and husbands, Clifford J. Murphy Sr. and Melvin “Mudge” Achenbach. She is survived by her children, Diane Murphy Phillips (Wayne) and Clifford “Butch” Murphy, Jr. (JoAnne); grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nFamily and friends can visit the Spicer-Mullikin Funeral Home, 1000 North DuPont Parkway, New Castle, beginning at 10 a.m. Monday, Sept. 11.

Here's a list to get you started in 2015, from beginning to end.\n\n-Eat a famous sausage: Housed in a white frame building with a pink pig on the roof just off U.S. 13 north of Smyrna, Helen's Sausage House is a favorite with the locals and has even gained national notoriety from time to time - Gourmet magazine once named the sausage house one of its 100 favorite places to eat.\n\nOrder a \"two-on-one\" - two deep-fried, 6-inch lengths of sausage served on a single roll (and we like it with fried onions and peppers) and sit in Helen's kitschy dining area full of Elvis Presley photos for the full effect.\n\n-Kayak at Trap Pond State Park: It's one of Delaware's hidden gems: Trap Pond State Park features the northernmost natural stand of bald cypress trees in the United States. Kayaking among the majestic beauties is breathtaking and worth the trip down to Sussex County.\n\nRent a kayak - or other boats - at the park and see for yourself. Bonus: It's also a great birdwatching location.\n\n-Take a ride down Del. 9 and eat at Sambo's: We all know Del. 1 is the preferred route to travel the state, but the tranquil two-lane road that is Del. 9 is flanked by corn fields and provides more of a relaxing drive while saving you toll money. When you need a break from the sights, stop at Sambo's Tavern in Leipsic.\n\nThe seasonal tavern was founded more than 50 years ago by Samuel \"Sambo\" Burrows. The locals know it's the go-to place for steamed crabs and cold beer.\n\n-Take a brewery tour: For being such a small state, Delaware sure has its fair share of breweries.\n\nThere's that little one in Milton that we all love, but if you've already been to Dogfish Head a billion times, check out others across the state: Twin Lakes in Greenville, Fordham and Dominion in Dover, Mispillion in Milford, Iron Hill in Wilmington and Newark, Stewart's in Bear, 16 Mile in Georgetown ... and the list goes on. For a full directory, check out visitdelaware.com.\n\n- Watch a horse race: Even if placing bets isn't your thing, watching a horse race at one of Delaware's three tracks is always a good people- and horse-watching time. Delaware Park in Stanton races May through October and offers meet-and-greets with the horses and jockeys in the gorgeous paddock. And several Kentucky Derby horses have gotten their start at the Stanton location.\n\nOr enjoy harness racing at Dover Downs or Harrington Raceway, both in Kent County.\n\n- Zip line through the trees\n\n: You no longer have to go to the rain forest or somewhere tropical to swing through the trees. In fact, you just have to go to Bear. It hasn't been around long, but the Go Ape Lums Pond zip lining and treetop adventure is wildly popular already. And with good reason: The four zip lining courses provide a scenic view over the 200-acre pond.\n\n- See a ballgame\n\n: Sure, Delaware may not be known for its professional sports teams, but there's plenty of sports action happening throughout the year.\n\nCheck out a Delaware 87ers game in the winter to see future NBA prospects. And in the spring and summer, the Blue Rocks provide a family-friendly atmosphere where you can watch future MLBers while eating and drinking food for a fraction of the cost of a Phillies game.\n\nIf football is your thing, check out a Blue Hens game in Newark during the fall.\n\n- Watch a re-enactment: Dover Days is one of Delaware's longest running events that celebrate First State history.\n\nIt's the only please in Delaware where you can see hundreds of children in colonial attire dancing around the maypole on Dover's historic Green. While there, explore Revolutionary War, Civil War and World War II encampments.\n\nThe festival runs May 1-3 this year.\n\n- Hit a festival: Delaware is quickly becoming a mecca for live music. Check out the growing and nationally acclaimed Firefly Live festival in June at Dover Downs, which draws big rock acts.\n\nOr this year, there'll be dueling country festivals: Big Barrel's 35-act list is led by headliners Carrie Underwood, Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert with Haggard, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Loretta Lynn and critically adored indie country newcomer Sturgill Simpson on board. Delaware Junction will have Toby Keith, Jason Aldean and Florida Georgia Line.\n\nFirefly: June 18-21\n\nBig Barrel: June 26-28\n\nDelaware Junction: Aug. 14-16\n\n- Indulge in ice cream: Tucked away in Hockessin, Woodside Farm Creamery offers to-die-for dessert (or, let's be real, we could eat this for dinner, too). You certainly can't ever go wrong with the wacky flavors - bacon or dirt, anyone? Or if vanilla is more your thing, that's there as well.\n\nThe family-owned creamery is open from early April through late October.\n\n- Be spooked: Sure Frightland near Middletown is awesome but there's another, lesser-known and more \"very Delaware\" way to get your spook on during Halloween. You have to check out the Haunted Chicken House on Proctors Purchase Road near Hartly. In addition to some decked-out chicken houses full of scary characters, there's also a hayride through a junkyard and concessions.\n\n- Explore Amish country: You don't have to go across the state line to Lancaster County to find a simpler way of life. Just outside Dover, more than 1,500 Amish live. A drive through the area offers picturesque views of farmland, historic barns, plenty of churches and a few businesses - cabinet shops, blacksmiths, dry good stores - to stop at.\n\n- Head to a beach festival: Yes, a day at the beach, is a joy in itself but if you can only take so much sunbathing, check out one of the beach events:\n\nThe annual Sandcastle Contest (Aug. 1) at Fisherman's Beach at the north end of the Rehoboth Beach Boardwalk. More than 100 teams are expected to express their artistic flair. Past creations have included swamp animals, mermaids, crabs, dolphins, pyramids and of course traditional sandcastles.The best part about the event? It's free.\n\nThe Great Delaware Kite Festival (April 3) at Cape Henlopen. The competition is free and open to all age groups. Grab a kite or make your own and compete in several categories. Or just go to watch the kite-flyers in their glory.\n\n- Learn about Delaware's geological history: It would nearly be impossible to make a Delaware list and not include at least one DuPont-related activity.\n\nHagley Museum - the site of the gunpowder works founded by E. I. du Pont in 1802 - lets you explore more than just the family's history: It offers a walking tour of the grounds where visitors explore the geology of the Brandywine Valley and its impact on the milling industry.\n\n- Take a train ride with Santa:\n\nA train ride is fun any time of year, but there's something magical about a holiday ride through the woods along a winding creek, twinkly lights glittering through trees along the way. It's not quite the \"Polar Express\" but there is a special passenger who is quite familiar with the North Pole: Santa\n\n. From Thanksgiving through Christmas, the Wilmington & Western Railroad's Santa Express makes a 90-minute run from Greenbank Station in Prices Corner to Ashland and back. With Santa. And a little chocolate for the kids. If Santa's not your bag, they also do leaf-peeper rides, a Valentine's Day ride and other special events. It's a jolly good time.

Some of the recipes for the Delaware dishes Guy tried are on the \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" website at foodnetwork.com/shows/diners-drive-ins-and-dives\n\n1014 N. Lincoln St., Wilmington, 302) 510-4929; http://localebbqpost.com\n\nLocale BBQ Post, a Wilmington barbecue eatery, was the first Delaware restaurant to be featured on the popular Food Network TV show, \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.\"\n\nIt's run by chef/owner Dan Sheridan who opened the mostly take-out spot in August 2015 on the edge of Wilmington's Little Italy neighborhood.\n\nThe episode called \"A World of Barbecue,\" aired on May 24.

Lincoln St., Wilmington, (302) 656-9822; jvpastabilities.com\n\nLuigi Vitrone's snug Pastabilities has been operating on the first floor of a former home in Wilmington's Little Italy neighborhood since 1988.\n\nThe episode \"Sausage, Shawarma and Scaloppini\" first aired May 31.

The arancini, $11, is risotto mixed with fresh herbs and cheese that's formed into a ball and deep-fried. It's served with marinara sauce. The veal is a house-special, not listed on the website menu. The veal recipe is on the \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" website.\n\nHours: Dinner-only beginning at 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. The last seating is at 9 p.m. Reservations are strongly recommended.\n\n3007 Concord Pike, Talleyville, (302) 477-9740; stoneyspub.com\n\nThe British restaurant was founded by Mike Stone, a former promoter for rock-and-rollers like Van Halen and Lenny Kravitz. He likes to say he couldn't find a place serving food like he grew up with in the United Kingdom, so he opened his own pub. Stone uses some of his mother's recipes for traditional fare such as bangers and mash, shepherd's pie, and beef Wellington.\n\nThe episode \"British, Hawaiian and Mexican\" first aired June 14. The next broadcast is 7:30 p.m. July 27. You can watch a video of Stoney's chef making roast beef and Yorkshire pudding on the \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" website.\n\nWhat Guy Ate: Stoney's signature fish and chips that's made with fresh-caught white fish that's dipped in an authentic British chip shop batter. The chips are hand-cut and deep-fried. Here's the recipe.\n\nFieri also had roast beef with Yorkshire pudding, a delicacy similar to popovers.

It will be repeated at 10 p.m. Aug. 9 and 1 a.m. Aug. 10.\n\nWhat Guy Ate: Fieri chowed on the That’ll Do Pig burger ($18), a beef burger made with a house blend of chuck, brisket, short rib, and filet served on a roll baked from the nearby Market Street Bakery.\n\nIt's topped with Tater tots, \"cart sauce,\" bacon, bacon mayonnaise, bacon jam and horseradish cheddar.\n\nHe also nibbled on crispy Nashville chicken skins ($9). The deep-fried chicken skins, very similar to pork rinds, are topped with a Nashville dry rub and served with ranch dressing. Here is the recipe.\n\nHours: 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday; 4 to 9 p.m. Saturday. Closed Sunday.\n\n3301 Lancaster Pike, Wilmington, (302) 691-5269; thesausagekingofdelaware.com\n\nMaiale Deli & Salumeria in The Cannery Shopping Center is owned by Billy Rawstrom, who calls himself \"The Sausage King of Delaware.\" He started the business in 2010 at another Wilmington location and moved to The Cannery in 2014.\n\nHe will be running the Pop-Up location soon at the DECO food hall in downtown Wilmington.\n\nThe episode \"International Infusion\" first aired July 12. It will be rebroadcast at 10 p.m. Aug. 16, 1 a.m. Aug. 17 and 7:30 p.m. Aug. 24.\n\nWhat Guy Ate: The Thai Curry Chicken Sausage Sandwich ($7.95) that's topped with Sriracha mayonnaise and an Asian Sesame Slaw. Here's the recipe.\n\nFieri also had the Castro sandwich ($9.50). It's Rawstrom's take on a Cuban sandwich that's made with house-cured ham, roast pork, Swiss cheese, pickles and Dijonaise sauce on pressed French bread.\n\nHours: 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday though Friday; 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday; closed Sunday.\n\n520 N. Union St., Wilmington, (302) 652-9223; mrsrobinos.com/\n\nMrs. Robino's, an Italian-American tradition since 1940, is one of Delaware's best-known restaurants. The eatery, in Wilmington's Little Italy neighborhood, is as old-school \"red gravy\" as it gets, but it also had added some new modern twists. The restaurant now has a vegan menu.\n\nThe episode \"Beef Bonanza\" airs at 9 p.m. July 26, midnight July 27, 10 p.m. Aug. 23 and 1 a.m. Aug. 24.\n\nWhat Guy Ate: Beef braciole and beef ravioli. Both dishes are made in house. The ravioli is always on the menu (there's also a cheese version with ricotta filling). You can get either six or eight meat-filled ravioli, with a meatball, for $10-$12. Robin Robino Mabrey says the braciole also will be available for customers. Here's the beef braciole recipe.\n\nHours: 11 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday; 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Friday; noon to 10 p.m. Saturday; and noon to 8:30 p.m. Sunday.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2018/08/01/restaurants-classics-delaware-dining/791705002/", "title": "20 eateries (and more) that are Delaware classics", "text": "The loss of such landmark Delaware eateries as Leo & Jimmy's in Wilmington, Dover's Kirby & Holloway, and more recently Arner's Restaurant in New Castle had us thinking about longtime First State eating establishments still operating.\n\nWe've come up with a list of 20 (and really more) classic Delaware places that are cherished, hometown favorites.\n\nTo be clear, classic eateries don't necessarily mean the state's best restaurants. That's another list.\n\nThese cultural icons have endured for decades for several, sentimental reasons. Mainly, loyal standbys don't change much or worry about being trendy or hip. They emphasize the customer experience, appease regulars but still grow their base, and continue to create fond memories.\n\nDegnars Greenhill Deli & Pizzeria\n\n2501 W. Fourth St., Wilmington; (302) 656-3663\n\nThis city sub shop has been in operation since 1949. First located at Greenhill Avenue and Fourth Street, it moved to its present location more than 40 years ago. The Degnar family added their name to the business within the past five years or so.\n\nFamily photos clutter one wall of the tiny space, and the counter is shoulder level. There's no seating except for three umbrella-covered picnic tables on the sidewalk.\n\nThe slap-slap, clang-clang of spatulas hitting the flat top when someone makes a cheesesteak is the shop's soundtrack. You can get pasta as well as pizza and stromboli. \"A corner piece, please, dear,\" says a customer pointing to the tomato pie.\n\nRegulars don't even look at the posted menu for the hot and cold sandwiches packed into white paper bags, though they might glance at the daily, handwritten specials. The shop's hours are scribbled on a paper plate hanging at the counter.\n\nWhat to order? Homemade iced tea and lemonade, breakfast pizza, chicken salad, one of the daily BLT specials, cheesesteaks, Italian subs.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Takeout with outdoor seating also is the norm at Walt's Flavor Crisp Chicken Express, 103 N. Lincoln St. in Wilmington. It makes the same fried chicken created in 1973 by the late Harry W. Sheppard at his old Vandever Avenue shop.\n\nMrs. Robino's\n\n520 N. Union St., Wilmington; (302) 652-9223\n\nDiners have been twirling forks through plates of pasta and using bread to sop up the sauce at this vintage Italian-American \"red gravy\" restaurant since 1940.\n\nThe Grand Dame in the city's Little Italy neighborhood was founded by Tresilla Robino, who started the business in the basement of her Howland Street home. She later moved to Union Street.\n\nStill family-owned, Mrs. Robino's honors its longtime patrons, a group fiercely protective of their favorite establishment, by posting their photos near the front door.\n\nWhat to order? Wedding soup, chopped antipasto salad and a combination of homemade spaghetti and ravioli. Check out crab nights on Thursdays.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Ristorante Attilio, a family-owned Italian-American eatery at 1900 Lancaster Ave. in Wilmington since 1985. Get the crunchy hot peppers, spaghetti with white clam sauce, homemade lasagna and Tartufo dessert.\n\n2600 Concord Pike, Brandywine Hundred; (302) 478-2165\n\nGenerations of patrons have making pit stops at “The Pit” for more than 60 years. This archetypal hamburger and shake joint, founded in September 1956, was modeled after The Dog House in New Castle. Initially, it had a long counter with a view of Concord Pike and about four tables. It's grown over the years but hasn't changed much since saddle shoes were in style.\n\nPresident Obama came for a visit in July 2014 on the advice from Vice President Joe Biden and his late son Beau, who were frequent visitors. The only-in-Delaware touches include naming sundaes after area high schools.\n\nWhat to order? Onion rings; The Pit Deluxe charbroiled cheeseburger; a black-and-white milkshake; and the Kitchen Sink, a monster sundae with 20 scoops of ice cream.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Burgers are king at \"the Pit,\" and steak sandwiches are the stars of the Claymont Steak Shop. The flagship Claymont shop at 3526 Philadelphia Pike was founded by Greek cousins Bob Hionis and Sam Demetratos in 1966.\n\n510 N. Union St., Wilmington; (302) 571-8929\n\nEvery state has foods that it's known for: Maryland has crabs, Pennsylvania has the cheesesteak and Delaware has the Bobbie.\n\nThe iconic \"Thanksgiving on a roll\" was invented by the late Wilmington native Lois Margolet. She launched the Capriotti's Sandwich Shop chain in 1976 in the Little Italy neighborhood where she grew up. Margolet named the mom-and-pop sub shop after her grandfather Philip Capriotti.\n\nThe specialty sandwich that established Capriotti's is the famed Bobbie. It's made with pulled turkey, cranberry sauce, homemade stuffing and mayonnaise. The dish was a recreation of a sandwich served to the Margolets by their Aunt Bobbie. The national restaurant chain now has 106 locations in 17 states.\n\nWhat to order? The Bobbie, of course. We also recommend the turkey sub and the Capastrami, hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing, and coleslaw on a roll.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Casapulla's shop at 514 Casapulla Ave. in Elsmere, has been making meaty Italian subs since 1956. It had been considered Capriotti's longtime rival, although the families were good friends.\n\n\"The only problem between us was that Capriotti's and Casapulla's almost sound the same,\" Lou Casapulla told The News Journal in 2017. \"What are you going to do?\"\n\nGrotto Pizza\n\n36 Rehoboth Ave., Rehoboth Beach; (302) 227-3278\n\nSo much nostalgia, and debate, surrounds Grotto Pizza. We're convinced the best slice is served with a side of salty sea air. Go to the original Rehoboth Avenue home, a few steps from the ocean, to enjoy pies that feature a blend of cheeses (they won't say what kind) and tomato sauce applied in a signature swirl.\n\nOh, and in case you're wondering what those regulars are doing with the napkins, dabbing the top of a slice to soak up \"pizza juice\" is a Grotto's tradition.\n\nGrotto Pizza was founded in 1960 by Dominick Pulieri, along with his brother-in-law, Joe, and sister Mary Jean Paglianite. At the first take-out stand, pizza slices sold for 20 cents a piece. A second Grotto Pizza on the Rehoboth boardwalk opened in 1963. The chain now has more than 20 locations.\n\nWhat to order? A traditional oven pizza. Sizes include a 12-inch regular or a 16-inch large. For toppings, we'd go with pepperoni or Pennsylvania mushrooms.\n\nWhat's similar to it?Nicola Pizza at 8 N. First St. in Rehoboth has been around since 1971. Owner Nicholas Caggiano gave Delaware's pizza culture the Nic-o-Boli, the First State's version of the stromboli.\n\n2020 Naamans Road, Brandywine Hundred; (302) 475-3000\n\nOwner Xavier Teixido's classy, convivial restaurant is modern and innovative, but it also focuses on old-school classics. It offers the state's best prime rib, along with seafood, steaks and a wine list deeper than Barry White's dulcet tones.\n\nBuilt on the bones of old Admiral Inn, it has roots tracing back to 1939 when it was the Log Cabin. Harry's has been operating since 1988 with Teixido purchasing it after a split with a former partner in 1993. It's not named after a particular person. Teixido once joked, \"Who doesn't love a Harry?\"\n\nWhat to order? Oysters, hot crab and artichoke dip, aged steaks, prime rib au jus medium rare, soft shell crabs (seasonal), and lobster mashed potatoes.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Walter's Steakhouse at 802 N. Union St. Since the early 1990s, owner John Walter Constantinou has continued the legacy of his father George's long-gone Constantinou's House of Beef.\n\n1722 N. Scott St., Wilmington; (302) 658-8625\n\nOwner August Muzzi has been standing in front of the grill at this old-school lunch counter tucked into the city's Forty Acres neighborhood since 1967.\n\nIt's a cash-only establishment, though there is an ATM machine where the old candy counter used to be. Almost nothing changes at Angelo's and that's the way Muzzi and his longtime patrons like it. The last renovation was in the early 1990s when booths replaced tables. It's open for breakfast and lunch Monday through Friday, and from 7 a.m. to noon on Saturdays. It can be tough beating the regulars to one of the 12 counter stools.\n\nWhat to order? A fried egg and meat breakfast sandwich, grilled cheese and Campbell's tomato soup, Italian sausage sandwich, root beer float, Angie's burger.\n\nWhat's similar to it?Libby's Restaurant at 227 W. Eighth St. in downtown Wilmington is sometimes called \"the 'Cheers' of food.\" Breakfast is served all day at this cash-only establishment that's been in operation since 1982.\n\n1200 N. Dupont Highway, New Castle; (302) 328-5380\n\nLou Sloan and his three brothers opened The Dog House in 1952. At that time, the four-lane highway where the Wilmington Manor eatery sits at Stahl Avenue was only two lanes with trees growing in the median.\n\nThe Sloans are no longer the owners, but split, foot-long hot dogs, cooked on a flat-top grill remain The Dog House's signature dish.\n\nCustomers still find refuge at the cash-only roadside eatery that features the same long, throwback counter with 17 stools that has been in place for 56 years.\n\nWhat to order? A foot-long dog, a cheese dog with chili, a hot dog with sauerkraut or maybe even a cheesesteak.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Deerhead Hot Dogs has been a part of Delaware's eating landscape since 1935. We sometimes hit the 620 S. Maryland Ave. site in Wilmington for a double dog with \"secret\" sauce. There's also a Deerhead Hot Dogs food truck.\n\n4866 N. Dupont Highway, Smyrna; (302) 653-4200\n\nIf you see a line at Helen's, and you will because it's such a popular place, be patient and don't leave. It moves fast.\n\nHelen's home since 1983 has been a squat, white building with bars on the outside windows. Keep an open mind if this is your first visit. Some of the best eateries don't always impress at first glance.\n\nIt's home to the quintessential Delaware breakfast. While most people assume that's scrapple, and Helen's has it, but, as the name suggests, order the sausage. It's deep-fried and it's terrific.\n\nYou can take your meal to-go or sit in the small seating area decorated with Elvis Presley memorabilia. Helen's is an early morning establishment. Really early. It opens at 4 a.m. and the staff calls it a day at noon, Mondays through Saturdays.\n\nWhat to order? Double sausage sandwich with fried peppers and onions; scrapple and egg sandwich; bone-in jumbo pork chop sandwich; home fries.\n\nWhat's similar to it?Royal Treat in Rehoboth Beach is a family-run, cash-only, seasonal breakfast and ice cream parlor that's been at 4 Wilmington Ave., near the boardwalk, for almost 30 years.\n\n2216 Pennsylvania Ave., Wilmington, 302-575-9651\n\nClubby, warm and definitely old-school Wilmington, the Columbus Inn got its current name in 1953, but its roots go back to the 18th century.\n\nOnce considered \"a men's club for the clubless,\" a longtime joke has been that more business deals were made at the Columbus Inn bar than in offices\n\nRenovations in 2010 by the Capano family, after the restaurant was closed for three years, made it much more inviting and modern.\n\nIn a nod to the past, brass nameplates on walls honor longtime customers who have died. The tavern area still has the walnut, horseshoe-shaped bar where for 65 years a congregation of regulars has rested elbows, swapped gossip and sipped cocktails and brews.\n\nWhat to order? Corn and crab chowder, the tavern burger, house-cut fries, crab cakes, the 8-ounce filet.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Jessop's Tavern in Old New Castle is housed in a structure originally built in 1674. In the 1950s, it was known as Captain’s Log Restaurant and it became The Green Frog Tavern in the 1970s. It's been Jessop's since 1996.\n\n101 N. Maryland Ave., Richardson Park, Wilmington; (302) 655-8772\n\nIndia Palace was one of the first Indian restaurants in the state when the Kumar family-run business opened in 1991 not far from the Five Points Volunteer Fire Co.\n\nIt quickly developed a loyal following due to the graciousness of Pinky Kumar, who runs the front of the house, and her husband, Sushil Kumar, who makes the delectable homemade naan in a clay tandoor oven.\n\nThere’s a small lot out front of the brick building, but parking isn’t all that easy. The decor, old-fashioned pine paneling, and a mix of tables and booths for about 50 people looks as though it hasn’t been updated since the restaurant opened.\n\nWhat to order? The buffet lunch; roti (homemade bread), bayngan bhurta (roasted eggplant), marinated sliced lamb, and tandoori mixed grill.\n\nWhat's similar to it? India Palace helped change Delaware's dining scene in 1991 and so did Toscana, Dan Butler's Trolley Square eatery which opened the same year. Butler is credited with setting a new standard for high-quality Italian restaurants.\n\n42 W. 11th St., Wilmington; (302) 594-3154\n\nNo contest: The Green Room inside of the 1913 Italian Renaissance hotel in downtown Wilmington is the most majestic dining room in the state.\n\nWhile the historic Hotel du Pont is no longer owned by the DuPont Co., it is still considered one of the most lavish hotels of America's Gilded Age.\n\nSomehow, you sit up straighter when dining at the Green Room (which, incidentally, has a crimson decor). Sunday brunch is pretty awesome and afternoon tea isn't bad.\n\nThe Green name refers to a family, not the color of the dining room. The hotel has already undergone some changes since The Buccini/Pollin Group acquired the building in 2017, and The Green Room is expected to do the same.\n\nWhat to order? Foie gras, crab cakes, any dessert and definitely the macaroons, the restaurant's signature baked treat. Go for Sunday brunch.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Dan and Missy Lickle brought fancy, but not posh, dining to Hockessin in 1980 with the opening of the Back Burner Restaurant. For a more lavish experience, go to Lickles' Krazy Kat's at The Inn at Montchanin Village.\n\nThe Deer Park Tavern\n\n108 W. Main St., Newark; (302) 369-9414\n\nDespite the legend, Edgar Allen Poe never raised a glass here. But he did lecture at the nearby Newark Academy and, as the story goes, cursed the Deer Park after he fell in the mud outside of it. Poe's \"Raven\" is the DP's mascot.\n\nAn inn, built in 1747, once stood on the ground. The Deer Park was built in 1851 and was once a hotel, and later became a restaurant and popular watering hole for University of Delaware students and local residents.\n\nThe Ashby family acquired the Deer Park in 2001 and made major renovations. The scruffiness is gone, but the Ashbys kept \"the townie bar\" and other traditions such as the Sunday Bloody Mary bar and half-price nachos on Wednesdays.\n\nWhat to order? Nachos grande, burgers, New England clam chowder, fish and chips, eggs Benedict, Bloody Marys.\n\nWhat's similar to it?Klondike Kate's, another popular UD haunt at 158 E. Main St. in Newark, offers American fare and a colorful history tracing back 281 years.\n\n59 Rehoboth Ave., Rehoboth Beach; (302) 227-3674\n\nBeach eats come and go like the tide, but the Back Pork Cafe has endured for 45 seasons. This funky place, with a Key West vibe, started out as the Hotel Marvel and expanded over the years.\n\nRegulars like its laid-back elegance, three decks, regular live music and terrific cocktails. The food is upscale and the service attentive. Locals and tourists both are catered to, and it's not unusual to see a well-behaved dog by its owner's feet on one of the decks. The seasonal eatery closes in October and usually reopens by April.\n\nWhat to order? Dark and stormy cocktails, anything with wild mushrooms, grilled octopus, rabbit bolognese, coffee drinks flamed tableside.\n\nWhat's similar to it? It's probably not surprising to hear some of the Back Porch's original owners in 1981 opened the Blue Moon. The stylish, theatrical 35 Baltimore Ave. eatery is located in a 1907 Sears Craftsman house.\n\n2 Jay Drive, off Basin Road, New Castle; (302) 328-9740\n\nFew places look like the Dairy Palace anymore. It is truly like stepping back in time at this very popular, old-fashioned New Castle ice cream shack. Leave your cellphone in your pocket and soak in the \"American Graffiti\" vibe.\n\nThe seasonal business has been in operation since it was founded in 1956 by Vince and Joyce Parker.\n\nThe couple's daughter and her family are continuing the cash-only, walk-up stand that offers soft serve ice cream with curls that Beyonce would envy. Don't want ice cream (and, uh, why not?) you can also order sloppy Joes, hot dogs and chili dogs.\n\nOn a warm summer night, when the neon lights blink on spelling out \"Dairy Palace,\" it almost feels like you could run into Sandy, Danny, Kenickie and the rest of the \"Grease\" gang.\n\nWhat to order? Pretty much anything, but our preference is a chocolate, vanilla or twist soft serve cone with sprinkles.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Since 1972, three generations of the King family have run King’s Homemade Ice Cream Shops. The flagship Milton is in the oldest commercial building, circa 1830, in Sussex County. The Lewes location has served scoops since 1981.\n\n120 Four Seasons Parkway (off Del. 896), Glasgow; (302) 738-9935\n\nFamily photos decorate the walls of the restaurant that has an atmosphere as Italian as the Trevi Fountain.\n\nFrank Sinatra croons from the speakers and the aromatic smell of tomato sauce and freshly made pasta drifting through the four dining rooms can make the stomach rumble.\n\nLa Casa Pasta was founded in 1978 by Giuseppe Martuscelli who emigrated from Santa Maria di Castellabate, near Salerno, Italy. The family also owns Klondike Kate's in Newark and the Chesapeake Inn in Chesapeake City, Maryland.\n\nWhat to order? Arancini, mussels in spicy marinara sauce, vitello Giuseppe, lobster fra diavolo, bronzino, tiramisu, ricotta cheesecake.\n\nWhat's similar to it?Vincente's Restaurant has moved a few times during its 47 year history. At its 5914 Kirkwood Highway home, chef/co-owner Dan Mancari presents showstopping, tableside Caesar salads and Bananas Foster.\n\n2038 Foulk Road, Brandywine Hundred; (302) 475-1887\n\nIt's hard to believe the building, dating back to the 1920s, has been known as anything but Stanley's Tavern. Still, when the state's best-known sports bar first opened in 1935, it was called Bill's Place.\n\nFormer Browntown resident Stanley Minakowski took over in 1947 and Stanley's Tavern was born. And 71 years later, it's still going strong.\n\nManaging partner Steve Torpey has been in the house since 1982. Stanley's has long been a favored spot to watch football (Philadelphia Eagles are the house team) or pretty much any televised athletic event. Walls are lined with sports-celebrity photos. Bartenders are friendly and chatty, and the beer is ice cold.\n\nThe restaurant has wide-ranging offerings and a popular salad bar.\n\nWhat to order? Chicken wings, burgers, sandwiches, meatloaf, baby back ribs, cheese fries.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Wilmington's Kid Shelleen's Charcoal House & Saloon has been going strong since 1983. The 1801 W. 14th St. site, owned by Xavier Teixido, has continuously operated as a Wilmington restaurant since 1940.\n\n283 Front St., Leipsic; (302) 674-9724\n\nSambo's Tavern, founded by Samuel “Sambo” Burrows in 1953, sits alongside the 17-mile (or so) Leipsic River in Kent County where farms, marshlands and tidal streams converge.\n\nYou have to be at least 21 years old to enter. The establishment, run by Isaac and Elva Burrows, has a tavern license, not a restaurant license. It's also cash only, though there's an ATM machine on site.\n\nYou can call ahead and reserve a table. Try to get a window seat so you can watch watermen pull up and unload crab catches.\n\nOn summer weekends, the bar is full, pitchers of cold beer are flowing and crowds at newspaper-covered tables pick their way through batches of hot, steaming blue crabs. Visitors can go to a giant map that hangs on a wall and stick a pin on their hometown.\n\nWhat to order? Crabs, crabs, crabs. Oh, and the crab cake sandwich, French fries and potato salad.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Blue crab lovers also have been coming to Lestardo's, a relaxed crab house at Del. 273 and Prangs Lane in New Castle's Rambleton Acres Shopping Center since 1969.\n\n1406 Coastal Highway (Del. 1), Fenwick Island; (302) 539-7156\n\nBreakfast has been a tradition at Warren's Station since 1960, but if you want a Bloody Mary or mimosa, head somewhere else. The beach eatery doesn't serve alcohol. It's been that way since it was founded by turkey farmer Warren D. Johnson who then called the business Warren's Family Restaurant.\n\nJeff and Paula Mumford bought the restaurant in 1971 and have since slightly changed the name. They also remodeled and enlarged the site to resemble a replica of a United States Lifesaving Station. Other Mumford family members now work in the business that's still affable and affordable.\n\nWhat to order? Chocolate chip pancakes, Fenwick Island Beach Patrol Sandwich, roast turkey, crab imperial, Delmarvelous rotisserie chicken, any housemade pie.\n\nWhat's similar to it?The equally family-friendly Robin Hood Restaurant at 54 Rehoboth Ave. in Rehoboth has been operating in the beach town since 1968.\n\n5812 Kennett Pike, Centreville; (302) 656-9776\n\nBuckley’s Tavern is to Centreville what the Deer Park Tavern is to Newark.\n\nWhile its home is an upper-crust, affluent area, the egalitarian eatery holds a place in the hearts of Delawareans partly because its crowd has ranged from construction workers in jeans to bankers in suits. It’s been a place of character for characters.\n\nThe building, dating back to 1817, started as a private residence and became a taproom and ice store in the 1930s. Dennis Buckley ran it from 1951 until 1970. It closed for 10 months in 2012 while the restaurant's longtime owners Bob Bolling and Bob Applegate brought in new operators and renovated the historic building.\n\nThe new look keeps the spirit of the original Buckley's while maintaining the integrity of the space.\n\nWhat to order? Roasted garlic hummus, Thai noodle soup, crab Cobb salad, Buckley's burger, French dip, macaroni and cheese. Go for the Sunday pajama brunch where half-price discounts are offered to those wearing PJs.\n\nWhat's similar to it? Feby's Fishery, operating since 1974, moved from Elsmere to its Lancaster Pike location in 1984. Snapper soup is a signature offering and devoted followers like that owners Philip and MarySue DiFebo remain wedded to tradition.\n\nBy limiting the list to 20 we're sure we've neglected some eateries. Here are a few more honorable mentions: Doyle's Restaurant in Selbyville; Mr. Pasta in Holly Oak; Cosmos Diner in Wilmington; The Hearth in Odessa; and Knotty Pine in Wilmington.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.comand on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2023/06/04/items-tsa-allows-carry-on-luggage/70281396007/", "title": "Can I bring this on a plane? Weird stuff TSA will let you fly with from ...", "text": "Look, we don’t know what you get up to on vacation, but if you find yourself with some interesting items to shove into your luggage at the end of your trip, make sure they’re TSA-approved.\n\nWhether you’re on your way home from Wizarding World or an archaeological excursion, chances are you might wonder if some of your related items and souvenirs can be packed in your checked bags or carry-on.\n\nOr maybe you’re just curious about what sorts of things your fellow passengers could be hiding in their luggage.\n\nEither way, here’s a list of some items TSA allows airline passengers to fly with that may not usually accompany your travel itinerary:\n\nGuns at TSA checkpoints:Here's what we saw at one of the airports with the most cases\n\nLearn more: Best travel insurance\n\nAntlers\n\nAntlers can be packed in carry-ons or checked bags. If you want them in a carry-on bag, make sure they are packed in something that can fit in the overhead bin or underneath the seat of the airplane.\n\nArtificial skeleton bones\n\nWent to a museum on vacation? Collecting supplies for an art project? Just want artificial skeleton bones for any other completely-normal-not-suspicious reason? TSA doesn’t care!\n\nThese are allowed in both carry-on bags and checked bags.\n\nAxes and hatchets\n\nIf your worst nightmares include fellow passengers going all “Freddy vs. Jason” in the cabin, rest assured these are not allowed in carry-on bags.\n\nBut TSA does let you travel with them in checked bags.\n\nGetting through airport security quicklyWhat is TSA PreCheck and how much it costs\n\nFacial recognition techlets TSA to verify your ID without an agent staring at you\n\nBiological specimens\n\nSome of you may have dreams of becoming the next Dr. Frankenstein.

That’s because farmhands have been flying on planes for years, and apparently some with cattle prods in tow.\n\nCattle prods are not allowed in carry-on luggage but can be packed in checked bags.\n\nCompressed air guns\n\nCompressed air guns, including paintball markers, can be carried in checked baggage only and must have the compressed air cylinder detached.\n\nCooked meat, seafood and vegetables (without liquid)\n\nMuch to the probable dismay of other passengers, if you wish to travel with cooked meat, seafood or vegetables, TSA allows these items to be packed in carry-on bags and checked bags.\n\nBe sure to pack everything securely and cross your fingers you don’t end up with any flight delays.

Crampons are traction devices used for walking on firm snow and ice.\n\nAll of you adventurers out there will be happy to hear that TSA allows these in checked bags and carry-on bags with special instructions.\n\nCooking gadgets\n\nIf your beloved blender or bread machine has to follow you to every Airbnb, TSA won’t be squashing your joy anytime soon.\n\nBlenders can be packed in carry-on bags with special instructions and checked bags.\n\nBread machines can be packed in both carry-ons and checked bags, along with waffle irons and tortilla presses.\n\nFoam toy sword\n\nThis one goes out to all the parents who have experienced the stress of asking a child to part with a newfound emotional support toy.\n\nIf your kid’s latest obsession happens to be a foam toy sword, TSA lets passengers travel with these in carry-ons and checked bags.\n\nFormaldehyde solution\n\nFormaldehyde solutions of less than 10% are not restricted as hazardous materials.\n\nAccording to TSA, formalin is typically 35% to 40% formaldehyde by volume, so a solution that is less than 25% formalin would be less than 10% formaldehyde and not restricted.\n\nIf this is on your packing list, leak-proof packaging with absorbent material is strongly considered.\n\nThis is allowed in carry-on bags if less than or equal to 3.4 ounces/100 mL or in checked bags following special instructions.\n\nFresh eggs\n\nWe’re not sure how fresh packed eggs would be after a two-hour layover in a random airport, but if this sounds like something you wish to encounter in your future, TSA has given you the green light.\n\nIt might sound like we’re cracking a joke, but fresh eggs are allowed in carry-on bags and checked bags.\n\nHigh eggs prices finally crack:Wondering why egg prices are high in Delaware?

Airport police can handle that.\n\nHarry Potter wand\n\nPotterheads, get excited. Harry Potter wands are allowed in carry-on bags and checked bags.\n\nAnd now that our interest is piqued, we’re dying to know which Harry Potter house TSA belongs to ...\n\nWhich Harry Potter house is Delaware:Is Delaware in the same Hogwarts house as your favorite Harry Potter character?

TSA won’t make you.\n\nLive coral and live fish can be packed in carry-on bags in a clear transparent container.

You better hope the flash mob breaks out before you hand over your luggage.\n\nParachutes\n\nIt’s important to always be prepared, and if your lifestyle warrants a parachute as a necessity, TSA lets you travel with these in carry-on bags and checked bags following special instructions.\n\nParachutes must be packed separately from other baggage and will be inspected at your end destination. TSA suggests adding 30 minutes to your recommended airline arrival window to accommodate parachute protocol.\n\nPlants\n\nPlant parents, your beloved children are allowed in both carry-on bags and checked bags.\n\nBut please, for the sake of other passengers, try not to spill soil when putting your plants in the overhead cabin.\n\nSlingshot\n\nLooking for some real life “Angry Birds” action?
