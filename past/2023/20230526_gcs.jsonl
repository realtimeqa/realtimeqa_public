Not only do you get to cool off in a dark, air-conditioned cinema (and maybe enjoy a cold drink), but you also get to take in the latest blockbuster spectacle out of Hollywood.\n\nMany point to the release of Steven Spielberg's \"Jaws\" in 1975, along with \"Star Wars\" in 1977, as the birth of the summer blockbuster – movies with big budgets and even bigger returns. These movies are oftentimes accompanied by large marketing campaigns and extensive merchandising. Prior to \"Jaws,\" the summer season was not generally considered the best time to release movies that were expected to be major hits. But that has changed and since then some of the top grossing movies of all time were released in the summer.\n\n24/7 Tempo has identified the biggest summer blockbuster each year since 1975 – or, beginning with \"Jaws\" – based on domestic box office data provided by box office reporting service Box Office Mojo. Dollar amounts have been included as both adjusted and unadjusted for ticket price inflation for comparison's sake.\n\nMany of the biggest summer blockbusters involve superheroes such as Batman, Spider-Man, and Wonder Woman. In recent years, movies released as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have been among audience's favorites. As franchise films have been growing in popularity at the summer box office for the past 40 years – again, since \"Star Wars\" first came out in 1977 – movies without sequels, such as \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\" are becoming increasingly rare.\n\nTo determine the biggest summer blockbuster every year since 1975, 24/7 Tempo reviewed the lifetime domestic box office gross of all films that were released during the summer from movie data site Box Office Mojo. For the purposes of this article, the summer season is defined as the first Friday in May through Labor Day Weekend. We included both domestic gross adjusted for ticket price inflation and not adjusted. Production budgets are often estimates as reported by Box Office Mojo. In certain cases, these figures are from Box Office Mojo’s parent site, the Internet Movie Database.\n\n1975\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Jaws\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $1.15 billion\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $260.0 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $7.0 million\n\n\"Jaws\" is based on Peter Benchley's novel about an enormous Great White Shark that terrorizes a fictional New England coast town. The film vaulted Steven Spielberg into the forefront of America's directors. The cast includes Robert Shaw as the Captain Ahab-esque shark hunter, Roy Scheider as the town's sheriff, and Richard Dreyfuss as a marine biologist.\n\n1976\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"The Omen\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $257.7 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $60.9 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $2.8 million\n\nThree years after \"The Exorcist\" shocked audiences with its depiction of demonic possession, the devil showed up again in cinema. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick play the parents of a demon seed in \"The Omen,\" one of the most harrowing movies of all time. Those who try to thwart the prophecy of the anti-Christ taking over the world are killed in some of the most gruesome scenes ever filmed.\n\n1977\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Star Wars\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $1.60 billion\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $461.0 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $11.0 million\n\nKids who had just been let out of school for the summer never forgot the opening scene of a spacecraft inhabiting the screen that announced one of cinema's greatest franchises. In \"Star Wars,\" we meet the characters that will become movie legends – Princess Leia, R2-D2, Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Darth Vader.\n\n1978\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Grease\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $694.7 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $190.0 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $6.0 million\n\nSome of the songs from the musical \"Grease\" – \"Summer Nights,\" \"Hopelessly Devoted to You,\" and \"You're the One That I Want\" – are embedded in our memory. The plot, such as it is, involves good girl Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) meeting greaser Danny (John Travolta, just off his \"Saturday Night Fever\" star turn) over the summer. The two fall in love, but when they discover they go to the same high school, school cliques complicate their relationship.\n\n1979\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"The Amityville Horror\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $310.3 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $86.4 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $4.7 million\n\n\"The Amityville Horror\" is another horror classic from the 1970s. The film, starring James Brolin and Margot Kidder, is about a family on Long Island haunted by malevolent poltergeists bent on driving them out of their home. The film is based on the experiences of the Lutz family, who bought a house in Amityville, Long Island, in 1974, 13 months after Ron DeFeo Jr. murdered six family members there.\n\n1980\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"The Empire Strikes Back\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $884.6 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $290.5 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $18.0 million\n\n\"The Empire Strikes Back\" is the sequel to the first Star Wars movie. Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill return as, respectively, Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Luke Skywalker. In a limited opening in 126 theaters on May 21, the movie rang up $4.9 million in unadjusted box office gross and was the No. 1 movie that weekend. It had a wider release one month later.\n\n1981\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $797.8 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $248.2 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $18.0 million\n\nFor pure escapist summer fare, few movies can top George Lucas and Steven Spielberg's homage to Hollywood adventure films, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" Harrison Ford, already scaling the heights of movie superstardom as Han Solo in the Star Wars films, plays the swashbuckling, snake-fearing archaeologist Indiana Jones, who must keep the Ark of the Covenant out of the hands of Nazis who plan to use it in their quest for world domination.\n\n1982\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $1.28 billion\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $435.1 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $10.5 million\n\n\"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial\" continued director Steven Spielberg's infatuation with benevolent beings from another world that began with \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" five years earlier. The movie also reinforced his belief during the post-Watergate era that government is not benevolent and is not to be trusted. The suburban kids who find E.T. know this, and they smuggle the extraterrestrial out of the neighborhood that is surrounded by government agents looking to capture the alien.\n\n1983\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Return of the Jedi\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $847.5 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $309.3 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $32.5 million\n\n\"Return of the Jedi\" was the third in the Star Wars series, opening on May 23, three years after the first sequel. In this film, Luke Skywalker tries to bring back Darth Vader from the dark side and defeat the evil emperor. The Star Wars franchise is the second highest grossing series in movie history thanks in part to this box office champion.\n\n1984\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Ghostbusters\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $641.3 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $242.2 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $30.0 million\n\nWho knew that oozing rivers of ectoplasm engulfing New York City could be big business? Three former parapsychology professors did, creating a business to expel hell-raising phantoms from the Big Apple. \"Saturday Night Live'' alums Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd star in this romp, and Sigourney Weaver, who had already faced down extraterrestrial terror in the movie \"Alien,\" plays up demonic possession for laughs in \"Ghostbusters.\"\n\n1985\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Back to the Future\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $532.0 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $210.6 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $19.0 million\n\nTime travel, cool cars, romance, Libyan terrorists, the birth of rock and roll – there's plenty to like about director Robert Zemeckis' nostalgic look at the 1950s. The movie spawned two sequels, but none surpassed the success and unbridled joy of the first film, which was the highest grossing movie in 1985 and was inducted into the National Film Registry.\n\n1986\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Top Gun\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $432.8 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $179.8 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $15.0 million\n\n\"Top Gun\" is about cocky Navy fighter pilots trying to outdo each other. The movie stars eye candy Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer, with Kelly McGillis as the love interest. The film captured the Reagan-era zeitgeist of a confident, maybe overconfident, America, looking to reassert itself on the world stage.\n\n1987\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Beverly Hills Cop II\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $354.1 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $153.7 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $28.0 million\n\nThe action-comedy \"Beverly Hills Cop II\" returned Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) to Los Angeles to help local police probe the shooting of a police chief and crimes associated with the attempted murder of the top cop. Murphy was one of the biggest stars of the 1980s, and his star power lifted the film to the top on its opening weekend in late May – it was the third highest grossing film in 1987.\n\n1988\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $343.0 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $156.5 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $70.0 million\n\nPioneering interaction between real and animated characters in the film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" engaged audiences in 1988. Roger is an animated rabbit who is accused of murder and needs the help of a detective who detests cartoons. The movie topped all others when it opened on June 24 and was the second highest grossing film in 1988 behind \"Rain Man.\"\n\n1989\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Batman\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $567.4 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $251.3 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $35.0 million\n\nMichael Keaton is Batman, who does battle with the deranged Joker, played by Jack Nicholson, in the Tim Burton-helmed movie that brought the caped crusader to the big screen. The film opened on June 23 and was the top box office attraction, with $40.5 million in unadjusted domestic gross during its opening weekend.\n\n1990\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Ghost\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $463.7 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $217.6 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $22.0 million\n\n\"Ghost\" is a romantic drama about a young man (Patrick Swayze) who is murdered and his spirit remains to warn his lover (Demi Moore) that the killers are out to get her. Whoopi Goldberg won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role as the psychic who warns Moore. The movie opened in mid-July and had the second highest domestic gross of any film in 1990 after the Christmas movie \"Home Alone.\"\n\n1991\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $439.4 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $205.9 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $102.0 million\n\nFormer body-building champion Arnold Schwarzenegger carved out a lucrative niche as an action star in the Terminator series. In \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day,\" Schwarzenegger plays a cyborg sent from the future to protect the future human leader who will lead the resistance against machines. The movie is remembered for Schwarzenegger's quote: \"Hasta la vista, baby.\" \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" terminated the competition on its first weekend in July 1991, raking in more than $31.7 million.\n\n1992\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Batman Returns\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $353.6 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $162.9 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $80.0 million\n\n\"Batman Returns\" finds the caped crusader (Michael Keaton) confronting the detestable Penguin (Danny DeVito) and the slinky Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). Released on June 19, \"Batman Returns\" was the top-grossing film on its opening weekend.\n\n1993\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Jurassic Park\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $825.9 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $402.8 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $63.0 million\n\nThe movie that launched the franchise about cloned dinosaurs running amuck in an island paradise was a blockbuster right out of the gate. Steven Spielberg's monster hit grossed more than $47 million in its first weekend in early June. \"Jurassic Park\" would go on to be the highest grossing movie of 1993.\n\n1994\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"The Lion King\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $803.2 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $422.8 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $45.0 million\n\nThe beloved animated tale about a young lion assuming his rightful place in the animal kingdom, is one of 28 Disney movies to have tallied more than $300 million at the box office. \"The Lion King\" opened in limited release on June 15 at two theaters, then had a wider release on June 24 at 2,552 theaters, racking up more than $40 million in unadjusted gross at the box office that opening weekend.\n\n1995\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Batman Forever\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $381.2 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $184.1 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $100.0 million\n\nVal Kilmer plays the caped crusader in \"Batman Forever,\" as the series is taken in a more campy direction by director Joel Schumacher. Batman matches wits with the horribly disfigured former district attorney general Harvey Dent, who is known as Two-Face, and the Riddler, a former employee of Bruce Wayne seeking revenge. The film opened on June 16 and wiped out the competition with a box office gross of more than $52 million that weekend.\n\n1996\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Independence Day\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $624.1 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $306.2 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $75.0 million\n\nCigar-chomping fighter pilot Will Smith, computer genius Jeff Goldblum, and crop-duster plane jockey Randy Quaid help save the Earth from aliens bent on conquest in this blockbuster that was released on July 3, the day before Independence Day.\n\n1997\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Men in Black\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $492.1 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $250.7 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $90.0 million\n\n\"Men in Black\" was a buddy movie with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones who fight extraterrestrials causing mayhem on Earth. The movie would spawn three other Men in Black films, all released for the summer. The first had the least successful opening of the first three but would eventually be the most lucrative, topping more than $250 million in unadjusted box office gross.\n\n1998\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Saving Private Ryan\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $412.7 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $217.0 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $70.0 million\n\n\"Saving Private Ryan,\" Steven Spielberg's paean to the greatest generation's sacrifices during World War II, doesn't fit the image of a summer escapist movie. But the critically acclaimed film was a hit, grossing more than $30 million in its first weekend in late July, on its way to over $217 million in unadjusted domestic total gross.\n\n1999\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $813.7 million\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $474.5 million\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $115.0 million\n\n\"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace\" is the first of the Star Wars prequel trilogy.

The cloned dinosaur flick opened on June 12 and took in more than $208 million in its first weekend, the biggest summer weekend opening ever. \"Jurassic World\" is by far the highest grossing film of the five-movie dinosaur franchise when not adjusting for inflation.

The sequel to the 2004 film about a family of crime-fighting superheroes was victorious at the summer blockbuster. It was, however, topped by two other movies released in 2018 outside of summer: \"Black Panther\" and \"Avengers: Infinity War.\"\n\n2019 (so far)\n\n• Biggest summer blockbuster: \"Aladdin\"\n\n• Domestic gross (adjusted for inflation): $270.3 million (so far)\n\n• Domestic gross (unadjusted): $270.3 million (so far)\n\n• Production budget (unadjusted): $183.0 million\n\nDisney's live action \"Aladdin\" is shaping up to be the biggest movie of this summer.

It crossed the $700 million mark in ticket sales, passing Marvel’s “Black Panther” to become the fifth highest-grossing film in North American history, and has made $1.4 billion worldwide since opening in May.\n\nIn another sign of “Maverick” staying power, the movie boasts a box office multiple of roughly 5.5, which means its current domestic haul is 5.5 times that of its opening weekend total. That’s unheard of in contemporary Hollywood, as most big films have a multiple of around 2.5.\n\nBut “Maverick” fans kept coming back to theaters throughout the summer, so much so that the film made at least one million dollars a day for 75 straight days.\n\nThat type of financial longevity not only speaks to the film’s quality — it garnered a 96% score on review site Rotten Tomatoes — but serves as an old-school success story at a time when theaters really needed one.\n\n“There are not enough adjectives to describe the importance of the box office performance of ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ to the industry, having come at a time when naysayers remained skeptical of the ability of the movie theater to draw audiences,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore (SCOR), told CNN Business. “Truly a watershed event.”\n\nHollywood simply does not produce summer blockbusters like this anymore.\n\nWhile several recent movies have done quite well, like 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame” and 2021’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” such releases are typically “front-loaded,” meaning they open to huge numbers on debut weekend then sputter out in the following week.\n\nA film that refuses to land\n\nDergarabedian isn’t exaggerating when he expresses how important “Maverick” has been to theater owners and Hollywood this summer: The film accounted for 13% of the overall domestic box office this year.\n\nAnd that doesn’t capture its symbolic value. “Maverick” comes at an inflection point for theaters, which are trying to return to normalcy after being devastated by the pandemic. Streaming services such as Netflix (NFLX) and Disney+ have also taken a stronger hold on consumers by featuring the type of big-budget productions that used to be exclusive to theaters.\n\n“Maverick,” however, demanded the biggest screens possible, and in doing so, reminded millions of viewers what it’s like to go to the movies after months — if not years — of staying away.\n\nTom Cruise and Paramount “went all in on the moviegoing experience,” Dergarabedian said. “That bet paid off big and, in the process, solidified Cruise’s position as perhaps the last true movie star while simultaneously proving that there is no substitute for the movie theater experience.”\n\nStill, the summer box office has been desolate the last few weeks, with films either being held up by production issues in Hollywood or heading directly to streaming. It’ll be a few months until two potential blockbuster sequels hit theaters, with “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” coming in November and “Avatar: The Way of Water” due in December.\n\nCan either of those films fly as high? Time will tell.

But now, coming this summer to a theater near you: the re-release.\n\nThe box office has entered the dog days of summer, in which big ticket sales and new releases are hard to come by. In the meantime, amid the desolate movie landscape, blockbusters of yore are returning to theaters.\n\nThat includes Universal’s “E.T. The Extra Terrestrial,” which took in $1.07 million last weekend — more than the totals of new films such as “Mack & Rita” and “Emily the Criminal.” Not bad for a 40-year old film.\n\nAnd it’s not the only big hit making a come back.\n\nDisney (DIS) announced Tuesday that 2016’s “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” would be returning to theaters for a week on August 26, along with a sneak peek of the new Disney (DIS)+ Star Wars series “Andor.” Universal’s “Jaws” — the original summer blockbuster from 1975 — swims back into theaters Labor Day weekend in IMAX and 3-D. Sony and Marvel’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home” — the biggest blockbuster from last year — swings into cineplexes for Labor Day as well, with new footage in the film’s “The More Fun Stuff Version.”\n\nThen, on September 23, 2009’s “Avatar” — one of the highest-grossing films of all time — returns to theaters before its highly anticipated sequel, “Avatar: The Way of Water,” comes out in December.\n\nRe-releases have always been a part of the box-office landscape, but “it seems that of late there have been many more then has been traditionally seen in theaters,” noted Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore (SCOR).\n\nWhy? Covid played a part.\n\nRe-releases re-released\n\n“The pandemic spurred on a greater proliferation of re-releases in movie theaters since there were no new movies to come by,” Dergarabedian said. “Theaters are looking for more than just brand-new movies to put on their screens and with some 30% fewer releases in the mix this year, it’s no wonder that this is a welcome trend.”\n\nBringing back favorites is good business for both theaters and studios, according to Dergarabedian.\n\n“Re-releases are great for theaters because it gives them more movies to put on their screens,” he said. “And it’s great for the studios who can dig into their vaults and earn revenues on films that were released many years ago, but now regain a new life on the big screen.”\n\nThe re-release trend is not just for blockbusters that opened in years past, however. Example A: “Top Gun: Maverick.”\n\n“Maverick” — which has made nearly $1.4 billion worldwide since opening Memorial Day weekend — got a boost in its theater count last week during its “Fan Appreciation Weekend” that included showings in premium formats like IMAX (IMAX).\n\n“‘Top Gun: Maverick’ is something of a freak of nature at this point,” Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Boxoffice.com, told CNN Business. “The film’s near-immaculate staying power has strengthened calls for it to be given more premium screen allotment again and again as other content dries up.”\n\nAnd there are more re-releases to come next year.\n\nParamount announced in June that 1997’s “Titanic” would be sailing into theaters just in time for Valentine’s Day 2023.\n\n“I think there’s an argument to be made that small-to-medium scale re-releases in IMAX and other formats should occur more often,” Robbins said. “While there is no substitute for a brand new release capturing a wide audience, select screenings of legacy content can offer valuable supplemental revenue to many theater owners and studios.”", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/25/media/thanksgiving-box-office/index.html", "title": "Thanksgiving used to be a movie feast. This year? Slim pickings ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThanksgiving weekend has historically offered a cornucopia of films, letting moviegoers get out of the house and kick back after eating copious amounts of turkey, mashed potatoes and pie.\n\nBut this year the movie menu is pretty sparse. The North American box office has few new films this weekend that are likely to draw tons of moviegoers.\n\n“Strange World,” Disney’s new animated film about a family of explorers starring the voice work of Jake Gyllenhaal, is projected to bring in only about $30 million domestically over the five-day holiday weekend — a fine, albeit muted, opening. But early box office results from Wednesday and Thursday indicate that “Strange World” is likely to come in under even those initial expectations.\n\nAnother Disney film, Marvel’s “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” is now in its second week and is set to win the holiday weekend with around $40 million domestically. It’s made $552 million so far.\n\nThe slate is a far cry from Thanksgiving weekends of yore. Thanksgiving is usually one of the busiest times of the year for movie theaters, as in many ways it kicks off the profitable holiday box office season — similar to how Memorial Day weekend ushers in the summer. For example, films like “Creed,” “Moana,” and “Knives Out” opened on Thanksgiving weekends and did well.\n\nSo what happened to Thanksgiving this year? Once again, blame Covid.\n\n“The impact of the pandemic, both in terms of production disruption and release-calendar shuffling, has left the table fairly light on cinematic entrees,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore (SCOR), told CNN Business.\n\nSupply chain issues in Hollywood have been hampering movie productions all year long. Summer ticket sales during the summer were strong thanks to hits like “Top Gun: Maverick,” but big new releases have been hard to find in recent months. “Wakanda Forever” is another notable exception, having notched a record $180 million earlier this month, but otherwise it’s been pretty quiet at the cineplex.\n\nA ‘prime time’ for the movie industry\n\nThe dearth of big new releases helps explain why the domestic box office is down 32% so far this year compared to 2019 before the pandemic. The number of releases on 2,000 screens or more is down by 36%.\n\nHolidays like Thanksgiving are important for theaters because “they act as a calendar-based touchstone,” which audiences have come to associate as a “prime time of sorts,” Dergarabedian added.\n\n“This is when the biggest and brightest movies are in the marketplace, and Thanksgiving is certainly one of those timeframes that has developed that type of identity over the years,” he said. “It would be a shame for Thanksgiving to wind up as another marginalized holiday period, like Labor Day weekend.”\n\nBut the 2022 holidays aren’t over yet, and there’s hope on the horizon thanks to James Cameron and his sequel to “Avatar” — the biggest blockbuster in cinema history.\n\n“Avatar: The Way of Water,” which opens on December 16, could unleash a wave of moviegoing to help the industry end the year on a high note. The film Cameron’s first since the 2009 original, and there are some questions about whether this very expensive film can find attract the same type of audience. Others argue: One bets against the director of “Titanic,” “The Terminator” and “Aliens” at their own peril.\n\nAs for Thanksgiving, Dergarabedian hopes that as the theater industry normalizes, the holiday will make a comeback.\n\n“This is likely a temporary shift and a result of the challenging marketplace dynamics over the past two and a half years,” he said. “Thanksgiving will rise again as one of the most important moviegoing weeks of the year.”", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/11/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/media/top-gun-paramount-ceo-risk-takers/index.html", "title": "Paramount took a risk keeping 'Top Gun' grounded for two years. It ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick” was never going to be an easy sell.\n\nSure, the film starred Tom Cruise — arguably one of Hollywood’s most iconic movie stars — and it would be the sequel to “Top Gun,” one of the biggest blockbusters of all time. But the original “Top Gun” was in theaters when Ronald Reagan was president, leg warmers were still in style, and the New York Mets last won the World Series.\n\nThe challenge for Paramount — the studio that released the film — and its CEO Bob Bakish was how to roll out a sequel to the 1986 Cold War classic for a world that had seemingly left Pete “Maverick” Mitchell and his “need for speed” behind.\n\nAnd as if that wasn’t enough, the movie was scheduled to be released in the summer of 2020 when the world was in the midst of pandemic that was shutting down entire industries and throwing millions of people out of work and, oh yes, closing movie theaters around the world.\n\n“It was pretty clear that that wasn’t a viable idea,” Bakish told CNN Business about releasing the film. “The world was pretty shut down, you weren’t going to put an expensive movie that you had real hopes for… in theaters and have nobody come.”\n\nWhat was Paramount to do? “Maverick” was ready to take off — but had nowhere to land. The film, with its hefty $170 million price tag, could go straight to streaming — like many movies did during the pandemic — and as a marquee title would have likely pushed subscribers to the studio’s growing streaming service, Paramount+. However, the company chose to save it for the big screen.\n\n“We really felt, and Tom [Cruise] certainly agreed with the fact that we had a great big screen movie and we just had to hold it,” Bakish said. “It just felt like the right thing to do.”\n\nStill, it was a big risk. Would audiences leave their homes during a pandemic to watch a sequel to a movie more than three decades old? Bakish and Paramount wouldn’t find out until roughly two years after the film’s original release date, after its fourth and final release date of May 27, 2022.\n\n“Top Gun: Maverick” has since become the fifth-highest-grossing film in US history.\n\n“The future is coming… and you’re not in it”\n\n\"No one could predict it would do this well,\" Paramount CEO Bob Bakish said about \"Top Gun: Maverick\" Eamonn M. McCormack/Getty Images for Paramount Pictures\n\n“It’s a very, very bad time to own a movie theater.”\n\nThat’s how Brent Lang, executive editor of Variety, described the climate of the movie theater industry during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.\n\nThe global health crisis shuttered theaters, delaying films for months, if not years. That left some in Hollywood to wonder if the business, which notched more than $40 billion in global ticket sales in 2019, would ever recover.\n\nStreaming — which had already upended the theatrical model — was now booming. Netflix was setting subscriber records, Disney+ surpassed 100 million subscribers in a mere 16 months and other new services were popping up seemingly every day.\n\nAmid that landscape, Warner Bros. decided to release its entire 2021 film slate directly to theaters and simultaneously to the company’s streaming service, HBO Max — a move that shocked Hollywood. (Warner Bros., like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nYet, cineplexes kept trying. In 2021, hits like Sony’s “Venom: Let There Be Carnage,” Disney’s “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” and Universal’s “F9: The Fast Saga” all brought in sizable ticket sales that helped theaters stay open.\n\nBut it wasn’t until Marvel’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home” debuted on the big screen in December that theaters saw a glimmer of hope. “No Way Home” made nearly $2 billion worldwide, but it didn’t really give the industry the confidence it needed — after all, Marvel movies are supposed to do well at the box office no matter what.\n\nSo if a superhero couldn’t save the day, what kind of film would inject new life into theaters? Enter a cocky 60-year-old flyboy and his rag-tag team of young fighter pilots.\n\n“Maverick” flew into theaters with lots of buzz and strong reviews, and that helped the movie blow past box office projections for its opening weekend. It brought in a Memorial Day weekend record of $160 million at the North American box office. That alone would have been a victory for Paramount, but the film was just taking off.\n\nAudiences came back week after week, making “Maverick” the only film ever to take the top spot on Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends. For 75 straight days the film made at least $1 million a day, and now accounts for roughly 12% of the overall domestic box office so far this year, according to Comscore (SCOR). Simply put, “Maverick” refused to land.\n\n“It was an event-level motion picture made for theaters,” Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at Boxoffice.com, told CNN Business. “It also brought back a significant portion of older audiences who held out during the early months of cinematic recovery in 2021 and early 2022.”\n\nEven Bakish was surprised by audiences’ reaction to the film, noting that Paramount “always knew it was a great movie” but it “probably underappreciated how great it was because no one could predict it would do this well.”\n\nBut there’s also a symbolic aspect to the film’s success. “Maverick” is an old-school box office hit made for the biggest screen possible that emerged just as the industry’s future was very much in doubt. “Maverick” showed that audiences still want to go to the movies.\n\n“The commercial reception of Tom Cruise’s legacy sequel was the summer movie miracle theaters needed,” Scott Mendelson, a box office reporter, wrote for Forbes.\n\nClimbing back up the mountain\n\n\"We really felt, and Tom certainly agreed with the fact that we had a great big screen movie,\" Bakish said. Kris Connor/SipaUSA/AP\n\n“Maverick” was also the type of success that Paramount — a company in transition — sorely needed.\n\nIn recent years, the studio behind some of cinema’s greatest films — think “The Godfather,” “Chinatown” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark” — found itself lagging behind competitors in box office market share.\n\nParamount recombined with CBS in 2019 after splitting off from the company in 2006 and rebranded itself as Paramount Global, revamping its top streaming service into Paramount+ during a rapid evolution of the entertainment industry.\n\nFor Bakish, Paramount’s current success comes from focusing on “multiplatform, global execution,” or as he himself puts it, “it’s about theatrical, it’s about television and it’s about streaming.” In other words, Paramount has more than just a streaming-centric view of the media business.\n\nThe strategy has been working. Paramount (PGRE) has had six No. 1 debuts so far this year — more than any other studio — with hit films across multiple genres, including romantic comedy (“The Lost City”), family (“Sonic the Hedgehog 2”) and horror (“Smile”).\n\nPutting films in theaters has not hindered Paramount’s streaming efforts, which include Paramount+ and Showtime and have nearly 67 million subscribers worldwide, the company said last week. While that’s lower than competitors like Netflix (NFLX) and Disney+, Paramount+ is the fastest-growing service in the US so far this year, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAnd those numbers will likely see a boost in the coming months with international expansion in the next year and “Maverick” finally hitting Paramount+ by the end of 2022.\n\n“This is an extraordinary collection of assets,” Bakish said of Paramount’s portfolio of brands. “And at the moment — and yes, I’m biased — we’re executing pretty well.”\n\nBut will that lead to another “Top Gun”?\n\n“You’ve got to have the stars align again. You’ve got to have a story that people love and you’ve got to put the team together,” Bakish said. “We’ll see.”", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/05/30/memorial-day-weekend-quiet-place-sequel-nabs-box-office-covid-best/5274881001/", "title": "Memorial Day weekend: 'Quiet Place' sequel nabs box office COVID ...", "text": "Jake Coyle\n\nAssociated Press\n\nNEW YORK — Moviegoing increasingly looks like it didn’t die during the pandemic. It just went into hibernation.\n\nJohn Krasinski’s thriller sequel “A Quiet Place Part II” opened over the Memorial Day weekend to a pandemic-best $48.4 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. Including the Monday holiday, the studio forecasts the film will gross $58.5 million in North America. It added another $22 million in ticket sales overseas.\n\nThe film’s performance cheered a movie industry that has been punished and transformed by the pandemic. Paramount Pictures’ “A Quiet Place Part II,” which was on the cusp of opening in March 202 before theaters shut, was the first big film this year — and one of the only larger budget COVID-era releases beside Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet” — to open exclusively in theaters.\n\nChris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount, called the opening “an unqualified success.”\n\n“It’s a huge sigh of a relief and a sense of optimism for sure,” Aronson said. “Movies, moviegoing, movie theaters aren’t dead. Yes, they’ve been threatened but they’re proving once again that they’re resilient and that people do want to have that communal experience.”\n\nReview:'A Quiet Place Part II' roars back as a solidly freaky, monster-filled followup\n\nMany studios have trotted out hybrid release plans during the pandemic, debuting films simultaneously in the home. The Walt Disney Co. did that this weekend with its live-action PG-13 Cruella De Vil prequel, “Cruella,” making it available to Disney+ subscribers for $30. In theaters, it grossed $21.3 million, Disney said, and an estimated $26.4 million over the four-day weekend. “Cruella” also added $16.1 million in 29 international territories. Disney didn’t say how much the film made on the company’s streaming platform.\n\n“A Quiet Place II” will also turn to streaming after 45 days in theaters when it becomes available on Paramount+. One clear result of the pandemic is that the theatrical window has shrunk, probably permanently. Three months was once the customary length of a movie’s run in theaters. The year’s previous best debut belonged to Warner Bros.′ “Godzilla vs. Kong,” which opened with $32.2 million, or $48.5 million over its first five days, while simultaneously streaming on HBO Max.\n\nThe contrasting release strategies between “A Quiet Place Part II” and “Cruella” offered a test case for Hollywood. How much does a day-and-date release cost a movie like “Cruella” in ticket sales? Is it worth it? Without knowing how much “Cruella” benefitted Disney+, a true comparison isn’t possible. But the strong returns for the theater-only “A Quiet Place Part II” are telling, says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. He called it a “pivotal weekend” for the movie industry that proved predictions of the movie theater’s demise “flat-out wrong.”\n\n“That ‘Quiet Place Part II’ did so well makes a strong case that a theatrical-first release for a big movie is the way to go,” Dergarabedian said. “This is the best possible news for an industry that’s been dealing with probably the most profoundly challenging chapter in the history of the movie theater.”\n\nThe debut of “A Quiet Place Part II” was much watched throughout Hollywood as the kickoff to its delayed summer movie season. After largely sitting out the pandemic, or diverting to streaming platforms, a lineup of blockbusters are again queuing up. On tap are Warner Bros.′ “In the Heights,” Universals’ “F9” and Disney’s “Black Widow.”\n\nLast week, Universal Pictures’ ninth installment in the “Fast & Furious” franchise, “F9,” opened with $162 million in ticket sales in eight international markets, and $135 million in China alone. In its second weekend, “F9,” which opens in North America on June 25, raced toward $230 million worldwide.\n\n“A Quiet Place Part II” had already had its red-carpet premiere in March last year, and spent some of its marketing budget. But it opened remarkably in line with predictions of how many tickets it would sell before the onset of the pandemic. In the intervening months, Paramount sold off many of its films to streamers — “Coming 2 America,” “The Trial of the Chicago 7” — but Krasinski and the studio felt strongly that the hushed intensity of “A Quiet Place Part II” worked best on the big screen.\n\n'Did I just put my marriage on the line?':John Krasinski recounts the scariest scene in 'Quiet Place II' for Emily Blunt\n\nIn an interview ahead of the film’s release, Krasinski said a theatrical release was “non-negotiable.” And Krasinski worked hard to stoke excitement, traveling the country in the week leading up to release to surprise moviegoers. Still, given the circumstances, he had little idea whether audiences would come out.\n\n“As bizarre as the entire year has been is how bizarre whatever opening weekend is,” Krasinski said. “I don’t really know what it is anymore.”\n\nIn the end, “A Quiet Place Part II” performed a lot like how the first one did. That 2018 hit, which ultimately grossed $340 million globally on a $17 million budget, launched with $50.2 million in North American ticket sales. Sequels usually do better than the original but “Part II” had far more challenges due to pandemic.\n\nRich Gelfond, chief executive of IMAX, where “A Quiet Place Part II” earned $4.1 million domestically, called the film “the first domestic release this year to cross the threshold from ‘great opening weekend given the pandemic’ to ‘great opening weekend, period.’”\n\nMemorial Day weekend, usually one of the busiest for theaters, still didn’t look like it normally does at the movies. Total box office exceeded $80 million but that’s about a third of the holiday weekend’s normal business. Last Memorial Day, when nearly all operating theaters were drive-ins, ticket sales amounted to $842,000, according to Comscore.\n\nMany theaters, particularly in New York and Los Angeles, are still operating with social distancing measures.

Baxter Avenue Theaters: Best experience\n\n1250 Bardstown Road, Louisville; 502-459-2288; score: 27 points\n\nYou won't find any thrills or grandeur at this quaint location tucked behind Mid-City Mall in the Highlands. And that's just fine. This stylish theater has charm.\n\nWith a prime spot by Bardstown Road, there are plenty of locally owned and diverse things to do both before and after the feature. Prices here are great — albeit not as cheap as its sister spot Village 8 — and you can even catch screenings of lesser known indie films here not screened anywhere else in the city. Add to that, Apex Theatres has often brought back classics like \"Halloween\" or \"Cruel Intentions\" during special events.\n\nDid we mention the reclining seats?\n\nPro tip: Buy your tickets far in advanced. They sell out quick here.\n\nTicket prices (may vary): $9.25 Monday, Wednesday, Thursday; $5.75 Tuesday; about $10 Friday-Sunday\n\nHot hot hot:Forget the 'Polar Vortex.' Here comes the 'Death Ridge' and record heat for the Southeast\n\n3. Xscape Theatres: Best place to spend a summer afternoon\n\n12450 Sycamore Station Place, Louisville; 502-709-6000; score: 27 points\n\nIt's pretty far out there in the East End, but the Xscape Theatres complex has everything you're looking for if you're in the area. Xscape has a good number of theaters, including a massive \"Xtreme Xscape\" screen, if you can handle a little sensory overload. (Go big or go home, right?)\n\nThe seats recline and are a great place to spend a few hours. The snack stand isn't huge but it has all the snack foods you'd expect, with beer and wine offerings. The building is tidy and bathrooms have been clean on our visits. It's a cool place.\n\nPro tip: Xscape is conveniently located across the street from the Main Event, a huge entertainment center with bowling, billiards, rock climbing and a bunch of other games and activities. It's a cool place to bring a group before catching a flick if you want to spend an afternoon hanging out ahead of the movie.\n\nTicket prices (may vary): $14.50 Monday, Wednesday-Sunday; $9 Tuesday\n\nYou may like:Everything you need to know about the Abbey Road on the River festival\n\n4. Louisville Palace: Best movie theater for date night\n\n625 S. 4th St. Louisville; 502-583-4555; score: 26 points\n\nIf you're looking to impress your date with a memorable movie night, the Louisville Palace is the place to go. From its stunning architecture to its captivating history, the atmosphere here is sure to spark romance.\n\nThe Palace doesn't show movies often and when it does, it tends to feature old Hitchcock flicks like \"Vertigo\" to classic Warner Bros. films like \"Casablanca.\" So if old fashioned isn't your cup of tea, maybe skip this specific outing.\n\nThe movies here are pretty cheap — usually $5 a flick — so you won't go broke, but you may have to pay for downtown parking as it's located in the middle of downtown. One other drawback? The seats don't recline.\n\nPro tip: Dress to the nines (if you're feeling it) and come early to fully take in your surroundings.\n\nTicket prices (may vary): About $5-8 per showing\n\n5. Cinemark Tinseltown: Best seats\n\n4400 Towne Center Drive, Louisville; 502-326-9272; score: 26 points\n\nWe'll get right to the point here — Tinseltown's seats, which are a key part of any movie experience, are the best you'll find in the Louisville area. Plush, modern recliners are in all theaters, with trays — trays! — for your food. No more resting your popcorn on the side of your seat, or saying a quick prayer that no one kicks it over if you rest it on the ground. You reserve your own seat here as well, which is clutch for a group experience.\n\nThe rest of Tinseltown is about what you'd expect from the East End landmark. The food menu has what you're looking for but isn't over the top, the prices are reasonable by movie theater standards (we spent $10 on a Monday night ticket) and there are plenty of showings of all the biggest movies. Nothing over the top, but Tinseltown gets the job done.\n\nPro tip: Tinseltown traditionally brings out a younger crowd, or at least it did during this reporter's teenage years. Plan accordingly.\n\nTicket prices (may vary): $10 Monday, Wednesday, Thursday; $5.50 Tuesday; about $12-13.75 Friday-Sunday\n\nYou may like:Louisville's newest transportation option?

Cinemark Preston Crossing 16: Dine in at this spot\n\n9700 Preston Crossing Blvd., Louisville; 502-961-9700; score: 26 points\n\nNot much differs at this Okolona Cinemark from the Tinseltown location — comfortable seats, food trays, and decent enough prices. You can watch a movie in standard, XD or 3D and the interior is spacious and inviting — what you'd expect from a quality theater.\n\nWhat's notable here is that there is a restaurant located right inside the theater. That's right, this is a one-stop dinner-and-a-movie spot. Plus there's a cute little gift area with plushies, T-shirts and movie collectibles. So bring the kids, unless you don't want to spend more money than you planned.\n\nPro tip: There's a little button on the seats that warms them up. That's right, heated seats!\n\nTicket prices (may vary): $9.50 Monday, Wednesday, Thursday; $5.50 Tuesday; about $12-13.75 Friday-Sunday\n\n7. Village 8: Best value, ticket prices\n\n4014 Dutchmans Lane, Louisville; 502-897-1870; score: 25 points\n\nWhen it comes to an affordable night out, Village 8 is your best bet in the Louisville area. You can catch a flick and a bag of popcorn for well under $10 any night of the week — they even have $2 Tuesdays. And this theater often shows movies you can't catch at another spot in the city.\n\nThe catch? The movies shown at Village 8 have been out for a minute, so if you want to see that new Marvel blockbuster, you'll have to wait a while. Also, the seats aren't very comfortable and the atmosphere is a bit dingy. But if you don't mind a no-frills flick outing, this place is a great choice. Of note, there are no recliners here.\n\nPro tip: Maybe don't see that summer blockbuster here, but keep it in mind for a casual outing.\n\nTicket prices (may vary): $4 Monday, Wednesday, Friday-Sunday; $3 Thursday; $2 Tuesday\n\nYou may like:Forecastle Festival's 2019 Late-Night shows include Chromeo and Moon Taxi\n\n8.AMC Stonybrook: Best theater for a large group\n\n2745 S Hurstbourne Parkway, Louisville; 502-272-4471; score: 24 points\n\nAMC Stonybrook has a big, comfy lobby with plenty of options for food and drinks as the concession area is large and there's a separate spot for the bar. The screens are good and the atmosphere is clean and welcoming. Bringing a large group of family or friends? It's definitely easy at this theater.\n\nAs long as you have a lot of cash. This place isn't exactly affordable. It does have discount nights but you have to pay for an AMC Stubs membership, so unless you are an avid movie-goer, you may want to steer clear. Also, the seats aren't very comfortable, especially now that this generation is spoiled with cozy reclining seats.\n\nPro tip: Bring a large group here but be on the lookout for coupons.\n\nTicket prices (may vary): Around $11 Monday-Thursday; about $12 Friday-Sunday\n\n9. Speed Art Cinema: Most immersive experience\n\n2035 S 3rd St., Louisville; 502-634-2700; score: 24 points\n\nIn case its name didn't spell it out for you, the Speed Art Museum's quaint but colorful theater is for the artsy folks. You're mostly going to find documentaries, biopics and obscure indie movies screened here, but that's why you go. Pair that with the fact that it's in an art museum and this place will have you immersed in culture.\n\nPrices are pretty low too, coming in anywhere from $9 to free on some Sundays, but you will have to pay for parking if you don't live on the University of Louisville campus where it's located. But one perk, if you like a theater-side cocktail, is that you don't have to pay for those overpriced theater drinks or snacks. Of note, no recliners.\n\nPro tip: Invite several people to car pool or split an Uber and avoid parking fees.\n\nYou may like:New Louisville music venue announces its first lineup, led by acts Lucero and Interpol\n\nTicket prices (may vary): Most showings cost around $9; sometimes free on Sunday\n\nSouthern Indiana theaters\n\n10. Regal Cinemas River Falls\n\n951 E Lewis and Clark Parkway, Clarksville, Indiana; 844-462-7342; score: 23 points\n\nThe prices here are a little high, with a Monday night ticket costing about $13, and the old-school seats that don't recline, but if you're in Clarksville with time to kill, River Falls gets the job done. Parking is easy and crowds aren't bad — you shouldn't have to worry about a line for your snacks ahead of the show.\n\nTicket prices (may vary): About $13 every day\n\n11. Regal Cinemas New Albany\n\n300 Professional Court, New Albany, Indiana; 844-462-7342; score: 22 points\n\nLike its Regal Cinemas sister in Clarksville, the New Albany theater also has relatively high ticket prices and older seats that could use a renovation. The rest of the theater is about what you'd expect — it's not a world-class facility, but it'll do if you're not looking to cross the river. The popcorn, oddly enough, was among the best we ate at any of the regional theaters.\n\nTicket prices (may vary): About $13 every day\n\nYou may like:Check out the first 12+ restaurants in Courier Journal's Wine & Food Experience", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/05/22/hangover-part-three-wolfpack/2349717/", "title": "'Hangover' stars blend together like a fine cocktail", "text": "Scott Bowles\n\nUSA TODAY\n\n%27The Hangover%27 series is the highest-grossing R-rated comedy franchise in history\n\n%22I don%27t think I%27ve ever felt as natural in a group as I am with those two%2C%22 says Cooper of Galifianakis and Helms\n\nZach Galifianakis was the first person Cooper called after his father died of cancer in 2011\n\nLAS VEGAS — Ed Helms hoists a massive wooden mallet over his head and stares at Bradley Cooper as if he's going to bash the guy's brains in.\n\n\"What is that?\" a grinning Cooper asks as he and Zach Galifianakis settle into a corner table at the Nobu restaurant at Caesars Palace.\n\n\"It's the hammer of Nobu!\" Helms says of the decorative prop he swiped from a bin. \"I believe I'm supposed to bludgeon you with it.\"\n\nCooper shoots him a mock-stern look. Helms offers a mock-sheepish face and puts the mallet down.\n\nThe Wolfpack isn't all about clowning around.\n\nCertainly, goofball behavior molded the Hangover series into the highest-grossing R-rated comedy franchise in history — with just two movies. And it will be the stirrer that mixes The Hangover Part III (opening Thursday), the final installment of the saga of the Wolfpack, the hapless trio whose Vegas visits are as subtle as a Mike Tyson sock to the jaw.\n\nBut get the comedians together in a room without cameras, fans or onlookers, and they can get downright sincere. To the last man they will say it's not antics that propel Hangover movies. It's affection.\n\n\"Great actors can fake chemistry,\" Cooper says. \"But audiences know when it's really there, and I think that's what people pick up on. We really are friends, off the set as well. If you have that warmth for each other, you get it back from fans.\"\n\nAudiences have been giving plenty back since the franchise launched in 2009: More than $1 billion in box office worldwide, including $532 million from blissfully hung-over U.S. moviegoers. The original film became the biggest R-rated comedy of all time and the third-biggest R-rated film overall, with $277 million. The Hangover Part II took fourth on the all-time list of R movies, with $255 million.\n\nThat leaves a lot riding on the latest outing this Memorial Day weekend, Hollywood's most important outside of Thanksgiving. Hangover III will face the first blockbuster showdown of summer as it competes with Fast & Furious 6 and the animated fantasy Epic.\n\nIf the Wolfpack — the moniker our hard-drinking characters gave themselves four years ago — is nervous about the stiff competition, it takes a backseat to the trio's bigger priority: staying in touch after the film opens.\n\n\"This is a nomadic industry, and you say you'll stay close with people you won't see again for years,\" says Helms, 39. \"But we went through a roller-coaster ride together with these movies, and we became actual friends, no cliche. That doesn't happen often, and you don't want to let it go when it does.\"\n\nWhen the three auditioned in 2008, the comedians knew each other as colleagues who would catch an act or bump into each other at premieres.\n\nThey exchanged obligatory \"we gotta do a movie sometime\" niceties, but it wasn't until an informal table-read in West Los Angeles with director Todd Phillips that the three noticed a spark.\n\nSo did Phillips, who auditioned his actors as a group to measure their chemistry.\n\nNot that he calls it that.\n\n\"I call it anti-chemistry,\" says Phillips, who directed the ensemble comedies Road Trip in 2000 and Old School in 2003.\n\nThe key, Phillips says, \"is finding guys who don't appear to be like each other. Too many comedies have actors whose comedy styles are similar, so it's one note. I like guys whose styles are polar opposites of each other.\"\n\nCooper's Phil would be the cocky ringleader, a partier who enjoys company at his benders. Helms' Stu became the straight man who tends to get tattooed or toothless when he joins said bender.\n\nAnd Galifianakis' Alan provided the outlandish humor, a role he reprised regularly off set, Phillips says.\n\n\"Basically, every Hangover movie has been me and Zach, trying to make each other laugh when the cameras aren't rolling,\" he says. \"Then we put that in the movie.\"\n\nThose barb sessions would make up the backbone of the first Hangover, whose original plot did not include what would become iconic gags of the series: a tiger that appears in their Vegas bathroom; a punch from Mike Tyson using Galifianakis' face as a flesh drum to keep rhythm to Phil Collins' In The Air Tonight; an abandoned baby strapped perilously to Galifianakis' belly.\n\n\"The structure of the film was there before Todd came on, but it wasn't as imaginative,\" Helms says of the original script. \"But when we all came on, all bets were off. There wasn't a scene we wouldn't try.\"\n\nThough there were scenarios they nearly couldn't pull off, including the emergency room setting in which the actors said they formed their tightest bond.\n\nThe scene, which called for the Wolfpack (and baby) to watch an elderly man drop his drawers, took more than a dozen takes as the actors kept cracking up. \"I'm not sure how we ever got through it,\" says Cooper, 38. \"But we were in hysterics. We knew we got each other.\"\n\nThey get in deeper water than ever the third time around, as they try to track down the unscrupulous drug dealer Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) and face an international assassin in John Goodman.\n\nBut the approach to the franchise remained the same, Phillips says. \"You set up a camera and let them be the Wolfpack, because they're kind of a real one, with as much heart.\"\n\nOccasionally to the (unintentional) exclusion of co-stars, Cooper concedes.\n\n\"I love everyone we work with, but it's different,\" he says. \"I don't think I've ever felt as natural in a group as I am with those two. I can just turn my brain off and be myself.\"\n\nCooper pauses and gets more serious. When his father died of cancer in 2011, \"Zach was the first person I called,\" he says. \"We went from co-workers to friends a long time ago.\"\n\n\"People like us to act like the characters in the movie, and I get that,\" adds Galifianakis, 43. \"But that really isn't our personality, other than enjoying hanging out together.\"\n\nNot that the group won't party during the farewell. The trio will hit an international circuit of premieres in London, Paris and Rio.\n\n\"That's when we'll get to say our goodbyes, at least on these movies,\" Galifianakis. \"Rio could be wild.\"\n\nHelms chimes in: \"If we don't break down sobbing.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/05/22"}]}

Here are 12 of the most anticipated roller coasters of 2023:\n\nMaking waves:SeaWorld debuting 3 groundbreaking new roller coasters this year\n\nWhat's new:Cedar Point, Knott's Berry Farm among parks debuting upgrades in 2023\n\nAquaman: Power Wave at Six Flags Over Texas\n\nNow open.\n\nLocation: Arlington, Texas.\n\nDescription: Riders are launched forward and backward on what Six Flags Over Texas calls the \"first ride-of-its-kind\" in North America, with a 90-degree dive into a \"massive splashdown.\"\n\nSpeed: Up to 63 mph.\n\nMinimum height: 48 inches.\n\nPerry likened Aquaman: Power Wave to riding a big boat on a roller coaster track. \"You get propelled backward up an incline, and then you go forward up an incline, and then you come back and go even higher, and then the pool at the bottom, when you pass it that last time, valves open and immediately fill with more water so when you come back down, you hit the water and there's this huge splash,\" he said. \"It's a cool combination of a roller coaster and a water ride.\"\n\nArctic Rescue at SeaWorld San Diego\n\nOpening: Spring.\n\nLocation: San Diego.\n\nDescription: Guests have to hurry to save Arctic animals from poachers as ice melts on Arctic Rescue, which SeaWorld calls the \"fastest and longest straddle coaster on the West Coast.\" It will feature 2,800 feet of track and three launches.\n\nSpeed: 40 mph.\n\nMinimum height: Unlisted.\n\n\"I'm excited about that,\" Perry said. \"I can't believe how many coasters SeaWorld San Diego has received in the past five years or so ... They just opened Emperor last year, so to follow it up with another new coaster this year, it's pretty unbelievable.\"\n\nBig Bear Mountain at Dollywood\n\nOpening: May.\n\nLocation: Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.\n\nDescription: With 3,990 feet of track, Big Bear Mountain will be the longest roller coaster at Dollywood and also the park's first featuring onboard audio.\n\nSpeed: Up to 48 mph.\n\nMinimum height: 39 inches.\n\n\"They're promoting it kind of as a family thrill attraction, but (with) the length of the track and what it does, I think it's going to appeal to kids up until thrill seekers,\" Perry said.\n\nHe had a chance to check out the ride cars at the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions convention last year and praised their detail and theming. \"It's probably going to end up being my favorite roller coaster at the park.\"\n\n'I Will Always Love You':Dollywood celebrates 50 years of iconic song with star-studded concert series\n\nCatapult Falls at SeaWorld San Antonio\n\nOpening: Summer.\n\nLocation: San Antonio.\n\nDescription: Expect to get wet on the world's steepest and first launched flume coaster, which SeaWorld says will give riders \"the rush of a coaster while experiencing the rocking and swaying of riding on a track of water.\" The ride will also feature \"the only vertical lift in North America,\" rising seven feet per second.\n\nSpeed: Over 37 mph.\n\nMinimum height: Undisclosed.\n\nFlume coasters can be a subject of debate for coaster fans who tally their rides.\n\n\"Is that going to count as a water ride or as a roller coaster or both?\" Perry asked. \"People aren't sure yet, but it looks like it will be awesome to be propelled forward on a water ride. It's definitely unique.\"\n\nDarKoaster at Busch Gardens Williamsburg\n\nOpening: Spring.\n\nLocation: Williamsburg, Virginia.\n\nDescription: Boarding snowmobiles to investigate unusual weather patterns near a cursed castle, brave riders may find they're not alone as they race through the dark on North America's first all-indoor straddle coaster, featuring four launches.\n\nSpeed: Unlisted.\n\nMinimum height: 48 inches.\n\nDarKoaster will be housed in Busch Garden Williamsburg's Curse of DarKastle building and pay subtle homage to its previous ride, according to the park. All indoor rides can face spatial limitations, but Perry said in DarKoaster, \"You're going to go around the track twice. There's a switch track, and so they're going to change the lighting, and they said it's going to be very different between the first time you go around and the second time you go around to tell the story.\" The ride has over 1,400 feet of track, but that switch will allow riders to experience 2,454 feet of track.\n\nKid Flash Cosmic Coaster at Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags Fiesta Texas\n\nOpening: Summer.\n\nLocations: Austell, Georgia, and San Antonio.\n\nDescription: Guests can race against each other on dueling twin tracks, which cross over a dozen times \"like a twisted bowl of spaghetti,\" according to Six Flags. The tracks themselves are single-rail.\n\nSpeed: Undisclosed, but the park ranks the thrill level as \"mild.\"\n\nMinimum height: 36 inches.\n\n\"Families and friends are going to have a blast racing,\" Perry said, noting the repeat ride-ability with varying outcomes. These will be the first racing coasters in Georgia and Texas, but Perry said their most unique feature will be LED panels lining each track, which can change color. \"This is the first time that anything like this has been created for a roller coaster, and theme park fans are super excited to see this come to life.\"\n\nPipeline: The Surf Coaster at SeaWorld Orlando\n\nOpening: Spring.\n\nLocation: Orlando, Florida.\n\nDescription: Guests can hang much more than 10 on this \"first-of-its-kind\" coaster\" featuring an \"inventive harness that keeps you secure while giving you unparalleled freedom of movement,\" according to SeaWorld Orlando.\n\nSpeed: Up to 60 mph.\n\nMinimum height: 54 inches.\n\n\"Coaster enthusiasts are psyched for Pipeline,\" Perry said \"It's a new ride design that they haven't experienced before ... The ride apparatus actually is going to kind of bounce up and down like you're riding a wave. And this is also the first launched stand-up coaster that has ever been built.\"\n\nHe noted many ride manufacturers seem to have shifted away from building stand-up coasters. \"This hopefully will be super popular, and there will be a resurgence of stand-up coasters.\"\n\nPrimordial at Lagoon\n\nOpening: Undisclosed 2023.\n\nLocation: Farmington, Utah.\n\nDescription: The park says details and images will be released as the ride, now under construction, gets closer to opening.\n\nSpeed: Undisclosed.\n\nMinimum height: Undisclosed.\n\n\"They haven't released too many details ... so that's building the anticipation,\" Perry said. \"They built some kind of mountain, so you can see the mountain, and then you see this one section of outdoor track. So coaster enthusiasts are really like, 'What's inside?' \"\n\nTRON Lightcycle / Run at Walt Disney World\n\nOpening: April 4.\n\nLocation: Near Orlando, Florida.\n\nDescription: TRON Lightcycle / Run invites guests to enter the Grid and race against personified computer Programs in futuristic Lightcycle vehicles, just like in the \"Tron\" and \"Tron: Legacy\" films and TRON arcade game.\n\nSpeed: Undisclosed but Disney calls it \"one of the fastest coasters at any Disney theme park.\"\n\nMinimum height: 48 inches.\n\n\"Coaster enthusiasts who have been riding it have just been blown away,\" Perry said. \"They love the whole look, the futuristic look of everything, how it's all weaved together with music from Daft Punk from the movie and pulling in the different futuristic themes. There are so many things to look at on the ride, you want to go on it definitely multiple times if possible.\"\n\nWhile the ride officially opens to the public next month, it's been open for cast members, annual pass members, and other special previews for a few weeks. When Perry got to ride it, he said he got chills.\n\n\"With TRON Lightcycle / Run, you are merged in that video game, like you're on the Grid. You were digitized and you're part of it, and it doesn't seem like you're in Florida anymore,\" he said. \"It's almost like being in a dream or something.\"\n\nDoes Disney have military discounts?:Yes, and so do these popular theme parks\n\nWild Mouse at Cedar Point\n\nOpening: May.\n\nLocation: Sandusky, Ohio.\n\nDescription: Guests chase after cheese in six mouse-themed cars and one cheese-themed car on this all-new coaster, which throws back to Cedar Point's original Wild Mouse ride. Because the number of riders in each car can change how it spins now, the park says \"no two rides will be the same.\"\n\nSpeed: 35 mph.\n\nMinimum height: 42 inches with a supervising companion or 48 inches solo.\n\n\"It's going to be a great family addition to the park,\" Perry said.\n\nCedar Point is known for its coasters, and Wild Mouse will be its 18th. \"There are all these roller coasters that go over 200, 300 feet tall,\" he said. \"This is an awesome addition where the people who don't want to go that high can still enjoy the roller coaster.\"\n\nWildcat's Revenge at Hersheypark\n\nOpening: Summer.\n\nLocation: Hershey, Pennsylvania.\n\nDescription: This new steel and wood hybrid roller coaster plunges riders down an 82-degree drop and features four inversions and the \"world's largest underflip.\"\n\nSpeed: Up to 62 mph.\n\nMinimum height: 48 inches.\n\n\"Some coaster enthusiasts were definitely upset that (its predecessor) Wildcat was closing, this traditional wooden coaster,\" Perry said. But the new ride incorporates several nods to the original.\n\n\"They took some of the wooden structure and then (add) the all-steel track,\" he said. \"The ride got a little rough in later years, so this is perfect.\"\n\nHe also complimented the train car design. \"There's a wildcat coming out of the front of the train, so it's going to be eye-catching. And then it's the world's largest underflip, the inversion spin that they're going for,\" he said. \"People can't wait.\"\n\nZambezi Zinger at Worlds of Fun\n\nOpening: Undisclosed 2023.\n\nLocation: Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nDescription: The tallest point on this new hybrid wood and steel coaster stands 17 feet higher than the park's original Zinger. Zambezi Zinger also features a new African safari theme and side-by-side seating, instead of toboggan-style seats.\n\nSpeed: 45 mph.\n\nMinimum height: Unlisted.\n\n\"They're going to use some of the elements from the old coaster like a spiral lift hill and some tunnels and stuff,\" Perry said, which he added makes fans wonder, \"'What is this going to be like, how close to the old coaster is this going to be, and what are they going to bring to it?' \"\n\nEve Chen is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in Georgia.

Last year, they rode every new coaster that opened across the U.S. and hope to do the same this year.\n\n\"I know, it's an obsession,\" Derek laughed. \"People think, 'What's wrong with you?' But it makes me so happy.\" And they aren't alone.\n\n'A really exciting time':12 of the most anticipated new roller coasters opening in 2023\n\nAre theme park rides safe?What you should know if you're worried about accidents\n\nEarly memories\n\n\"I remember one time being a kid, there was an amusement park book, and our mom would read us pages from it like as a bedtime story,\" Derek said with a smile. He still loves park statistics. \"We just retained all this information.\"\n\n\"Then I remember I was talking to my mom one day about EPCOT and the different countries that have (pavilions), and she was like, 'If you focused this much on your school work, you'd be getting straight A's,' \" he added. \"But my passion was theme parks.\"\n\nTurning point\n\nThe brothers vividly recall their first \"big rides\" at around age 10. They were at Six Flags Great Adventure, the first stop of theme park road trip, which also included Hershey Park, Kings Dominion and Busch Gardens Williamsburg.\n\n\"We're looking at these big rollercoasters, and we're thinking, 'We don't want to go on, and we're too scared to go on.' Do you remember?\" Derek said, turning to Doug, who immediately agreed. \"And our parents said, 'Well, if you're not going to ride the big rides, we can just go to museums for the rest of the trip.' \"\n\n\"They're not going to spend all this money going to these theme parks,\" Doug chimed in. Even back then, tickets weren't cheap, but nowadays, the starting price for daily park admission ranges from $39.99 at Kings Dominion, with its Early Days Deal, to $109 at Universal Studios Hollywood.\n\n\"And we're kids,\" Doug said. \"We don't want to spend our summer vacation in museums, so that forced us on the rides. And as soon as we did go on the big rides, we fell in love.\"\n\nBeing a kid again\n\n\"When you're on a coaster, for me, I'm not thinking about anything else. All my cares from the world, from the day, they go away, and I'm just living in the moment, which is hard to do nowadays,\" Derek said. \"For theme parks, same thing. It reminds me of being a kid and just being blissful and happy.\"\n\n\"I feel exactly the same way, and I just love that fake fantasy world and just the themes,\" Doug chuckled. \"It's an escape.\"\n\nDream jobs\n\nWhen the brothers were 16, they got jobs at Rocky Point Park, a Rhode Island amusement park that opened in the 1840s and shuttered in the 1990s.\n\n\"We just loved being in the park and you know, we would do anything,\" Derek said. The jobs included operating games and giving guests temporary tattoos. \"And we would ride as much as possible, even if we weren't supposed to.\"\n\nHe said one rainy day with low attendance, they rode the Corkscrew roller coaster, their first upside-down roller coaster, over 30 times in a row. \"Surprisingly, we didn't get sick,\" he said. \"We just had the time of our lives.\"\n\nThey began traveling on their own for coasters in college and got really into it after moving from Rhode Island to California.\n\nReal jobs\n\nNowadays, Derek and Doug are DJs and music producers. \"I'm thinking about music and coasters all the time,\" Derek said. Whenever they travel to new cities for gigs, they try to ride roller coasters nearby.\n\nThey'd hoped to ride Dr. Diabolical’s Cliffhanger, which is billed as the \"world's steepest dive coaster,\" when they DJed at Six Flags Fiesta Texas' Pride event last June, but it wasn't open yet.\n\n\"We did go back,\" Derek laughed. \"It was the end of October, and Doug was like, 'You know we've been on pretty much every new roller coaster that opened this year. We haven't been on Dr. Diabolical. It's a shame we can't get on it.' So for our birthday, we planned a trip to go ride Dr. Diabolical.\" They did wind up riding every new coaster in the U.S. last year, making special trips for most of them.\n\nPark tipsHow can I get the most out of my Disneyland trip?

Doug has ridden over 1,100.\n\n\"For Derek, there's no coaster too small. He will travel – and we have – hours and hours out of our way for some kiddie coaster that's considered a (coaster) credit because he counts all his coasters,\" Doug said with a laugh.\n\n\"If I fit, I sit; like a cat in a box,\" Derek laughed. \"If I'm going to a kiddie coaster in South Dakota and I've never been to South Dakota, it forces me to go out and see this area of the country I haven't been to.\"\n\nSome roller coasters are the destination. Others are detours.\n\nCoaster community\n\nThe brothers aren't the only ones willing to go the distance. American Coaster Enthusiasts describes itself as the \"world's largest club of amusement ride enthusiasts,\" and many members are willing to travel for their shared love.\n\nDerek serves as the group's communications director. Doug joked that he's Derek's assistant, but he really helps with ACE's social media and other areas. \"It's like a full-time job, but it's all volunteer,\" he said.\n\nDerek and Doug have met some of their closest friends through ACE events, which include exclusive ride times on attractions before or after theme parks open to the public.\n\n\"It's like a dream come true being at a park when there aren't lines, and you can just sit on a roller coaster and go on it over and over and over and try all the different seats,\" Derek said, joking that their early Rocky Point days prepared them for that.\n\nFavorite roller coasters\n\nDerek says his favorite roller coaster is \"always the roller coaster that I'm currently riding,\" but noted appreciation for traditional coasters like Leap-the-Dips, which Lakemont Park bills as the \"oldest wooden roller coaster in the world,\" and newer ones like VelociCoaster at Universal Orlando Resort.\n\n\"Maybe Derek's are off the record,\" Doug laughed. \"I have so many.\" Doug's favorites include Superman at Six Flags New England, Iron Gwazi at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, X2 at Six Flags Magic Mountain and Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland just outside Toronto.\n\n\"For me, Hershey Park has the best collection of roller coasters, and now they're getting a new roller coaster this year,\" he added. \"Busch Gardens Williamsburg is my favorite park overall. I have so many memories there.\"\n\nDoes Disney have military discounts?Yes, and so do these popular theme parks\n\nWhat's new at Dollywood:Big Bear Mountain coaster and much more\n\nMaking the most of it\n\n\"Unfortunately, our parents don't travel with us anymore because our dad had a stroke a few years ago,\" Doug said. The summer before the stroke, they got in one last big road trip all together with visits to Six Flags St. Louis, Silver Dollar City and Hershey Park.\n\n\"After our dad had his stroke, for me, it's kind of like I don't want to miss any opportunity because I never know when I won't be able to do something,\" Derek said. \"So even though I might not want to travel those two hours to go to that little coaster or get up at four in the morning and go to a roller coaster, I just do it because I know I'm going to make such good memories.\"\n\nNow the brothers FaceTime or call their parents from parks. \"It's like they're there as much as they can be, but it brings back like all the memories of being a kid,\" Derek said. \"But yeah, our mom loves roller coasters, and I feel like she lives vicariously now, through what we're doing.\"\n\nAnd \"we do have our coaster enthusiast friends now to go on these big epic trips with,\" Doug added.\n\nRoller coaster tips", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/theme-parks/2022/11/03/hersheypark-wildcats-revenge-hybrid-coaster-2023/8258281001/", "title": "New hybrid roller coaster with 'world's largest underflip' coming to ...", "text": "YORK, Pa. – Roller coaster fans will see a new hybrid coaster made of steel and wood at Pennsylvania's Hersheypark next summer, the company announced Wednesday.\n\nWildcat's Revenge will be custom-built and located in the Midway America area of the park.

Built in 1929, The Dragon Coaster, is one of the last roller coaster rides built by famed engineer Frederick Church that is still operating. (Look closely and you can catch a glimpse of it in Mariah Carey’s 1995 music video “Fantasy.”) The park’s 104-year-old carousel is another attraction, with a rare band organ built by the Gavioli company in Italy.\n\nModern marvels: There’s plenty to opt for, from the Double-Shot Log Flume and Super Flight to Wipeout and the Park features mini-golf, a boardwalk, Olympic-sized pool and a guarded beach.\n\nDetails: 1 Playland Parkway, Rye, New York.

On Seaside Heights’s Casino Pier the storm sent the Jet Star rollercoaster into the ocean, but the pier now is home to the blue and neon green Hydrus, a German-made Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter model coaster, and a 131-foot Ferris Wheel that lights up at night and gives riders views of both land and sea.\n\nWhat to expect this summer: The return of Centrifuge, a scrambler-style ride also lost to the storm, and the addition of Elephant Express, a flying elephant ride; the Mermaid Parade log flume, which features 130 feet of water track, and Crazy Cabs, a spinning ride.\n\nOn the south end of the boardwalk in Seaside Park, a few small rides and games have popped up in place of Funtown Pier, which was known for its kiddie rides, and Carousel Arcade.

While there is plenty of chocolate here, it's not quite the movie scene in your head. Even so, it's still a blast. Dating back to 1906, it's been home to roller coasters since 1923, currently boasting 14 different coasters ranging from rides for kids to white-knuckle experiences for the older crowd. There are shows, games, an 11-acre zoo and Hershey's Chocolate World, a 30-minute tour that reveals how cocoa beans are made into the classic American snack. And, yes, you get to sample the goods.

When opened in 1907, it was among nearly 20 amusement parks in the region. Now it's the only one, and honors its origins with details such as a Victorian Main Street. While grownups might like the nostalgia, kids will just care about the fun stuff — and there's plenty of it, from a Ferris wheel and carousel to a water park with a 23,000-square-foot wave pool, lazy river and free-fall slides. The Big Wave Bay water park also hosts \"Dive-In Movie\" events throughout the summer.

From June 1 to June 21, the park is open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Friday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday and Sunday; beginning June 22, weekend hours are 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. until Labor Day. 856-208-6440 diggerlandusa.com/ — Tammy Paolino, Courier Post, tpaolino@gannett.com\n\nSesame Place, Langhorne, Pennsylvania\n\nWhy you should visit: Sesame Place, as the only theme park in the United States based entirely on the PBS series \"Sesame Street,\" has the kid-centric vibe you'd expect. Rides and attractions are modeled after \"Sesame Street\" characters and children can interact with costumed characters, watch stage shows and parades. Rides are geared for the youngest patrons, though there are also two mild rollercoasters, including Oscar’s Wacky Water Taxi, which opened in 2018. A variety of family-friendly water rides provides more all-ages fun. Inclusivity is a priority: Sesame Place was the first theme park in the world to earn the designation of Certified Autism Center by the International Board of Credentialing and Continued Education Standards.\n\nWhat's new: Snuffy is here! Mr. Snuffleupagus, Big Bird's friend, will be shuffling through the park all season. The \"Sesame Street\" neighborhood has been updated to reflect the new set on the TV series. New photo op stations will commemorate the 50th anniversary this year of \"Sesame Street.\"\n\nDetails: 100 Sesame Road, Langhorne, Pennsylvania. Opens at 10 a.m. daily through Labor Day.

It’s the new amusement park, the exciting cousin to old Coney Island. It is THE place to be every summer.\n\nTime slips away to riding on the Beast over and over, testing whether the front car or back car has the most exciting trip. Being wholly invested in which train is faster on the Racer – go Red Racer! – or sharing Smurf blue ice cream with a special someone. Every generation has its own Kings Island memories.\n\nThe park was a game-changer for Cincinnati, drawing visitors from all over the Midwest. Even the Brady Bunch came to town.\n\nKings Island will reopen for its 50th anniversary season on April 16, so folks can revisit their favorites and make new memories. A daylong celebration is planned for April 29, the date that the park opened for previews back in 1972. Kings Island’s “Golden Celebration” events will begin May 28.\n\nKings Island:11 original rides, attractions still on track\n\nFrom Coney Island to Kings Island\n\nAnything you want to know about Kings Island? It’s probably found in Evan Ponstingle’s thorough history on the subject in “Kings Island: A Ride through Time.” He interviewed just about every principal figure in the creation and development of the park to get the inside scoop.\n\nAs Ponstingle lays it out, the origin of Kings Island was the convergence of two ideas at the right time. In the late 1960s, Gary Wachs, son of Coney Island owner Ralph Wachs, was tired of cleaning up the park after the frequent flooding. He dreamed of ways to move and expand old Coney to rival Disneyland and drew up a plan.\n\nCharlie Mechem, then the CEO of Cincinnati-based Taft Broadcasting, had his own idea. The company could promote its Hanna-Barbera cartoon characters in amusement parks, using Disney as a roadmap. He had lunch with Roy Disney, who told him, “You have the finest small amusement park in America right in your backyard, Coney Island!” Go see about working with them, he suggested.\n\nKentucky’s answer to Disneyland:Frontier Worlds theme park lost to Kings Island\n\n50 years ago:Remembering old Coney Island\n\nSo, in 1969, Taft and Coney Island announced they were building a new amusement park in Warren County. Taft also purchased Coney for $6.5 million in stock. The old park was to close in 1971, with the new one slated to be ready the year after. The name Kings Island was a tribute to both the location, Kings Mills, and the park’s predecessor, Coney Island.\n\nLousy weather for the opening\n\nAs general manager of the new park, Gary Wachs was in charge of making his idea a reality. He had adapted Disneyland’s hub-and-spoke design into a cloverleaf, with four main \"lands\": a children’s area, a historic area celebrating Cincinnati’s river heritage, a Coney Island tribute and a European boulevard. That was pretty close to the finished park.\n\nKings Island opened on time, with a price tag of $31 million (that's $214 million adjusted for inflation into 2022 dollars). Critics questioned whether anyone would pay six dollars to get into the park when Coney Island had been free. To make it worse, a preview opening on April 29, 1972, was dampened by heavy rains.\n\n“Nearly everyone did agree that the park is big and beautiful, with lots of potential,” wrote The Enquirer’s Jim Knippenberg. “And everyone agreed that the weather was lousy. Certainly no kind of a day to open a new amusement park.”\n\nThe official grand opening on May 27 – with sunshine, parades and hot air balloons – was better received.\n\n“I was blown away,” said Don Helbig, now the area manager of digital marketing for Kings Island. “When I first walked in, the first memories, you saw the fountain and you saw the buildings going down International Street, the Eiffel Tower, you had the Sky Ride going across in front of it. … As you walked through the front gate, because you couldn’t see it from the outside, it was like you entered a whole new world.”\n\nThree Fs dominate map of the park\n\nThe one-third replica of the Eiffel Tower, standing 314 feet tall, was the eye-catching centerpiece of International Street. The boulevard was inspired by Wachs’ trip to Europe and featured what he called the “three Fs”: flags, flowers and fountains.\n\nThe Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera was a place for kids to meet their favorite TV cartoon characters, Scooby-Doo, Yogi Bear and Fred Flintstone. Even better, they could go into the TV on the Enchanted Voyage, a boat ride similar to It’s a Small World, where they passed through an animated world. Parents were just glad to have air-conditioned relief from the summer heat.\n\nOur History:Top 10 retired Kings Island rides we miss the most\n\nRivertown, the homage to Ohio history, featured the timeless Kings Island & Miami Valley Railroad and the Kings Mills Log Flume (which still exists as Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown).\n\nThe Oktoberfest area had its own teacup ride with a Germanic twist – Der Spinnen Keggers, aka the drunken barrels.\n\nWhen Coney Island closed in 1971, most of the rides like the Grand Carousel, Cuddle Up and Tumble Bug were packed up and transported up the highway to the aptly named Old Coney section of Kings Island. So were the midway games. The popular Shooting Star wooden roller coaster was not, though. Wachs decided to build something new.\n\nKings Island set the trends\n\nWachs hired venerable coaster designer John C. Allen of the Philadelphia Toboggan Co. to build a side-by-side racing roller coaster they called the Racer. Red and blue trains raced on twin tracks, up and down hills. “There’s been a lot of sensation built into this ride,” Allen told The Enquirer at the time. “We think this is the finest coaster ever built, one of the largest ever built, and certainly the largest we ever built.”\n\nThe Racer was the first large-scale coaster built since 1947, and is credited with reigniting the roller coaster renaissance in the 1970s. It made history again in 1982 when one of the trains was reversed and became the first roller coaster to ride backward. (Both trains started going forward again in 2008.)\n\nAnother feather in Kings Island’s cap: it was the first amusement park to sell pizza. Really. Gregg Pancero and his father, Jack, handled the pizza concessions at La Fiera Pizzeria on International Street, selling sauce, dough and toppings provided by family friend Buddy LaRosa. The popularity of the pie set a new trend for amusement parks and the shop became an official LaRosa’s franchise.\n\nBut it wasn’t cheap. “A modest slice with pepperoni is an outrageous 55 cents, and a whole cheese pizza is $3.60,” the Dayton Daily News complained in 1973.\n\nPartridges, Bradys and Evel Knievel\n\nMore than 2 million people visited Kings Island in its first season, which was double Coney Island’s attendance in its final year.\n\nIt helped that Taft Broadcasting used its Hollywood connections to promote the park beyond Cincinnati. Most folks remember when “The Brady Bunch” filmed an episode on location in 1973, with the Brady kids riding on the Racer and cutting in line (those weren’t extras in the show, just guests at Kings Island for the day). But “The Partridge Family” beat the Bradys to it. Teen heartthrob David Cassidy and his costars filmed at Kings Island in August 1972.\n\nDennis Spiegel, the assistant general manager when Kings Island first opened, told Ponstingle he had received a call from someone at WKRC-TV asking if his son could come see the filming. “This little guy was 10 years old, I think, at the time,” Spiegel said. “It was George Clooney! He was running around, getting into everything, messing around.”\n\nThat death-defying daredevil Evel Knievel came to Kings Island to perform his most successful jump in 1975. He rode his motorcycle down a launch ramp and soared over 14 Greyhound buses, which got the highest ratings on “ABC’s Wide World of Sports.”\n\nHere comes the Beast\n\nWhat really put Kings Island on the amusement park map was the arrival of the Beast, the “biggest, baddest, longest, fastest coaster in the world,” in 1979. John Allen, the coaster designer, had retired by then, but he scribbled formulas on the back of a menu for Kings Island engineers Al Collins and Jeff Gramke to design it themselves.\n\n“It was very labor-intensive,” Gramke said. “There were no scientific calculators, no computers. Everything had to be calculated by hand. It didn’t take long to see why John didn’t want to do it.”\n\nThey designed the 7,359-foot-long wooden coaster track to interact with the wooded terrain. The tunnels were added because the track needed to go underground for a bit on a dip so the structure didn’t have to be built so tall. The double helixes at the end were to use up the energy accumulated from the two lifts.\n\nThe Beast attracts attention from roller coaster enthusiasts all over the world. Even with the loops and thrills of newer rides, such as the giga coaster Orion, the Beast is still the standard. The track is undergoing refurbishment to make the ride smoother in time for the park’s 50th birthday celebration.\n\nFifty years isn’t what it used to be, a link to a bygone age. Things from 50 years ago don’t seem that old. But a golden anniversary is still a milestone for a park that has created so many memories for so many people.\n\n“I’ve always said, we don’t make hubcaps or bottle caps,” Spiegel said about his years at Kings Island. “What do we do? We don’t pollute the skies, we don’t put pollution in the rivers. What do we do at the end of the day? We make smiles and memories, put smiles on people’s faces.”\n\nAdditional sources: Enquirer archive, visitingkingsisland.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/09/06/cedar-point-closing-top-thrill-dragster-ride-to-be-reimagined/65474805007/", "title": "Cedar Point closing Top Thrill Dragster; ride to be 'reimagined'", "text": "It was once the tallest roller coaster in the world.\n\nAnd some 19 years and a troubled past later, Cedar Point is retiring the famed Top Thrill Dragster.\n\nThe ride that dominates the Sandusky park's skyline has sat idle since a tragic mishap last August severely injured a park customer.

They found loose bolts, signs of wear, deformation, and impact marks on train cars and sections of track over the spot where a metal plate broke from the ride and fell.\n\nThe piece of metal described as about the size of \"a man's hand\" struck the woman Aug. 15, 2021. The accident left 44-year-old Michigan resident Rachel Hawes in intensive care with a brain injury, the family said in a statement after the accident.\n\nTop Thrill Dragster investigation\n\nThe Ohio Department of Agriculture — charged with the inspection of amusement rides — found in its February report that Cedar Point had no knowledge that the ride was in an unsafe condition the day of the accident.\n\nState investigation:Cedar Point cleared in Top Thrill accident investigation.\n\nThe plate that dislodged was attached by bolts and was supposed to hover just over the track and a series of sensors that kept tabs on the coaster as it made its way at breakneck speed up and over a 420-foot-tall hill in 17 seconds.\n\nBefore the mishap, some 18 million guests rode the ride, which sent riders in the air at a speed of 120 miles per hour in just 3.8 seconds.\n\nWhen it opened in 2003, Top Thrill Dragster was the tallest and fastest coaster in the world, but those records were surpassed in 2005 by the Kingda Ka coaster at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey. It also boasted faux Goodyear Tires when it first opened.\n\nPast Top Thrill Dragster incidents\n\nFrom the start, the coaster was plagued by issues that led to its frequent closings as the park grappled with its complicated and temperamental hydraulic system.\n\nRiders were injured in a pair of previous mishaps on the coaster.

It even had a set of bleachers where onlookers could watch it run.\n\nCedar Point's future\n\nIn its announcement on social media Monday morning, Cedar Point said the ride \"as you know it is being retired.\"\n\nThe park said an announcement will be made later of a new and \"reimagined\" ride experience.\n\nWhile the Top Thrill will be gone at the start of the 2023 season and its apparent replacement remains in limbo, there will be a new coaster at the park next summer.

Ensslin\n\nNorthJersey\n\nThree bulldozers revved up on a snow-covered field alongside the Cyclone, the legendary ride that for 40 years had been of the main attractions of Palisades Amusement Park. The Record photographer Gordon Corbett captured the scene on Feb. 8, 1972 as within a few minutes the wood-frame roller coaster came crashing down in a cloud of splinters and dust.\n\nStanding nearby was a man in a long tan trench coat and a hard hat. His name was John Rinaldi, who had been the amusement park’s superintendent and general manager a job he had held since 1963. His late father Joseph had held the job before him.\n\nIn an odd twist of fate, John Rinaldi had been hired by the construction company that had the contract to tear down the cyclone. His son, John Rinaldi, says he has seen other pictures of his dad that day.\n\n“There’s a picture of my dad…with an expression on his face,” the son recalls. “I could see the tears, but I don’t know that it was actually in the pictures.”\n\nInsider deals:Save on tickets to parks and zoos\n\nInsider savings:Take A Trip To Disney World\n\nThat day marked the end of what historian Vince Gargiulo would later call “a century of fun” in the 34-acre amusement park that straddled the Cliffside Park and Fort Lee border atop the Palisades. The park — which was still attracting more than 6 million visitors each summer — fell victim to real estate value and changes to local zoning laws.\n\nStory continues after the gallery.\n\nThe beginning of the end was sounded in January 1971 when newspapers reported that Irving Rosenthal, the owner and operator of the park, was negotiating with Centex Corporation, a Texas company that had offered $12.5 million for the land with a plan to build up to 4,000 high-rise apartments on the site.\n\n“I just want to get my estates in order,” said Rosenthal, a 73-years-old millionaire who had started his empire with his late brother Jack as kids selling pails and shovels to visitors to Coney Island. He promised the public one last grand summer.\n\n“I'll still maintain and operate the park,” he said. “I am here every day of the week. I have my maintenance and carpenters out right now. The public can be assured that Palisades\n\nAmusement Park will have its biggest and best season in history.”\n\nElephants on water skis\n\nAs a recent Cliffside Park High School graduate, then 17-year-old Gargiulo read the news of the park’s pending demise with a fair amount of skepticism. “I couldn’t imagine my amusement park being gone,” says Gargiulo, a Mahwah resident who is director of the Palisades Amusement Historical Society.\n\nThere had been rumors ever since the property was rezoned in 1967 that each summer might be the last for park, he says. But he wrote off this latest report as just another publicity stunt. After all, he says, this was the same park that once famously staged a circus elephant water-skiing across the Hudson River on a pontoon drawn by a motor boat.\n\nGargiulo, who grew up about two blocks from the park, says, \"Palisades was my playground. I could walk there. I could take my bike there. We could sneak in by the hole in the fence that nobody knew about except me and my close friends. So it was a huge part of my growing up.”\n\nThat hole in the fence, however, was no accident. John Rinaldi says Rosenthal knew of the gap and left it alone. He figured the 10-cent admission fee that neighborhood kids were trying to avoid would be spent many times over on rides, ice cream and other attractions. Besides, Rosenthal was a stickler for keeping the park groomed, painted and maintain right up until the end. Rinaldi says that even at age 73, the short, grey-haired park owner would be out on the mid-way each day, making his rounds. He would demand that every burnt-out lightbulb be replaced. And while he was a millionaire with a home on Fifth Avenue in New York City, he still would pick up stray hot dog wrappers, according to Rinaldi.\n\nRinaldi grew up in the park. He went everywhere from the bottom of the salt water pool with its wave machine to the top of the cyclone. There is a publicity photo taken of Rinaldi and his dad in the spring of 1968 with the youngster looking over plans for new rides that his dad is holding. Fifty years later, the son still has a piece of one of those rides, a fully restored German-made mini hot rod that was once part of the Tunnel of Love ride later renamed Casper’s Ghostland.\n\nThe spring of 1971 arrived just like any other. A story in The Record described how John Rinaldi Sr. was busy overseeing his year-round work crew as they spruce up the park for what would be its final season.\n\nOn opening day, a woman rolled her baby carriage up to the entrance. It was in many respects a typical summer. In May, kids from local elementary schools would hike to a free day at the park. And on summer nights after the crowds were gone, Rinaldi remembers how the people who worked at the park would congregate on the beach at the swimming pool. There was a country music talent show in August. And the grand final of the Miss American Teenager competition in September.\n\nBut things were not as they always were. Among residents who lived near the park, there was a rising chorus of complaints about traffic jams and abusive park patrons who parked in front of their homes. “It was not a pleasant time for many of the people who lived very close to the park,” Gargiulo recalls. “While in retrospect, nobody wanted to see the park go, I think at that point in time, many of the residents of the area did want to see it go.”\n\nRinaldi also remembers an influx of people who seemed more intent on causing trouble than having fun. \"It got to the point where there was a lot of fighting,\" says Rinaldi, remembering one man who had a cane from which he pulled out a sword. When trouble did happen, the park had a coded announcement over the loud speaker, \"Anna Cook, report to the wild mouse.\" That would send the park security and other staffers to deal with the problem.\n\nBut Rinaldi also remembers how the park decided to reduce its supply of plush toys and prizes that summer. \"Everyone was a winner that last year,\" he says.\n\nLast call\n\nThe final season came to a close on Sept. 12, 1971. Rinadi remembers a lot of tears and storytelling among the folks who ran the park and its concession stands.\n\nThe Record reporter Kevin Hall documented the final hours of the park that day. He tagged along as electrician Dom Alosio and employee Sam Steinman went over to extinguish the lights on the big Palisades Amusement Park sign that faced Manhattan and the Hudson River.\n\nHere's how Hall described the final scene:\n\n“We’re going to kill it Sam,” Alosio said, pointing to the sign. “exactly at 9:30 p.m.”\n\nSam leaned against the glare of the first S in PALISADES..\n\n“OK, you just call out the time, I’m ready,” Sam said, settling comfortably against the S.\n\n“It’s 9:30,” Alosio said almost at once – cheating his watch by two minutes.\n\nSam turned to the reporter.\n\n“OK, remember, 35 years” he shouts over his shoulder. “Here goes.”\n\nAnd at 9:28 the last big light was out.\n\nRemembering the park\n\nNostalgia for the park marches on long after that final summer. Gargiulo's book \"Palisades Park: A Century of Fond Memories\" was published in 1996. He later produced a documentary as well. Radio disc jockey Bruce Morrow, who once hosted rock and roll shows at the park in the 1960s, has done Palisades Park reunion shows at the State Fair Meadowlands in East Rutherford. And a set of rediscovered carts from the cyclone have been brought back to Fort Lee where one was on display at the Fort Lee History Museum.\n\nGargiulo attributes the park’s enduring legacy to a desire for simpler times. He says those memories well up whenever he passes by the old site. “I still remember the smell of the saltwater pool and the spray coming from the falls. I remember the smell of the two-cycle engines that they had on the boat ride. I remember the smell of the Belgian waffles that was like this great sweet vanilla smell that the waffle stand had,\" Gargiulo says. “I can hear the sounds. I can hear the click-click-click of the Cyclone roller coaster as it went up the first hill. I can hear the sounds of the people at the Free Act stage when Cousin Brucie would introduce people and they would cheer.\n\n“Every sense in my body I can still feel at the park. And yet, it’s sad. I look at these high rises and I think of how many thousands of people must live there and must have lived in these homes and never even knew that they are on hallowed ground where Palisades Amusement Park once stood.”\n\nMore history stories:\n\nConstance Kopp:Bergen's first female sheriff's deputy\n\nJohnny Vander Meer:Midland Park ball player with back-to-back no-hitters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/theme-parks/2020/08/16/national-roller-coaster-day-americas-most-iconic-thrill-rides/3374805001/", "title": "National Roller Coaster Day: America's most iconic thrill rides", "text": "Arthur Levine\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nSunday is National Roller Coaster Day. Normally, I'd implore you to put your phone away, make tracks for the nearest amusement park, and mark the occasion by screaming like a ninny on a thrill machine. But, you know, COVID.\n\nSure, some parks are open, and some coasters are rolling. If there is one near you, go for it. But now, in the summer of our discontent, the only ups and downs that many of us are contemplating are the ones on coronavirus and unemployment charts.\n\nOh, how we long for this thing to be over and to return to normal. In that spirit, let’s honor Roller Coaster Day by taking a look at some of the most iconic rides in the U.S. They aren’t the latest and greatest, nor are they necessarily the best.\n\nBut these are the coasters that have stood the test of time, captured our imaginations, and caused lots and lots of knuckles to turn white. They are the ones that have been there through good times and bad and will be there when this thing is over. Let’s look forward to the day when we can ceremoniously toss our facemasks and hand sanitizer into the trash and take a victory lap together aboard one of these iconic coasters.\n\nConey Island Cyclone, Luna Park\n\nBrooklyn, New York\n\nFirst up is the Coney Island Cyclone at Luna Park in New York. Talk about ups and downs. After everything the venerable amusement area has been through, it’s kind of a miracle the ride is still standing. But thank goodness it is (and its National Historic Landmark status insures it will remain standing).\n\nBuilt in 1927, it's not the oldest coaster still operating, but it‘s plenty old. And it harks back to the days when Coney Island was the epicenter of the amusement universe. Still, the Cyclone is not merely a living piece of Americana. It remains surprisingly vital and stands tall, along with the Wonder Wheel, as beacons of a resurgent Coney Island.\n\nThere are many other vintage coasters to consider, including Jack Rabbit, Thunderbolt, and Racer, the three glorious 1920s-era rides at Kennywood in Pennsylvania, and the lovingly maintained Giant Dipper (built in 1924) at Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk in California.\n\nSpace Mountain, Walt Disney World and Disneyland\n\nOrlando Florida and Anaheim, California\n\nBecause they are located at the most popular theme parks in the world, let alone the U.S., the two Space Mountain coasters at Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom in Florida and Disneyland Park in California are certainly iconic. They have probably also logged more passengers than any other coasters in the country, and they have near-universal name recognition. Encased in once-futuristic, now-quaint, white-spire structures, the indoor rides are conducted mostly in the dark and retain an air of mystery.\n\nBut for all of their intrigue, people are often shocked to learn that they hit fairly poky top speeds of roughly 27 mph in Florida and about 32 mph in California. Built in 1975, the Magic Kingdom attraction is two years older than its Disneyland counterpart. The latter got a major makeover in 2005 with a new track and trains and is smoother than the Florida version.\n\nThe two Big Thunder Mountain Railroad coasters, also at Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom, debuted after the Tomorrowland rides and are nearly as iconic. At well over three minutes, the runaway mine train coasters are quite long. Built in 1959, Disneyland’s legendary Matterhorn Bobsleds also qualifies as iconic. The first coaster to feature a tubular steel track, the historic ride ushered in a new era of thrill machines.\n\nThe Beast, Kings Island\n\nCincinnati, Ohio\n\nSpanning 7,359 feet, covering 35 acres, and meandering through Mason, Ohio (located north of Cincinnati), The Beast at Kings Island took the record as the world‘s longest wooden coaster in 1979 and still holds the bragging rights today. After ascending its second lift hill, passengers plummet and navigate a 540-degree helix through a darkened tunnel. How’s this for iconic? Kid-lit writer R. L. Stine wrote two books about the famed ride.\n\nAnother Kings Island woodie, Racer, also vies for icon status. Built in 1972, the twin-racing coaster was featured on a 1973 episode of “The Brady Bunch.” (Marcia, Jan, and the gang rode in the red train, which appeared to have bested the blue train.)\n\nMillennium Force, Cedar Point\n\nSandusky, Ohio\n\nOpened in 1870, Ohio's Cedar Point debuted its first roller coaster, the Switchback Railway, in 1892. The ride closed in 1907, but through the years the park has introduced many others and now offers an impressive collection of 18 thrill machines. Perhaps the most iconic is Millennium Force which opened in (you guessed it) 2000 and broke records as the tallest (310 feet) and fastest (93 mph) complete-circuit coaster. (Incredibly, Cedar Point broke its own record in 2003 with the 420-foot-tall, 120-mph Top Thrill Dragster.) Millennium Force dominates the park’s crowded skyline and sends coaster fans’ hearts aflutter even before they board the literally breathtaking ride.\n\nAnother record-breaking and arguably iconic ride on Cedar Point’s roster is Magnum XL-200. By cracking the 200-foot height threshold in 1989, it was the original “hypercoaster” and launched the modern-day coaster wars.\n\nThe New Revolution, Six Flags Magic Mountain\n\nLos Angeles\n\nThe first contemporary coaster to feature a full 360-degree loop, The New Revolution at Six Flags Magic Mountain in the L.A. suburb of Valencia, California, turned heads–literally–when it opened in the bicentennial year of 1976. It has remained a favorite at the coaster-crazy park (which has 19 thrill machines, more than any park in the world), especially after it received some TLC for its 40th anniversary in 2016.\n\nBecause of the park’s proximity to Hollywood, a number of films and TV shows have been shot there. The New Revolution reaped plenty of icon cred when it was featured in productions such as the 1977 disaster-suspense movie, “Rollercoaster,” the 1983 classic “National Lampoon’s Vacation,” and one of the world’s greatest guilty pleasures, “KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park.”\n\n“Vacation” stars John Candy and Chevy Chase also took an onscreen ride aboard Colossus, another Magic Mountain coaster that has had cameos in a number of films and shows. The twin-track, wooden coaster ceased operating in 2014, but it didn’t completely go away. Its structure was incorporated into the wooden-steel hybrid coaster masterpiece, Twisted Colossus.\n\nBatman the Ride, Six Flags Great America\n\nChicago\n\nSix Flags Great America, which lies north of Chicago in Gurnee, Illinois, introduced a new breed of thrill ride, the inverted roller coaster, in 1992 when it debuted Batman The Ride. Featuring floorless trains that are suspended beneath the track, it looks like a demonic chair lift. It is a wild sight to see passengers navigate Batman’s teardrop-shaped loop with their dangling legs flailing this way and that. With its abrupt changes and tight inversions, the coaster delivers rib cage-crushing positive G-forces.\n\nThe popular ride inspired a number of inverted coasters at parks around the world, including exact Batman replicas at Six Flags Magic Mountain, Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, Six Flags St. Louis, Six Flags Over Georgia, and Six Flags Over Texas.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/theme-parks/2018/12/24/seaworld-orlando-infinity-falls/2406026002/", "title": "SeaWorld's Infinity Falls has world's tallest drop on a river raft ride", "text": "Arthur Levine\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nAt many of SeaWorld Orlando’s exhibits and shows, visitors ogle creatures in the water. For the park’s newest attraction, however, it’s the guests who are in the drink. They aren’t swimming among tropical fish or other marine life. They are aboard circular vehicles, floating downstream in turbulent, churning waters, and bracing themselves for the finale: the world’s tallest drop on a river raft ride.\n\nInfinity Falls, which opened in October, takes passengers on a journey through a lushly landscaped area that SeaWorld transformed for the attraction. Whereas most of the park is dedicated to ocean-dwelling animals, the new ride focuses on a freshwater environment.\n\n“We created a South American rainforest in the middle of SeaWorld Orlando,” says Jeff Hornick, senior director of theme park development for SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment. The park imported more than 700 trees, including a humongous ficus that weighs in at 22,000 pounds, to line the banks of the ride. “It’s a lost river jungle setting,” adds Hornick.\n\nInstead of the 10- or-12-passenger vehicles typically used for raft rides, Infinity Falls features smaller ones designed for eight passengers. The nimbler rafts provide a more dynamic ride experience. After piling in at the loading station, the action is relatively calm at first. Near the start of the ride, the rafts pass a lovely flamingo habitat.\n\nBusiness picks up quickly, however, as the river’s path introduces curves, dips and drops. As with whitewater excursions on real rivers, the combination of the rapids and elements in the riverbed disrupts the balance of the rafts and makes the ride thrilling. The vehicles teeter, spin and careen off the sides of the channels. They also take in generous amounts of splashing, cascading whitewater.\n\nDepending on the weight distribution of the passengers and which way the rafts are facing when they encounter one of the disruptions, riders might get soaked or remain dry. But before they disembark, it's a safe bet that passengers will get sufficiently doused at least once.\n\nMore:The 11 best amusement parks in Florida, 2019 edition\n\nIt can get mighty hot and sticky in Orlando, especially during the peak summer season. That’s why there are plenty of water rides offering cool relief at the area’s many theme parks. In fact, Journey to Atlantis, a nicely themed attraction that is part roller coaster and part splashdown boat ride, has been drenching SeaWorld Orlando guests for many years. But a water ride can be a tricky proposition for visitors at an otherwise dry theme park.\n\n“We had a lot of conversations about how guests get wet on river rapids rides,” Hornick says about the development process for Infinity Falls. “We found when people get doused by a waterfall (hello, Popeye & Bluto’s Bilge-Rat Barges at Universal’s Islands of Adventure), they get upset about that. When guests get wet on our ride, it’s really from the rapids, and that’s more acceptable.”\n\nThere is a waterfall on the SeaWorld ride, but the water stops falling as the rafts pass under it. There are near-miss geysers that do the same thing. Hornick failed to mention, however, that onlookers can activate water blasters and fire at will at passengers. One way or the other, riders aboard Infinity Falls are bound to get soaked.\n\nYou could purchase a poncho (or bring one from home) before getting on the ride. After you get off, SeaWorld offers, for an additional fee, walk-in body dryers big enough for a few people. Both strategies would help keep you relatively dry. But hey, isn't the whole purpose of a river raft ride to get wet? But you must dress right to survive theme park water attractions: Either wear or bring a bathing suit and sandals.\n\nMidway through the course, a traditional lift brings the rafts up a hill. The extra dose of gravity along with the fast-moving rapids help keep the action lively.\n\nFor the ride's finale, a clever vertical lift (the first of its kind in North America for an attraction like this) delivers the rafts to the precipice of Infinity Falls’ record-breaking 40-foot drop. While it gives SeaWorld bragging rights for a river rapids ride, there are log flumes, shoot-the-chutes, and other water rides at parks that climb much higher and have longer, steeper and faster drops. The drop is thrilling and makes a big splash at the bottom, but it’s not so intimidating that younger visitors or those who are wary of extreme coasters wouldn't want to give the attraction a whirl. The minimum height to ride is a fairly low 42 inches.\n\nIt might have been nice if Infinity Falls included some animatronics or other storytelling elements during the ride. But its rainforest motif is stunning and at night, the ride features dramatic lighting. After disembarking, guests are invited to visit kiosks that deliver information about freshwater ecosystems and water conservation.\n\nAlong with the river rapids attraction, SeaWorld introduced the themed restaurant Waterway Grill. It includes South American-inspired dishes such as grilled churrasco steak and empanadas along with a wide variety of craft beers.\n\nInfinity Falls continues SeaWorld’s evolution. More than just a place to passively watch animals, guests can now engage with attractions and enjoy thrilling rides. The chain says that it is now committed to introduce something new at its parks every year. For 2019, SeaWorld Orlando will convert an area into Sesame Street Land and offer rides such as Super Grover’s Box Car Derby, a junior roller coaster.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/24"}]}

Is Nathan's Joey Chestnut worried?", "text": "Researchers at the University of Michigan released a peer-reviewed study last week claiming that eating a single hot dog can take 36 minutes off of a human's life. In contrast, the study found that eating nuts could add 26 minutes to someone's lifespan.\n\nThat study could cause someone to think twice about devouring a frankfurter at a baseball game or holiday cookout. It also takes a direct shot at a sportsman who has built his legacy off of eating hot dogs.\n\nHeat your meat:Pepperoni, salami, Italian-style deli meats investigated by CDC for salmonella\n\n\"Interesting, I might need to eat more nuts to go back in time,\" tweeted 13-time Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest champion Joey Chestnut, who owns the world record for eating 76 hot dogs in 10 minutes and, by the study's calculation, would've lost one year and 15 minutes of his life for consuming his estimated 19,200 hot dogs over 16 years.\n\nBut health experts say there's more complexity than simply replacing hot dogs with nuts.\n\nCould eating hot dogs actually shorten your life span?\n\nOlivier Jolliet, one of the lead researchers on the study, published in the journal Nature Food, told USA TODAY that 5,800 foods were evaluated and then ranked based on their nutritional disease burden as well as their impact on the environment. Hot dogs were considered the most unhealthy.\n\n\"I wouldn't get too worried about eating a hot dog from this,\" Jolliet said. \"Basically, we were trying to show how you can improve your lifestyle and the environment without necessarily trying to be vegan.\"\n\nThe study found that substituting 10% of daily caloric intake from beef and processed meats for a mix of fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes and select seafood could reduce your dietary carbon footprint by one-third and allow people to gain 48 minutes of healthy life per day.\n\n\"The condition of the study is for marginal change and for the every day (American) where they can make minimum changes in their diet for overall health and the environment,\" Jolliet said. \"For Mr. Chestnut, I think he could be better for his health if he doesn't eat that many hot dogs because they are processed meats, but our study was not meant to measure extreme eating.\"\n\nShould Joey Chestnut be worried?\n\nEvery Independence Day, Joey \"Jaws\" Chestnut takes center stage at Coney Island – with a live ESPN national audience – to do what no human has done before: Eating 70-plus hot dogs in 10 minutes. This past July 4, Chestnut eclipsed his own world record with 76 dogs.\n\nJOEY CHESTNUT:Should hot dog eating competition hero be included in greatest 'athlete' debate?\n\nChestnut, 37, is a year-long competitive eater who trains to master his hot dog dominance by consuming other foods like Twinkies, burgers, tamales, gyros and chicken – dude ate 413 wings in 12 hours. Chestnut is hailed by Major League Eating as the greatest of all-time.\n\nThat doesn't happen overnight. Chestnut told The Washington Post that he sees doctors, does dietary cleanses and eats healthy (believe it or not) when he's not in-season training. So when the study started to go viral, Chestnut, accordingly, disagreed with its premise.\n\n“People will think automatically that if they eat healthy food, they might live forever,” Chestnut said. “And then I see on Twitter like, ‘Oh, watch out, Joey Chestnut’s going to die.' There are so many other things to a person’s health than their worst eating habits. The only way I can continue doing (competitive eating) is by being healthy.”\n\nNutrition expert Dr. Cate Shanahan, author of \"The Fatburn Fix\" and a former consultant for the Los Angeles Lakers, New York Yankees and Green Bay Packers, said Chestnut is \"better off than the average American\" when he's eating healthy and exercising in conjunction with competitive eating.\n\n\"We have to define what is healthy eating carefully,\" she said. \"... If Mr. Chestnut does avoid seed oils, he can eat all the hot dogs he wants a couple times a year for a contest because the extra (food consumption) turns into body fat.\"\n\nCan hot dogs be a part of a healthy diet?\n\nRegardless of moderation, hot dogs are not exactly healthy. The World Health Organization’s International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) reported ham, hot dogs and other processed meats may contribute to colorectal cancer. Hot dogs also are high in saturated fat and sodium. Just one hot dog can contain over a quarter of your day’s sodium allowance and over 14 grams of fat.\n\nShanahan believes that while processed meats like hot dogs can inherently be unhealthy, it's wrong to zero in on just hot dogs as the study does in highlighting the food.\n\n\"We haven't established that hot dogs are toxic and not all hot dogs are created equal,\" she said. \"... What's most important to know about hot dogs is they don't have seed oils. And what's most unhealthy is industry-produced vegetable oils that accumulate in our body fat and disrupt our body's energy-producing systems.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2020/05/21/socially-distanced-live-streamed-memorial-day-curbside-hot-dogs/5214651002/", "title": "Virtual Memorial Day; curbside hot dogs: Ways to stay sane during ...", "text": "After a wet and rainy week, the weather is supposed to clear up for Memorial Day weekend.\n\nWhat are your plans?

This is what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend:\n\nGet your hands wet with clean, running water.\n\nApply soap, then scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Sing \"Happy Birthday\" twice, or any one of these other songs to know you've scrubbed enough.\n\nRinse your hands well.\n\nDry them off with a clean towel.\n\nHow to prepare and cook meat safely\n\nWhen you buy cold foods like raw meat or poultry, you want to make sure it's refrigerated within two hours of buying it at the grocery store, or one hour if it's above 90 degrees Fahrenheit outside, says the USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service.\n\nMeats need to be cooked to a certain internal temperature to make sure you get rid of any bacteria. The FSIS advises using a food thermometer to double check your meats hit the right temperature.\n\nAll poultry should hit a minimum temperature of 165° Fahrenheit, while burgers made of ground beef, pork, veal or lamb should reach 160° F, says the agency.\n\nFor whole cuts of beef, pork, lamb or veal, the CDC says internal temperature should reach 145° F, then let the meat rest for three minutes before serving or eating.\n\nAlso, when you're removing cooked meat from the grill, don't use the same tools or plates that have touched raw meat.\n\nWhat if you bring food somewhere else?\n\nIf you're bringing food over to cook at another location, like a family member or friend's house or a local park, the FSIS advises using an insulated cooler with enough ice or ice packs so the temperature inside doesn't get above 40° F.\n\nHow long can food sit out?\n\nThe FSIS says you shouldn't let food sit out for longer than two hours, or one hour if it's hotter than 90° F outside. Keep coolers nearby to chill food if needed. If the food sits out beyond two hours, just throw it out.\n\nWhat about leftovers?\n\nMake sure leftover food is covered in airtight wrapping or sealed containers. The USDA says leftovers can stay in the refrigerator three to four days or three to four months in a freezer.\n\nDiversity in the workforce:Female CEO pay rose 26% in 2021, but not many women are in top jobs", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/07/03/grilling-safety-tips-handling-raw-meat-your-july-4th-cookout/1630598001/", "title": "America, you're grilling your burgers wrong and it could kill you", "text": "An end to a recent 10-state E. coli outbreak involving ground beef doesn't mean you should skip grilling safety at your Fourth of July cookout.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention two weeks ago declared over an outbreak that sickened 209 people, mainly from March to May. Food safety experts, consumer groups and health officials have been stressing food safety precautions since last spring and fall when recalls of ground beef and hot dogs raised concerns about E. coli contamination.\n\n\"Cooking food thoroughly and handling it correctly is critically important,\" said Carmen Rottenberg, acting deputy undersecretary for the USDA's Office for Food Safety and administrator of the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, told USA TODAY at the time. \"The food produced is not sterile. ...

Use a food thermometer to check that your burgers or steaks have been cooked to a temperature that will help prevent foodborne illnesses from bacteria such as E. coli. Ground beef and pork should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 160°F (70˚C). Steaks and roasts should be cooked to at least 145°F (62.6˚C) and allow to rest for 3 minutes after removal from the grill. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a chart showing the safe cooking temperatures for foods.\n\nMarinated no-no. Don't reuse marinades that have been used with raw meat.\n\nFor kabobs, keep meat and vegetables separate. Put peppers, onions and carrots on separate sticks because veggies cook faster than the meat and you don't want your meat undercooked.\n\nDon't use the same plates or utensils. Whatever dish you bring the meats to the grill on should not be used to take them up, unless it's cleaned thoroughly. That's because bacteria from the raw meat can spread to the cooked meat. Have a clean plate or platter and clean utensils to take up food.\n\nPractice cleanliness. You should wash you hands after preparing meats. Also wash your kitchen counter, cutting boards and utensils after they are used on raw meats.\n\nBeyond meat. Keep chilled certain salads or desserts that were served cold. After being served, cold dishes should not stay outside more than two hours – and just one hour if it is warmer than 90 degrees outside. Beyond that, toss it.\n\nSpecial attention needed. Some are more likely to succumb to food poisoning from E. coli; children and newborns, pregnant women, the elderly, and those with weak immune systems are among those more susceptible.\n\n\"Although E. coli illnesses linked to beef, specifically ground beef hamburger, have been on a downward trend for decades, proper hand-washing is still important after handling raw meat and, most important, cooking hamburgers well-done to at least 160 degrees is key,\" said Bill Marler, a food safety attorney and publisher of Food Safety News.\n\nContributing: Zlati Meyer\n\nJuly Fourth:Grill mistakes that can ruin your backyard barbecue – and how to avoid them\n\nJuly deals:How and where to get free food – from chicken to ice cream – plus discounts", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2020/04/22/10-ways-make-your-weekends-feel-more-normal-quarantine/3002668001/", "title": "10 ways to make your weekends feel more normal in quarantine", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors. Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nAt first, staying home all the time may have felt like an extra-long weekend, with the opportunity to catch up on those TV shows and movies you never got around to, do some reading, and give your house a good scrub down.\n\nNeed help finding products?Sign up for our weekly newsletter. It’s free and you can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nBut even if you finish every episode of Gossip Girl or The Sopranos, complete the works of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky (or the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy), and clean out every crevice with a toothbrush, it’s hard not to yearn for things that made your past weekends more fun, such as going out to restaurants and bars, hitting the movies, or even—gasp—heading out of town for a vacation. But there are ways to make your weekends now feel more like actual weekends. Allow us to suggest:\n\n1. Go backyard camping\n\nGet your Wild on without having to hike hundreds of miles on the Pacific Crest Trail by turning your backyard into a just-rugged-enough campsite, with a tent and sleeping bags to keep you cozy. Some good options are the Camp Dome 4 tent from REI, which reviewers say is easy to set up and can fit up to four people, and the Siesta 30 sleeping bag, which has lightweight panels to keep you cozy on cool spring and summer nights.\n\nAdd in a fire pit, like one from Endless Summer, to roast your s’mores in style. If you’re not fully committed to the camping-at-home experience, you could instead install a hammock—we like the Vivere Double Hammock, which has hundreds of rave reviews for being as comfy as a bed and lives up to them—as another way to read, nap, or just relax outdoors.\n\n2. Get going on the grill\n\nCan’t get everyone in the house into the whole camping thing, even in the backyard? Hold a cookout instead, which guarantees the one thing that unites indoors and outdoors enthusiasts: grilled meat (or veggie burgers). If you need a new grill, we love the Weber Spirit E-310, which can hold about 18 burgers at a time, provides even cooking with perfect sear marks, and looks sleek. For easy flipping and serving, consider upgrading your grill tools to OXO’s grilling tongs and spatula—both are big enough to flip and clamp onto grilling items, with comfortable rubberized handles that won't slip from your grasp. No backyard? You can still grill. Consider an indoor grill like the Cuisinart Griddler Deluxe, which helps you serve up burgers, hot dogs, and more from a more compact device.\n\n3. Hold a movie premiere party\n\nReplicate the movie theater experience at home—hopefully without someone behind you kicking your seat. Many film distributors are offering home rentals of recently released movies, including Emma and The Invisible Man, which you can access via most streaming devices. Our favorite, the Roku Ultra, is easy to use, with voice search and dedicated shortcut buttons for high-traffic streaming platforms, like Netflix, Hulu, and HBO. Once you choose your movie—which could be a new release or a classic musical on Disney+—pick a showtime and dim the lights. For an accurate theater experience, you may allow one person in the room to check their phone during the movie’s most climactic moments, but let’s say that this is the ideal movie-watching experience. Instead, ask your viewing companions to silence their phones or, if you’re feeling ambitious, put them in another room for distraction-free viewing.\n\nOf course, no movie-watching experience is complete without popcorn. You could do the bag stuff, or get a fresher-tasting bowl that you flavor yourself with the Cuisinart Microwaveable Popper, which makes popcorn in minutes by filling it with popcorn kernels and sticking it in the microwave.\n\n4. Do an at-home mani-pedi\n\nYou—yes, you—have the power to give yourself a mani-pedi treatment at home. Tidy up your hands and fingernails by clipping and buffing the nails, and exfoliating and moisturizing the hands. Give your feet some TLC with a foot spa, like the Ivation Foot Spa Massager, which bathes, massages, and gives feet a nice pampering. Then, trim your toenails and use a scrub, loofah, or textured towel to slough off dead skin. Polish isn’t required, but if you paint your nails, follow it with a clear topcoat to ensure the color stays put.\n\n5. Rejuvenate your skin\n\nStill feeling the spa vibes? Pamper your skin from head to toe. To give yourself an at-home facial, start by steaming open pores with a warm, wet face cloth, or go fancy with a steamer appliance, like the Dr. Dennis Gross Pro Steamer. Follow that with a gentle cleanser like Cerave’s hydrating cleanser, a chemical exfoliating serum like The Ordinary’s Lactic Acid Solution, your favorite moisturizer, and and an eye mask to minimize puffiness. Another way to indulge: A nice, long, soak in the tub. Make it feel special with Dr Teal’s refreshing eucalyptus and mint-scented bubble bath, followed by a soothing body lotion, like Cerave.\n\nIf you’re feeling extra, try a butt mask. Really! We tried one of Bawdy’s sheet masks and loved that it helped provide soothing, cooling, and felt truly luxurious in the way that only a mask treatment for one’s bum can.\n\n6. Replicate your favorite restaurant brunch\n\nIf the thought of a Sex and the City-style ladies brunch, complete with waffles, iced coffee, and hot gossip, has you near tears with desire, relax: You can bring most of the important elements of brunch in a cafe or restaurant to your own home. Start with the coffee. You can make the Tiktok-famous frothy coffee with instant coffee, milk, sugar, and a whisk or hand blender, or regular iced coffee with your preferred coffee beans, a grinder, a pour-over coffee maker, and a paper filter. (If you prefer a hot brew, the pour-over device will do the trick for that, too.)\n\nTo make diner-worthy waffles, use our favorite budget-friendly waffle maker, the Cuisinart Round Classic Waffle Maker. It preheats and bakes waffles faster than any other waffle maker we tested, provides an even, crispy texture, and is small and slim for easy storage. Finally, set up a Zoom call with your friends—or invite your family or roommates to the table—and you’ll have the ideal brunch setup.\n\n7. Tune in for a fitness class with an app or portal\n\nThe studio you go to for your Saturday morning spin, yoga, or pilates class may be closed, but there are a lot of ways to join a live fitness class at home. First, see if any local studios are holding Zoom classes—many are, and attending those classes is a good way to keep a local business (and your favorite instructors) afloat. If you have a ClassPass membership, you can use it to check out all the virtual classes in your area and use your credits to sign up for one.\n\nFeel like at-home workouts are going to be part of your routine for a while, and the live class option is an important component for you? Consider trying Daily Burn, which live streams yoga, cardio, barre, and other classes at 9 a.m. every morning, though you can play the videos at any time of day—it’s currently free for the first 30 days. You may also prefer a yoga-specific app, like Find What Feels Good from Adriene Mishler, the yogi behind the mega-popular YouTube channel Yoga with Adriene. It gets you access to videos that aren't on YouTube and lets you download videos so you can practice when you aren't connected to the internet. No matter what you choose to use, you'll need a good yoga mat—if you need a new one, we love the Lululemon Reversible Mat, which grips tight to the floor and provides a nice, cushiony surface to practice on.\n\n8. Have an international dinner party\n\n“Around the world” progressive dinner parties are a tried-and-true Pinterest date night fave, not to mention the dramatic impetus for a great episode of Mad Men. Create your own (without the guests, for now) by cooking up your favorite international dishes for each course. What you make is up to you. But you can use some of our favorite tools to make them, such as the Lodge cast iron pizza stone, the Zojirushi Fuzzy Logic rice cooker, and the Instant Pot Ultra (which can cook up almost anything). You may also get international wines delivered to your door, either by calling a local store (they are essential businesses, after all, and many are delivering, even if they previously did not). Or consider Firstleaf, a wine subscription service that quizzes you on your tastes and ships you six bottles every month, as well as lets you shop a la carte for the perfect bottle or two.\n\n9. Take an online museum tour\n\nMany people like to think of their weekends as an opportunity to browse through museums and art galleries, but rarely get around to it, even if they live in a city full of them. Now it’s a lot easier to hit the museums without having to deal with crowds, getting there, or even changing out of your PJs, thanks to virtual tours. Google Arts & Culture partnered with more than 2,500 museums to provide a glimpse into museums all over the world, including the Museum of Modern Art, the American Museum of Natural History, the British Museum, the Musée d'Orsay, the J. Paul Getty Museum, and about 2,495 others. Whether you choose the impressionists or the T-rex skeletons, it’s a nice way to provide a diversion for stir-crazy grown-ups and kids alike.\n\nCheck out museums with Google Arts & Culture\n\n10. Get out of state with a virtual adventure\n\nVisiting Hawaii’s volcanoes and the Great Wall of China in one day is an impossible feat—or, at least, it was. Bucket-list travel destinations such as the Great Wall, several National Parks, the Central Caribbean Reefs, and more offer in-depth tours online so you can get up close and personal with them from your computer. While it won’t be exactly the same as seeing the real thing, it’s a great way to get a taste for a faraway place you’ve thus far only read about or seen on Instagram. Visit solo, with your partner or roommate, or have your kids tag along to make up for the field trip they’re missing.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

Happy 4th of July.\n\nBoy this year is moving fast, and it's been a bumpy one for me. I've had a lot of change and dealt with a lot. So when I can, I lean on things that feel right. I'm from the snowy, windy, often unforgiving Rust Belt. In this part of the country, we earn our warm days. They don't come easy or stay for very long. I learned early that you'll regret not enjoying springs and summers, especially when the snow hits in the late fall. Or in the deep freeze of January, February, March, and sometimes even April. So this time of year, I make time for long drives and long walks and barbecues. Every summer I find a cookout or two or three or four to go to to relax, to eat, to drink and be merry, to throw around a football, kick a soccer ball, to talk about nothing or talk about the profound. All this made me wonder what makes the perfect barbecue. As my Phoenix-based colleague, Jennifer McClellan says, it depends on where you live.\n\nJennifer McClel...: You need a pool, or you need to be by some form of water if it's anytime between late April and October, because it's just way too hot to stand outside in the sun without some water relief.\n\nJames Brown: We'll hear more from Jennifer later, but first we need your help. At 5 Things, we're working on a project. What is the defining food of your town, your state, your region? We want to know. Email us at podcasts@usatoday.com. We'd like to feature you and that food on our show. Once again, that's podcasts@usatoday.com. Now we're headed to West Palm Beach, Florida where Shane McBride and Matt Abdoo are opening the latest location of the Pig Beach Barbecue restaurant. They also have locations in New York City and they're coming to Louisville, Kentucky soon. They're also the authors of Pig Beach Barbecue Cookbook Smoked Grilled Roasted and Sauced. We'll link to it in the description of this episode. I caught up with them at their grand opening and asked them what kind of barbecue they would construct with an unlimited budget.\n\nShane McBride: Matt and I live outside of the normal barbecue world in the sense that we are classically-trained chefs. I'm a wine and whiskey nerd. So I would definitely have some really great champagne and rosé to start the day with, that's 100%.\n\nJames Brown: What kind?\n\nShane McBride: Pick up. What's that?\n\nJames Brown: What kind of rosé?\n\nShane McBride: Rosé? My favorite rosé is is called Arnot-Roberts.\n\nJames Brown: Ooh, that's fancy.\n\nShane McBride: Yeah, it's very esoteric. I would probably go with something like that and I would totally 100% do the Pol Roger Winston Churchill champagne, all day long. If I could drink that every day, all day, that would be my guy.\n\nMatt Abdoo: Yeah. That's the total normal stuff barbecue people are drinking at their home barbecue for the 4th of July.\n\nJames Brown: Yeah, for us durable folks, explain what the Winston Churchill rosé combo looks like. What does it taste like?\n\nShane McBride: So Winston Churchill is the top tier champagne of Pol Roger. It was the cuvee that Winston Churchill drank. It's just a really kick ass champagne. And then it's really just kind of super bright rosé, Arnot-Roberts is a really kind of... It's got a little funk to it, goes really good with food. So I would kick off there and I would have some beer for people.\n\nMatt Abdoo: For me, I mean, I'm happy to always drink whatever he brings, the stuff that he brings is always topnotch and delicious. But for me, if I'm having a barbecue and I'm getting up early in the morning to start cooking, I got my buddies or my friends or family coming over to cook with me. It's usually either a nice ice-cold light beer, something like a Miller Light is my go-to drink. I'm a light beer guy. I am. That's what I enjoy drinking. Especially when you're doing the long-term longevity drinking for the day, which is barbecue. The light beer is you can keep going. If you get into the heavier ones, like the IPAs or the hoppy things, they get a little bit harder to put down throughout the day. Plus you get a little intoxicated too quickly with them. Or I also enjoy drinking just some really light crisp white wine, like a Pinot Grigio with lots of ice cubes in it, hot summer day, we're doing a barbecue, just staying hydrated, keeping cool, keeping refreshed is my go-to jam for that.\n\nJames Brown: What's on the grill? What's your main course?\n\nMatt Abdoo: Well, I think for the perfect barbecue that you have to have a fun spread. A barbecue is about hopefully bringing a bunch of people together, minimum group of 10. When you're cooking barbecue, most big format meats do feed large groups of people. So personally, I would love to have a spread, wouldn't you? Like you have a little chicken, have a little brisket, have a little pulled pork or ribs, or both. Throw a couple sausages in the mix.\n\nShane McBride: Got to have some chicken wings.\n\nMatt Abdoo: Some chicken wings, and the more the merrier, really. If you have the time to cook it all, and you're planning a big feast for some friends coming over on a barbecue day, you want to check all those boxes. Definitely have some form of poultry, have some form of beef, have some form of pork. And then from there as sides, I'm always a huge fan in the summertime of cold sides. Things like a cole slaw or a nice corn salad when you're in peak corn season in the summertime. Things like that for me would be great. Have some watermelon, got to have some nice fresh fruit. Hot summer day is a perfect addition to any barbecue.\n\nShane McBride: Tomato salad.\n\nMatt Abdoo: Tomato salad. Ooh, that'd be good.\n\nShane McBride: All day.\n\nMatt Abdoo: Watermelon, cucumber, feta salad. That's something fancy, but very, very delicious. I think that's the route that I would go for sure.\n\nShane McBride: Absolutely.\n\nJames Brown: Oh, Shane, are you on the same course?\n\nShane McBride: I'm in there. I would throw in our mac and cheese, for sure.\n\nMatt Abdoo: Can never go wrong with mac.\n\nShane McBride: I have a body built by mac and cheese, so I got to keep that, that's in my repertoire.\n\nJames Brown: Where would you go in terms of your desserts?\n\nShane McBride: I go directly to my Florida boy roots and Key lime pie. It's one of my favorite things of all time when I was a kid, my grandparents had Key lime trees in their backyard.\n\nMatt Abdoo: That's dope.\n\nShane McBride: So we had fresh Key lime pie probably at least once a month. And it's still to this day, probably my ultimate favorite dessert.\n\nMatt Abdoo: I don't think you'd ever go wrong with any kind of pie for a barbecue. I also love doing things that are fun and shareable on large formats things like we do these great s'mores treats. It's like a play on a rice crispy treat, but you use Golden Grahams and Cocoa Puffs and chocolate and marshmallows, and you mix all that together and make a s'mores treat. So they're like the bars. Or I'm also a huge fan of these lemon bars that we make, which is like a sweet cookie, shortbread cookie crust with this really amazing lemon limeade filling. It's similar to a Key lime pie, but more of a lime square kind of thing, which is really fun. I think the citrus aspect of any dessert is always a nice touch to a barbecue because you're eating all these really rich and heavy meats and having something acidic at the end helps lighten up that belly full of barbecue, if you will.\n\nJames Brown: Well, so where are we doing it? Obviously you'd love to do it at your barbecue joints, but let's say we're outside. Where do you do it? Do you do it at a park? Do you guys have special places that in your lives where you'd want to hold such a bash?\n\nShane McBride: That's a great question.\n\nMatt Abdoo: I think that's a great question. For me-\n\nShane McBride: Unlimited budget still?\n\nMatt Abdoo: No, we got past unlimited budget. We're on a normal budget. On the back of a yacht in the middle of Pacific. No, for me, any friend or family that might have a really big backyard, maybe a pool or a Slip and Slide or something where you can just have a lot of fun and be outside and play around, the kiddos can run around while mom and dads can enjoy a few adult beverages and enjoy the barbecue. And maybe a grill's also going for the kids with a hamburger and hot dog. Our business partner, Rob Shawger has an incredible home with a great big backyard and pool outside, which has always been the perfect backdrop and was the catalyst for me and Rob, when we got started doing barbecue, that's where we did all of our R%D and started practicing. So for me, that has a special nostalgia place in my heart.\n\nJames Brown: Jennifer McClellan has one of the coolest jobs here at USA Today. She oversees all things books and food related. She also writes a lot about food herself and as you might have guessed, she loves a good backyard barbecue. So I asked her, what are cookouts like in Arizona?\n\nJennifer McClel...: That is a good question. I would say that it's pretty much, you need a pool, or you need be by some form of water if it's any time between late April and October, because it's just way too hot to stand outside in the sun without some water relief. So that also makes it so that you need to look for foods that do well in the heat. And that also if you're having some water fingers or if you're near the water, it's not going to get ruined. So things like that, you have to think about when you're here.\n\nJames Brown: So give me a couple examples. What's a food that does well in the heat?\n\nJennifer McClel...: Guacamole, as long as it's not out all the time, but that is a good one. You can make it ahead of time. It never lasts long enough to be able to go back in the fridge when you're around here, everyone has their own twist on it. Obviously really good avocados, tomatoes, jalapenos and onions, but then people put really cool things in it like pomegranate seeds, maybe some different types of cheeses and things like that. So it's really fun. You can go straight, normal guacamole or people can really play around with it and have that be a lot of fun.\n\nJames Brown: What's the go-to drink for you at one of these events?\n\nJennifer McClel...: Go-to drink, well, water for sure. But also canned cocktails are a big thing that I'm into right now. When you are outside and eating, and especially if you're barbecuing with my friends, we all have little kids. Like I said, we're around the pool a lot. So anything in a glass bottle or in an open cup is probably going to get spilled or broken at some point in the day. So I always like to look for things in cans, whether that is just some sparkling water, something like that, anywhere from the canned cocktails, the hard spiked cider. Really good, the last like year or so, I think that canned cocktails have gotten a lot better. They used to have a weird metallicky taste and people in America are very enterprising, so they have cracked that code in my opinion. And I really haven't had a bad one lately. There's vodka tonics, there's margaritas, there are all sorts of things. If you just wander into your local beverage store or down that special aisle in the grocery store, tons of tons of choices right now that are really good.\n\nJames Brown: Yeah. I was going to ask you, do you have a tier ranking for the best canned cocktail?\n\nJennifer McClel...: It's a very scientific approach of having to try those. Not really. I've liked all of the ones that I've tried this summer. I don't really have brand names off the top of my head, but some of them, they had, oh gosh, there was a sex on the beach one that was really good. There was the vodka tonics, obviously out here, margaritas, tequila are really big. So a lot of my friends opt for that, the margarita in a can.\n\nJames Brown: Where we going in terms of sides?\n\nJennifer McClel...: Okay. So sides are where I shine. I love sides. So I mean, I like macaroni salad or potato salad. You have to have a starch. And I like the more oil-based dressings and that's partially just because where I am, it's pretty hot. So unless I am making it ahead of time and it's in the fridge... Let me, backtrack. Everything's made ahead of time. I think everything with the sides, you need to make that a day or two ahead of time. Those need to be ready to go when the other stuff is so that you're just setting it out. So the mayonnaise-based stuff is delicious, but for a barbecue, especially where it's really hot, it can go one way or the other. You forget about it. And then any leftovers are ruined because you don't want that out in the heat for any extended period of time. So I opt for the pasta salads that have the Italian dressing-type of dressings and sauces on it. It's good if you can to throw in maybe some salami and cheeses and things like that. I really like it packed full of other veggies. So tomatoes, I've thrown bacon in there a couple times, that was a hit. A lot of people like bacon and when you can throw it in surprising things like that, hey, why not?\n\nJames Brown: Who's going to complain about bacon?\n\nJennifer McClel...: And then also baked beans are a really good one. So those are really good. If you are able to put them in a pressure cooker or something, the day ahead of time, soaking those, I like to soak them and to make them from scratch, you get the flavor jam-packed into the beans if you're able to do it that way. And you don't need a lot of ingredients to make really good baked beans. And then any sort of salads, veggies, fruits, that stuff, anything that people can just throw on their plate, as they're going. So I always like to do maybe some cucumbers and carrots and peppers, things like that, just a nice little veggie tray, mostly so that when you're packing your face with the brisket and the chips and all the other stuff, you can be like, I'm healthy. I ate a vegetable today.\n\nJames Brown: I could tell that this is totally your jam.\n\nJennifer McClel...: We could talk about food all day.\n\nJames Brown: I wish our listeners could see your face right now. You just lit up. It's wonderful.\n\nJennifer McClel...: Yeah, sides are where it's at. I mean, I love the main dish. Don't get me wrong, but all of those different flavors, you're taking a bite of one thing and then another, and it makes me happy. It's silly, but it just makes me happy.\n\nJames Brown: What time of day is it in Phoenix?\n\nJennifer McClel...: Well, probably starts in the late afternoon. That way you can be a little bit shaded where I am, around our pool or where you're at. And then you can start early with the appetizers, with the fruits and the things that you have set out. You can get a good guacamole base going, and then you've got your water activities, all that. The kids are playing, your chatting with your friends. You're waiting for the brisket or whatever it is to come off the grill. That's a couple more hours. And then there's dinner. Everybody stops. Everybody sits down, kids are wrapped in towels and everyone's just eating off the paper plates and balancing it on there. And then you go back to the water and then you bring out dessert and stuff after. So I would say late afternoon so that you can roll it into the evening when the sun goes down, not as hot, the perfect day.\n\nJames Brown: Sun is starting to set and we're moving into the dessert country. What's dessert?\n\nJennifer McClel...: What's dessert. Dessert is popsicles for the kids. So you can get them checked off the list. For the adults, I like fruit. So any sort of like a strawberry shortcake situation, you can have your cake ready to go. You've got some strawberries that you've chopped up. You've either boiled them a little bit or roasted them so that they get really soft and become like that syrup. And then you just spoon that over the cake, whipped cream on top, done.\n\nJames Brown: One last thing. We're going to play a game with Danielle DeSiato. Did I pronounce it correctly?\n\nDanielle DeSiat...: You sure did.\n\nJames Brown: The Kitchen and Cooking Editor at Reviewed. Danielle, welcome to 5 Things.\n\nDanielle DeSiat...: Hi, good to be here. Thanks.\n\nJames Brown: So our game is very simple. There are three answers. It's called high-low. What is the best high-grade grill that you can get your hands on? What's the best low-grade grill you can get your hands on? And what's your wild card? A favorite, one that we wouldn't think about that does a good job? Help me fit into different budgets.\n\nDanielle DeSiat...: Awesome. So definitely at the high end, super classic high quality, the Big Green Egg, that's going to be your Kamado grill that can grill, it can smoke, it can even be an outdoor oven. It's probably going to run you anywhere from 1000 up, depending on the bells and whistles, the size and the setup, but it's going to last you a really long time. It's going to be a workhorse. It's awesome.\n\nJames Brown: Outdoor oven.\n\nDanielle DeSiat...: Yes. Outdoors pizza, cornbread. I mean, you can really up your grilling game with an outdoor oven and smoker. I mean, your briskets and your pulled pork, it's going to deliver all of that stuff. Super delicious, high quality. It's heavy, but it's not hard to use.\n\nJames Brown: Outstanding. On the low end for us people with a tight budget, where would you see us going, where what's a good option?\n\nDanielle DeSiat...: Get a classic charcoal grill. You can't go wrong. A Weber is going to run you as low, if you get the portable version, as low as 90 bucks. Get yourself a charcoal starter to go with it, about 20 bucks. And you're going to be grilling all season long, really tasty, super easy to use and not a huge investment.\n\nJames Brown: And what's your wild card? What does a good job that's off the beaten path? Things we hadn't thought about?\n\nDanielle DeSiat...: Well, you need a gas grill. It's not off the beaten path, but for gas grills, you're really going to be in the middle of the road. You're going to spend more than you will on a charcoal grill. You're not going to be quite at the do-it-all workhorse level of a Kamado grill. But you got the Weber Genesis even the Weber Spirit, and those are going to do you really well. You're not going to spend a ton of money on them. They're going to last you years and years, and you're going to be able to grill a lot of awesome stuff for all your friends, barbecuing all summer long.\n\nJames Brown: Outstanding. And that's the whole idea here, to get the best barbecue possible.\n\nDanielle DeSiat...: Yeah. Weber's Classic, you really can't go wrong. They're going to be running a lot of great deals for all the summer grilling needs. And whether you get gas or charcoal, you've really got a range of options there.\n\nJames Brown: If you like to show, write us a review on Apple Podcasts or wherever you're listening and do me a favor, share it with a friend.

Just a smoky whiff of freshly grilled burgers, ribs or chicken over the open flame gets your mouth watering.\n\nBut cooking a ground beef patty to perfection isn’t always as easy as it looks. How does an amateur chef get that perfect char on the outside and not raw on the inside? Is it better to use charcoal or gas? What’s the best way to grill vegetables? A bad day at the grill in front of family and friends can ruin even the best of intentions.\n\nAward-winning barbecue joint Hot Rod’s BBQ in Wharton is famous for its slow-smoked pulled pork and barbecue baby back ribs. The restaurant consistently makes the top of the list for barbecue lovers in northern New Jersey. Owners Anthony and Toby Sibona combine the best of barbecue from around the country, but because they’re from New Jersey, they call it “Yankee BBQ.”\n\n“If you grew up in Louisiana or South Carolina, barbecue is part of your culture. It happens every day, every weekend and there’s a lot more restaurants,” Anthony Sibona said. “But New Jersey barbecue has been a slow development up until now where we have hundreds of barbecue restaurants. I think it’s not something we’re used to every day. It is American comfort food.”\n\nGrowing up, Anthony Sibona always had a passion for cooking. He labored in all areas of the restaurant business before meeting his wife, Toby, when they worked together in a restaurant that served up California fare more than 30 years ago.\n\nThe roots for Hot Rod’s BBQ started with the pair setting up pig roasts before moving on to catering jobs, where Anthony was asked to create more dishes. Despite not being a classically-trained chef, he’s spent the last 20 years developing barbecue and catering for large groups, including cooking for 700 to 800 people in less than two hours.\n\nAfter developing a menu they were both happy with, the pair took over a commissary restaurant to try out some of Anthony’s recipes before moving to Wharton 16 years ago.\n\nToday, the Sibonas are known for Hot Rod's \"World-Famous Smoked Wings,\" but they have plenty of advice how to make great barbecue of all varieties.\n\n“Starting with high quality, fresh meats is very important to what your finished product is,\" said Anthony Sibona. Giving yourself proper prep time, marinating time to really elevate your flavors. That’s really important. Starting with the right equipment, that’s totally key.”\n\n“It’s more than gas grills. Pellets, smokers and grills are getting really popular and they’re really versatile. The amount of commercial marinades, sauces and rubs that are available at your supermarket has tripled in the last ten years so you can really have a lot of fun playing with some flavors. Cooking real barbecue, not grilling steaks, real barbecue, large cuts of meat, there’s something ritualistic about it.”\n\n“The bottom line is just have fun with it. There’s so many different concoctions that you really can’t be intimidated,” Toby Sibona said. “If it’s something that interests you as something to do in your backyard, just trying new things each time and having your friends there to taste that with you. Make it a family event on a weekend. It is truly comfort food.”\n\nStory continues below gallery.\n\nSibona, recently featured on Fox 5 New York for his wings and CBS Sports Radio, has some tips for how to turn a run-of-the-mill cookout into something memorable.\n\n1. Gas or Charcoal\n\nSibona says the type of grill is a matter of preference, although he recommends always pre-heating the grill for at least 10-15 minutes before grilling. When using charcoal, make sure it’s completely gray and orange before you start cooking.\n\n2. Direct vs. Indirect\n\nWhen cooking smaller cuts of meats, such as steaks, burgers, hot dogs and the like, Sibona recommends direct heat grilling at temperatures from 350-425 degrees as this range will give the best results. With larger cuts, such as a pork tenderloin, pork ribs or chicken on the bone, he said that quickly searing the meat on a direct heat source but moving to indirect works best. Indirect cooking is created when your heat source is not directly under your food. Use a lid to create an oven like environment.\n\n3. Pick the Right Charcoal\n\nWhen cooking with a charcoal fire try to use all natural, chemical free briquettes or lump hardwood charcoal. Many products on the market use petroleum binders that can sometimes give an off taste.\n\n4. Beware of Lighter Fluid\n\nSibona says that serious put masters would never let lighter fluid near their grills and smokers because it can sometimes produce a chemical taste that stays on the food long after you think it burned off. The preferred fire-starting procedure requires a simple, inexpensive device called a charcoal chimney. People are becoming more aware of chemical-free charcoal and other alternative ways of starting charcoal rather than just using lighter fluid which often gives a chemical taste to your meat.\n\n5. Food Safety\n\nKeeping foods out of the \"danger zone\" is imperative, especially with the hotter weather we've been experiencing. Food storage is extremely important as bacteria grows very rapidly at temperatures between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Keep hot food hot, at or above 140 degrees, and cold foods cold, at or below 40 degrees.\n\n6. Accessorize\n\nThere are countless cool sometimes very useful grilling and barbecue accessories available on the market. Cedar and Mesquite grill planks are available for delicate fishes and meats, grill baskets work great with root vegetables. Smoke chip boxes are great according to Sibona as he said they can allow you to get a “smoky taste” from your gas grill.\n\n7. Seasonings and Marinades\n\nWhile techniques and recipes differ, one thing remains a constant to a great barbeque experience and that are top-notch seasoning and marinades.\n\nGo: Hot Rod’s BBQ, 175 N.

But hosting one can get pricey if you don’t watch your budget. Here are some tips for hosting a fabulous cookout this Fourth of July without going broke, courtesy of Sarah Spigelman Richter, a food reporter based in Manhattan.\n\n1. Think quality over quantity\n\nYou may think you’re getting a deal on that discount meat, but chances are the pricier goods are a better value, said Richter. Though you’ll have fewer burgers to go around, you’ll feel better about eating meat that was raised ethically and sustainably — it’s better for your health, the environment and animal welfare. Of course, “sustainably sourced everything does cost more,” Richter said, so don’t feel pressured to serve up a steak. “Go for any sort of poultry that’s interesting to you,” she said, or choose sausages, fish or ground meat. The latter is often cheaper and more delicious.\n\n2. Serve veggies\n\n“You don’t want to forget people who don’t eat meat at your cookout,” said Richter, who advised hitting the farmer’s market to stock up. “My general rule of thumb is, whatever looks best that day, get it,” she said. Veggies usually taste good either right off the grill or when they’ve cooled down, so they’re a perfect snack for after the pool. Try loading kebabs with veggies and a small amount of meat, or serve up meatless grilled mains like beans and tofu. “Things that can fall through the grates like asparagus can always be put in a foil pouch placed directly on the grill,” Richter said.\n\nLearn more: Best credit cards of 2023\n\n3. Grill fruit\n\nThe surprising, smoky flavor of grilled fruit is like “dinner theater,” said Richter, who explained that grilling brings out the natural sugars in fruit, which makes them sweeter, like caramelized onions. Remember to brush whatever you’re grilling with a little olive oil and keep a close eye on your fruit so it doesn’t go up in flames (indirect heat is best). Richter advised grilling stone fruit like peaches, plums, nectarines, pluots and apricots. Leave the skins on, then peel afterward and serve with a dollop of cool whipped cream. “It’s a really easy dessert,” she said.\n\n4. Ask friends to BYOB\n\nWe won’t dissuade you from stocking up on basics like water and soda, but it never hurts to ask your friends to pitch in. If they have particular tastes — yes way, rosé — encourage them to round out the offerings. As Richter jokingly put it, “Get your friends to bring exactly what they like so you don’t wind up with three bottles of white zinfandel that nobody drinks and eventually turns into vinegar in your pantry.”\n\n5. Use rewards credit cards\n\nIf you’re going to go shopping, you may as well get a little kickback for it, which is what rewards credit cards are all about. You can earn points toward perks like gift cards, account credit and discounts at your favorite stores. Just remember to check your credit before you apply, as many issuers require decent credit in order to qualify. (Not sure where your finances stand? You can view two of your credit scores for free on Credit.com.)\n\n6. Keep side dishes simple\n\n“Don’t drive yourself crazy trying to make a risotto in the kitchen while everyone’s outside enjoying themselves,” said Richter. “Grab a bag of chips and some coleslaw and enjoy the day.”\n\nMore from Credit.com\n\nThis article originally appeared on Credit.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/08/29/al-roker-gave-me-crash-course-grilling-and-wasnt-disaster/1118368002/", "title": "Al Roker gave me a crash course in grilling, and it wasn't a disaster", "text": "There are people who can’t cook … and then there’s me.\n\nFor all the \"food porn\" accounts I follow on Instagram, and hundreds of restaurants I've bookmarked on Yelp, my own skills in the kitchen are less than exemplary. I can't make a grilled-cheese sandwich without setting off the smoke alarm and admittedly know the Seamless guy who delivers my bagels on a first-name basis.\n\nEmbarrassed by my ineptitude, I decided to course-correct by taking an online cooking class. And who's a better teacher than \"Today\" weatherman Al Roker?\n\n\"Backyard Grilling and Barbecuing With Al & Matt\" (celebrity chef Matt Abdoo) is a five-episode crash course on all things charbroiled, now streaming on NBC's craftsy new Bluprint digital network. Modeled after the star-studded \"MasterClass,\" Bluprint gives subscribers more than 3,000 hours of on-demand classes for $14.99 a month, on topics ranging from woodworking and yoga to knitting and ballroom dance.\n\nThe \"Backyard\" hosts share upscale takes on grilled favorites: Recipes include pork-and-turkey burgers with Asian slaw, grilled Baharat chicken kebabs and blackened swordfish with charred green onions. Episodes average 15 minutes, and comprehensive instructions are available to reference as you watch.\n\nAs the summer cookout season draws to a close this Labor Day weekend, I tried my hand at two of the most accessible recipes: Roker's King of Steaks porterhouse and Abdoo's Pig Beach burger, named for his Brooklyn BBQ joint. But first, I needed my grill: a rickety charcoal rig that set me back $14 and (no joke) three hours of assembly. (Word to the wise: It's worth splurging on something that's not one burger flip away from falling apart, particularly if you have ambitions of being a grill master.)\n\nBoth recipes required minimal prep. I marinated the steak in olive oil, rosemary and garlic, sticking extra cloves inside the meat as advised, only to watch them fall into a charcoal abyss as soon as they hit the grill. After 16 minutes of rotating and simmering, Roker's steak was coated by a palatable brown crust of herbs, with perfect sear marks emblazoned across the lightly pink meat that he could cut with a butter knife. \"Fight for your right to bite,\" Roker jokingly advises, eating directly off the bone.\n\nMy steak, on the other hand, resembled a tawny, chewy slab of shoe leather – the result of overcooking and under-marinating the meat. Thankfully, I was able to drown it in warm, homemade rosemary-orange butter, which may have been the only thing on the menu I aced.\n\nSince a $13 porterhouse steak isn't advisable for a first foray into grilling, I moved on to the less-labor-intensive Pig Beach burger, nestled in a potato bun with dill pickles and doused in white American cheese and a homemade sauce (containing mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles and shallots). It's fast, easy and guaranteed to \"blow your mind,\" promises Abdoo, who took the reins from Roker for this lesson.\n\nBecause I was too impatient to preheat the grill properly, one of my patties was slightly undercooked, while the other crumbled into a juicy, oily mess on the cooking grate. Although the end result was far less appealing than Abdoo's mouthwatering short-rib burger, it was still tasty enough to make me want to give it another shot sometime.\n\nAll in all, Roker and Abdoo make for affable, erudite teachers, sharing personal techniques and occasional quips as they breeze through the grilling process. The video component of the class is most helpful to show how your finished food should look, but the detailed recipes you can download – some of which are used in New York restaurants – are at least as valuable.\n\nMy only advice for fellow grilling newbies: Pick up some tongs and cook a few hot dogs before jumping in with the pros. While \"Backyard\" has sparked a newfound interest in grilling, my skills aren't quite up to char with theirs.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/25/wildlife-crossing-effigy-mounds-praying-coach-news-around-states/50137711/", "title": "Wildlife crossing, effigy mounds: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The Alabama Democratic Party has launched a “Free Weed” website to support its effort to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in the state. The site, www.FreeWeedAL.com, argues that prosecutions for small amounts of cannabis are a waste of criminal justice resources and have disproportionately affected communities of color. The party argued legalizing marijuana could also bring economic benefits to the state. “Alabama’s Republican politicians seem hellbent on wasting money criminalizing ordinary people, ruining lives in the process,” state Rep. Chris England, chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party, said in a statement. “Criminalizing cannabis doesn’t make us safer.” The site is a mix of policy advocacy and promotion for the state Democratic Party and candidates. It includes statistics about marijuana prosecutions as well as links to donate to the state party, register to vote and volunteer to help candidates. It also offers “Free Weed” T-shirts and other merchandise. Alabama Republican Party Chairman John Wahl called the site “a stunt.” “The Alabama Republican Party supports traditional family values. It’s important to us that our society and our families stay safe, strong, and healthy. The recreational use of marijuana does not encourage these principles,” Wahl said in a statement.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Bureau of Land Management has proposed an expansion of lands available for selection by Alaska Native Vietnam War-era veterans who are entitled to allotments. Tom Heinlein, acting state director for the land agency in Alaska, on Thursday recommended opening about 27 million acres of land for allotment selections by eligible veterans. Currently, about 1.2 million acres are available. Concerns have been raised that some of the currently available lands are difficult to access or outside veterans’ cultural homelands. Heinlein said the next step is to provide detailed land descriptions to Interior Secretary Deb Haaland. It would be up to Haaland to sign and issue an opening order for land selections, he said. The plan is to get her that information in the coming weeks, Heinlein said. He called the matter a “super high priority” for Haaland, who visited with veterans last week during her trip to Alaska – her first to the state as secretary. “We have a sacred obligation to America’s veterans,” she said in a statement, adding that she “will not ignore land allotments owed to our Alaska Native Vietnam-era veterans.” Under the 1906 Alaska Native Allotment Act, Alaska Natives were allowed to apply for up to 160 acres of land. Many Alaska Natives were unaware of this program, which was ultimately expanded and extended.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A developer is exploring the potential for what would be the state’s biggest wind farm on an expanse of high desert in Pinal County about 30 miles north of Tucson. But the company’s plan to erect up to 83 wind turbines at the site known as Oak Wells has already drawn opposition from local ranchers who say the wind farm would harm rangeland as well as the environment and native wildlife. Oak Wells Wind LLC, an Arizona company set up by Boston-based Galehead Development, has been testing the winds with a test station set up in the area since last fall. It has also conducted initial studies on local bird populations and met with state and federal wildlife officials. Galehead has partnered with Steelhead Americas, the North American development arm of Danish wind-turbine maker Vestas, to study the wind resource in a roughly 44,000-acre “area of interest.” No decision has been made on moving forward with the wind project, which if built at a proposed capacity of up to 300 megawatts would be the largest in the state, a manager of the project said. “At this point in time, we are still assessing the viability of a wind farm in the Oak Wells area, but we believe there would be strong interest if it is shown to be a viable area for development,” said Patrick Brown, a project development manager for Vestas.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Friday that he was considering calling a special session of the Legislature later this year after finance officials said they expected the state’s surplus to hit $1 billion by the end of the year. Hutchinson, a Republican, said he was weighing proposals to use the surplus money to expand broadband access in the state, to address additional school facility funding needs because of inflation and to enact further tax relief. Hutchinson said he did not expect to decide whether to call a special session until mid- to late summer at the earliest, contingent on whether there is consensus behind any proposals. The governor did not elaborate on how much money he was considering for each proposal. The state’s surplus for the fiscal year, which began July 1, is approaching $500 million, state finance officials said earlier this month. Hutchinson said the session might also address the U.S. Supreme Court’s expected ruling on Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban. That ruling could overturn or weaken Roe v. Wade.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAgoura Hills: Construction has begun on what is billed as the world’s largest wildlife crossing for mountain lions and other animals caught in Southern California’s urban sprawl. Officials held a ceremony Friday to mark the start of construction of a $90 million bridge over a freeway and feeder road that is about 35 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. “This wildlife crossing could not have come at a better time. It is truly a game changer,” said Jeff Sikich, biologist for the National Park Service. “Today’s groundbreaking sets a path toward saving our local mountain lions and supporting the diversity of wildlife in this whole region.” The bridge will stretch 200 feet over U.S. 101 to give big cats, coyotes, deer and other wildlife a safe path to the nearby Santa Monica Mountains. It is expected to be completed by early 2025 and will be named the Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing for the philanthropist whose foundation donated $25 million. About 300,000 cars a day travel that stretch of the 101 in Agoura Hills, a small city surrounded by a patchwork of protected wildland that the new crossing will connect. The star of the fundraising campaign to build the bridge was mountain lion P-22, who traveled across freeways and made his home in a huge Los Angeles park. While he is unlikely to use the span because he lives many miles away, P-22 became a symbol of the shrinking genetic diversity of wild animals that must remain all but trapped by sprawling development or risk becoming roadkill.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: Investigators believe a wildfire that forced the evacuation of nearly 20,000 people in northern Colorado last month was started by a very small campfire near a hiking trail, authorities said Thursday. However, investigators have exhausted all their leads and have not been able to identify a person responsible for starting the wildfire that broke out March 26 on the outskirts of Boulder, the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office said. The investigation has been stopped but will be reopened if there are any substantial new leads, it said. The remains of the campfire were found a few feet off a trail on public open space property just inside the city limits of Boulder, south of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the federal facility after which the fire was named, the sheriff’s office said. It is not known how old the campfire was, sheriff’s spokesperson Carrie Haverfield said. The 190-acre wildfire burned to within 1,000 yards of homes on the west end of the college town, near the area where more than 1,000 homes were destroyed by a wildfire pushed by strong winds in late December. The cause of December’s fire is still being investigated by the sheriff’s office.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state Senate on Friday gave final legislative approval to a multiyear labor agreement that includes 2.5% pay raises and bonuses for tens of thousands of state employees, despite concerns raised by some Republicans that taxpayers can’t afford it. The four-year deal, reached by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration and recently ratified by 43,000 unionized workers, cleared the Democratic-controlled Senate on a vote of 22-13. The House approved the same agreement Thursday. As in the House, debate in the Senate focused on whether the wage enhancements will help stabilize a predicted tsunami of retirements while rewarding a workforce that endured the pandemic, or instead create future fiscal challenges for the state. Passage of the major labor deal comes as Lamont and the General Assembly are trying to reach an agreement in the final weeks of the legislative session on revisions to the state budget. Meanwhile, as new revenue projections show the state is now poised to end the current fiscal year June 30 with a nearly $4 billion surplus, state lawmakers are limited by caps on spending and revenues. Proponents of the deal contend the bonuses will likely save the state more money in the long run and predict an arbitrator would have probably awarded state employees 3% raises.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A battle is brewing over the health of the Delaware River, waged by the environmental groups sworn to protect it. PennFuture and the Delaware Riverkeeper Network have filed official petitions claiming the Delaware River Basin Commission is holding back on its promise to protect the integrity of the watershed around Wilmington, Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey. Studies conducted by the Delaware Riverkeeper Network have concluded that dissolved oxygen levels around these parts of the watershed aren’t high enough to sustain the good health of the river. Mostly these levels are attributed to wastewater treatment plants along the river that pollute it. Jessica O’Neill, a senior attorney at PennFuture, a Harrisburg-based environmental advocacy nonprofit, said the quantity of pollution allowed to be released by these wastewater plants is contingent on the limit set by the River Basin Commission, which she said is dragging its feet on raising the limit. But “raising dissolved oxygen levels in the Delaware Estuary is not as easy as flipping a switch, as some contend,” said Kate Schmidt, communications specialist for the commission. “Besides needing the scientific basis for such an action, as well as a public process, there are significant costs associated with raising the criteria.” Maya van Rossum, leader of the nonprofit Delaware Riverkeeper Network, said the environmental groups pushing back at the commission’s supposed inaction view the panel as working in lockstep with industrial interests.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: At least four people, including a 12-year-old girl, were shot when a gunman unleashed a flurry of bullets in the nation’s capital, leading to lockdowns at several schools Friday. The injured were expected to recover, and the suspect was found dead hours later inside an apartment at the scene as Metropolitan Police Department officers conducted door-to-door searches of buildings in the area. Authorities had said earlier that they were seeking a 23-year-old Virginia man as a person of interest. The man had been “linked to social media postings” that emerged as part of the investigation, said Assistant Metropolitan Police Chief Stuart Emerman. Police believe the man erected a “sniper-type setup” with a tripod and rifle in his apartment and began firing indiscriminately at people walking below, Chief Robert Contee said. The shooting was recorded and posted online on 4chan, an online message board. Separately on Friday, emergency medical crews were called to the Supreme Court about 6:30 p.m. after a man set himself on fire outside the building. Police said Saturday that the man, Wynn Bruce, 50, of Boulder, Colorado, had died.\n\nFlorida\n\nMarathon: A rehabilitated green sea turtle was released back to the ocean in the Florida Keys on Friday to mark Earth Day. Several hundred onlookers watched on Marathon’s Sombrero Beach as staff from the Keys-based Turtle Hospital released “TJ Sharp,” a 65-pound juvenile sea turtle rescued in February. The endangered reptile had been discovered floating offshore, unable to dive and visibly affected by fibropapillomatosis, a condition that causes cauliflower-like tumors and affects sea turtles around the world. TJ’s condition upon arrival at the Turtle Hospital required surgical removal of the tumors and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, vitamins, and a nourishing diet of greens and mixed seafood. “Sea turtles are the oldest animal known to man – to be able to take a sea turtle, rehabilitate it and return it to its ocean home on Earth Day, it’s just an amazing day,” Turtle Hospital manager Bette Zirkelbach said. She said that although Earth Day is recognized once a year, humans can take daily steps to protect marine resources and help ensure the survival of sea turtles. “What people need to do to make every day Earth Day is to reduce single-use plastics, keep trash out of our oceans and help keep our planet clean,” Zirkelbach said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was hostile during testimony Friday in a hearing on her eligibility to run for reelection, saying she did not remember liking and making various social media posts surrounding the attack on the U.S. Capitol last year and accusing an opposing lawyer of using chopped videos and twisting her words. Voters in the Georgia congresswoman’s district have said Greene helped facilitate the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection that disrupted certification of President Joe Biden’s victory, making her ineligible for reelection under a rarely cited section of the 14th Amendment dealing with “insurrection or rebellion.” But Greene – who, the day before the Capitol riot, proclaimed on TV that this is “our 1776 moment” – testified that she’s never endorsed violence. Greene is set to appear on the Republican ballot for Georgia’s May 24 primary and has been endorsed by ex-President Donald Trump. The administrative law judge who oversaw the hearing must present his findings to Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who will then make the ultimate determination over whether Greene is qualified. Greene has repeatedly denied aiding or engaging in an insurrection and has filed a lawsuit alleging that the law the voters are using to challenge her eligibility is itself unconstitutional.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. government on Friday dropped its appeals of a state order requiring it to remove fuel from a massive military fuel storage facility that leaked petroleum into the Navy’s water system at Pearl Harbor last year. Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Defense notified the state and federal courts of its decision. The move comes more than a month after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the military would permanently shut down the tanks and drain all of their fuel. The Hawaii Department of Health, which issued the order, said the decision regarding the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility was a “step forward.” “While today’s announcement is good news, the work continues,” the department said in a statement. It said it would “continue to act expeditiously and proactively to oversee the safe defueling and decommissioning of Red Hill and restoration of the aquifer.” David Henkin, an attorney for Earthjustice which is representing the Sierra Club of Hawaii as an interested party in the case said his clients would remain vigilant to make sure the tanks are promptly defueled. “It’s a wonderful Earth Day gift to the people of Hawaii and in particular to all the residents of Oahu who depend on safe, clean drinking water when they turn on their tap,” Henkin said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Department of Defense plans to build an advanced mobile nuclear microreactor prototype at the Idaho National Laboratory. The department signed off on the Project Pele plan to build the reactor and reactor fuel outside of Idaho and then assemble and operate the reactor at the lab. The decision follows a two-volume, 600-page environmental impact statement that includes public comments evaluating alternatives for building and operating a gas-cooled microreactor that could produce 1 to 5 megawatts of power. “Advanced nuclear power has the potential to be a strategic game changer for the United States, both for the (Department of Defense) and for the commercial sector,” said Jeff Waksman, program manager for Project Pele. “For it to be adopted, it must first be successfully demonstrated under real-world operating conditions.” Officials had previously said preparing testing sites at the Idaho National Lab and then building and testing the microreactor would take about three years. The department said the project is subject to the availability of appropriations. The department said two reactor designs are being considered, and one chosen will be announced later. The department said both designs are high-temperature gas-cooled reactors using enriched uranium for fuel.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A judge on Friday threw out 44 more convictions tied to a notorious former police sergeant who regularly framed people for drug crimes they didn’t commit, exonerations that victim advocates said would be among the last from one of the most disgraceful chapters in the Chicago Police Department’s history. The dismissal of the cases by Cook County Judge Erica Reddick was the result of petitions to do so filed by the victims’ attorneys with the support of the Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx’s office. “In order to restore trust in the criminal justice system, as prosecutors, we must approach every case with an eye toward the facts, the evidence, and the law,” Foxx said in a press release. The latest dismissals bring to more than 170 Black defendants who have seen their drug convictions tied to former Sgt. Ronald Watts and his tactical unit dismissed in recent years. Joshua Tepfer, an attorney with The Exoneration Project who has worked with many people convicted due to Watts and his crew, said that Friday’s hearing would be the last of a number of similar hearings in recent years in which large numbers of victims have had their convictions thrown out. He said only a few cases remain.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A report from the Domestic Violence Network analyzing crisis calls to service providers in central Indiana shows calls to the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department nearly doubled during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The report recorded 2020 data from service providers across central Indiana, which includes Marion, Hamilton, Hendricks, Hancock, Boone, Johnson, Madison, Morgan, Monroe and Shelby counties. In 2020, there were approximately 13,500 calls made to five area agencies: the Julian Center, Sheltering Wings, Alternatives, Inc., Families First, Prevail and Beacon of Hope. (Families First has since merged with Children’s Bureau; the agency is now known as Firefly Children & Family Alliance.) Kelly McBride, executive director of Domestic Violence Network, said the pandemic did not cause domestic violence in central Indiana, but the effects of the stay-at-home orders exacerbated problems that had already been there. The report specifies that correlation does not equal causation in regard to COVID-19 and that COVID-19’s effect on domestic violence will be studied for years to come. COVID-19 stay-at-home orders put abusers and families into enclosed situations at home and also cited the stressors of people losing their jobs and increased alcohol use during the pandemic.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A check of the state’s online court system shows a unique name for the prosecutor in hundreds of cases: the Easter Bunny. The Iowa Capital Dispatch reports that on April 4, online docket sheets for hundreds of Polk County cases were revised to indicate the prosecution had been transferred from an assistant county attorney to “Easter Santa Bunny.” Bret Lucas, an assistant county attorney, said the situation stems from a recent realignment of cases within the county attorney’s office. Some cases were “transferred” to the Easter Bunny until all the work on the digital case transfer could be finished. Lucas said it appears that the Judicial Branch and the IT department decided to use the fake placeholder name. Stacy Curtis, a supervisor for the criminal division of the Polk County Clerk of Court’s Office, said the references to the Easter Bunny should not have been visible to the public.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Housing developers will now be able to get state help for home projects related to economic development, the governor’s office announced Thursday. The Startup Housing Opportunity Venture Loan program is intended to help build houses to address the needs of communities across Kansas, Gov. Laura Kelly said. “A shortage of quality, affordable housing is a barrier to economic growth and development throughout the state – and particularly in rural Kansas,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. “Affordable housing is a vital component of recruiting and retaining workers, families, and entrepreneurs to help rural and urban Kansas thrive. We can’t capitalize on our record-breaking economic success if we don’t have affordable housing options for our workforce, and I’m pleased this new program will be another step in addressing this challenge.” The SHOVL program will provide funding to housing developers for expenses incurred before the closing of permanent financing for housing developments. No-interest loans of up to $25,000, with a required 20% match, available to private developers, nonprofit organizations and local governments looking to construct housing developments in communities with populations of fewer than 10,000 people.\n\nKentucky\n\nHodgenville: The Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park is seeking volunteers for its first Park Care Day. The volunteer day is being held Saturday at the Lincoln boyhood home site at Knob Creek, the park said in a statement. There will be a variety of projects for volunteers to tackle, including planting an interpretive garden at Knob Creek. Park staff researched to find heirloom variety seeds close to what the Lincoln family might have grown while living at the Knob Creek Farm, the statement said. Volunteers will plant seeds that include Bloody Butcher Corn, Scarlet Pole Runner Beans and Connecticut Field Pumpkins. Those interested in participating are encouraged to register by calling the Birthplace Visitor Center.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A 4-year-old girl is dead after her grandmother allegedly forced her to drink a bottle of whiskey while her mother watched, according to police. Sgt. L’Jean McKneely, a Baton Rouge police spokesperson, told news outlets the little girl’s grandmother, Roxanne Record, 53, and mother, Kadjah Record, 29, were arrested Friday, each on a charge of first-degree murder. It was unknown if either of them had an attorney who could speak on their behalf. Officers were sent to a Baton Rouge home about 11 a.m. Thursday after reports of an unresponsive child. The child, 4-year-old China Record, was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner’s Office said an autopsy showed a cause of death was acute alcohol poisoning. The little girl had a blood-alcohol level of 0.680%, more than eight times the 0.08% driving limit for an adult, authorities said. While investigating, detectives say they learned the victim’s grandmother forced her to drink a bottle of the alcohol while the mother watched. The investigation remains ongoing.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state has created a website – maine.gov/reliefchecks – to help residents collect their $850 relief checks included in a $1.2 billion supplemental budget signed by the governor last week. The website aims to answer commonly asked questions surrounding eligibility, timing of checks and filing taxes. “We want to make sure that every eligible person is able to receive this assistance, and we are hopeful that this website can help accomplish that by answering some of the most common questions Maine people may have,” Gov. Janet Mills said in a statement. The money accounts for more than half of the $1.2 billion budget. Mills proposed returning much of the money to Mainers as a historic surplus ballooned thanks to federal spending and rosier-than-expected revenue forecasts. The checks will be mailed to more than 850,000 individuals, but filing an income tax return is a prerequisite. The state is giving late-filers until Oct. 31 to submit their tax returns. Income limits for the payments are $100,000 for an individual or married filing separately; up to $150,000 for head of household; and $200,000 for couples filing jointly. The first round of checks will go out in June, and additional checks will roll out through the end of the year.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: An area teen who created a COVID-19 kit for teachers has been recognized as one of 25 Prudential Emerging Visionaries from around the country. Arthur Wang, 17, realized the severity of the disease months before most of his classmates when he got updates about the coronavirus from his uncle, who is a doctor in China. That inspired the Columbia resident to come up with an effort to better support teachers and other workers in Howard County, where he is a junior at River Hill High School, and beyond. “We wanted to help the community,” he said. “I realized how hard it was for the teachers to switch from virtual to in-person classes. Some teachers said it was like flying a plane with no direction.” Wang inspired 42 other students in the county to form the nonprofit Clarksville Youth Care Group. The organization has donated more than 1,400 protective kits to teachers at 62 schools. And he’s not done yet. The kits include a handmade colorful cloth mask in assorted designs that features a pocket where a filter can be inserted for additional protection; an “ear saver,” which reduces the strain that masks place on the ears; a thank-you card; and a mask lanyard. Each kit takes about three hours to make. Wang, who previously raised $13,000 in an effort to make 3,600 face shields that were donated to 101 hospitals, clinics, dental offices, urgent care centers and first responders in seven states, raised $5,000 for the project focused on educators.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The mayor released a plan, on Earth Day, to address extreme heat caused by climate change in disadvantaged city neighborhoods. The Heat Resilience Solutions for Boston plan presents a number of strategies that Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu says will help build a “more just, equitable, and resilient Boston.” The plan focuses on five so-called environmental justice communities that experience greater burdens as temperatures rise: Chinatown, Dorchester, East Boston, Mattapan, and Roxbury. It also includes citywide strategies that Wu said her administration will pursue, such as distributing “pop-up cooling kits” that include a hose, misters and a tent to community organizations that have public events this summer. Wu said her administration will also launch a design challenge for heat resilient “cool” bus stops and educate property owners on the benefits of installing so-called cool roofs that increase energy efficiency. And a new Boston Extreme Temperatures Response Task Force will help coordinate the city’s efforts as it’s faced more hot days and nights over the past decade than any decade in the previous 50 years, Wu said. The heat plan is a part of Climate Ready Boston, ongoing efforts to prepare for sea level rise, coastal storms, extreme precipitation, extreme heat and other impacts.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: The Rev. Al Sharpton demanded Friday that authorities publicly identify the officer who killed Patrick Lyoya, a Black man and native of Congo who was fatally shot in the back of the head after a struggle. Sharpton’s comments at Lyoya’s funeral renewed demands by Lyoya’s family members and activists. He told the roughly 1,000 people gathered that authorities cannot set a precedent of withholding the names of officers who kill people. Police in Grand Rapids have said they will withhold the officer’s name unless he is charged with a crime, which they describe as a long-standing practice that applies to the public as well as city employees. “Every time a young Black man or woman is arrested in this town, you put their name all over the news. Every time we’re suspected of something, you put our name out there,” Sharpton said. “How dare you hold the name of a man that killed this man? We want his name!” Mourners at Renaissance Church of God in Christ, many wearing T-shirts or sweatshirts bearing Lyoya’s picture, stood and applauded. In a statement Friday, City Manager Mark Washington acknowledged the demands and said he would discuss the matter with the police chief and human resources officials.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A 13-year-old boy will soon earn his bachelor’s degree from college, with a major in physics and a minor in math. Elliott Tanner is maintaining a 3.78 grade point average at the University of Minnesota and participating in undergraduate research while also tutoring classmates. He wants to be a high-energy theoretical physicist and ultimately a professor of physics at the university. “I have an incredible passion for physics,” he said. “It’s been one of my favorite things to do.” Elliott’s mom, Michelle Tanner, said he started reading and doing math by age 3. Following a few years of home schooling and a high school curriculum that took him two years to complete, he began taking college classes when he was 9. “People who hear Elliott’s story say he doesn’t get to be a kid, or he grew up too fast,” Michelle said. “He still very much is a kid, and the only difference is he goes to school in a different building.” Besides being on the verge of graduating, he has been accepted into the University of Minnesota’s Physics PhD program. Now his parents are trying to figure out how to pay for it. “We’re just trying to explore all our options and coming up with dead ends,” Michelle said. “Trying to apply for any scholarships, fellowships, grants, and we have not been successful.”\n\nMississippi\n\nMoney: Stymied in their calls for a renewed investigation into the killing of Emmett Till, relatives and activists are advocating another possible path toward accountability: They want authorities to launch a kidnapping prosecution against the woman who set off the lynching by accusing the Black Chicago teen of improper advances in 1955. Carolyn Bryant Donham was named nearly 67 years ago in a warrant that accused her in Till’s abduction in Mississippi – even before his mangled body was found in a river, FBI records show – yet she was never arrested or brought to trial in a case that shocked the world for its brutality. Authorities at the time said the woman had two young children, and they did not want to bother her. Donham’s then-husband and another man were acquitted of murder. Relatives of Till still prefer a murder prosecution, but there is no evidence the kidnapping warrant was ever dismissed, so it could be used to arrest Donham and finally get her before a criminal court, said Jaribu Hill, an attorney working with the Till family. “This warrant is a stepping stone toward that,” she said. “Because warrants do not expire, we want to see that warrant served on her.” There are plenty of roadblocks. Witnesses have died in the decades since Till was lynched, and it’s unclear what happened to evidence collected by investigators.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The city has agreed to reinstall two paving stones that contained a reference to a Confederate general to settle a lawsuit filed after the stones were removed, according to attorneys in the case. Edith Vogel, a former City Council member, sued the city and Mayor Carrie Tergin in March after the pavers were removed. Vogel paid for the stones to be installed at a park on a city greenway known as Adrian’s Island as part of a fundraising campaign. Vogel’s attorneys at Bradbury Law Firm said a federal judge approved a settlement Thursday, KOMU reports. Under the settlement, the city agreed to reinstall the pavers within 15 days and pay Vogel’s attorney’s fees. Vogel contended in her lawsuit that her free speech rights were violated when the stones were removed. The stones read: “Union Camp Lillie notes: deciding against attack the confederate army under Gen. Sterling Price turned from Jefferson City Oct. 7, 1864.” The City Council voted in October 2021 to remove a similar paving stone from a roadway. Although she is not required to do so, Vogel said she will donate to the Parks Foundation $2,000, which was the amount the city refunded to her when it removed the pavers.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The administrator of the state psychiatric hospital is leaving his post amid the facility’s loss of Medicare and Medicaid funding for repeated failures to meet health and safety standards, the state health department said Thursday. Kyle Fouts, who has led the Montana State Hospital in Warm Springs since 2019, will begin work May 9 as administrator at the Intensive Behavior Center in Boulder, Colorado, the Montana State News Bureau reports. The center is a 12-bed, short-term treatment facility for people with intellectual disabilities. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had found patients at the Montana State Hospital were in “immediate jeopardy” several times in recent months before revoking the hospital’s federal funding effective April 12. Payments for patients who were already at the hospital continues for another 30 days, but no new patients would qualify for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursements. The hospital’s deficiencies included failing to separate patients with COVID-19 from those who weren’t sick. Three patients died of COVID-19. Another patient died after repeated falls. The hospital, which had about 142 patients in early April, is also short-staffed and has relied heavily on traveling staff, the agency found.\n\nNebraska\n\nCambridge: Wind-driven wildfires sweeping through parts of Nebraska contributed to the death of one person and injured at least three firefighters, authorities said Sunday. The person who died was in Red Willow County, in the southwest corner of the state, Nebraska Emergency Management Agency spokeswoman Jodie Fawl said. Fawl said she didn’t have details about that person or where the firefighters were injured, though she said their injuries were not believed to be life-threatening. Blazes have been reported in 12 counties around the state since Friday. The state agency said they were still burning Saturday night in five counties in Nebraska’s southwest: Perkins, Hayes, Furnas, Red Willow and Frontier counties. The agency didn’t provide estimates of the total area that had been burned or the number of homes or other structures that had been destroyed. Several small towns, including Cambridge, Bartley, Indianola and Wilsonville, in Nebraska’s southwest and Macy in its northeast, were forced to temporarily evacuate because of the fires. The evacuation orders were lifted Saturday. The Nebraska National Guard deployed three helicopters and several support trucks to help battle the blazes.\n\nNevada\n\nCrystal Bay: For nearly eight decades, the Tahoe Biltmore has been a familiar fixture for motorists rounding the curved stretch of pavement on Nevada State Route 28 that led to the property. Come 5 a.m. Saturday, the long-standing hotel-casino will close its doors one final time. “It’s been 76 years,” said Janet Fogerson, controller for the property. “I mean, the Rat Pack used to go across the street.” But not even Frank Sinatra and his crew can win against Father Time. The same can be said about the Tahoe Biltmore, whose old-school charm will soon yield to a more modern resort and residential project known as Boulder Bay. Chalk it up to the steady march of growth and progress, something from which even idyllic Lake Tahoe is not immune. “I have been up here for 42 years, so I have seen a lot of growth, and I have seen a lot of changes,” Fogerson said. “But when that building comes down, it’s going to be emotional.” The Tahoe Biltmore first opened in 1946. The crew celebrated one last hurrah by holding a goodbye party for the property this past Saturday, with cash drawings, free food and live entertainment.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A bill adding an exception to the state’s new abortion ban for cases in which the fetus has been diagnosed with “abnormalities incompatible with life” has been sent to the desk of Gov. Chris Sununu, who said he would sign it. Since Jan. 1, New Hampshire has outlawed abortion after 24 weeks’ gestation, with exceptions only for pregnancies that threaten the mother’s life or health. Doctors who provide late-term abortions can face felony charges, and ultrasounds are required before any abortion. With nine Republicans joining all 10 Democrats, the state Senate voted 19-5 in favor of a bill to limit the use of ultrasounds and add the “abnormalities incompatible with life” exception. The bill passed the House last month. Sen. Becky Whitley, D-Hopkinton, said she was grateful to women who shared heartbreaking stories, including a Brookline woman who learned 21 weeks into her pregnancy that one of her twins would not survive on her own after birth. “We know that there are many more women who have these deeply personal stories who may not be comfortable attending a public hearing who can attest that, yes, these circumstances are rare, but they happen to real families,” she said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nCamden: Passaic County Prosecutor Camelia Valdes allegedly froze out and retaliated against a media specialist in her office who twice refused to process compact discs that contained inappropriate pictures of her and her husband, according to a lawsuit filed last Monday in state Superior Court. The specialist, Henry Hernandez, of Clifton, claims in his suit that the retaliation worsened during the COVID-19 crisis. His bosses disregarded his medical issues, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart problems, and refused to install plastic desk barriers in his unit, the lawsuit said. They also unjustly docked his pay, isolated him by banning visitors to his office and ignored his concerns about being reinfected with the virus after he recovered from the illness in December 2021, according to court papers. In the five-count suit, Hernandez accused Valdes and Christopher Drelich, the county’s chief of investigators and his superior’s boss, of intending to cause him severe emotional distress. He also claimed they violated the state’s Conscientious Employee Protection Act and the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination. Hernandez wants a judge to levy punitive damages, interest costs, attorneys’ fees and any other relief, the suit said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Federal authorities are taking to the airwaves to call attention to unsolved homicide and missing person cases on the largest Native American reservation in the U.S. The FBI announced last week that it’s running a 60-second radio ad in the Navajo language to call attention to what family members and advocacy groups have described as a crisis that is affecting Indian Country. Airing twice a day on an AM radio station broadcasting from the Navajo capital of Window Rock, Arizona, the spot features a plea from the mother of Lee Michael Pahe, who was found fatally shot last summer in Naschitti, New Mexico. “You don’t have to understand Navajo to feel the emotion of the mother who speaks about the loss of her son in this ad,” Special Agent in Charge Raul Bujanda of the Albuquerque FBI Division said in a statement. “Violent crime affects everyone the same way, and everyone deserves justice.” The radio spot comes as New Mexico implements legislation adopted earlier this year to ensure more effective coordination among law enforcement agencies when it comes to missing Native Americans or unsolved homicides. State Attorney General Hector Balderas has met with victims regarding obstacles to reporting, investigation and other issues that they have experienced.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state could allow for the automatic sealing of some criminal records, make it harder to evict tenants, and ban gas and oil hookups in new buildings under bills that advocacy groups want lawmakers to pass in this year’s legislative session. The Democratic-led Legislature passed a $220 billion budget this month that boosted pay for health care and home care workers, shaved 16 cents off the cost of a gallon of gas through December, and tweaked a landmark bail law. But the budget excluded several criminal justice and environmental policy proposals that had received support from Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state Senate. State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said he opposed using the budget to pass new policies. Lawmakers could also pass a bill that could nix former Lt. Gov. Brian Benjamin, a Democrat, from the June primary ballot. Benjamin resigned April 12 in the wake of his arrest in a federal corruption investigation.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: A smarter-than-average bear took a tourist jaunt through downtown – even taking care to use crosswalks at intersections – before police guided it back to nature. Asheville police said the call they received Thursday about a bear milling through downtown was the third such call they’d received in a three-week span. Video posted by the police department on its Facebook page Friday shows the bear waiting at a crosswalk and looking both ways before crossing the intersection. In another clip he climbs a tree in a small park space. Officers guided the bear, which was wearing a tracking collar, back into a wooded area.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A group that wants to change the state constitution to require voter approval of constitutional amendments from a simple majority to 60% and limit a measure to a single subject is a step closer to bringing the matter to a public vote. Secretary of State Al Jaeger on Friday said the sponsoring committee delivered 910 petitions with a claimed 33,624 signatures, just over the 31,000 signatures that must be approved to get the proposed measure on the November ballot. Jaeger approved the petitions for circulation a year ago. His office has 30 days to determine if the measure qualifies for the ballot. The citizen-led Protect North Dakota’s Constitution believes the voter threshold for amending the state constitution isn’t high enough. The group said a dozen constitutional amendments proposed since 2010 have been successful. Backers say the measures also often have contained multiple issues. Citizen initiatives allow residents to bypass lawmakers and get proposed state laws and constitutional amendments on ballots if they gather enough signatures from voters.\n\nOhio\n\nWright-Patterson Air Force Base: A high-ranking Air Force official has been convicted by a military judge of one of three specifications of abusive sexual contact in the first-ever military trial of an Air Force general. The charge faced by Maj. Gen. William Cooley during the weeklong court-martial at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base had three specifications, one alleging a forcible kiss and two alleging forcible touching in 2018. Cooley was convicted Saturday of the forcible kissing specification but acquitted of the other two. Officials said the verdict marks the first court-martial trial and conviction of a general officer in the Air Force’s 75-year history. A former commander of Air Force Research Laboratory, Cooley was charged with abusive sexual contact in an encounter with a woman who gave him a ride after a backyard barbecue in New Mexico nearly four years ago. Officials said the woman is a civilian who is not a Department of Defense employee. Cooley is set to be sentenced Monday morning and could face as much as seven years in jail as well as loss of rank, pay and benefits. Cooley had the option of a trial by court member jurors or by military judge, and he chose to have the case heard by the judge.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Enoch Kelly Haney – a Native American artist, Seminole Nation chief and state lawmaker – has died at age 81. Haney’s death was announced Saturday by Brian Palmer, assistant chief of the Seminole Nation. A cause of death was not immediately released. “With a heavy heart, the Seminole Nation woke to the news of the passing of Chief Kelly Haney. An inspiration to many, an accomplished artist, his work with the State and later as Chief highlighted his career, but his greatest achievement is that of family. Keep his family in prayer and may they find comfort in knowing the Seminole Nation and Indian Country mourns his loss,” Palmer said in a statement on Facebook. In a tweet Saturday, Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt said Haney’s “contributions to our state are mighty.” Haney, who had most recently lived in Norman, grew up in Seminole. His grandfather was the chief of the Seminole Tribe in the 1940s. A Democrat, Haney was a Methodist minister prior to entering politics in 1978 as co-chair of then-Lt. Gov. George Nigh’s first of four successful campaigns for governor. Haney’s 17-foot sculpture “The Guardian,” a towering statue of a Native American, was placed atop the state Capitol dome in 2002.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The growth of the state’s wolf population slowed significantly last year because 21 animals were poisoned by poachers, hit by cars, or killed by wildlife officials after they attacked livestock, state wildlife authorities said Wednesday. The 2021 census counted 175 wolves, up just two animals from the previous year, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife said. The number of documented packs decreased to 21 from 22 after eight wolves in eastern Oregon were illegally poisoned, wiping out an entire pack. The number of breeding pairs of wolves was down to 16, from 17 in 2020. It was the slowest rate of wolf growth since 2016, although agency officials did add that wolves expanded their range into four new areas of activity in rural areas in Jefferson, Klamath, Grant and Union counties. The count only captures wolves observed through visual observations, tracks and remote camera photographs, and the actual number of wolves in Oregon is higher, officials stressed. Just 13% of the wolves in Oregon are in the western part of the state. Conservation group Cascadia Wildlands said the high number of wolf deaths at the hands of humans was unacceptable. “Oregon’s wolf population simply cannot sustain such high levels of human-caused wolf mortality,” said Nick Cady, Cascadia Wildlands’ legal director. “The state needs to both seriously prosecute poachers and stop killing wolves to subsidize commercial livestock operations.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city abandoned its indoor mask mandate Friday, just days after becoming the first U.S. metropolis to reimpose compulsory masking in response to an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. City officials who had previously stressed the need to head off a new wave of coronavirus infections by requiring people to mask up indoors abruptly called it off after what they said was an unexpected drop in the number of people in the hospital and a leveling-off of new infections. The city had taken plenty of heat for the renewed masking order, with a lawsuit already filed and two of the three leading Democratic candidates for Pennsylvania’s open U.S. Senate seat expressing opposition to it at a debate Thursday night. But city officials insisted Friday that their decision was about the data, not any external legal or political pressure. “I had said when I announced this that if we didn’t see hospitalizations rising that we needed to rethink this and that we shouldn’t have a mandate. So that’s what we’re doing today,” the city’s health commissioner, Dr. Cheryl Bettigole, said at a virtual news conference Friday. Still, the city’s on-again, off-again decision-making left some people scratching their heads, with restaurant manager Jesse Andreozzi saying officials were “flip-floppy” when it came to masks.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city’s taxpayers own a desirable piece of property right by the ocean in Narragansett – they just can’t use it. For close to a decade, the city’s summer camp at the southern tip of Point Judith has been boarded up and closed to the public. And although Providence is now awash in $166 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funds, the city currently has no plans to use any of that money to reopen it, according to a spokesman for Mayor Jorge Elorza. Public records show Providence is currently paying $13,061 a year in taxes to the Town of Narragansett for the property, which is valued at $1,092,100. “I would love to see the property rehabbed so that the residents of Providence can go back to enjoying day trips there,” said City Councilman Michael Correia, who pushed for years to reopen the seaside camp. “I do have to admit that it has fallen off the radar since the pandemic hit.” The property is typically referred to as “Camp Cronin” – a frequent source of confusion, since it abuts the much larger Camp Cronin Fishing Area, which is state-owned and open to the public. Providence once owned both parts of Camp Cronin, purchased from the federal government after World War II. It served as a summer camp that got inner-city children out of their sweltering neighborhoods, regardless of parents’ ability to pay. Over the years, the city also routinely bused nursing home residents and other older people to Camp Cronin so they could take in the fresh air, enjoy a cookout and play bingo.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Supporters of a bill to allow women to get birth control pills at pharmacies without a doctor’s prescription are trying to get it passed before this year’s session ends. A state House subcommittee on Wednesday approved the bill, sending it to the chamber’s full medical committee. The bill has already passed the Senate, but there are just nine regular legislative days left in the General Assembly’s 2022 session. Pharmacists could choose whether to participate in the program, which allows them to give birth control pills or other hormonal contraceptives to women over 18 without a doctor’s visit, The Post and Courier reports. Even in areas without doctors, there are pharmacies close by, state Rep. Russell Ott told the newspaper. “If we want to get serious about cutting down on abortions, if we’re going to decrease the number of unwanted or unplanned pregnancies, we need to get real,” said Ott, D-St. Matthews. The bill unanimously passed the Senate last year. Sen. Tom Davis, R-Beaufort, introduced it after the General Assembly passed a bill greatly restricting abortions, saying it was another logical step to stopping unwanted pregnancies. The only GOP member of the House subcommittee voted against the bill. Rep. Joe Bustos, R-Mount Pleasant, said a doctor should be involved “anytime you’re putting chemicals into your body.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A newly formed organization wants to put a question on the November ballot that would forbid the construction or operation of any new slaughterhouses within city limits. It’s a ballot question aimed squarely at Wholestone Farms, a Nebraska-based pork processor that announced plans last year to build a $500 million plant in northeastern Sioux Falls. The executive director of Citizens for a Sustainable Sioux Falls called the project “a step backwards” for the quality of life in Sioux Falls that was going to “slide in under the radar,” listing concerns including odor, water quality and affordable housing. Wholestone’s board chair, on the other hand, said the company is an open book and going above and beyond to be a good neighbor, while questioning who exactly is funding the opposition to the plant. Citizens for a Sustainable Sioux Falls has been pushing back against the plant since at least March 11, when it sent out a press release entitled “New Survey: Sioux Falls Residents Raise Alarm on Mega-Slaughterhouse.” The group is headed by Robert Peterson, who has worked as a field director for Marty Jackley’s gubernatorial campaign and as a public policy and outreach manager at the South Dakota Treasurer’s Office.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Prosecutors will no longer pursue illegal voter registration charges against a woman who was granted a new trial after she challenged her jury conviction, a district attorney said Friday. Charges against Black Lives Matter activist Pamela Moses, 44, are being dismissed, and she will no longer face a second trial “in the interest of judicial economy,” Shelby County district attorney Amy Weirich said in a statement. Moses, who had prior felonies, was convicted in November of registering to vote illegally in Memphis in 2019 and was sentenced Jan. 31 to six years and one day in prison. She has said she was unaware she was ineligible to vote. At the time, legal experts said her sentence was excessive. Moses filed a motion asking for a new trial. In February, Criminal Court Judge Mark Ward overturned her conviction and granted Moses a second trial, which now won’t take place. In all, Moses has spent 82 days in custody on the case, “which is sufficient,” Weirich said in her statement. Moses’ previous felony convictions permanently barred her from voting. In 2015, she pleaded guilty to two felonies as well as three misdemeanors and was placed on probation for seven years. Moses said the Tennessee Department of Correction gave her a certificate saying her probation had ended – leading her to believe she could begin working to restore her voting rights – but then rescinded the certificate.\n\nTexas\n\nEagle Pass: A Texas National Guard member went missing Friday after going into the river along the U.S.-Mexico border to help a migrant who was struggling to swim across, according to a local sheriff. A woman trying to cross the Rio Grande from Mexico made it about halfway to the other side when she appeared to begin going under the water, Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber said. The rescue attempt happened near Eagle Pass at a section of the river known for strong currents. “He jumped in the river,” Schmerber said. “They never saw him come out.” He said the Guard member, who has not been identified, took off his jacket and left his radio before going into the water. The woman made it across and was placed in the custody of Border Patrol, said Schmerber, whose department was involved early in the search. The Texas National Guard said in a statement that state troopers and Border Patrol agents were also helping. The attempted water rescue happened about 8:30 a.m., according to Schmerber. The Guard member was assigned to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s sprawling border security mission, known as Operation Lone Star, which has deployed thousands of Guard members across Texas’ 1,200-mile southern border since launching last year. The mission has come under scrutiny over migrants sitting in border jails for months on trespassing charges and low morale among Guard members over living conditions, long deployments and little to do.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Democrats pulling hard to defeat Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Lee took the unusual step Saturday of spurning a party hopeful to instead get behind an independent, former presidential candidate Evan McMullin. Democrats were swayed by calls from prominent members who said McMullin, a conservative who captured a significant share of the vote in Utah in 2016, was the best chance to beat Lee in the deeply conservative state that hasn’t elected a Democratic U.S. senator for more than 50 years. “I want to represent you. I’m committed to that. I will maintain my independence,” McMullin told Democratic delegates. Lee also faced two GOP challengers at his party’s nominating conventions. He handily won in front of the right-leaning crowd with more than 70% of the vote. But those candidates will still appear on the primary ballot because they used the state’s other path to the primary ballot and gathered signatures. Former state lawmaker Becky Edwards garnered about 12% of the vote Saturday. Former gubernatorial deputy chief of staff Ally Isom came in third.\n\nVermont\n\nNorthfield: Three Norwich University students are facing criminal charges and others being ticketed for hazing after an investigation into allegations of branding and waterboarding involving the women’s rugby team at the private military college, town police said Friday. One 22-year-old student is charged with simple assault, and another is charged with reckless endangerment in the March 20 incident. Another student, 21, is charged with both simple assault and reckless endangerment, according to the police department. They and three other students are being ticketed for hazing, a civil infraction. Five of the students are members of the women’s rugby team, and one is on the women’s lacrosse team, Norwich said. The civil infraction is handled by the Judicial Bureau and carries a fine of $1,000 to $5,000, police said. Norwich said in a statement that it has “zero-tolerance regarding hazing misconduct from our students” and will take appropriate disciplinary action now that its investigations are completed. Northfield Officer Karie Tucker said in an affidavit that she went to the school March 20 for a report of someone being held at knifepoint. Tucker said she spoke two days later to the woman, who reported she had been “branded” using pliers and a lighter by other members of the rugby team.\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: A local school board has decided against buying some new social studies textbooks because of concerns from some citizens that one of the books encourages “divisive teachings,” including critical race theory. The Williamsburg-James City County school board voted 4-3 on Tuesday not to buy the books, The Virginian-Pilot reports. Board Chairman Greg Dowell said he found nothing wrong with the book’s overall content. But he said he couldn’t vote “yes” because of the controversy around it and the possibility that it could cause further “community division.” “We are transitioning out of a period of discord in our community and our country, and that takes all of us,” Dowell said. The textbook of concern is “Government in America: People, Politics and Policy,” which is often taught in Advanced Placement government and politics classes. It examines current events and public policy, while offering examples of political unrest. One citizen at Tuesday’s board meeting claimed the book was biased and left-leaning. Another said the cover photograph was a form of indoctrination. The photo is of a protest outside the U.S. Capitol with signs reading, “Silence is violence,” “No justice no peace,” and “Stop killing Black people.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The clock ran down at the end of the homecoming game, and spectators stormed the football field, knocking over members of the high school band – all to gather around an assistant coach as he took a knee in prayer, surrounded by uniformed players. Six years later, after losing his coaching job and repeatedly losing in court, that former coach, Joe Kennedy, will take his arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday, saying the Bremerton School District violated his First Amendment rights by refusing to let him continue praying at midfield immediately after games. Four conservative justices have already expressed concerns with how his case has been handled. Kennedy’s effort to get his job back helped earn him an appearance at a 2016 Donald Trump rally and quickly became a cultural touchstone, pitting the religious liberties of public school employees against what his critics describe as long-standing principles separating church and state and protecting students from religious coercion. Lawyers for the school district say officials had no problem letting Kennedy pray separately from students or letting him return to the field to pray after the students had left. But allowing him to pray at midfield immediately after games with students there risked being seen as government endorsement of religion.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: All 55 counties in the state will offer early voting for this year’s primary election, which is being held May 10. Early voting starts Wednesday and continues through May 7, including the last two Saturdays before the primary, Secretary of State Mac Warner’s office said. Voters may cast an early ballot at the county courthouse, an annex or a designated voting location during normal business hours. On Saturdays, voting will be from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. West Virginia’s primary is semi-open, meaning voters who aren’t affiliated with a recognized political party may participate in the primary of the party of their choice. Unaffiliated voters must ask poll workers for the specific party’s ballot they desire, Warner’s office said. More information about in-person and absentee voting and a list of early voting sites are available online at GoVoteWV.com. Voters can also check registration at the site.\n\nWisconsin\n\nFarmington: Management of a park listed on the National Register of Historic Places has been returned to the state in hopes of better preserving more than two dozen Native American effigy mounds. The 22-acre Lizard Mound Park in Washington County was first designated as a state park in 1950. The property and its 28 effigy mounds have been owned and managed by the county since 1980 but now have been transferred back to the state’s care. Lizard Mound in Farmington has one of the largest and most intact effigy mound groups in the country, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. Kettle Moraine State Forest-Northern Unit superintendent Samantha Lindquist will oversee Lizard Mound and said it won’t be run like a typical state park. “It’s not going to be managed as, say, a recreation facility,” she said. “There’s going to be a few picnic tables, but it’s not going to become overly developed. There’s not going to be all these special uses of the site. The site is an ancestral burial ground. It has cultural and historical significance. So it’s going to be preserved in that way.” As a burial ground, the Lizard Mound area is considered sacred by Native people. The Ho-Chunk consider the mound builders to be among their ancestors. While conical and linear mounds can be found throughout the Midwest, effigy mounds are unique to southern Wisconsin – the ancestral homeland of the Ho-Chunk people.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: U.S. Rep.

It also could be riskier.\n\nSaturday will be unlike any Independence Day in recent memory. From Atlanta to San Diego, hundreds of fireworks shows have been canceled as officials restrict large gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic, especially as infections surge across the U.S.\n\nWith fewer professional celebrations, many Americans are bound to shoot off fireworks in backyards and at block parties. And they already are: Sales have been booming. Some public safety officials say consumer fireworks in more hands means greater danger of injuries and wildfires in parts of the country experiencing dry, scorching weather.\n\n“The general public is buying more than ever before,” said Steve Houser, president of the National Fireworks Association.\n\nWhile it's not clear exactly what is driving people to shops, some sellers think fireworks are a diversion for people who have been stuck at home during the pandemic.\n\n“We’re seeing new customers ... who usually don’t come to the fireworks tents,” said Robert Fletcher of Desert Sky Fireworks, which has locations across Arizona.\n\nCities like Los Angeles and San Francisco have received more complaints of illegal fireworks this summer than in previous years. While most states allow at least some types of consumer fireworks, many cities prohibit them, even non-explosive sparklers. But they acknowledge it is difficult to stop people from buying them just outside city limits where they're legal.\n\nIn Arizona, which has battled wildfires for weeks, thousands of people have signed an online petition calling for Gov. Doug Ducey to ban fireworks this summer.\n\nDelanie Thompson, 28, said she started the petition after seeing a neighbor’s house engulfed in flames last week during a wildfire in Phoenix. She said she and her boyfriend were forced to evacuate their home for 30 hours.\n\nThompson said she got angry when she later saw a roadside tent selling fireworks in a nearby town.\n\nThe Fourth of July is “about our independence,” she said. “Not just about fireworks.”\n\nAuthorities in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale seized nearly 4,000 pounds of banned fireworks this week after getting a tip about an illegal sales operation at a house.\n\nFireworks can be a big danger as many parts of the American West struggle with drought, turning vegetation into tinder for flames.\n\n“It definitely compounds the risk for starting wildfires,” Jessica Gardetto, a spokeswoman for the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, said of fireworks.\n\nThe center is predicting more wildfires than usual in July across a swath of the U.S. West. And fires started by retail fireworks tend to burn near homes, said Gardetto, who has heard them explode every day for the last week in her neighborhood.\n\nFires are just one cause for concern. Some doctors fear injuries will increase this year as more people experiment with fireworks at home.\n\nIn Ontario, California, a man in his 30s had his left hand blown off Thursday while lighting illegal fireworks, police said. He lit an aerial device but it didn't go off immediately, only detonating after he approached it, authorities said.\n\nDr. Erin Miller, a hand surgeon at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, said she amputated 42 fingers due to fireworks injuries last year while she was on call during the Fourth of July.\n\nShe has simple advice for revelers: Do not use larger fireworks like mortars and cherry bombs.\n\n“Do not mix alcohol or any other substances if you're choosing to use fireworks,” she added.\n\nBut not everyone is as alarmed by the increased interest in consumer fireworks.\n\n“It’s business as usual for us,” said Chris James, a spokesman for the Glendale Fire Department.\n\nThe agency will have extra units on standby like usual for the holiday, he said. He recommends having water and a fire extinguisher nearby.\n\n“It’s basic common sense we try to preach,” James said.\n\nFire departments and many sellers also urge people to have a sober “designated shooter,” said Houser of the National Fireworks Association.\n\nSome in the industry believe monthslong lockdowns during the pandemic explain the increased interest in blowing off steam with fireworks.\n\n“We’ve all been cooped up at home. We all have a lot of added stresses,\" said James Fuller, a spokesman for TNT Fireworks. “I think a lot of folks want to feel good again.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2021/07/13/fireworks-smoke-laced-toxins-can-have-impact-your-health/7912908002/", "title": "Fireworks' smoke is laced with toxins, can have impact on your health", "text": "The July Fourth holiday was a weekend of barbecues, time with family and fireworks displays by starlight. But the holiday also sparked something else: a question about the impacts of fireworks.\n\nFor many, the bright lights of fireworks disappear as quickly as they came. But the explosions involve far more than just the flash. They leave something that’s a little harder to see in the dark: smoke. That’s the faint burning smell you might sometimes notice when you or your neighbors set off fireworks, or perhaps the haze you see when you go to a city display.\n\nThat smoke is air pollution made up of harmful particulates and toxic chemicals that can hang in the air and get into the water, soil and your lungs.\n\nI assure you we are not trying to put a damper on your Fourth of July plans for future years, but we do want you to be in-the-know. Which is why for this edition of the Scrub Hub, we are answering the question: Can fireworks hurt your health and the environment? And if so, how?\n\nShort Answer: Pollution levels skyrocket\n\nThe data makes it pretty clear, the answer is yes.\n\nFireworks season kicks off around Memorial Day and runs through the end of July, and it often shows a bit of a bump in particulate levels during the evenings as people set off the explosives in celebration of summer. Still, sensors managed by Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis across the city as well as the state’s air monitors around Indiana show air quality being good in the first few days of July.\n\nBut the numbers “go off the charts” from July 3 through July 5, according to John Blair, who leads a southern Indiana environmental nonprofit called ValleyWatch. And “of course, July 4 is the worst,” he added.\n\nLuckily, the numbers don’t literally go off the charts, as Blair said, so we can see just how high they spike. For reference, “good” for particulate matter is less than 12, based on the 24-hour average. Across the two dozen IUPUI sensors around the city, almost all show the half-hour average of particulate matter reaching levels above 150, some even nearing 250, in the late hours of July 4 and early morning of July 5.\n\nThose levels are pushing into the “unhealthy” and “very unhealthy” range.\n\nThis isn’t just true of Indianapolis: Monitors around the corners of Indiana show similar results in the days around July 4. Research in other cities across the country and world also show that fireworks can generate eight times the average particulate matter concentration during and immediately after the display.\n\nThis effect also is not new this year: The skyrocketing pollution levels are a main staple around the holiday.\n\nWhile particulate matter concentrations generally return to background levels within a day or two, the hot and humid weather of summer can cause the poorer air quality to linger for a few days, said Gabe Filippelli, the Executive Director for IUPUI’s Center for Urban Health. And the health effects can last for days or longer, too.\n\nFilippelli said it’s not a surprise.\n\n“It is clearly related to fireworks and the smoke from them,” he said. “What is surprising is how few people recognize this as a potential public health threat.”\n\nLong Answer: Your health at risk\n\nThe smoke that lingers after fireworks doesn’t just hang in the air, but it can have a “significant” impact on health, according to a new study published in the journal Atmospheric Research.\n\nFor this study, researchers looked at firework celebrations for Independence Day in the U.S., Australia Day and China’s Lunar New Year. The high concentrations of smoke from fireworks are comprised of both coarse and fine particles — that’s the particulate matter we talked about above.\n\nSome common examples of these particles include dust, dirt or soot, and they can come from smokestacks, construction sites, farm fields and the tailpipes of your cars. They also come from the explosion of fireworks.\n\nParticulate matter is the main cause of reduced visibility — think haze or smog — in the U.S., according to the Environmental Protection Agency. These particles, which often are too small to see with the naked eye, can be inhaled and get deep into the lungs and sometimes the bloodstream.\n\nParticulate matter is among the top global environmental health concerns and nearly three million people died from exposure to the small particles in 2017, according to researchers.\n\nJames Briggs:Indiana’s backyard fireworks season is too long, too tortuous, too dangerous\n\nChildren, elderly adults and individuals with respiratory or cardiac conditions are reported to be the groups of people most affected by this exposure, according to the study. Even short-term exposures can aggravate lung disease, causing asthma and acute bronchitis, and increasing the susceptibility to respiratory infections, officials said.\n\nAnd in people with heart disease, short-term exposures to the smoke from fireworks have been linked to heart attacks and arrhythmias.\n\nIf the smoke particles weren’t problematic enough, those from fireworks are often laced with toxic chemicals and heavy metals such as nitrogen, sulfur, cadmium and copper that give the blasts their color and sparkling effect, Blair said.\n\nFor some, the impact of fireworks “might mean a trip to the ER,” he said, and for others, “a general feeling of malaise and energy depletion for hours or days after exposure.”\n\nSome states, such as Wisconsin, have encouraged people to limit their use of personal fireworks because of the potential health impacts. Officials note that displays at community events, while not without any issues, pose less of a risk. That’s because they are launched far enough into the sky to dissipate before reaching those watching from the ground.\n\nStill, community displays coupled with backyard blasts mean the production of a large amount of particulate matter “right where people live and breathe,” Filippelli said.\n\n“The impacts are short-lived, but the levels are quite high,\" he said. \"And in a city, that means a lot of people are exposed.”\n\nDo you have additional questions?

Lit grills release the aromas of barbeque and other roasted delicacies. The night sky is ablaze with the multihued splendor of fireworks. People in general savor the height of the summer and the city is awash in the hues of red, white and blue. Of course, when it comes to flags, those same colors can sometimes be seen in a different configuration than the star-spangled banner with accompanying stripes that we hold so dear. Recent events in South Carolina shone a spotlight on the most common of those different configurations of flags, and shines a light on the intersection between the freedom of speech and respect.\n\nIndependence day is a celebration of freedom. We got our freedom after a long fight and many skirmishes, minor and major, and rampant politicking. The events surrounding the successful battle for independence are not straightforward, similar to the events that preceded the Civil War. Every story always has different parts and different interpretations depending on who is telling it and the role played by the teller. This I especially clear when addressing the Civil War. For a great refresher on a lot of the nuance, Howard Zinn's \"A Peoples' History of America\" is a great place to start. While you are at it, you might also want to go further back in time to the different stories of the occupation of North America in Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz's \"An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States\". Eye-opening stuff.\n\nDetails are important. Knowing the full story is key. It is important to celebrate what makes America special, our freedom, and the men and women who brought us the freedom and continue to help us exercise it and hold it dear. It is also fine to revel in that freedom and do the things that people in many other countries cannot do — express opinions counter to those held by the majority or opinions that may be incendiary. What we should not do is exercise that freedom at the expense of respect.\n\nWe may have the freedom to say what we like, but that does not mean that hateful prejudicial speech is acceptable. At the most simple level, we each have the freedom to use what language we want, but few of us would use bad language in front of children. You have the right to smoke, but respect those who decide not to and children and do not smoke around them. Few of us would rub salt on old wounds. Few of us would say things that we know have the potential to hurt.\n\nYes, we have to fly whatever flag we would like to, but it is important to respect what the flag we fly represents. The swastika is a symbol that is auspicious and sacred in Hinduism and Buddhism. Of course this symbol also took on a very different meaning during World War II. Given all the additional symbolism now attached to it, it is something better not flaunted. A Hindu or Buddhist may want to because of their freedom, but it would be respectful to not do so publically.\n\nSimilarly, the Confederate flag has a number of different meanings. While some (e.g., Huffington Post) argue that it is primarily a symbol of slavery, to many in the South it represents other elements of heritage. Whereas both interpretations are debatable, the fact remains that it offends many millions of Americans of all stripes. Native American mascots similarly offend many, yet we Americans have the freedom to use them. While many states now have laws surrounding mascots, there are no laws I have heard of regarding swastikas or the Confederate flag. At least not yet.\n\nA significant body of psychological research has shown that in many studies Native American participants exposed to Native American mascots actually experienced decreases in self-esteem compared to exposure to non-Native American mascots. Similarly, the Confederate flag has also been shown to be a large part of identity formation. Whereas anecdotal evidence suggests that many Americans who fly the Confederate flag are not racist but mean to celebrate Southern heritage, use of this symbol is also directly tied to individuals with racist attitudes as evidenced in the Charleston shooting. It should also be known that many of us hold implicit attitudes that we are not conscious aware of. You can even take a test, developed at the University of Washington and Harvard, to see if you are prejudiced when you did not even know it (implicit.Harvard.edu). Could wearing the Confederate flag be an indicator of an implicit attitude? I have not seen that done yet, but worthy of thought.\n\nThe bigger point is respect. Let's respect our fellow Americans who take deep and significant offense to that symbol. I salute freedom. We have the freedom to say what we want, love whom we want, and use the symbols we want, BUT when we do, let's keep in mind those around us and what our speech and actions may signify. I also want to believe that we are a great country because we can respect our fellow citizens no matter what their race, ethnicity, or gender. With more respect, we will all be better off.\n\nRegan Gurung is a professor of human developent and psychology at University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/2019/07/04/cities-with-the-biggest-fourth-of-july-celebrations/39645461/", "title": "Cities With the Biggest Fourth of July Celebrations – 24/7 Wall St.", "text": "Liz Blossom\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nCelebrating the birth of our nation is one of America's favorite holiday. It's truly a family holiday, with picnics, barbecues, outdoor games, fireworks, and reunions with friends and relatives. It also represents the commencement of hot days, summer fun, and the pleasure of being outdoors. But, first and foremost, Independence Day brings us together to celebrate as Americans, regardless of our individual heritage or political views.\n\nAmong America’s patriotic holidays – Presidents’ Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day, and Veterans Day – it's the celebration of “The Fourth” that most evokes our history and the freedoms we enjoy. In communities across the country, fife and drum corps, marching bands, and symphony orchestras perform Sousa marches and patriotic melodies before immense gatherings, building to a crescendo of pyrotechnics, all in celebration of our country’s founding.\n\nWell in advance of the holiday, most Americans know what they will be doing to celebrate, and children everywhere look forward to staying up late for fireworks, a highly anticipated tradition from an early age. For daytime activities, even the smallest towns and villages have their own unique salute to our nation.\n\nWhile a family might look forward every year to the comfort and pleasure of attending a hometown celebration, many will occasionally change it up by traveling to a larger – or otherwise different – venue as a special treat. 24/7 Tempo has reviewed some of the largest 4th of July events, focusing on family friendly celebrations, many of them multi-day affairs, that offer a variety of activities and experiences for free or at a small cost. Some of the cities with the best celebrations are among the top places Americans will go for the Fourth of July.\n\nHeads up:These cities have the worst Fourth of July traffic in the US\n\nBoston\n\nSteeped in Revolutionary War history, no city does Independence Day like Boston. Called Harborfest, Boston's celebration lasts a week and attracts nearly 3 million visitors every year. The week of events – many of them free – include parades, harbor cruises, ceremonies, tours, live music, exhibitions, and a famous \"chowderfest.\"\n\nThe biggest party is the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular on the 4th. Thousands of residents and visitors alike spend the day picnicking in front of the Hatch Memorial Shell on the Charles River Esplanade, assuring themselves a good spot to enjoy the evening's free Boston Pops Concert. The orchestra ends its concert with a rousing performance of the 1812 Overture to kick off a spectacular fireworks display over the river, viewable from the 3-mile long esplanade or from across the river in Cambridge.\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nLike Boston, Philadelphia takes its role in America's independence to heart, making the 4th of July a weeklong celebration, called the Wawa Welcome America festival. Free events include museum days (free or \"pay what you wish\"), block parties, concerts, outdoor movies, a variety of children's activities, food events, live performances, a parade, and pyrotechnics. There were fireworks over the Delaware River on June 29, and another show on July 1. But the biggest party is on the 4th.\n\nFestivities begin at noon with a massive \"Party on the Parkway,\" covering several blocks of the city's Benjamin Franklin Parkway, with food, live music, games, and brew, that end with an outdoor concert, this year starring Jennifer Hudson and Meghan Trainor. It all comes to an end with a glorious fireworks display over the Philadelphia Museum of Art, choreographed to a patriotic soundtrack.\n\nNew York City\n\nNot to be outdone by the two cities that most evoke the American Revolution and the Declaration of Independence, New York City will host its 4th of July celebration, with millions of people celebrating from the city's rivers, parks, and rooftops. The legendary Macy's fireworks show, the largest in the country, will fire from the Brooklyn Bridge and four barges on the East River, with many other displays also launching in the area, including in Coney Island, Jersey City, Manhattan's West Side, and Staten Island.\n\nThere is a lot of other free or inexpensive fun on the 4th in the Big Apple besides the fireworks: an international 4th of July night market in Queens, Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest at Coney Island, and a concert by the Staten Island Symphony on the waterfront overlooking New York Harbor, as well as with special film screenings and sports events.\n\nLike sitting on a gold mine:If you bought a house in San Francisco 10 years ago, here’s how much it could be worth now\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nOur nation's capital takes great pride in its 4th of July celebrations, which begin with a noontime parade with floats, fife and drum corps, and military personnel and VIPs marching and rolling along 10 blocks of Constitution Avenue. Later, as a prelude to the evening's more traditional celebration, this year the federal government will sponsor a \"Salute to America\" to take place at the Lincoln Memorial, with military bands, fly-overs, and an address by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe annual concert by the National Symphony Orchestra, with special guest stars, takes place at dusk on the Capitol's west lawn, and, as in Boston, the concert ends with Tchaikovsky and cannon fire to cue the fireworks. With the magnificent monuments, museums, and memorials as the backdrop, the annual fireworks on the National Mall provide a memorable and moving experience.\n\nAtlanta\n\nThe 4th of July is celebrated throughout the city and neighboring communities, with several fireworks displays and a range of free concerts, exhibitions, family activities, and parties taking place in community parks and other venues throughout the larger metropolitan area. But what sets Atlanta apart on the 4th is its annual AJC Peachtree Road Race.\n\nThe famous race, organized by the Atlanta Track Club, is capped at 60,000 participants and billed as the largest 10k in the world. This year's event could be the liveliest in the event's history, as it is celebrating its 50th anniversary. One hundred fifty thousand spectators will be lining Peachtree Road to cheer on the runners and enjoy the eateries and special events along the course. The public is also given free access to the Peachtree Health and Fitness Expo at the Georgia World Congress Center on July 2 and 3.\n\nNashville, Tennessee\n\nLast year, a quarter of a million people came to Nashville's downtown to enjoy a full afternoon's worth of 4th of July entertainment, topped off by one of the largest fireworks displays in the country. This year, the free concert will be followed by 62,000 shells that will fire for 30 minutes – accompanied by the Nashville Symphony orchestra.\n\nThe free concert and fireworks spectacular is surrounded by events throughout Music City's metropolitan area, including a 5K and 10K race on the morning of the fourth, a series of fireworks from the 4th to the 6th over Nashville area lakes, and many parties, some offering free food, at Nashville's eateries, breweries, and bars.\n\nTahoe South, California\n\nThis city of around 20,000, which shares a border with Nevada, sits on one of the most beautiful lakes in the world. On the 4th of July, the city's population will swell to over 100,000 for the Lights on the Lake Fireworks, one of the biggest pyrotechnic displays in the country. Part of the fun is finding the perfect spot for watching the show. Since the fireworks are launched from barges on the lake, the view from a boat can hardly be beat, unless you make the effort to climb Mount Tallac for a uniquely breathtaking viewpoint. Beaches, shorefront parks, and tourist lodges also host thousands of viewers.\n\nWorth a look:Kevin Durant sells gorgeous $12 million Malibu beach house before move to Nets\n\nMiami Beach, Florida\n\nThere are plenty of fun opportunities to celebrate the Fourth in Miami Beach, with pyrotechnics firing from a number of locations: Key Biscayne, Downtown Miami, Coconut Grove, Miami Beach, and on Ocean Drive over Lummus Park. The most popular is the Fire on the Fourth Festival, celebrated at the North Beach Bandshell. The fireworks will launch over the Atlantic Ocean, following the ultimate family beach day. Activities are particularly geared toward children and families – bungee jumping, games, food trucks, rock-climbing, and crafts.\n\nAnchorage, Alaska\n\nWhat makes the 4th of July stand out in Anchorage is the length of the day of celebration. It begins with a community pancake breakfast at 8:00 a.m., an unusually early start for a holiday party, unless you consider that the sun will have been up since 4:30 a.m. Celebrations stretch out at the other end of the day as well; fireworks require dark skies, and the sun won't set until 11:30 p.m.\n\nIn between the initiation and close of the celebrations, there is a lot going on. After breakfast is a parade, followed by a reading of the Declaration of Independence and a festival of food (with an emphasis on fresh seafood), games, period costumes, and then the annual double header between rival hometown baseball teams. The last pitch signals the start of the pyrotechnics.\n\nThat's a lot of boom:Fireworks sales to top $1.3 billion in 2019\n\nWilliamsburg, Virginia\n\nThere is an admission charge to visit Colonial Williamsburg, but it offers a unique and fun experience whenever you choose to go. If you are able to book tickets for the holiday, it could be your most memorable 4th of July.\n\nIn this most famous reproduction of a colonial village, visitors experience the revolutionary spirit through a cast of villagers dressed in period costumes and working at traditional trades and tasks. On the 4th, the living history of Williamsburg is particularly spirited and moving, with Thomas Jefferson strolling through the crowds, pausing to read the Declaration of Independence aloud. There are fifes and drums, of course, and a number of performances and demonstrations, though many of the celebratory activities revolve around dinner and can be pricey. At the end of the day, the fireworks, timed to patriotic music, are for all to enjoy.\n\nNew Orleans\n\nNew Orleans flaunts its musical DNA at Louis Armstrong Park with a nine-hour free 4th of July concert, billed as Essence in the Park, with an impressive list of featured acts performing from two stages. The celebration includes vendors, a New Orleans style parade, and activities for all ages.\n\nPart two of the New Orleans Fourth is dubbed Go Fourth on the River. Before the fireworks begin there is more live music in the French Quarter and a fireboat water show on the Mississippi. Fireworks are launched from opposing barges on the River, and revelers can download an app that will allow them to hear patriotic tunes synced with the pyrotechnics.\n\nLos Angeles\n\nLos Angeles has more than its share of opportunities to party over the 4th of July holiday, with beach parties, parades, and performances throughout the city and nearby venues. Events range from a day-long block party and free fireworks in downtown L.A., to sky-divers and a parade in Pacific Palisades, to a bodybuilding pageant in Venice Beach.\n\nMany activities are free, but the centerpiece of the celebration, three nights of fireworks at the Hollywood Bowl, preceded each night by a Los Angeles Philharmonic concert, requires tickets, beginning at $15 for the more distant seats. Competing for the crowds on the 4th is AmericaFest at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, which begins with tailgating in the parking lot and ends with a spectacular fireworks show. You have to pay to get in, but the fireworks can be seen from outside the stadium.\n\nChicago\n\nThe big events – a parade, a concert, and fireworks – are all free in Chicago. The twin hearts of the celebration are Grant Park, which hosts the traditional concert of patriotic songs, and the Navy Pier on Lake Michigan, where the 4th will be celebrated with a day-long party, including a beer garden, followed by impressive pyrotechnics over the lake.\n\nThere is plenty of free viewing of the fireworks from the pier and riverfront, but, for those who want to splurge, there are many rooftop venues and opportunities to watch from the water on various tour boats cruises. Some offer dinner and bar services for a grander celebratory experience.\n\nMinneapolis\n\nMinneapolis is a prime 4th of July destination because of the variety of events in and around the city, with fireworks shows throughout the region both big (Minneapolis' Stone Arch Bridge and Lake Minnetonka) and a little smaller (Powderhorn Lake Park, Gold Medal Park, Shakopee's Valleyfair amusement park, Mystic Lake).\n\nDowntown Minneapolis' Red White Boom celebration is the center of the festivities, with road races, an outdoor movie, live music, and fireworks. Offering a more patriotic atmosphere, Fort Snelling has ceremonies, cannon fire, fife and drum performances, and a parade. For family fun, St. Paul hosts a day-long party in Langford Park, with races, kid's activities, a parade, and live music. Nearby Plymouth takes the holiday into the fifth of July in spectacular fashion with fire dancers, the Minnesota Orchestra, and a fireworks extravaganza.\n\nDid yours make the list? Top 5 states with the highest (and lowest) financial literacy rates\n\nGranbury, Texas\n\nSmalltown Granbury, notable for a cemetery where Davy Crockett and his family, has about 9,000 residents, yet it draws tens of thousands of visitors to its annual 4th of July fireworks display, the big attraction of the Granbury Chamber of Commerce Old-Fashioned Fourth of July Celebration.\n\nThe fireworks, and the free big band concert that precedes it, are spectacular, and the events surrounding the pyrotechnics are homey and fun. The beloved community party begin with a car show at a local Chevy dealer on July 3 and ends with a free outdoor concert in the town park on July 6. In between, there is a decorated bike contest, hometown parade, junior rodeo, and a battle of the bands.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The Iowa State Fair had been scheduled for Aug. 13-23.\n\nPresiding over a meeting that took just minutes Wednesday, board president Dave Hoffman called the decision “pretty monumental.”\n\nThe final determination came after one-on-one meetings with board members and discussions with stakeholders in Gov. Kim Reynolds' office and the Iowa Department of Public Health, as well as a review of results from a survey sent out to possible fairgoers, Iowa State Fair CEO Gary Slater said after the vote.\n\nUltimately, the decision came down to a choice between risk and reward: Should organizers offer an event with the bare minimum, or should they wait until all Iowans can have the full State Fair experience again?\n\n“We tried every which way in the world to put together a plan that kept people safe and that also completed the mission of the Iowa State Fair,” Slater said. But “it became a challenge to have a fair that we could all enjoy and be proud of.”\n\nConsidering the limited occupancy on the ground recommended by medical professionals and the considerable drop in attendance suggested by the survey results, the 2020 fair would have been a “shadow” of the fair we know and love, he said.\n\nNot only that, but the numbers didn’t work to make moving forward with the fair financially beneficial, Slater said.\n\n“Not having a fair and having a socially distant fair lost about the same amount of money,” he said. “To have a fair that broke even, we would have had to have triple the number” of people who said in the survey that they would attend.\n\n“It was not even close to breaking even.”\n\nIowa waited as long as possible to decide\n\nThe Iowa State Fair was the last big Midwestern fair to decide whether to open for 2020. Rivals Minnesota, Wisconsin and Indiana canceled within the past two weeks because of COVID-19 concerns, joining previously scrapped fairs in Ohio and North Dakota.\n\nNebraska, South Dakota, Kansas and Michigan have said their state fairs will go forward, despite safety risks. Fair leadership in Illinois and Missouri are still weighing options.\n\nThe Iowa State Fair has been canceled only five times in its 165-year history, and never for a pandemic or large-scale medical crisis. There was no fair in 1898 due to that year's competing World's Fair in Omaha, and World War II dimmed the Grandstand's lights from 1942-1945.\n\nFair events were held during the influenza pandemic that began in 1918 as well as during the polio epidemic.\n\nThough all the fairs' management groups stay in contact, each one has a different look and feel, Slater said. The other Midwestern fair groups did not influence the direction the Iowa State Fair took, he said.\n\nSlater has long maintained that a determination would be made by June 15 to give fair staff and partners enough time to get the grounds and event schedule prepared for a possible Aug. 13 opening.\n\n“You have to base your decision on what we know today,” he said. “We all hope that August would be something, that everything has gone away, but I don't know that we can rely on that to be true. And so we rely on our information and surveys and what we know to be those constraints that we need to operate in today.”\n\nGovernor not making a recommendation; Grassley had hoped to go\n\nReynolds said in her daily coronavirus press briefing that she had been in contact with fair staff recently to learn what information they were gathering and how they were determining if they could pull off a fair with reduced attendance. However, she said she did not make a recommendation to the board on whether or not to hold the fair.\n\n“I stand by whatever decision they make,” she said. “I appreciate they’ve really been thoughtful and taking the time. They've not rushed this decision, giving Iowa and Iowans an opportunity to respond.”\n\nReynolds also distanced her Wednesday proclamation lifting 50% capacity restrictions on businesses from any decision the fair board would make, saying fair staff would have to consider health precautions like any other business.\n\n“You have to remember they've had a lot of participants that typically make up the Iowa State Fair, that are not going, that have already canceled,” she added.\n\nIndeed, the famous Bill Riley Talent Search, which has brought talented youngsters from across Iowa to perform at the State Fair for the past 60 years, called off the 2020 competition in May.\n\n\"To my knowledge, it's never been postponed in the past,\" Bill Riley Jr. told the Register. \"It's heartbreaking. I'm really going to miss what I call 'summer season.' \"\n\nCountry music superstar Chris Stapleton postponed his Grandstand show to next year, saying in a statement that the decision was made \"with the health and safety of our fans, touring family, and the communities we travel through\" in mind.\n\nAsked if there was any public health opinion regarding if the fair should move forward, Dr. Caitlin Pedati said Wednesday that all of the safety guidelines they’ve sent to businesses — frequent hand-washing, social distancing — would “continue to be important things regardless of which setting we're talking about at this point.”\n\nU.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said during his weekly press call that he would not “bad mouth” the judgment of public health officials, but that he “sure would miss the Iowa State Fair.”\n\n“I've heard my wife three or four times — maybe more than three or four times — in the last month (say) she wants to go to the State Fair,” he said. “We haven't missed the State Fair since 1974. And before 1974, we periodically went to state fairs.”\n\n“It's not just the Grassleys that love it,” he said, adding that he would wear a mask if asked. “It's an Iowa tradition.”\n\nA different summer … and a bitter economic pill\n\nMany of Iowa’s favorite spring and summer traditions have become casualties to coronavirus this year.\n\nThe Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, better known as RAGBRAI, made the \"difficult decision\" to cancel in April, citing an inability to ensure riders' safety due to the spreading pandemic. The Des Moines Art Fest and 80/35, the annual music festival in Western Gateway, also canceled their 2020 events.\n\nAll are major economic drivers for the state, but the State Fair is a financial juggernaut for many local bottom lines, bringing more than a million people and roughly $100 million in economic impact to the Des Moines metro over its 11-day run.\n\nYear-round, about 60 people work for the Iowa State Fair, its website reports, but nearly 3,000 people are hired by the fair and outside exhibitors when the grounds open to the public.\n\nCanceling the State Fair would be a \"huge\" hit to the local economy, Greg Edwards, president of Catch Des Moines, previously told the Register.\n\n\"Most all of our hotels are pretty well full on both the weekends of the fair,\" Edwards said, \"and they also see a big increase in occupancy during the middle of the week, too.\"\n\nWhile the fair may be the big draw, Edwards said that visitors often spend money at restaurants, shopping malls and other entertainment venues while they're in the metro.\n\n\"During the time of the fair, other big attractions benefit,\" he said. \"Adventureland and the Blank Park Zoo have some of their biggest weeks of the year during the run of the State Fair.\"\n\nThe fair itself will have to reduce expenses over the next few months, Slater said, adding that 90% of the fair’s income is made in August.\n\nBut vendors and campers shouldn’t fear any major changes, Slater said.\n\n“My motto is faith, family and fairs, and faith means integrity,” Slater said. “We will do the right thing with our vendors. Those that have their spots will retain those spots for next year.”\n\nNot the fair you remember\n\nLike Slater, officials for many of the already canceled fairs have said that the necessary precautions they would have to put in place to limit the spread of coronavirus would diminish visitors’ experiences, and possibly put too big a strain on the institutions, financially.\n\nIn Minnesota, the fair most like Iowa’s, fair manager Jerry Hammer told the Star Tribune that social distancing was near impossible on the fairgrounds and that anything they came up with would be \"unrecognizable\" and could put the fair \"in a hole we might never come out of.\"\n\n\"To all the folks who say they’d come no matter what, well, thanks, but it wouldn’t be anything you’d recognize,” Hammer told the Star Tribune.\n\nIn the months that Iowa State Fair staff was monitoring the COVID-19 situation and looking at options, Slater previously said that the fair board and employees have been \"humbled\" by the words of encouragement they've received from fans far and wide.\n\nTheir main goal in making this difficult decision, Slater said, is to “preserve the grand tradition of the Iowa State Fair.”\n\n“If they'll hang on for these next 14 months,\" Slater said, \"and our scientists and our medical professionals take care of the pandemic that we're faced with, we will have a great State Fair and will be back to celebrate everything that's good in Iowa.”\n\nThe state of Midwestern fairs\n\nNorth Dakota: Canceled. “When it’s safer for us to be together again,” the state fair looks forward to making next year’s event “even greater,” Renae Korslien, the fair’s general manager, said in a statement.\n\nSouth Dakota: On. Gov. Kristi Noem said in a press conference that the South Dakota State Fair would move forward. “We’re thinking out of the box on ways to continue on with the fair and still keep people safe,” she said.\n\nNebraska: On. In a June 5 update, Nebraska State Fair organizers said they are “optimistic” and “continuing to prepare and plan” for their full 11-day event as well as their large stock show.\n\nMinnesota: Canceled. \"Right now is the time of year when things need to really take off if we’re going to have a fair, but we can see that we’re out of runway and can’t get off the ground. There will be no state fair this year,” Jerry Hammer, the fair’s general manager, said in a statement.\n\nMissouri: Decision pending. An announcement is expected by mid-June, according to a May 13 update on the fair’s website.\n\nWisconsin: Canceled. \"We explored countless models, but ultimately safety cannot be compromised,\" a news release said. \"The risks associated with hosting an event of this size and scope right now are just too great.”\n\nKansas: On. “Despite the uncertainties of our present situation, fair officials remain confident that residents can ‘Celebrate Kansas’ at the end of summer,” according to a May 13 update to the fair’s website.\n\nMichigan: On. “At this time, we are hopeful that a sense of normalcy will return by (September) and that Michiganders, more than ever, will welcome an opportunity … to celebrate the great state of Michigan,” according to a popup on the fair’s website.\n\nIndiana: Canceled. After “endless hours analyzing all options,” the fair commission made the “painful decision” to cancel, a news release said. The state will host a modified State Fair 4-H Livestock Show and Project showcase.\n\nOhio: Canceled. “Knowing how easily the virus spreads in large groups, we believe it is the safest path forward for the health and safety of all Ohioans,” Andy Doehrel, chair of the Ohio Expositions Commission, said in a statement.\n\nIllinois: Decision pending, cancellation likely. Although a decision has not been made, large gatherings \"are unfortunately not likely to happen in the near future,\" according to a post on the fair's website.\n\nCourtney Crowder, the Register's Iowa Columnist, traverses the state's 99 counties telling Iowans' stories.

Booming music festivals downtown. Sticky afternoons at the Iowa State Fair.\n\nIt's hard to imagine Des Moines without them. But the coronavirus outbreak spreading across the state has already forced the cancellation or postponement of several of central Iowa's traditional spring and summer events, and is threatening others.\n\nIt's a blow to a community that packs the warmer half of the year with festivals, fairs and other outdoor gatherings.\n\n\"Des Moines has this rich culture of going out and doing things in the summer,\" said Kristen Meyers, an event planner who works with multiple festivals. \"I think that we take every sunny, beautiful day that we can because half the year is cold and dreary.\"\n\nCatch Des Moines, the metro's convention and visitors bureau, estimates canceled or delayed conventions and sporting events over the next few months already have resulted in the loss of more than $35 million in expected revenue for the community. That figure doesn't include gatherings like concerts and festivals, which Catch Des Moines does not track.\n\nThe economic benefits of hosting a gathering go far beyond venue rental fees and tourism taxes. On its own, the World Pork Expo, held in early June, has a $16.3 million impact on the community, according to Catch Des Moines President Greg Edwards. But on March 31, the organizers canceled the event due to coronavirus concerns — and that means some 20,000 people associated with one of the Midwest's biggest industries won't be making their annual pilgrimage to the capital city.\n\n\"You always have to keep in mind the ripple effect that this has. These events are more than just events,\" Edwards said. \"Visitors eat in our restaurants, they stay in our hotels, they spend money in our shops.\"\n\nFor massive summer staples, that ripple effect is likely to be even larger — and the consequences of cancellations more far-reaching. The Iowa State Fair, one of the largest and longest-running events in the state each summer, hosts hundreds of food and merchandise vendors and regularly draws over a million visitors over its 11-day run, making it a formidable economic ecosystem on its own.\n\nState Fair CEO and Manager Gary Slater estimated that organizers will need to make a decision on whether to hold the fair by early to mid-June.\n\nThe increasingly barren schedule of upcoming events in Des Moines is a graphic illustration of the uncertainty of the next few months. Most late spring and early summer events already have been delayed or canceled due to the possibility that social distancing will continue through the start of festival season. Meanwhile, large end-of-summer festivities are in limbo, their organizers unable to make firm commitments as they face an unpredictable future.\n\n'Just too soon'\n\nNothing says summer in Des Moines like the Downtown Farmers' Market. Each Saturday, it hosts nearly 300 vendors selling fresh produce, crafts and coffee. The market, which typically starts the first weekend in May, usually boasts 25,000 visitors.\n\nBut with social distancing guidelines in effect until April 30 in Iowa, which advise against holding gatherings of more than 10 people, the massive weekly street party is off \"until restrictions are lifted,\" according to a statement on the market's website.\n\nCourtney Shaw, vice president of communications for the Greater Des Moines Partnership, said market organizers are working with the farmers and craftspeople waiting to sell their wares.\n\nIt's the same story for the Drake Relays, a late April tradition. The track competition and its related festivities — the Beautiful Bulldogs contest, Grand Blue Mile and Drake Road Races — were postponed indefinitely in mid-March.\n\nAnd a look through the Wells Fargo Arena website reveals a list of canceled and postponed events through April. Coronavirus has affected everything from the Harlem Globetrotters to Michael Bublé. Cher, whose April 16 show would have been one of the biggest of the year, now won't appear until Sept. 28.\n\nThe next event still scheduled is a Joe Rogan stand-up comedy show on May 15. And there's still no word about Elton John's long sold-out \"Farewell Yellow Brick Road\" show, scheduled for June 11.\n\nEven some events that take place in the early summer, after current social distancing guidelines end, have been rescheduled.\n\nCelebrAsian, a two-day Asian, Asian American and Pacific Islander heritage festival that normally kicks off the summer festival season, and Capital City Pride Fest, a weekend celebration of LGBTQ culture, have moved their festivities to later in the year.\n\nDan Jansen, president of Capital City Pride, said his team has been watching federal and state guidelines while taking hints from other Pride festivals across the nation. The Pride Fest is now scheduled for mid-July, a month later than its original date. Jansen said the group has another fallback plan if the July target doesn't work.\n\n\"Ultimately, we are a community organization. We do want to ensure the safety of the community,\" Jansen said. \"But we also want to enable the fact that, at some point, the community will want to be together in person to celebrate.\"\n\nNu Huynh, executive director of the Iowa Asian Alliance, said CelebrAsian's Memorial Day weekend date was \"just too soon\" to safely gather a crowd. She said that while organizers are aware of an increase of anti-Asian racism in the U.S. based on the coronavirus' origin in China, concerns about xenophobia did not prompt the delay.\n\n\"If anything, it's the opposite. We definitely want to show our strength and resiliency, and that Iowans are better than that,\" Huynh said.\n\nHuynh and several other event organizers said they were struggling to organize event sponsors as local and national businesses deal with the pandemic.\n\nEmily Steele, an organizer for the nonprofit musical festival 80/35, said corporate sponsorships began to fall off as the coronavirus crisis ramped up. The combination of that and uncertainty that Iowans would purchase tickets led 80/35 to cancel its July downtown gathering of Iowa and national performers.\n\n\"We just couldn't guarantee that we would have the funds from the ticket sales to secure the acts,\" Steele said. \"And on top of that, knowing that corporate sponsors, they're also going through some financial instability or some questioning of if they can give away funds. No one really said that, but it got quiet.\"\n\nLater events: Wait and see\n\nSeveral summer staples remain in limbo ⁠— not yet canceled or delayed, but with only so long before decisions must be made.\n\nAnne Lawrie, marketing director for the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, said there will be a decision April 15 about whether the nation's largest annual bike tour will happen as scheduled in mid-July. There's a complex checklist of things to organize, from merchandising to logistics along the route.\n\nRAGBRAI brings thousands of cyclists together to ride, party and camp in close proximity to one another for an entire week. Lawrie said that, if the current prohibitions on mass gatherings stay in effect, RAGBRAI will be forced to comply and cancel.\n\nThe factors challenging RAGBRAI go beyond crowd size: The financial strain of coronavirus on host towns may also influence the decision. The planned RAGBRAI route has overnight stops in six towns across the state, each of which must be able to feed and offer accommodations to the riders.\n\n\"We're also looking at the community's ability to plan and put on the events from a fundraising perspective, from a food and vendor perspective and from a housing perspective,\" Lawrie said. \"Can we raise the money we need to raise in order to pay for the events in each of those towns? That's a community decision.\"\n\nIowa's Ride, a new, similar ride scheduled for the week before RAGBRAI, also is waiting for the situation to clarify before making a call.\n\n\"Like most other events, we are carefully monitoring the evolving situation of COVID-19,\" Iowa's Ride Director TJ Juskiewicz wrote in an email. \"Our top priority is the safety of the public, our riders, support drivers, volunteers and others that would work the event.\"\n\nHinterland, the eclectic annual music festival in St. Charles, is also waiting and watching. Festival owner Sam Summers said he's closely monitoring news on the virus, but he said his confidence level is \"very, very high\" that it will be safe to hold the three-day festival in late July.\n\nAnd then there's central Iowa's crown jewel: the Iowa State Fair, which is scheduled for Aug. 13-23. Slater, the CEO and manager of the fair, said the staff is proceeding under the assumption that the fair will happen.\n\n\"It's too early to speculate about August,\" Slater said. Cancellations for May and June events are understandable, he said, \"but things in July and August, it's not time to make those decisions based on the data and information that we have.\"\n\nSlater estimated that organizers would make a decision on holding the fair in the next 60 to 75 days. He said fair organizers and vendors need time to order merchandise to sell, and June is the longest many of them can wait before shipping times would interfere with business.\n\n\"We're just trying to delay things to that drop-dead date of, you know, if you have to have tickets printed in order to sell them at the front gate, what is the last date you could order them and get them here in time for the fair?\" Slater said.\n\nThe precedents for canceling the fair are a reminder of the scope of the global pandemic. In the 166 years since the first fair, the only times it hasn't been held are during the four years of World War II and during the Spanish-American War in 1898, when it also faced competition from the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, a world's fair in Omaha.\n\nGathering in a post-coronavirus world\n\nEvent organizers said that even if the pandemic subsides before the warm weather does, they aren't sure how an event following months of social distancing will go. But they all agreed it wouldn't be business as usual.\n\n\"I truly believe the world will not be the same when we're out of the pandemic and the crisis mode,\" Slater said. \"The world will have changed; we all will have changed; you will have changed, as I.\"\n\nSlater said the State Fair would consider limiting crowds inside buildings and providing more hand sanitizer. Several other event organizers brought up similar mitigation strategies.\n\nBut even with hand sanitizer and a new focus on public health, attendance at large events is hard to predict. Iowans might be excited to socialize, but they may also emerge from isolation shy of traveling and spooked by crowds.\n\nEdwards of Catch Des Moines looked on the bright side, saying hesitation around travel may be a boon for central Iowa. Tourists can visit by car, rather than taking a plane.\n\n\"There's going to be still some hesitancy out there from people all across the world on traveling,\" he said. \"So many of our visitors do come from a 250-, 300-mile radius around Des Moines. So that's where we can really make an impact of letting people know, 'Hey, we're open. We've got great things happening here.'\"\n\nAnd after months indoors and with minimal social contact, perhaps festivals — even if they're a few months later than usual — will be exactly what Iowa needs. Meyers, an organizer working on Pride Fest and 80/35, thinks so.\n\n\"For me, working in festivals is a way of bringing so many different kinds of people together and giving them a chance — and I'm sure we're all really excited to do this — to get out of their house and stop playing video games.\"\n\nStatus of some major spring and summer events\n\nMission Creek Festival, April 1-4: canceled\n\nDrake Relays, April 22-25: delayed\n\nDowntown Farmers' Market, May 2: delayed\n\nCelebrasian, May 22-23: delayed\n\nWorld Pork Expo, June 3-5: canceled\n\nCapital City Pride Fest, June 12-14: delayed\n\nDes Moines Arts Festival, June 26-28: still on\n\n80/35, July 10-11: canceled\n\nIowa's Ride, July 12-18: still on\n\nThe Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, July 19-25: still on\n\nItalian-American Heritage Festival of Iowa: July 24-25: canceled\n\nHinterland, July 31- Aug. 2: still on\n\nIowa State Fair, Aug. 13-23: still on\n\nThis article has been edited to show that the Des Moines Arts Festival is still scheduled to be held June 26-28.\n\nKatie Akin is a retail reporter for the Register.

New this year, there will be a Sensory-Friendly SpinCity Morning from 11 a.m.-1 p.m. Monday, Aug. 8, when lights and sounds will be reduced.\n\nState Fair buildings for shopping, food and air conditioning\n\nAt some point in a typical State Fair visit, you're likely to find yourself needing some shelter from the weather — either to avoid rain or to cool off. In addition to the various animal barns and a few other smaller buildings, here are the main buildings you can hang out in while also shopping, eating or admiring exhibits.\n\nThe Expo Center is the biggest building. It has food, free samples, activities, official merch and aisle upon aisle of vendors.\n\nThe Original Cream Puff Pavilion is the central location for cream puffs. There are also other treats, such as brownies and cookies, for those who aren't into cream puffs.\n\nThe Wisconsin Products Pavilion is a great stop for baked potatoes, treats featuring apples, cranberries and ice cream, pretzels and a few Christmas tree displays.\n\nCorn on the cob, cream puffs, flavored milk and other kid-friendly food options\n\nFor a lot of people, a State Fair exhibit is all about the food. There are more than 200 locations for food spread out among State Fair Park, with more than 800 dishes. Here are some kid-friendly must-haves.\n\nThe iconic Milk House is back after a two-year pandemic-induced hiatus. Located near the Expo Center, at South Grandstand Avenue at Main Street, this is where people can buy their favorite flavored milk for $1 a cup.\n\nCream puffs have been sold at the fair since 1924 and are State Fair's most popular food item. They can be bought at the Original Cream Puff pavilion by waiting in line inside the building (the line is long but typically fast-moving) or at the express window at the north end of the pavilion. There are also two to-go kiosks for quick cream puff-getting along Grandstand Avenue. A cream puff costs $5, with 3-packs available for $14 and 6-packs for $25.\n\nFor people who must have food-on-a-stick at the Fair, there are your typical corn dogs and caramel apples as well as deep fried candy bars, Oreos and Twinkies. Here are a few of the more unusual offerings.\n\nThe Brownie Waffle Stick is a Belgian waffle baked around a brownie with white chocolate chips, served on a stick, dusted with powdered sugar and drizzled with chocolate syrup.

Instead, the annual event will focus on agricultural and educational competitions for exhibitors, their families and guests.\n\nIn an online release, members of the commission expressed concerns for the public health of residents and guests, as well as the potential financial impact of hosting a fair under current COVID-19 safety protocols.\n\n“Although vaccination rates are improving significantly each day, Ohio continues to fight the battle against COVID-19,\" General Manager Virgil Strickler said in the release.\n\n\"Where we are today in this battle makes it challenging to plan a large-scale entertainment event, not knowing where we will be, or what Ohio will look like, in late July.\n\n\"In addition, the important safety protocols that have been put in place to protect Ohioans, like indoor seating capacities, may lead to attendance that is considerably lower than previous years. The financial ramifications of hosting a typical Ohio State Fair with the same overhead costs, but far less revenue, could be devastating to our organization. In a typical year, the Ohio State Fair’s budget is designed to break even, with a nominal profit, if any. Hosting a full fair this year would likely lead to significant financial loss.”\n\nThis year's fair, which is scheduled for July 28 to Aug. 8, will be limited to exhibitors and family members for youth and senior livestock competitions, along with educational project judging for non-livestock competitions, such as 4-H.\n\nThe announcement was made before Gov. Mike DeWine's Thursday coronavirus press conference, where he said he anticipates all county fairs and independent fairs will have full fairs this year, and the decision made by the commission was unique to the state fair because of its size.\n\n“The important thing for me, I think the importing thing I think for all of us, is young people will have the experience of taking their projects to the state fair this year like a normal year they would be able to do,” DeWine said.\n\nOhio State Fair:With no state fair in 2020 due to COVID-19, Ohio Expo Center lays off 46 employees\n\nMany offerings expected to come back in 2022\n\nOfferings associated with the Ohio State Fair — such as rides, concerts, entertainers, live music, food vendors and other features — are expected to return in 2022, according to the release.\n\nFans disappointed after the announcement\n\nWith Thursday's announcement, longtime attendee Chris Loos said he's disappointed he and others won't be able to attend the event, an experience that's long been a yearly tradition in his household.\n\n\"There's no food, no rides; it's not even the fair at this point,\" said Loos, 23, of Galloway.\n\nDeVante Jackson, 24, of Hilliard, said there shouldn't be a fair at all this year, especially with so many features being removed.\n\n\"The fair is supposed to be catered to us — people that live in Ohio,\" he said. \"If the fair is not catering to us, I'd rather not have it. I don't want it to be mediocre. It sounds like more of a science fair.\"\n\nDetailed plans for the livestock and educational competitions are forthcoming. At this time, staff members expect livestock shows to begin July 19 and conclude Aug. 8. The deadline for exhibitors to enter livestock competitions will be June 20.\n\nThe 2022 Ohio State Fair is slated for July 27 to Aug. 7.\n\n@earl_hopkins1\n\nehopkins@dispatch.com\n\nJacalyn Borchardt contributed to this story", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2022/05/24/delaware-summer-fun-firefly-freeman-stage-rehoboth-beach-guide-state-fair-nelly/9779410002/", "title": "Follow our summer guide to Firefly, Delaware State Fair and much ...", "text": "It’s about that time of year for you to break out the hot pants again.\n\nAnd the SPF and bug spray.\n\nWe know you're trying to figure out what fun, adventure and entertainment you can sink your teeth into in Delaware this summer.\n\nDon’t’ fret.

But when the mercury rises to unthinkable levels, summer can completely drain us all. The long days we craved in the winter seem never-ending.\n\nLet’s change that.\n\nBy making some smart food and beverage choices, we can minimize the sun’s toll on our bodies and enjoy every minute of every carefree day.\n\nFirst and foremost, don't get parched.\n\nMORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest\n\nDehydration is one of the major causes of low energy and increased heat exhaustion in the summer. And you often don’t feel dehydrated. By the time you feel thirst, you’ve been dehydrated for a while. Stay in front of it this summer and hydrate. Also, think beyond water (which is always a great choice). Fresh fruits and vegetables provide loads of water, with vitamins and minerals to boot. When you consume water, fruits and vegetables with a high water content, you hydrate the body’s cells, which translates to a lower body temperature.\n\nAnd there are powerful nutrients that cool you from within, too. Here are 11 foods that get the job done, with five recipes that incorporate most of them.\n\nCucumber\n\nWho wants to be “cool as a cucumber” this summer? When the temperature soars into the uncomfortable zone, we all do. So why is the veggie so cool? C ucumbers are profoundly hydrating; and it’s crucial to stay hydrated in the heat. Nibble on cucumber slices, dipped in cool ranch or hummus, for a great snack.\n\nGreen “juice” is another excellent option. Combine cucumber, lemon and spinach in a blender (with ice if desired) and puree until smooth and drinkable, adding a little water if necessary. If you want to try cucumbers in ways you’ve never tried before, whip up my Indian Raita with Naan and Watermelon Salsa recipes. You’ll be glad you did.\n\nWatermelon\n\nWith the amount of flavor it packs, it’s amazing to me that watermelon is 95 percent water. Sweet, juicy and crunchy, the fruit reduces body heat immediately — perhaps that’s why watermelon slices are such a welcome addition to every summer soiree. And it makes for a refreshing salsa.\n\nBut don’t relegate the melon to hand-held slices and “balls.” The flesh is excellent when pureed into a juice; I like to add a splash of lemon or lime.\n\nPeaches\n\nSummer or not, you should always reach for seasonal produce first. Why? Seasonal fruits and vegetables dish up what the season craves. In the summer, peaches fit the coolant bill (whereas tubers and winter squashes warm us like space heaters in the winter).\n\nAt just 35-50 calories each, fresh peaches are crammed with vitamins A and C, riboflavin and potassium, essential nutrients for maintaining healthy skin and body. And take note: Dried peaches help regulate the body’s production of heat. For a sensational peach dessert, try my Strawberry Peach Sherbet recipe .\n\nLeafy greens\n\nWhen it comes to healthy food options, leafy green vegetables seem to find a spot on every list. Greens like spinach, kale, collard greens and romaine are all rich in vitamins and minerals, besides having a very high water content. Ve ggies that are brimming with water not only cool the body, they’re easier to digest. That means your body doesn’t have to work as hard, which saves you energy and keeps you cool.\n\nOpt for large green salads mixed with other water-rich vegetables, such as celery, iceberg lettuce and tomato. Need a recipe to kick-start things? Look out for my Wilted Kale Salad with Coconut Water Vinaigrette .\n\nPineapple\n\nJust like leafy greens and cucumbers, fresh pineapple is crammed with water and nutrients. Consider adding the flavorful, cooling fruit to salads and smoothies. You also can place fresh pineapple slices on burgers and grilled chicken for extra flavor and texture. You’ll get heat from the meat and cool from the fruit.\n\nAn added bonus? Pineapple contains bromelain, an enzyme that reduces inflammation in the body. Check out my recipe for Hawaiian Chicken with Grilled Pineapple and Zucchini , which incorporates two cooling foods.\n\nZucchini\n\nThe true squash of summer, zucchini ranges in color from yellow to dark green. All varieties are water-packed and high in vitamin C, phytonutrients and manganese, a mineral that helps protect your body from free-radical damage (especially important when we spend long summer days in the blazing sun). Manganese also promotes collagen production and the growth of healthy bone tissue.\n\nFresh mint\n\nChock-full of antioxidants, mint has been used as a home remedy for lowering body heat for centuries. There’s no doubt the zesty herb provides a cooling effect, but why? A quick science primer will explain: Our nervous system is built to sense changes in temperature. The receptor protein that senses those temp changes is TRPM8 and it’s found in all cold-sensing nerve cells. Once activated by TRPM8, our nerve cells send a message to the brain that “things are cooling down.”\n\nHere’s where mint comes in: It contains menthol, a chemical that directly binds to TRPM8 and activates it. In essence, it tricks the brain into sensing a temperature change. Trickery or not, it’s a cool effect. I add fresh mint to my Strawberry Peach Sherbet recipe, and whiz mint leaves into juices and smoothies all summer long.\n\nRadishes\n\nApart from being water-rich, radishes are packed with vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that lowers body heat. Radishes also have anti-inflammatory properties, which are effective for fighting heat stress. Add sliced radishes to your salads and sandwiches and let the cooling begin.\n\nLemons\n\nAll citrus fruits have incredible cooling effects on the body, and they promote detoxification (thanks to vitamin C). Add a squeeze of fresh lemon (and lemon wedges) to your water and, as you sip and stay hydrated throughout the day, you’ll be adding immune-boosting compounds that protect your body and skin (the body’s largest organ).\n\nYogurt\n\nCurd is a dairy product obtained by curdling milk with an acidic ingredient like lemon juice or vinegar. In India, curd is hailed for its ability to aid digestion and provide a cooling relief from spicy foods. It’s a well-known body coolant. Y ogurt is obtained using a similar process (the milk is fermented with two different strains of live bacteria), and it produces the same cooling result.\n\nCreate cool summer treats by using yogurt (regular or Greek) as the base for smoothies, milkshakes, dips and “ice cream bars.” For a refreshing dessert, add diced fruit and mixed berries to yogurt and top with a sprinkling of granola or nuts. For a great side dish, try my Indian Raita with Naan .\n\nCoconut water\n\nCoconut water is loaded with electrolytes and essential minerals that help keep the body well hydrated. Drink a glass of coconut water to naturally balance the electrolyte levels in your body and to regulate your body temperature. Also, try my Coconut Water Vinaigrette .\n\nTHE RECIPES\n\nWatermelon Salsa\n\nServings: 8-10.\n\nFrom Robin Miller\n\n3 cups diced watermelon\n\n1 cup diced cucumber, preferably seedless/English cucumber (also called hothouse)\n\n½ cup diced mango (also water-rich!)\n\n¼ cup minced white onion\n\n1 tablespoon fresh lime juice\n\n1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced\n\n2-3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil\n\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n\nPreparation:\n\nCombine all the ingredients in a large bowl and toss to combine.

That’s exactly how 2-year-old, Creid Carpenter, spent his Saturday morning at the Visalia’s Farmers Market.\n\nEven in the early-morning heat, Visalians hurried to the farmers market to select from a variety of locally-sourced produce and homemade treats. With over 20 vendors, Saturday’s market is a one-stop shop.\n\nBut there is one vendor who constantly draws a crowd, Vine Ripe Tomato. The produce vendor is a must for many at the farmers market. Owner, Agustine Agraz, is famous for not only his succulent tomatoes, but sweet summer melons.\n\n5 ways to get deals at Farmers Market this summer\n\nVine Ripe has been a permanent fixture at the market for the last 25 years. Agraz was one of the first vendors to sell his homegrown fruits and vegetables.\n\n“Customers keep coming for our tomatoes even though there are other vendors selling tomatoes,” he said.\n\nVine Ripe is a family-owned 20-acre farm in Hanford. For thirty years, Agraz has grown his tomatoes in a hydroponic greenhouse. Hydroponic farming is a way of growing produce in water, without soil.\n\nThe alternative method of farming means that the quality of the produce is never compromised because of weather, Agraz said.\n\nEvery Saturday, he and his crew wake up early, pack up the van with freshly picked fruits and vegetables, and head toward Visalia.\n\n“We have a variety of tomatoes,” Agraz said. “We’re best known for our beef steak tomatoes. We don’t pick them until they’re ripe on the vine.”\n\nCantaloupes and sweet watermelon are the summer’s top sellers, he added.\n\nOn Saturday, Agraz brought two large bins of watermelons and expected to sell out by the end of the day. He is one of the few vendors to offer a variety of melons.\n\nPriscilla Gutierrez and her two young children picked the biggest watermelons on display.\n\n“We’re going to eat it as soon as we get home,” she said with a smile.\n\nVine Ripe Tomatoes also has corn, squash, figs and herbs available for sale throughout the summer season.\n\nAlberto Meza, a farm worker at Vine Ripe, said the best way to eat the tomatoes is in a salad or salsa.\n\n“These are the best tomatoes,” he said. “They have a great flavor and texture.”\n\nFood grab goes global\n\nIn season\n\nVisalia’s Farmers Markets suggests purchasing the following seasonal summer produce: apricots, assorted citrus fruits, assorted melons, beets, berries, chard, cherries, collard greens, fresh herbs, garlic, kale, lettuce, nectarines, okra, olives, Onions, peaches, pecans, peppers, plums, pluots, potatoes, spinach, sprouts, strawberries, summer squash, sweet potatoes, walnuts, watermelon and yams\n\nVisalia’s Farmers Market hours:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2022/06/22/skip-cooking-easy-summer-recipes/7691965001/", "title": "Easy drink recipe for adults: Blueberry Collins takes 5 minutes", "text": "Baby, it's hot outside.

Along with this transition comes a need to focus on nourishing meals and snacks that fuel these more intense, adventurous workouts.\n\nBeing smart about nutrition both before and after exercise can lead to better endurance and quicker recovery. The right diet also supports a healthy weight and maintenance of both muscle mass and flexibility.\n\nThe key to unlocking the body’s potential for great workouts and overall well-being is a diet based on whole, real foods. This includes plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and unprocessed grains, as well as meat, dairy and eggs from responsibly raised animals.\n\nThankfully, the warmer months bring fresher, tastier produce and a greater variety of locally raised foods to farmers markets and stores. These nutrient-rich, delicious foods should be the foundation for an active person’s diet.\n\nFor pre-workout power: Berries and whole grains\n\nIn the hour leading up to exercise, a light snack with good-quality carbohydrates will provide the energy you’ll need for the work ahead and boost your blood sugar healthfully.\n\nBerries are an excellent choice for pre-workout fuel. They provide natural, easily digestible sugars and boast an impressive array of inflammation-fighting phytochemicals. Some ideas:\n\nTop a piece of whole-grain toast with a thin layer of peanut butter and sliced fresh strawberries for a delicious take on the classic PB&J.\n\nBlend fresh or frozen blueberries with almond milk and half a banana for a delicious, quick pre-run smoothie.\n\nEat blackberries or raspberries out of hand or blend them into yogurt and freeze into popsicle molds for a cooling pre-workout treat.\n\nDried, unsweetened cherries are a portable energy booster that can be enjoyed anywhere; keep some in a sealed container in the car or gym bag for an anytime pick-me-up.\n\nIf there are two hours or more before planned exercise, a heartier snack or even a light meal may be needed before hitting the pavement or trail. It’s still a good idea to include quality carbs like fruit and whole grains along with a small amount of protein to help stabilize energy levels and provide more long-acting fuel.\n\nIn warmer weather, ditch the hot oatmeal in favor of a cool parfait or overnight oats. Either can be made in a glass jar and stored in the fridge until ready to eat.\n\nFor the parfait: Layer berries or other seasonal fruit with plain yogurt, chopped nuts and granola.\n\nFor overnight oats: Combine plain rolled oats with milk, chopped fruit and, if desired, peanut butter or nuts; mix well and refrigerate at least 4 hours before enjoying.\n\nPrefer a more savory approach? Try hummus with raw or roasted market veggies like carrots, peppers and zucchini along with whole-wheat pita.\n\nFor post-workout hydration: Coconut water and watermelon\n\nFollowing exercise, it’s important to replenish fluids and electrolytes lost in sweat. For lighter exercise of an hour or less, simple coconut water, which provides potassium, magnesium and sodium, is a smart choice and a more natural, nutritious alternative to sports drinks.\n\nOr, for a refreshing summer treat, try salted watermelon after a workout. Watermelon’s high water content along with its electrolytes, natural sugars and antioxidants make it a hydration powerhouse. The sprinkle of salt will enhance the fruit’s sweetness and help replace sodium lost in sweat.\n\nTake rehydrating to the next level by blending frozen watermelon, mint leaves and coconut water into a delicious, all-natural slushie.\n\nFor post-workout recovery: Seeds and fatty fish\n\nThe hour after exercise is a vital time to take in foods that help rebuild muscle and replenish energy. A light meal or snack that includes both carbohydrates and protein does the job best.\n\nFor carbs, think outside the refined sugar box of granola bars and chocolate milk for something more wholesome. Seeds contain all the nutrients needed to grow a baby plant and so are extremely high in many health-promoting compounds.\n\nBoth sunflower and pumpkin seeds provide magnesium, which helps relieve muscle tension. These larger seeds can be eaten on their own or mixed with nut butter, honey and oats to create delicious, portable energy bites.\n\nHemp and chia seeds contain anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats and can be blended into post-workout smoothies or mixed into yogurt or cottage cheese along with honey or jam for the ultimate recovery snack.\n\nQuinoa and millet seeds, when cooked, make an excellent base for a grain salad, which can swing sweet (cinnamon, berries, walnuts) or savory (cherry tomatoes, feta, spinach).\n\nIt’s well known that protein is required for muscle repair. Some may reach for protein powders or bars out of convenience, but compared with whole foods, these products offer little in the way of health-boosting benefits. Not to mention many of these products contain far more protein than the average exerciser needs.\n\nFatty fish like wild salmon, trout and tuna offer high-quality protein as well as heart-healthy omega-3 fats that can reduce joint and muscle swelling. For a quick post-workout meal:\n\nTry canned tuna mixed with plain Greek yogurt and dried herbs on whole-grain crackers.\n\nAdd cooked wild salmon to veggie salads or scrambled eggs.\n\nCanned salmon is inexpensive and great for homemade salmon burgers, which can be cooked for the week ahead and reheated or eaten cold on toast or greens with a dollop of dill yogurt sauce.\n\nRecipe: Power Up Salad with Avocado Ginger Dressing\n\nFor an anytime feel-good boost: Sprouts and avocado\n\nTo keep an active body running strong, don’t overlook the power of greens and healthy fats. Though these may not be optimal foods for immediately before or after exercise, they should certainly be included in a healthful diet.\n\nWhen it comes to greens, sprouts pack a punch, as these tiny plants are truly a living food, full of vitamins and antioxidants. Pea sprouts are an early spring favorite, but sunflower, alfalfa and radish sprouts are all fairy easy to find at markets or to grow in the kitchen.\n\nEach variety of sprout has a unique flavor, usually a subtler shade of the plant or vegetable into which it would grow. Sprouts should be eaten soon after purchase for optimal nutrient value and freshness. Top salads, sandwiches, or stir-fries with sprouts for a pop of color and crunch.\n\nWith all the focus on protein and carbs in exercise nutrition, healthy fats such as those found in nuts, avocado and seeds as well as from fish, pastured eggs and meat can be overlooked. Sufficient fat in the diet supports optimal hormone function, healthy weight regulation and greater satisfaction from eating. Without enough dietary fat, body tissues are more prone to injury, and mental focus can suffer.\n\nIncluding at least one source of good fat at meals improves satiety and enhances absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. Swap out chip or crackers for nuts as a midday snack, spread avocado on sandwiches or use it as a topping for chili, tacos or eggs.\n\nDrizzle flavorful extra-virgin olive oil to finish a pasta dish or soup. Shun fat-free salad dressings in favor of a simple homemade vinaigrette.\n\nPowering up the body for warm-weather exercise and outdoor adventures is simpler than it seems. Just look for what is fresh, colorful and unprocessed whenever possible. Whole, natural foods improve energy and boost performance, hopefully inspiring exercisers, no matter their chosen mode of movement, to add something fresh and colorful to their next meal.\n\nAshleigh Spitza is a registered dietitian and freelance writer living in Milwaukee who blogs atfunkybeetsblog.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2019/04/30/oba-pops-and-tubby-pig-open-fort-myers-shrimp-dock-closed-season/3539190002/", "title": "Oba!

It's home to pristine, white sand beaches and warm water, and features Pier 60, which hosts a nightly sunset festival on the Clearwater Beach Pier, complete with live music, street performers, vendors and splendid views across the gulf. Also in the area is Fort de Soto Park, which is a great beach option for families with either two or four-legged children – there's a natural sandbar area that forms a lagoon-like pool for kids to swim in safely, and also a Paw Playground and Dog Beach for canine family members. And if your Memorial Day plans usually include a BBQ, there are grills in the park for epic cookouts.\n\nAmelia Island, Fla.\n\nFlorida is a great state for Memorial Day beach celebrations because it's warm enough to swim in May. Amelia Island off the state's northeast corner is a fun and accessible destination with more than 40 public beach access points along 13 miles of coastline. It's a charming little island with plenty of dining, shopping and activity options, making it a great place for families, not to mention the miles of palm-lined bike paths, dunes rolling down into wide stretches of beach and clear, blue ocean for swimming. There are dozens of hotels to choice from. Spoil yourself with a stay at the Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island, which is poised on a bluff of dunes overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIndiana Dunes State Park​, Chesterton, Ind.\n\nBeaches don't always border oceans; some of the best border lakes. And in Chesterton, Ind., you'll find Indiana Dunes State Park, which includes 15-miles of gold sand beaches strewn along the shores of Lake Michigan. What makes this state park such an ideal Memorial Day beach destination is it provides two experiences in one: There's the lake to play in and on, and then there are 70 miles of hiking trails to experience as well. Memorial Day weekend is extra special at Indiana Dunes State Park, with a sunset hike on Friday, a guided 3 Dune Challenge hike, a scavenger hunt and a birds and blooms hike on Saturday, and several other programs over the holiday weekend.\n\nLincoln City Beach, Lincoln City, Ore.\n\nHeading out west, Lincoln City is located approximately two hours southwest of Portland, along a beautiful 7.5-mile pristine stretch of Oregon Coast that includes one of the longest beaches in the state. Although this isn't really a swimming beach destination, Lincoln City stands out as a great Memorial Day beach destination for beach walkers and combers. Keep your eyes on the sand while strolling, as you may discover everything from driftwood to seashells to glass treasures. Every day from mid-October through Memorial Day, anonymous volunteers known as \"Float Fairies\" hide colorful hand-made glass art along the beach. And the rule is that whoever finds the art can keep it. On Memorial Day weekend an extra 100 pieces of glass art are hidden to celebrate the end of the season, and a party is thrown with a jumbo float on the beach and a treasure hunt leading to a weekend getaway prize.\n\nLong Beach, N.Y.\n\nFrom beach volleyball to a free summer concert series, Long Beach, one of only two cities on Long Island, is another unspoiled Memorial Day celebration spot. With the Atlantic Ocean on one side and the Reynolds Channel on the other, it is a beautifully situated seaside community that boasts a 3.5 mile long beach considered one of the cleanest in the USA. Memorial Day kicks off the summer season in town, and the city is home to all sorts of adventure opportunities including flying on a recreational trapeze school, experiencing the state-of-the-art surf center, playing a few rounds of mini golf courses or just wandering down the two-plus-mile boardwalk filled with all sorts of eating options.\n\nBrigantine Beach, N.J.\n\nIf you live between Washington D.C. and New York City and you're looking for an East Coast beach to explore this Memorial Day, consider heading to Brigantine Beach in New Jersey. It's kind of the anti-Jersey Shore, the exact opposite of towns like Seaside Heights. Just north via bridge from Atlantic City, it's a quaint, local beach town that awakens over Memorial Day weekend. Clean, family-friendly and all around chill, it's a bit of an undiscovered gem in the state. Wander up from 14th Street beach to Laguna Grill for a rum runner to sip in the sand, or if you'd rather have an ice cream, brave the line at Auntie B's. For evening celebrations, the jetty on the south end is a front-and-center seat for the fireworks over the casinos, without having to deal with the Atlantic City hubbub.\n\nPoipu Beach, Kauai, Hawaii\n\nFor one of the most exotic and beautiful beach destinations in the USA, head to Poipu Beach in Kauai this Memorial Day. It's considered one of the best beaches in the world, and offers a delightful environment for swimming, surfing, boogie boarding, snorkeling or simply relaxing. It’s also a very family friendly destination, and considered one of Hawaii's safest beaches with lifeguards on duty 7 days a week and shallow waters for kids to swim. It's a picture perfect beach too, with all white sand, palm trees and some of Hawaii’s most stunning views. Humpback whales, sea turtles and Hawaiian monk seals can also often be spotted.\n\nHermosa Beach, Calif.\n\nSouthern California is synonymous with great beach towns, and Hermosa Beach is no exception. The perfect seaside town to experience the region's quintessential laid-back Cali lifestyle, Hermosa Beach is especially fun over Memorial Day weekend when it throws its annual Fiesta Hermosa, now in its 44th year. The festival draws some 100,000 people and 300 vendors from painters to jewelers, which also makes it the largest arts and crafts festival in SoCal. Best of all, Hermosa Beach is located just 5 miles south of LAX, which means if you're flying in there's no need to rent a car as it's a short Uber ride from the airport.\n\nHilton Head Island, S.C.\n\nHilton Head has long been one of the top beach towns in the country, and Memorial Day weekend marks the start of the season on the shoe shaped island measuring 12 miles long by 5 miles wide. Beyond unique hard pack sand that makes its beaches perfect for running, biking or strolls as the sun rises and sets, the resort town has also undergone a lot of renovation recently, meaning whatever resort you book, you're likely to be lodging in newly renovated digs. It's also home to restaurants, shops and activities to meet all tastes and budgets, and works well whether you're on your honeymoon or an extended family holiday.\n\nDuck Beach, Duck, N.C.\n\nIn North Carolina's beautiful Outer Banks area, Duck sits on a narrow barrier stretch of land that's another great Memorial Day weekend beach destination. With over six miles of white sand beaches, it offers uninterrupted ocean views and an abundance of open space on the sand to gather with friends or family and kick of the summer season. When you've finished soaking up the sun and sand, head to the town waterfront, which stretches for nearly a mile along the Currituck Sound, and is especially beautiful at sunrise and sunset. In Duck itself there are dozens upon dozens of unique dining and shopping experiences, as well as plenty of lodging options.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/01/29/sandy-beach-readiness-summer/1874229/", "title": "Many beaches on Jersey Shore will be open by May", "text": "Asbury Park (N.J.) Press\n\nSome towns are racing to rebuild their boardwalks for summer\n\nOthers expect to have only portions of beachfront restored\n\nA few are struggling to recover\n\nASBURY PARK, N.J. — Three months after superstorm Sandy, the once-devastated Jersey Shore is inching its way back with many beach towns promising that they will be ready for the summer season.\n\nSome towns, such as Belmar and Lavallette, expect to have their boardwalks restored by then although not all amenities will be available.\n\nOthers, such as Long Branch and Toms River, will have only portions of their beachfronts restored.\n\nAt the same time, hard-hit towns like Union Beach — which was mostly underwater at one point — struggle to come back. Officials there say the beach and boardwalk may not be ready until the end of the summer at the earliest.\n\nFollowing is a town-by-town list of coastal towns in the two most heavily damaged New Jersey counties — Monmouth and Ocean — and when those municipalities' officials hope to have repairs completed.\n\n1. Asbury Park. The boardwalk and beach will be ready by Memorial Day although sections may open earlier, City Manager Terence Reidy said.\n\nSuperstorm Sandy left significant damage at the southern end of the boardwalk near the casino and the area immediately south of Convention Hall. The city's sewer plant also was damaged. The total recovery cost is about $10 million. So far, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has given the city $700,000, Reidy said.\n\n2. Atlantic Highlands. The municipal harbor sustained about $40 million in damage from Sandy, and the marina is in the process of being rebuilt.\n\nTo date, the borough has spent about $3 million in its cleanup efforts of the harbor. Harbor officials are planning to reopen the facility by April. Shore Casino will open within a month, and the bait shop will reopen for the upcoming fishing season, officials said.\n\nBorough officials estimate that at least 75% of the costs will be federally financed.\n\n3. Bay Head. Borough beaches will be ready by summer, Councilman Brian M. Magory said.\n\nWith all major storm debris collected and sand collection waning, the borough's beachfront is in \"pretty good shape,\" Magory said. No project costs were available.\n\n4. Belmar. The beaches will be open by Memorial Day.\n\nThe borough expects boardwalk repairs to be completed by then as well. The rebuilding of the boardwalk pavilions, restrooms and other structures will not occur until 2014.\n\nThe borough awarded a $6.6 million contract to Epic of Piscataway to reconstruct the boardwalk; overall Belmar borrowed $20 million toward recovery efforts.\n\n5. Brick. Officials are confident that the township beaches will be open by Memorial Day.\n\nThe ocean beach sustained about $4 million in damage from the storm. Overall, the township sustained $43 million in damage. The dune system was destroyed in some areas, and the boardwalk at Brick Beach 3 was damaged, Mayor Stephen Acropolis said.\n\n\"The beaches are going to be open,\" he said. \"The issue is how much of the beach is going to be there. At some points during high tide the water comes right up to the base of the dune.\"\n\n6. Brielle. The waterfront area near the Manasquan River is expected to be open for the summer, borough officials said.\n\nThe estimated cost of cleaning up debris from Sandy is about $400,000. To date, the borough has spent about $375,000.\n\n7. Highlands. Snug Harbor beach will be open for the summer.\n\nThe borough sustained millions of dollars in damage to its municipal property, private homes, businesses and public properties. The borough's infrastructure damages are estimated to be $12 million.\n\nThe estimated amount spent to date on Sandy preparation and cleanup is $2.35 million, Borough Administrator Tim Hill said. The overall assessed ratable losses are estimated to be about $20 million.\n\n8. Island Beach State Park. The park is open from its gate south to Ocean Beach 1 — the northern 3.5 miles of the eight-mile-long park.\n\nThe entire park should be open and operating normally by Memorial Day weekend, said Ray Bukowski, park administrator. State officials do not yet have a cost estimate for repairs.\n\nDamage includes eroded dunes, boardwalks and beaches washed away, and the wreckage of the park marina. It is unclear whether the marina will be ready for the summer.\n\n9. Lavallette. Borough officials expect to have the boardwalk rebuilt by May 24 at a cost of $2 million.\n\nLavallette lost about 70% of its boardwalk to Sandy. The borough plans to award contracts to rebuild lifeguard facilities and wooden dune walkovers and for repairs to various street ends at the beachfront. Beach sand needs to be replenished.\n\nThe cost of these projects has not been fully assessed, but the borough remains optimistic that the work can be completed by Memorial Day weekend.\n\n10. Long Beach Island. Officials here say recovery efforts are progressing well and that about 90% of the island's 580 business will be ready for the summer season.\n\nLong Beach Township, the 18-mile-long island's largest municipality, has spent $15.8 million on storm-related cleanup.\n\n11. Long Branch. The beachfront will be open by Memorial Day; however, a one-mile section of boardwalk lost from Melrose Terrance south to Brighton Avenue will not be repaired by this summer.\n\nPier Village businesses are open; the city is finishing $200,000 in repairs to the steps, access points and bulkhead. The city estimates $7.5 million in damages.\n\nAt the north end, damage to the boardwalk promenade is estimated at $2 million. Repairs will be complete there before Memorial Day.\n\n12. Manasquan. Most beachfront facilities be will ready for Memorial Day weekend, including the one-mile boardwalk promenade, lighting and the public bathrooms at the inlet and Ocean Avenue beaches, borough officials said.\n\nThe borough will use temporary facilities for Brielle Avenue restrooms, and Seawatch facility repairs may not be completed. Ninety percent of the sand has been returned to the beaches.\n\nThe borough lost about $77 million in taxable properties from superstorm Sandy.\n\n13. Mantoloking. Parts of the borough's 2.2 miles of beaches will open this summer, Borough Engineer Robert Mainberger said.\n\nBut all beach access points were lost after superstorm Sandy, portions of the island were washed away near its bridge, and homes had significant damage from the storm and a fire from a gas main break. A cost estimate should be available by March, he said.\n\nAt the moment, though the bridge from the mainland has opened, the borough is still on emergency lockdown, and recovery projects include making side streets safe and completing demolition work. The municipality has a targeted mid-February as a repopulation date.\n\n14. Middletown. Middletown is in the preliminary planning phases of beach and dune restoration projects for the North Middletown, Ideal Beach and Leonardo areas of town, officials said.\n\n15. Ocean Grove. The beach and portions of the boardwalk will be ready by Memorial Day weekend, according to the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association.\n\nThe boardwalk will be fully operational from Bradley Beach to Embury Avenue and from the pavilion to Seaview Avenue. Only temporary beach access will be available from Embury Avenue to the pavilion and from Seaview Avenue to Asbury Park, a temporary walkway is being explored.\n\nTotal damage estimates were not available.\n\n16. Ocean Township. Most of the damage has been cleared, and recovery costs are about $800,000.\n\n17. Oceanport. Roughly 10% of 2,100 homes in the borough were damaged during Sandy; some 100 homes remain unoccupied, officials said.\n\nLocal officials estimate that of the $367 million in damage, the borough will need $360 million to rebuild private homes and $1 million to rebuild six businesses damaged in the storm. Officials indicated that the bill for emergency response from police and the Department of Public Works ran to $600,000.\n\n18. Point Pleasant Beach. Boardwalk repairs are set for completion by May 22; officials say recovery here is progressing well.\n\nDebris pickup is complete and efforts to sift sand are nearly finished. The borough is quoting repairs for the inlet area. Officials approved emergency appropriations of about $3.2 million for restoration and recovery and about $1.7 million for the boardwalk bid.\n\nOfficials estimate total recovery costs at about $7 million.\n\n19. Sandy Hook. Gateway National Recreation Area sustained about $180 million in damage, including severe damage to roads, concessions, utilities, the wastewater treatment plant and the potable water system at Sandy Hook.\n\nAs of last week, 80% of Sandy Hook had electricity, and the park had potable water, according to Pete McCarthy, coordinator of Gateway's Sandy Hook Unit. The goal is to have the park open for the summer with temporary restroom facilities.\n\n\"We're not going to be able to promise something and cast it in bronze,\" Superintendent Linda Canzanelli said.\n\n20. Sea Bright. The beachfront borough was one of the most severely devastated from Sandy with its utility lines ruptured and many of its homes and businesses damaged or destroyed.\n\nAll its beachfront facilities, including restrooms, a small boardwalk, and a bathing pavilion, were destroyed, according to Mayor Dina Long. In addition, many of the private beach clubs were destroyed.\n\nThe borough has been able to clear the storm debris. Utilities have been restored throughout the borough, except to one housing complex, and a quarter of the borough's population has been able to return to a repaired home, Long said.\n\nA handful of businesses have reopened. Long said she expects the beach to open on Memorial Day weekend and added that the borough will bring in temporary facilities.\n\n\"There will be a beach in Sea Bright this summer,\" Long said. She had no estimate of the cost of all the damage to borough property.\n\n21. Sea Girt. The first phase of Operation Comeback, which includes the boardwalk restoration and another project to repair the beach pavilion, is expected to be completed by Memorial Day, Borough Administrator Alan Bunting said.\n\nHe gave a \"high end\" estimate of $675,000 for both of those projects.\n\n22. Seaside Heights. Officials here say recovery efforts are moving along now that the borough made famous in MTV's Jersey Shore awarded a contract to rebuild the boardwalk at a cost of $3.6 million.\n\nThe deadline for that project's completion, May 10, mirrors the date that borough officials hope everything will be ready for visitors. The borough plans to seek bids soon for the repairs of two lifeguard bases and to rebuild two destroyed bathhouses.\n\nThe borough approved a $14.1 million emergency appropriation to cover what it estimates total recovery efforts will cost. Much of Funtown Pier amusement park and its iconic roller coaster were destroyed in the storm. The borough has spent about $4.5 million so far for debris removal and electric utility repairs.\n\nWith Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursement, officials estimate a $500,000 effect on the budget.\n\n23. Seaside Park. The beach and boardwalk will be open by Memorial Day, officials said.\n\nFourteen projects are on the borough's to-do list because of water damage in wake of Sandy. So far contracts have been awarded for six projects, including boardwalk repairs, fixing a flooded public works meeting, and electrical work at the marina.\n\nOfficials plan to have all projects bid by the end of February. They estimate the total cost of recovery efforts at $8 million, but it is not clear how much the borough has spent at this time.\n\n24. Spring Lake. Reconstruction of the two-mile boardwalk will be done before Memorial Day weekend.\n\nThe borough estimates that the total costs of the boardwalk will fall between $3 million and 4 million. Beach badge fees were raised this year to help pay for repairs.\n\n25. Spring Lake Heights. The borough had substantial damage in its parks from downed trees; work to resolve the problem should be completed by early spring, Borough Administrator Jay Delaney said.\n\nThe borough has awarded about $40,000 in contracts for tree removal so far with a final cost expected to be about $75,000.\n\n26. Toms River. The township expects to have a portion of its noncontiguous beachfront on the northern barrier island open by June 1.\n\nThe extent of that portion is contingent on how much of Ocean Avenue and Ocean Terrace, the road along the beach obliterated in the storm, is completed by then. The reconstruction of roadway began last week; however, much of the construction schedule revolves around the replacement of utilities under the roads, which is outside of municipal control.\n\nThe boardwalk will not be ready but should be under construction by the summer, according to municipal officials. Toms River lost two lifeguard houses, projected to cost $1.2 million each. The cost to replace the boardwalk is estimated at $2 million.\n\nThe cost of the wooden dune walkovers to access the beachfront will be about $250,000. The cost to replace the dunes and beach area on publicly owned land will cost about $1.75 million. The cost of reconstructing Ocean Avenue and Ocean Terrace, an integral part of reopening the beach, will cost more than $3 million, officials said.\n\n27. Union Beach. Borough officials say the cost of damage is still being calculated.\n\nSandy left hundreds of families without homes, and businesses and its elementary school were damaged. Fifty homes were swept away, and more than 200 others were damaged beyond repair.\n\nAbout 2,600 homes are in the borough. To date, 70 have been demolished, and 70 more are on the town's list to be taken down. The borough's $8 million budget has lost about $1.3 million of its tax ratables. Additionally, 14 police vehicles, three ambulances and a firetruck were damaged.\n\nBorough engineers are in the process of redesigning the boardwalk and beach area. However, borough officials do not expect the beach and boardwalk to be open until the end of the summer.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2022/05/26/delaware-beaches-memorial-day-weekend-parking-weather-covid-restaurants-lifeguards/9853742002/", "title": "Delaware beaches: What to know for your Memorial Day weekend trip", "text": "Summer is finally here, and there’s an undeniable buzz around the Delaware beaches.\n\nBeach businesses and resort towns are preparing to welcome visitors, but what should you know if you’re planning to enjoy the long weekend with your toes in the sand and an ice cream cone at your fingertips?\n\nWe've got you covered.\n\nIf you’re looking to visit the beaches during Memorial Day weekend, this guide will help answer questions ranging from dining to parking to the latest weather reports.\n\nSTART OF SEASON:What’s new at the Delaware beaches for summer 2022? A starter list of what to expect\n\nLifeguard shortages affecting Lewes\n\nLet’s start with the good news: Lewes expects to have at least two lifeguard chairs on its municipal beaches for Memorial Day weekend.\n\nThis comes after the resort town originally announced that it would leave its beaches completely unguarded this summer due to staffing shortages.\n\nNow, after the community showed up with support and lifeguard connections, Lewes hired a new lifeguard captain and plans to bolster its staffing for the summer.\n\nThe plan is to have the beaches fully staffed with lifeguards by June 15, according to Kent Buckson, the longtime beach patrol captain who stepped up to help Lewes find a new captain.\n\nLIFEGUARD UPDATE:Delaware beach community rallies to ensure Lewes has lifeguards ahead of Memorial Day\n\nLEWES NEWS:Two Lewes beaches have new names. Here's what to call them and why it matters\n\nStrohm Edwards – a Sussex County native, former lifeguard and current swim coach – will be on-site as the new captain in Lewes this weekend.\n\nWhile some beaches, like those at the Delaware State Parks, said they were still looking for applicants as of last week, most beaches are fully staffed. Lifeguards like Buckson remind people to check in with the municipality or beach patrol headquarters to find out where the lifeguard stands are and always swim where they can see those guards.\n\nEven when lifeguards are present, resort towns like Rehoboth Beach remind visitors to always keep an eye on each other and swim with a buddy (if willing to brave the chilly May waters).\n\nWhat do the beaches look like after this month's storm?\n\nAfter a nor’easter earlier in May caused steep cliffs in the dunes and dune crossings, the Delaware beaches are now ready to welcome visitors for the start of summer. Still, there are a few things you should know before you go.\n\nWhile most beach entrances have reopened, Rehoboth Beach will have two of its 38 entrances barred off as of Friday morning. The state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control is working to repair those dune crossings. They include:\n\nSurf Avenue\n\nOne at Maryland Avenue\n\nIn South Bethany, all beach walkways have reopened except for the one at South Third Street, according to Town Manager Maureen Hartman. This entrance included an accessible ramp compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and that ramp was wiped out in the storm.\n\nDNREC is responsible for repairing or replacing the ramp, Hartman said. In the meantime, anyone needing assistance to access the beach can contact the South Bethany Beach Patrol to schedule a day and time in advance to use a beach wheelchair.\n\nMultiple beach entrances – both for driving and walking – are expected to be closed at the Delaware State Park beaches, as well, this weekend.\n\nAs of Thursday, the following dune crossings were closed due to \"unsafe drop-offs,\" according to a DNREC news release:\n\nNavy crossing at Cape Henlopen State Park\n\nThe northernmost pedestrian crossing at The Point in Cape Henlopen\n\nKeybox, Conquest and Faithful Steward crossings at Delaware Seashore State Park. The Conquest pedestrian crossings are also closed.\n\nThe closed locations also have very limited space for drive-on surf fishing because of narrow beaches even during low tide, said spokesperson Shauna McVey.\n\nThe Delaware State Parks encouraged visitors to follow the Cape Henlopen and Delaware Seashore state parks Facebook pages for updates on closed dune crossings.\n\nThe following access points were open as of Thursday:\n\nThe Point, Herring Point and Gordons Pond crossings at Cape Henlopen State Park.\n\n3Rs crossing at Delaware Seashore State Park.\n\nNorth (York), Middle and South crossing at Fenwick Island State Park.\n\nAll other beach entrances in Lewes, Dewey Beach and Bethany Beach are open.\n\nBEACH RESTORATION:Delaware begins restoring beach access following bad storms, South Bethany 'worst hit'\n\nBeachgoers will also notice that many of the beaches are significantly narrower at points, especially during high tide. That dramatic difference will slowly be corrected over time as the ocean naturally returns some of the sand to the shore.\n\nHere are some tips that Rehoboth Beach spokesperson Lynne Coan shared to make the most of your visit to the beach:\n\nSpread out from the center and consider claiming a spot at the south or north end of Rehoboth Beach. Deauville Beach is open and accessible on the north end, and the south end is a bit wider, less steep and has less dune damage.\n\nConsider timing your visit to coincide with low tide and avoid high tide peak.\n\nTravel light and compact to the beach in an effort to share space with other sun-seekers.\n\nNeed a wheelchair-accessible entrance? Visit the Laurel Avenue crossing where additional mats have been installed on the beach to provide easier wheelchair access.\n\nIn Dewey Beach, people will notice that dune crossings may be steeper than normal, according to Town Manager Bill Zolper. The sand also lost about 5 feet of depth back by the dunes, and that loss of depth improves as you walk down toward the water.\n\nOn a positive note: Some of these changes on the beach mean Dewey Beach is seeing more of those little pools of water where young kids love to splash around and play, Zolper said.\n\nHe also reminds visitors to stay off the dunes except when walking on the marked dune crossings. Whether the dunes have post-and-rope or the typical wooden fencing installed by DNREC, people should never climb or dig into dunes.\n\nBEACH SAFETY:Put down the beach shovel – digging big holes can get you in trouble. What you should know\n\nWhat to expect at restaurants, other beach businesses\n\nDelaware’s beach towns are preparing for a summer that’s as busy – if not busier – as last year.\n\nThat means it’s once again a time for this reminder: Have patience, folks.\n\nMany restaurants, bars and others in the service industry are still facing staffing shortages. While some businesses are getting more help from international students than in the past two years when COVID-19 restrictions limited that workforce, several other factors are impacting the seasonal labor shortage this year – especially a lack of affordable housing.\n\nRemember last year when some businesses were limiting hours or services? Visitors could see that again this summer, according to Carol Everhart, president of the Rehoboth-Dewey Chamber of Commerce.\n\nWORKFORCE In Delaware's new jobs landscape, workers are demanding more from employers\n\nIt may be wise to make early reservations, follow your favorite spots on social media or call ahead to stay updated on any changes.\n\nAs far as outdoor dining, many beach towns found ways to continue that into the 2022 season. However, Rehoboth Beach no longer allowed parking spaces to be blocked off for dining on public sidewalks. So, don’t expect to see those familiar red barriers in Rehoboth this summer.\n\nOUTDOOR DINING:Rehoboth Beach passes new outdoor dining rules for public sidewalks ahead of 2022 summer\n\nPublic health guidelines, COVID cases\n\nThe Delaware Division of Public Health reported a rise in COVID-19 cases in its monthly report in May.\n\nThe state reported that an average of 20% of tests reported to DPH are coming back positive as of May 24. That’s the highest positivity rate since late January.\n\nLATEST:Delaware is reporting rising COVID cases, hospitalizations again. What that means for you\n\nWhile hospitalizations are not nearly as high as they were during the first omicron surge, the number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 has increased since the spring. The state was reporting 115 people hospitalized and 10 in critical condition this week.\n\nSo, what should you do? This is the latest advice from DPH:\n\nStay home if sick and get tested if you have symptoms or were exposed to someone with COVID-19.\n\nThere are no mask mandates, but DPH advises masking up in indoor places or if you are at higher risk for illness.\n\nGet vaccinated and boosted when you’re eligible.\n\nStay informed and turn to reliable sources for data, information, and treatment options like de.gov/coronavirus.\n\nDon’t know if you’re eligible for a booster? Check your eligibility with this guidance from the state:\n\nChildren ages 5 and older if it has been five months after their second dose of Pfizer\n\nPeople ages 18 and older if it has been five months after their second dose of Moderna\n\nPeople ages 18 and older if it has been two months since their initial dose of Johnson & Johnson\n\nPeople who qualified for an “additional/fourth” dose of Pfizer or Moderna because they have certain immunocompromising conditions or are 50 years old and older. They can get their booster dose six months after receiving their third dose.\n\nWant to know where to receive booster shots? Visit coronavirus.delaware.gov/vaccine/where-can-i-get-my-vaccine/#publichealth.\n\nParking and transportation\n\nAll resort towns from Lewes to Fenwick Island have their seasonal parking rules in place.\n\nRehoboth Beach set new dates for its parking season – May 15 to Sept. 15 – which matches that of Dewey, Bethany, South Bethany and Fenwick.\n\nAnother change to note in Rehoboth: Because of the pandemic, Rehoboth offered free parking after 4 p.m. on Mondays for the past two years. That Meterless Monday program will not continue this summer.\n\nPARKING 2022:How much will it cost to park at the Delaware beaches? Parking changes coming this summer\n\nBoth Rehoboth and Lewes increased some parking rates this year. It is now a universal $3 per hour rate in Rehoboth, and Lewes is charging $1.50 downtown and $2.50 at the beaches.\n\nLewes has several free non-metered parking lots listed on its website, as well as metered lots and spaces on side streets.\n\nWhen visiting Delaware State Parks like Cape Henlopen, parking is included in the entrance fee.\n\nIn Dewey Beach, parking is free in all permit-only and metered spaces Monday through Wednesday from 5 to 11 p.m. only. All other days and times, you must pay to park on public streets.\n\nFenwick Island and South Bethany mostly require permits to park, but Fenwick offers free parking on its side streets after 4 p.m.\n\nIn Bethany Beach, all spaces are either metered or require a permit through Sept. 15.\n\nMany of these towns and cities offer payment through the ParkMobile app.\n\nFor more about parking (or State Park fees), visit each beach town's website:\n\nConsider taking the Beach Bus\n\nWant to forget about parking or paying for gas? Take a bus to the beach. Parking is free at the park and rides in Lewes and Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThe Beach Bus has already started its routes and will continue seven days a week until Sept. 11. The stops include Rehoboth Beach and the Boardwalk; Lewes; Long Neck; Dewey Beach; Bethany Beach; South Bethany Beach; Fenwick Island; Ocean City, Maryland; Millsboro; and Georgetown.\n\nThe cost to ride the bus is $2 per trip, $4 for a daily pass, $16 for a seven-day pass or $60 for a 30-day pass.\n\nTraveling from northern Delaware or Kent County?

If walking the boardwalk that night, expect it to be cooler and cloudy with a low around 62.\n\nThe skies continue to clear up on Sunday with a mostly sunny forecast. The temperatures should be near 71 during the day and reach the low 60s at night.\n\nAnd if you’re planning to spend a day off in the sand on Monday, you can expect sunny skies and a high near 72.\n\nEmily Lytle covers Sussex County from the inland towns to the beaches.

If not that date, then \"really close\" to then, Grapski said.\n\nAt a Tuesday morning press conference, DNREC's Delaware State Parks announced the official grand opening of the new full-service restaurant and bar built atop the park's existing bathhouse next to the Indian River Inlet Bridge.\n\nSpeakers at the press conference included Gov. John Carney, DNREC Secretary Shawn Garvin, Delaware Tourism Office Director Linda Parkowski, Parks and Recreation Director Ray Bivens and Grapski.\n\nThe partnership between state parks and La Vida Hospitality — owners of other beach favorites Fork & Flask at Nage Restaurant, Crooked Hammock, Big Chill Surf Cantina and more — is the largest public/private partnership and capital investment (more than $1 million) in state parks history, according to Carney and Garvin.\n\n“The state parks really thrive on partnership, leveraging resources, leveraging challenges and turning them into positives for the people of Delaware,\" Garvin said.\n\n“This is a really important industry in our state, the $3 billion tourism industry,\" Carney said. \"It drives so much employment and so much fun and so many visitors come here to this place, and we’re enhancing it with this public-private partnership.”\n\nThe partnership is an obvious one for Grapski and the rest of La Vida Hospitality to take part in.\n\n“To kind of define that word partnership, we view this as us working with the state parks to enhance an experience that’s already great here at the Seashore State Park,\" Grapski said. \"We know tons of people are coming here. We hope to be an additional amenity to the park that people can enjoy in a different way.”\n\nIt will be a much different way than park-goers are used to. The construction site is an easy indicator of that. Work began on-site on Feb. 1 by Lighthouse Construction of Dover.\n\nBig Chill is a sprawling space with 360-degree views of the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian River Inlet and Indian River Bay. There will be seating for up to 200 guests to enjoy dining and cocktail service.\n\nOther features include a $300,000 adjustable umbrella \"room\" for rooftop dining. There's a bar inside the umbrella'd area with 24 bar stools. The umbrella, manufactured in Austria, is 36-feet wide and is designed to protect against rain and wind up to 100 mph.\n\nRELATED: Three Delaware beach towns approved for emergency nourishment\n\nFood at Big Chill is designed to be typical beach fare, with classics like burgers, hot dogs and crinkle-cut fries. Of course, there will be seafood and an oyster bar. Grapski said La Vida is putting its own twist on it by adding SoCal tacos from Taco Reho, its food truck in Rehoboth Beach.\n\nGuests can take food to the beach but alcohol will not be able to hit the sand.\n\nBig Chill will employ \"northwards\" of 50 to begin the season, Grapski said, though he added that number may rise around July 4.\n\nREAD MORE: Bloody Mary competition returns to the Starboard on May 21\n\nAlso on the property is an event tent, which will play host to weddings and other events.\n\n“We’re currently working on a couple different partnerships with some of our local marketing friends to bring different events, beer festivals, culinary coast events,\" Grapski said of the tent area. \"Things like that will allow us to use this space and really show off this beautiful state park.”\n\nThe immediate area near the state park, Carney said, is a place he consistently recommends to colleagues in Washington.\n\n“I’ve always felt the top of the Indian River bridge has the best view in the whole state of Delaware,\" Carney said.\n\n“I wish I could stay here all day.”\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the Delaware Tourism Office unveiled 50 new beach umbrellas available for rent at the Seashore State Park. The umbrellas are emblazoned with the Visit Delaware logo and have the new slogan, \"Endless Discoveries\" featured on them as well.\n\nThe umbrellas, Parkowski said, will be \"dotting the beaches for years to come.\"\n\njneiburg@delmarvanow.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2022/05/24/memorial-day-weekend-drive-roads/9824124002/", "title": "When not to hit the road Memorial Day weekend: 'Expect congestion'", "text": "Barbecues.

The company released Memorial Day travel data Monday and said that 82% of Memorial Day weekend travelers will be traveling by car. Location data company Arrivalist said in a release that it estimates 37.9 million Americans will travel by road during this time.\n\nWith traffic in mind, it pays to plan ahead.\n\nAccount for extra travel time no matter where you're headed\n\nTravel times are expected to rise all around the country this coming weekend. It's important to plan for that when you are mapping out your route.\n\n\"Nationwide, you can expect about a 50% increase in normal travel time,\" Pishue said.\n\nFor example, if a trip typically would take you two hours, Pishue said it's smart to budget three hours.\n\nMetropolitan travel time impact\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the worst travel times across several U.S. metropolitans, according to Inrix, in partnership with AAA:\n\nAtlanta\n\nWorst corridor: I-85 South; Clairmont Road to MLK Jr. Drive\n\nWorst day: Thursday..\n\nWorst time: 3:30-5:30 p.m..\n\nPeak travel time increase: 128%\n\nBoston\n\nWorst corridor: I-93 South, Purchase Street to MA-24.\n\nWorst day: Thursday.\n\nWorst time: 2:30-4:30 p.m.\n\nPeak travel time increase: 110%.\n\nChicago\n\nWorst corridor: I-290 East, IL-110 to Racine Avenue.\n\nWorst day: Thursday.\n\nWorst time: 3:30-5:30 p.m.\n\nPeak travel time increase: 131%.\n\nDetroit\n\nWorst corridor: I-96 North; 6 Mile Road to Walled Lake.\n\nWorst day: Friday.\n\nWorst time: 3:00-5:00 p.m.\n\nPeak travel time increase: 65%.\n\nHouston\n\nWorst corridor: I-69 North; I-610 to I-10.\n\nWorst day: Thursday.\n\nWorst time: 4:45-6:45 p.m.\n\nPeak travel time increase: 88%.\n\nLos Angeles\n\nWorst corridor: I-5 South; Colorado Street to Florence Avenue.\n\nWorst day: Friday.\n\nWorst time: 4:45-6:45 p.m.\n\nPeak travel time increase: 123%.\n\nNew York\n\nWorst corridor: I-278 West, Long Island Express to 39th Street.\n\nWorst day: Thursday.\n\nWorst time:3:15-5:15 p.m.\n\nPeak travel time increase: 161%.\n\nSan Francisco\n\nWorst corridor: I-80 West, Gilman Street to Civic Center.\n\nWorst day: Thursday.\n\nWorst time: 5:45-7:45 p.m.\n\nPeak travel time increase: 105%.\n\nSeattle\n\nWorst corridor: I-5 South; WA-18 to WA-7.\n\nWorst day: Thursday.\n\nWorst time: 5:00-7:00 p.m.\n\nPeak travel time increase: 112%.\n\nWashington\n\nWorst corridor: I-95 South; I-395 to VA-123.\n\nWorst day: Thursday.\n\nWorst time: 3:45-5:45 p.m.\n\nPeak travel time increase: 77%.\n\nWhat's the worst day to travel this Memorial Day weekend?\n\nInrix has projected congestion across the country and has predicted when roads will be the most crowded.\n\n\"We think the most congested day is going to be the Thursday before the weekend ... across the country,\" Pishue said.\n\nFriday is another peak congestion day, Inrix said in a release. The least congested days will be Saturday, Sunday and Monday, according to Pishue.\n\nWhat time should you aim to travel through the holiday weekend?\n\nOn Thursday (the busiest day) – and Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday during Memorial Day weekend – the worst time to travel will be between 1 p.m. and 9 p.m., Pishue said.\n\nThat time period was a byproduct of the COVID-19 era, Pishue said, noting that Inrix has seen this trend in \"pretty much any metro area.\"\n\nMorning peak periods, usually spanning 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., have been depressed in terms of travel because fewer people are going into offices. But midday travel is at or above pre-COVID-19 levels in many areas, making midday an inopportune time to leave, Pishue continued.\n\n\"What we recommend is leaving generally before 6 or 7 in the morning, and on the weekend part of it – Saturday, Sunday, Monday – leaving before, you know, 10 or 11 (a.m.),\" Pishue said.\n\nHere’s Inrix's breakdown, in partnership with AAA, of the overall best times to travel and worst times to travel by day this Memorial Day weekend:\n\nThursday\n\nWorst time: Between 1 p.m. and 8 p.m.\n\nBest time: Before 6 a.m. and after 9 p.m.\n\nFriday\n\nWorst time: Between 12 p.m. and 7 p.m.\n\nBest time: Before 7 a.m. and after 9 p.m.\n\nSaturday\n\nWorst time: Between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m.\n\nBest time: Before 10 a.m.\n\nSunday\n\nWorst time: Between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m.\n\nBest time: Before 10 a.m.\n\nMonday\n\nBest time: Before 11 a.m.\n\n\"There's not a really bad travel time on (Memorial Day itself),\" Pishue said. \"(Traffic is) more spread throughout the day.\"\n\nContributing: Bailey Schulz, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/reviewed/2023/05/26/memorial-day-2023-when-is-memorial-day-weekend-how-to-spend-it/70256998007/", "title": "Memorial Day 2023: When is Memorial Day weekend and how to ...", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors. Purchases you make through the links below may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\n\nMemorial Day weekend is here. It's considered to be the unofficial start to summer for many, but the meaning behind it goes much deeper than that. Memorial Day is a time to honor the men and women that died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. They made the ultimate sacrifice so that we can live in the land of the free, allowing us to spend the day in a much more carefree way.\n\nThere are endless ways to spend your extra time, but it's important to first and foremost acknowledge the contributions of those who are no longer with us. Because of them, you can host a barbecue, get away for a mini vacation or even go shopping to enjoy the long weekend ahead. We’re here to help you decide how to spend your time by highlighting all the fun and meaningful things you can do over Memorial Day weekend.\n\nMake smart choices without hours of googling.

This year, it falls on Monday, May 29th. Many schools and businesses observe the federal holiday and shut their doors for the day.\n\nWhat is Memorial Day?\n\nMemorial Day is a federal holiday in America wherein fallen soldiers are honored for their service and mourned for making the ultimate sacrifice while serving in the United States Armed Forces.\n\nHonor veterans in a meaningful way\n\nIt's important to acknowledge why holidays are observed, as it gives you a better appreciation and understanding of the day. Memorial Day, as per its name, was established as a day of remembrance, specifically for service members who gave their lives in the line of duty. It can be traced all the way back to the Civil War. In Charleston, South Carolina, Black veterans organized burials for Union soldiers and later held a parade commemorating those who had fallen. Around the same time, the first “Decoration Days” were held, wherein women decorated the graves of fallen Confederate soldiers with flowers. Memorial Day was declared a federal holiday in 1971.\n\nNo matter where you live in the U.S., there's a good chance that there’s a Memorial Day parade or memorial service near you to attend. You can ask your smart speaker to help you find an event.\n\nThough it may seem like there’s no thank you that can quite cover the sacrifices of veterans, it can’t hurt to try. If you know of a late veteran, you can decorate their grave with a beautiful bouquet. You can also thank soldiers as you see them throughout the holiday. To thank active military members from afar, you can write letters to them or create thoughtful care packages to send them.\n\nSpend time with friends and family\n\nWhile Memorial Day is a day of remembrance, there's still space to have some fun, too. As it is a federal holiday, many businesses across the nation are closed and workers have the day off. Memorial Day has become widely regarded as the “unofficial start to summer” and an opportunity to gather with friends and family. You can host people right in your backyard for some fun in the sun and tasty grilling. Just freshen up the patio furniture and put out some lawn games for the whole family to enjoy. Looking to take it to the next level? You can also spruce up your home or car with some patriotic flair.\n\nDust off the grill\n\nMemorial Day is the perfect excuse to break out the grill for a barbecue. If you've noticed us talking about grilling a lot, it's because there's seldom a bad time for it. If you already have a grill, just make sure that it’s clean before using it. New to grilling? There are many grills to choose from, but we recommend our favorite charcoal grill, the Napoleon NK22K-LEG-2. It’s sturdy, gives you 22 inches of grill to work with and distributes heat evenly. If you decide to buy the Napoleon, don’t forget to pick up some charcoal. When it comes to gas grills, our favorite is the Weber Spirit II, which is compatible with a nifty thermometer app to help you cook food to the perfect temperature. Whatever grill you choose, unless you’re handling the searing-hot food with your hands (which we at Reviewed do not recommend) you’ll need good tongs to get the job done right.\n\nEnjoy a weekend getaway\n\nSince you have the day off, you might want to take some time to get away from the house and spend some time in nature. Perhaps take a short camping trip with the best tents we've reviewed. The Coleman 4-Person Skydome is our tent of choice, particularly if you’re not comfortable setting up tents—the attached poles are a lifesaver. Hiking to your destination? Consider a walking stick and a solid pair of hiking boots. Our favorite hiking stick is the Cascade Mountain Tech thanks to its affordability, lightweight build and adjustable length. And you can’t go wrong with the Ultralight Hiking Boot by Season Three. They may be costly, but they look and feel great.\n\nMaybe camping isn’t your style and you prefer a faraway destination. With that, you’ll need proper luggage to pack all your essentials. It doesn’t have to cost a fortune, either. We’ve got you covered with great luggage deals from Macy’s. Another way to make travel a whole lot easier is by keeping the kids good and distracted throughout your journey. Try some of these tried–and–true toys and games to entertain them. You can even get in on the fun with audiobooks that are a delight for the whole family\n\nHitting the road?These are the worst travel times this weekend for air, road travel\n\nHit the beach or lounge by the pool\n\nAnother great way to spend your day off is to hit the beach. We can help you bring everything you need for a perfect day. We recommend checking out these online stores to find a perfect swimsuit. Throw a towel, your favorite shades and a quality water bottle in a beach bag and you're good to go. Don’t forget to put on sunscreen so you can make the most out of your fun in the sun without major sunburns or unfortunate tan lines.\n\nIf you’re more of a pool person and are lucky enough to have a pool, then you’ll need to clean it before you dive right in. We’ve prepared a handy guide to help you every step of the way.\n\nCatch up on some much-needed R&R\n\nLet's face it, as nice as it is to spend time with friends and family, you deserve some time to yourself, too. What better way to spend the long weekend than to catch up on well-earned sleep, ensuring that you're feeling recharged when Tuesday comes knocking? Your body will thank you for finally managing to get a good night’s sleep.\n\nIn our humble opinion, the most important ingredient to getting quality sleep is a good pillow and there's no better option than Coop Home Goods Original Pillow. This pillow can be adjusted easily to fill it with your desired amount of memory foam. Sleeping on this will send you to a blissful paradise.\n\nIf a new mattress is calling your name, consider buying the Leesa Hybrid. This soft, but sturdy bed contours to your shape for maximum comfort and makes you feel like you're slumbering on a cloud. Before you excitedly reach for your tracker to log all the sleep you'll be getting, you should know that it may hurt more than it helps.\n\nShop the best Memorial Day deals\n\nWith great holidays come great deals from major retailers like Amazon and Walmart.

A few people played in the surf, with a couple more adventurous souls taking a deeper dip into the cool ocean water.\n\nSome wore masks, but many didn't. They're only required on the Boardwalk in Rehoboth.\n\n“This is a critical weekend for us,” Delaware Governor John Carney said in a press briefing Friday afternoon. “It’ll be a test as to how we’re able to keep socially distant, to be safe, to protect our neighbors.”\n\nHe said the focus will be more on voluntary compliance than enforcement of social distancing and mask-wearing requirements at Delaware’s beaches. But if the weekend goes well, he suggested, more conversations could be had in the upcoming week about loosening other restrictions.\n\nRehoboth Beach Police Chief Keith Banks said everything was going well as lunchtime hit on Saturday. Most people were complying with mask-wearing requirements and not getting disorderly when hearing of the rules, he said. He and his officers handed out about 200 masks to people who didn’t have them by lunch time on Saturday.\n\n\"It's beautiful weather,\" he said as he chatted with local business owners about what do when their lines get long like they normally would at the height of summer.\n\n\"Does it feel the same? No,\" he said, noting that the normal summer holiday crowd of visitors just wasn't there Saturday. \"We're going to get back to normal.\"\n\nWhile Delaware’s beaches have reopened for swimming and sunbathing, a mandatory 14-day quarantine order for out-of-state visitors and a ban on short-term rentals remained in place.\n\nRemaining restrictions were why Matt Weiner of Zelky’s beach arcades was asking visitors to sign a petition that would allow him to reopen without removing 80% of his game machines, which is what state officials want him to do.\n\n“If we don’t have machines, we don’t have revenue,” he said, adding that he noticed out-of-state traffic seemingly passing right by Rehoboth Beach on their way to Maryland or other coastal towns that have reopened hotels and short-term rentals. “Summer fun has been canceled by the governor.”\n\nFurther south in Ocean City, where out-of-staters aren’t required to self-quarantine for 14 days, the Inlet parking lot had plenty of open spaces and was scattered with license plates from Pennsylvania, Virginia, New Jersey and even Utah. Most plates, however, were from Maryland.\n\nRELATED:Heading to a Delaware beach for Memorial Day? Here's what you need to know about reopening\n\nSUMMER CHALLENGES:With short-term rentals still banned, Delaware locals fear visitors will leave for new beaches\n\nTraffic got slightly more congested closer to the Boardwalk, but cars weren’t sitting bumper to bumper as they normally would be for such a sunny, breezy day.\n\nAt Dumser’s, families sat in the sun, soft serve in hand with masks tucked below their chins.\n\nBars and restaurants may be closed to dine-in and drink-in services, but that hasn’t stopped the drinking or party prep of many of Ocean City’s younger beachgoers: A few 20-somethings walked up to Dumser’s with a pack each of Coors Light and White Claw, eyeing the menu.\n\nBehind Ocean City’s ice cream mainstay, a young, shirtless and masked man walked away from a strangely vacant Seacrets, where rows of patrons/partiers can normally be found — waiting for their orange crush and bayside views — as early as 7 a.m. Memorial Day weekend.\n\nOn the way to the Boardwalk, Henry Gregory stepped out of his motel wearing a shirt that read “Please wash your hands.” The Baltimore resident picked it up at a t-shirt shop while enjoying the sun and shore with a few friends from the city.\n\nWhile the giant ferris wheel remains still, street performers — from melancholic violinists to a guy joyfully shaking maracas — are back.\n\nThree police officers stood at Ocean City’s iconic entryway, while just down the Boardwalk, a few dozen mostly unmasked beach goers crowded around a street performer, watching him spray paint eclectic scenes and characters onto canvases.\n\nSome people sat on benches that had been blocked off, ignoring the city’s social distancing attempt in order to eat their fries, ice cream and other beach treats.\n\nOn the Boardwalk, seagulls expressed their normal voracious appetite for Thrasher’s by flying a few feet above the salty stray fries, then strategically diving for them while squawking at fellow feathered predators and human foot traffic.\n\nOn the beach, kids ran just past the water’s edge, squealing and slightly intimidated by the rough waves. Many of them utilized the wet sand for castle-building, while surfers went out much further to find a decent wave to ride.\n\nSave for the occasional mask, it was a normal day at Ocean City’s beaches, with families, college grads, fishers, bikinis, flip flops, surfers and fry seekers. While Ocean City was less packed than a typical Memorial Day weekend, it became somewhat of a temporary oasis from the pandemic. Whether beachgoers were masked or dismissing safety guidelines entirely, perhaps this weekend was their attempt to get back to normal — or some semblance of it — as soon as possible.\n\nAs the day lingered and the sun kept shining, traffic increased in downtown Rehoboth Beach by the afternoon, with barely a parking spot to be found along Rehoboth Avenue.\n\nDown in Bethany Beach, though, people like Merilie Van Goor of Long Neck thought they’d avoid crowds by going to the family-friendly resort town farther south. It seemed she wasn’t the only one who had that idea.\n\nPeople packed the slimmer beach, where it seemed like it was getting harder and harder to maintain social distancing. Aside from the Boardwalk, where masks are required, it seemed many were shunning the precaution. People pulled down their N-95 masks to enjoy local ice cream, and teenagers lined up closely together for a lunchtime snack.\n\n“For a Memorial Day weekend, it seems like there’s nobody here,” Van Goor said, noting that the crowd in Bethany was still far smaller than normal. But when she and her small group of friends and family crossed over the dune and got their toes in the sand, they stopped and turned around because it was too crowded for their comfort.\n\n“They’re really right on top of each other,” she said. “I’m so proud of the police here, though. They’re being so kind and gentle.”\n\nFor Cassidy Baker, one of the co-owners of Three Blonde Bakers in Bethany, the beach-goers were a welcome sign. She said from her experience, people were maintaining their distance while ordering and picking up, a good sign that summer will soon be able to start.\n\n“We’re really happy with the fact that people are able to enjoy the beach and do it safely,” she said. “We’re just hoping everybody can pull together and follow the rules now so we can open fully later.”\n\nSurf conditions also weren't the best for swimmers on Saturday. Moderate rip current risks lingered into the weekend, creating yellow flag conditions, said Rehoboth Beach Patrol Captain Kent Buckson.\n\n\"It's not too crowded. People are being respectful,\" he said as he drove up and down the beach in a dune buggy, checking out the scene and checking in on his guards who took up their posts for the first time Saturday.\n\n\"On the north and south ends, the crowd drops off significantly,\" he said. Most people were setting up their blankets near the Rehoboth Avenue entrance, where the beach is slightly smaller due to recent erosion from rough surf and storms.\n\n\"All in all, it's going well,\" he said. \"I'm very happy with our start today. Hopefully this is one step closer to normalcy.\"\n\nThe threat of rainy weather originally forecast for this weekend may have impacted some people’s decision to avoid the beaches Friday and Saturday. Showers may return Saturday afternoon, but skies are expected to clear up by the time Memorial Day arrives.\n\nThe National Weather Service forecast for Rehoboth Beach shows a cloudy Sunday with a high of about 57 degrees and a partly sunny Memorial Day with a high near 63 degrees.\n\nHave more questions about Delaware's beaches?

Here's how much gas cost ...", "text": "The national average of gas is $4.60 a gallon, according to AAA.\n\nMore people are expected to drive this Memorial Day weekend compared to last year.\n\nSee how much gas cost in your state, and how it compares to the rest of the United States.\n\nIt's a Memorial Day weekend unlike any other, as holiday travel will be met with gas prices that continue to shatter records.\n\nGas prices have been increasing for nearly two weeks, with the national average at $4.60 a gallon, according to AAA, a 43-cent jump from when the national record was initially broken in March.\n\nYet despite the pain at the pump being felt nationwide, the holiday weekend is expected to result in more travel across the country compared to last year.\n\nAcross all modes of transportation, there is an 8% increase in travel this weekend compared to 2021, according to Cars.com. Of that travel, 82% will be done by car, but most of it will be carpooling to save money. Location data company Arrivalist said in a release that it estimates 37.9 million Americans will travel by road during this time.\n\n\"Record-high gas prices aren’t scaring away as many avid road trippers this Memorial Day as one would think,\" Jenni Newman, Cars.com's editor in chief, said in a statement. \"It seems many Americans are willing to pay a premium to take some time off and celebrate the holiday. But the nature of the road trip is changing: Carpooling is no longer just for work and school commutes.\"\n\nLearn more: Best travel insurance\n\nHere's what you should know about being on the road for this Memorial Day weekend:\n\nTraveling for Memorial Day?: Here's when to avoid hitting the road, according to experts\n\nPlanning to head out this summer?: Here's how to take a summer road trip without spending a fortune as gas prices reach records\n\nWhy are gas prices so high?\n\nThere are several factors contributing to the rise of gas prices, with one of the main components being the embargo on Russian oil due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe cost of oil worldwide continues to be over $100 due to the embargo. U.S. crude oil costs $112.88 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, costs $116.41 as of Thursday, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nGas prices have begun to level off this week, but Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told USA TODAY things can change at the pump. Prices typically rise in the summer, and Memorial Day is the \"unofficial kickoff to the summer driving season,\" De Haan said.\n\nThe demand for gas and hurricane season, which begins on June 1 and is expected to bring several storms this year, can result in higher prices.\n\n\"We're probably setting up for a bumpy and expensive ride at the pump in the summer. It undoubtedly in my mind, barring a recession, is going to be the priciest summer that we've ever seen,\" De Haan said.\n\nWhen should I get gas?\n\n\"Sooner rather than later,\" De Haan said.\n\nHe added the reason is that although increases are slowing down, they could rise up toward the end of the week and when people begin to hit the road. But prices may be dipping in some cities and counties, so it's best to monitor daily changes.\n\nDe Haan said gas stations would also be busier as the weekend approaches, so not only could you be paying for more gas, but you could be spending more time waiting to do so.\n\nThose traveling across states should also see if there are any price differences across state lines. For instance, the average price in Nevada is $5.24, but go east to Utah and it's $4.59.\n\nAnother tip from De Haan to save money? Slow down about 5-10 mph on the highway.\n\n\"You can generally boost your fuel efficiency by 5% to 10%, if not more, and with a national average of $4.50, even a 10% savings is the equivalent of close to 50 cents a gallon,\" he said.\n\nWhere is gas the most expensive?\n\nThe West Coast is where you'll find the most expensive gas in the U.S., as all states bordering the Pacific Ocean are averaging over $6.. California has the most expensive gas at $6.07.\n\nStory continues below.\n\n'Excruciating':This working-class California county has the most expensive gas in the nation\n\nWhere is gas the least expensive?\n\nGas prices are above $4 in each state, but the cheapest gas is in the Midwest, with Oklahoma having the lowest cost at $4.09.\n\nAverage gas prices per state\n\nAre you wondering how much gas costs in your state on average?

Restaurant trash bins are no longer overflowing, and the famished creatures are scrambling for new sources of food.\n\n\"Jurisdictions have closed or limited service at restaurants and other commercial establishments to help limit the spread of COVID-19.

Asa Hutchinson said he’s seeing evidence of a second peak of coronavirus cases in his state.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference, Hutchinson said a high school swim party has been linked to new COVID-19 cases in the northeast part of the state.

More than 96,000 people have died in the U.S. during the pandemic so far, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSimone Landon, assistant editor of the Graphics desk for the Times, told the newspaper she wanted to mark the moment in time but wasn’t sure about just using graphics and instead came up with the idea to compile obituaries and death notices from newspapers across the nation.\n\n2 Missouri hairstylists may have exposed 140 clients to coronavirus\n\nTwo Missouri hairstylists worked while experiencing symptoms of the coronavirus, potentially exposing dozens of people, health officials said.\n\nThe Springfield-Greene County Health Department announced Friday the first stylist at Great Clips had served 84 clients. In a Saturday announcement, the department said 56 other clients were potentially exposed by the second stylist.\n\nClay Goddard, the health department's director, said in a news briefing the first stylist to get sick worked eight days from May 12 to May 20, with only the 18th off. The coworker then worked five shifts from May 16 to 20 while experiencing very mild symptoms.\n\nAll of the two stylists’ clients wore masks and will be tested. The owner of Great Clips said in a statement that the salon will be closed until it goes through sanitizing and deep cleaning.\n\n– The Associated Press\n\nTrump administration exempts foreign athletes from entry ban\n\nActing Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf signed an order Friday that exempts certain foreign professional athletes from the ban on entry into the U.S.\n\n\"Professional sporting events provide much needed economic benefits, but equally important, they provide community pride and national unity,\" Wolf said in a press release. \"In today’s environment, Americans need their sports. It’s time to reopen the economy and it’s time we get our professional athletes back to work.\"\n\nThe order also exempts the athletes' staff, team and league leadership, spouses and dependents from entry restrictions.\n\nThe order applies to Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the Women’s National Basketball Association, the Professional Golfers’ Association Tour, the Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour, the National Hockey League, the Association of Tennis Professionals and the Women's Tennis Association.\n\nSpain to reopen borders in July\n\nPrime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced Saturday that the country would be open to international tourism starting in July, Madrid-based newspaper El Pais and Reuters reported.\n\n\"Spain needs tourism and tourism needs security,\" Sanchez said.\n\nAccording to The Financial Times, tourism accounts for 12% of Spain's gross domestic product. The country welcomes 80 millions tourists each year.\n\nThe rest of Europe won't reopen until after June 15 and probably later than that for non-EU citizens.\n\n– Jayme Deerwester\n\nPublic remarks led to Florida data curator's firing\n\nThe woman who raised questions about Florida’s COVID-19 data after being ousted as the data’s curator had been reprimanded several times and ultimately fired for violating Health Department policy by making public remarks about the information, state records show.\n\nRebekah Jones’ comments over the past week and a half in emails to researchers, interviews with a handful of media outlets and blog posts have sought to sow doubt about the credibility of the data now that she is no longer in that role.\n\nState health officials strenuously deny any issue with the information’s accuracy as Gov. Ron DeSantis seeks to make a data-driven case for a step-by-step reopening of the state’s battered economy following safer-at-home orders. The Republican governor lashed out at a news conference earlier this week saying Jones had a pattern of “insubordination” and should have been fired months ago.\n\n– The Associated Press\n\nObesity increases risk of COVID-19 severity, studies show\n\nThe chronic conditions that increase the risk of serious illness and death of COVID-19 are by now well known: diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and being older than 65. Obesity is less well known or understood, but a growing number of studies and data on COVID-19 deaths confirm the link.\n\nThe extra weight on people in the 40-plus BMI range who contract COVID-19 increases the chance they will require hospitalization, most likely in the intensive care unit. It also hampers the ability of physicians to treat them, especially with ventilators, doctors say. Read more here.\n\n– Jayne O'Donnell", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/24"}]}

Yet there's one increasingly popular option that's downright retro: the drive-in theater.\n\nHearing the term drive-in may conjure images of '50s high schoolers in hotrods, or the big screen Brad Pitt's character lives behind in Quentin Tarantino's recent '60s-set film \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" But the inherently socially distanced setup of sitting in separate cars has made crowds suddenly seek out drive-ins, and luckily, Florida has several such theaters that have operated for decades.\n\nWhen traditional theaters shut down in the early months of the pandemic, drive-ins became essentially the only way to see films on the big screen, leading to the unlikely scenario observed by Vice where Ocala Drive-In briefly became the center of the U.S. box office merely by staying open and showing new releases. And while many movie theaters now struggle to stay open, with the country's second-largest cinema chain Regal recently temporarily closing again, drive-ins continue to remain popular.\n\nRooftop Cinema Club opened The Drive-In at Armature Works in Tampa, proving successful enough that programming was recently extended through Nov. 15. Sarasota-Manatee has hosted drive-in screenings at venues like The Mall at University Town Center and a Bradenton Walmart, the latter as part of a national tour by the chain.\n\nFall film festivals across the country have largely employed a combination of drive-in and virtual screenings. It's even inspired musicians, comedians and other entertainers to host drive-in events, including at actual theaters, with country star Jimmie Allen performing a concert at Lakeland's Silver Moon Drive-In this summer.\n\nGoing to the movies has long been one of my favorite pastimes, and while multiple local theaters remain open with safety guidelines, I've tried to limit my time indoors besides my home. And since I'd never been to a drive-in before the pandemic, visiting some of the ones near me has been a way to replicate the theatrical experience while getting out of the house and trying something new.\n\nI first visited Ruskin Family Drive-In, which has operated since the 1950s and shows double features, in late August when they screened \"The New Mutants.\" The X-Men spinoff was one of the first major new movies to open amid the pandemic. It was paired with fellow comic book film \"Black Panther,\" which in a tragic coincidence, played the same night the untimely death of its star Chadwick Boseman was announced.\n\nMORE: 15 top movies to watch for this Oscar awards season\n\nMORE: Top movie picks for Sarasota-Bradenton: Oct. 29-Nov. 4\n\nThe following month, I visited Tampa's Fun-Lan Drive-In to watch Christopher Nolan's much-anticipated time-bending thriller \"Tenet.\" And when I didn't have any plans this Halloween, I decided to head back there to see the new horror movie \"Come Play.\"\n\nThere are some drawbacks to watching a movie outside of an air-conditioned multiplex. If you choose to turn your car off and use a portable radio like I did, the Florida heat can be a factor, though thankfully it's now cooling down some. The dark, nighttime-set opening scenes of \"The New Mutants\" and \"Come Play\" were a little tough to make out, and the audio was rough during the louder action sequences in \"Tenet\" (though some of those who saw the film in regular theaters reported similar issues.)\n\nBut there's something to be said about the retro charm of a drive-in, not to mention the outdoor backdrop, with a beautiful Florida sunset slowly fading into night almost feeling like nature's version of an auditorium's lights dimming. And as someone who regularly went to the movies multiple times a week before the pandemic, with this easily being the longest stretch I've gone without seeing a film in theaters since I was a kid, it's been great seeing movies on a big screen again, in a venue where I felt totally at ease.\n\nOne of the moments I'm most looking forward to when this pandemic ends is the communal experience of sitting in a darkened auditorium with a packed crowd enjoying a movie again. Until then, I'm grateful for Florida's drive-in theaters for bringing back some of that feeling for me. And once this is all over, I intend to not make it another 29 years before I make my way back to the drive-in.\n\nHere's more information about some of the drive-in theaters closest to Sarasota-Manatee:\n\nRuskin Family Drive-In: The drive-in theater that has operated since the 1950s offers double features and is primarily showing throwback titles currently, with animated movies \"Toy Story\" and \"The Polar Express\" currently scheduled as the next screenings. 5011 U.S. 41, Ruskin; $6 ages 9 or older, $1 ages 5-8, free ages 4 or younger (cash only); 813-645-1455; ruskinfamilydrivein.com\n\nFun-Lan Drive-In: The drive-in offers movies on multiple screens and has largely been showing new releases, with recent offerings including horror movie \"Come Play\" and comedy sequel \"Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,\" along with some older titles. 2302 E. Hillsborough Ave., Tampa; $7 ages 12 or older, $2 ages 5-11, free ages four or younger; 813-234-2311; floridaswapshop.com/tampa\n\nThe Drive-In at Armature Works: Rooftop Cinema Club recently opened this drive-in featuring twice a night screenings.

But it also begs the question: What will they look like on the other side of COVID-19?\n\nTheaters have been largely closed around the country since March, when the pandemic created chaos within the industry: Hollywood shuttered, new films shifted to streaming, and studios sent their biggest summer movies packing, either to the fall or all the way into 2021.\n\nNow, with states slowly unveiling reopening phases and a couple of high-profile projects scheduled to hit theaters next month – Disney’s live-action “Mulan” (July 24) and Christopher Nolan’s thriller “Tenet” (July 31) – Americans are weighing when exactly they can (and should) safely go back just as change to a pop-culture pastime seems inevitable.\n\nCoronavirus delays:'Wonder Woman 1984' shifts to fall, 'Tenet' moves two weeks\n\nTests and more tests:Hollywood unveils new COVID-19 safety protocols for upcoming film and TV productions\n\n“It's going to be an evolution, not a revolution, that happens in the way people consume movies in the theater,” says Comscore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian.\n\nAudiences may have “amazing memories” of going to the movies, but “those days may be gone for good if we don't get rid of this virus or if another iteration of this virus happens,” says Jeff Bock, senior box-office analyst for Exhibitor Relations. “This one has scared people. And it was serious enough that it's going to change habits.”\n\nHere’s what movie theaters might look like in the near and far future:\n\nGoodbye, high-end amenities; hello, hand-sanitizer stations\n\nBecause everyone is starved for human interaction, a return to movie theaters “will automatically feel like a big, communal win,” says Kate Erbland, deputy film editor for IndieWire. However, that’s not possible without also taking into account aspects like masks, socially-distanced seating arrangements and “simmering worry over touching things.”\n\nThe push in recent years for cushier, reclining seats and expanded concessions will now shift toward moviegoers’ health concerns as more states begin to open theaters: California, for example, is now allowing theaters to be opened at 25% capacity while cinemas are in Phase 4 of New York’s reopening. AMC Entertainment, the largest movie theater chain in the U.S., says it plans to be fully open globally by July.\n\nBock thinks “personal preference” will be the status quo for the first couple months of reopening. “You want to take a risk or you don't, and that comes down to your personality, honestly.” Also important: world of mouth when it comes to cleanliness and following protocols. Bock points out one worry is an inconsistency among theaters when it comes to masks: “The No. 1 way to prevent (coronavirus) that we know of is a mask. And if they're not enforcing that, there's a huge swath of audiences that will just not go.”\n\nMissing movie theaters in quarantine?Fill up the car and head to these drive-ins\n\nStay safe and have fun: A user's guide to drive-in movie theaters\n\nRather than instituting any across-the-board health guidelines, the National Association of Theatre Owners is making sure theaters and chains develop their own protocols – in terms of spacing of seats, cleaning and disinfecting, and other concerns – and know what’s required, since state and local guidelines are different across the country.\n\nAudiences “want to see that movie theaters are doing those things right,” says NATO vice president and chief communications officer Patrick Corcoran. “They don't want theaters saying, ‘Hey, it's safe, come back’ because that's self-interested and they don't want to be sold on this. They want to be shown exactly what you're doing.”\n\nStudios could own their own theater chains\n\nAt the same time AMC committed to opening theaters in July, they also reported a more than $2 billion quarterly loss due to pandemic closures. In a recent public filing, the chain warned that it may not survive the fallout, and there has been speculation it could be an acquisition target for Amazon.\n\nWith the Justice Department filing a motion late last year to terminate the 1948 Paramount Decrees (a landmark antitrust case which prohibited studios from owning their own theaters), there’s a chance – possibly sooner rather than later – that studios might be able to purchase chains in financial distress. Erbland suspects it’s “inevitable” that a streaming service or studio will get back into the exhibition business on a large scale.\n\n“The tide is turning on what used to be verboten,” she says. “Movie theaters were already struggling long before COVID-19 shuttered many of them – some, it seems, even for good – and if a studio or streamer wants to come in and re-energize the market for people who still love going to the theater, that's a positive.”\n\nBock also sees it as a good thing, especially if studios are game for playing competitors’ films, too. Disney, for example, could have a “supercenter” theater featuring characters and merchandise in a theme-park atmosphere. “It’d be much like going to Disneyland where everybody's cheery and happy,” Bock says. “And if you go to a Lionsgate one, everybody's going be dressed like John Wick.”\n\nWill we ever go to movie theaters again? And are the Oscars even happening? We have answers\n\nSummer streaming preview:The 10 must-see new movies to stream while stuck at home\n\nDrive-ins are back, baby! (Maybe for good)\n\nAfter years of drive-ins going extinct like giant-screened dinosaurs, all of a sudden they’re the hottest ticket in their towns. “We could have never foreseen this just a few months ago,” Dergarabedian says. “Driving up, staying in a car and watching a movie really just dovetailed perfectly into social distancing.”\n\nWhile they had their initial heyday in the 1950s and ‘60s, drive-ins are surging in popularity again now – with safety protocols in place, of course – thanks to the resurgence of old favorites, as well as pop-up venues where you can park cars and a huge screen, such as Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. “In places like Florida and across the Southwest and the South, there's the potential for these theaters to be open all year-round,” Bock says. “If you built a double-decker (drive-in) that was super high-end, people would freak out. It would be a thing.”\n\nErbland doesn’t predict a sudden explosion of new drive-in theaters, though she believes the reinvigorated ones “are here to stay. People have remembered how fun they are, and how they can still feel like a communal experience, and I think a certain amount of emotion will be attached to them going forward.”\n\nAn apocalytic scenario could spawn new experiences\n\nSo what happens to movie theaters in the worst-case scenario, where there are several COVID-19 waves, a vaccine takes longer than expected or never happens, and streaming becomes the absolute go-to for movie lovers rather than a darkened screen with strangers? The cultural impact would be “devastating,” Dergarabedian says. “A world without the movie theater is not a world I'd want to live in.”\n\nErbland figures we’d still find the communal experience through “watch parties, more virtual premieres, more tweet-alongs, and maybe even more exploration of deeper back catalogs of very worthy films.” And Bock imagines theaters still existing, perhaps on a smaller scale with “theater pods where you and your family show up and just rent it all out.\"\n\n“I don't know that they'll completely go away, but if they did, it’d just be in a weird apocalyptic sort of way. Guess what? I think that's the future anyway,” Bock says. “This just picks up the pace in terms of what eventually is going to happen to theaters, in terms of which films will play to wide audiences and are worth the risk versus which films and which genres are not.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2014/11/04/arizona-iconic-businesses-closed/18468521/", "title": "Iconic Arizona businesses that are closed", "text": "The Republic | azcentral.com\n\nEditor's note: This story originally published in November 2014. If we've missed any Valley iconic businesses that have closed, add them in the comments section of the story.\n\nMany Phoenix-area restaurants, stores and other iconic businesses have come and gone in the area's history. Whether they had to shut down due to circumstance, management issues, skyrocketing prices or if they just couldn't keep up with the changing times, some of these businesses left a mark in the Valley. Here's a look at a few of the most iconic metro Phoenix businesses that have closed down.\n\nTom's Tavern\n\nJust shy of its 90th birthday, Tom’s Tavern in downtown Phoenix closed in 2017.\n\nThe iconic restaurant, a favorite of Arizona’s movers and shakers, opened in 1929.\n\nJim Gallen, the current chef-owner, released a statement via The Knight Agency, its Scottsdale-based PR firm:\n\n\"After careful consideration, Tom’s Tavern was forced to close on May 5. Owner and Chef Jim Gallen expressed great disappointment with the closure and would like to thank the loyal customers who have been with Tom’s for the last 87 years. Tom’s Tavern has a rich history in Phoenix, and has enjoyed serving many of our city’s finest. At this time, no plans have been made for the location at 2 N. Central Ave. Chef Gallen will continue cooking in the Valley and updates on his career will be announced soon.\"\n\nLegend City\n\nThe memories of this amusement park are better than the reality. Legend City changed hands four times during its 20-year lifetime. Each new owner would subtly change the park’s operations, evolving it further away from it's original Western-theme vision and more into a permanent carnival.\n\nThe original owner, Louis Crandall was inspired by Disneyland and the sudden boom of amusement parks across the country. The economic reality was it was too hot for an amusement park during Phoenix summers and winter evenings didn’t generate enough business.\n\nLegend City closed for the final time in September 1983. The park was leveled, and the grounds now hold office buildings for a public utility.Since then, there has been no amusement park like it in the area.\n\nVideo Paradise\n\nVideo Paradise in Chandler is from a bygone era, when video stores were a hot weekend stop for people of all ages and the wait for a new release created some buzz.\n\nAfter 25 years operating as a locally owned, independent store that hung on long after national chains Blockbuster and Hollywood Video closed stores across the country, the owner, Marshall Hawkins, said a \"perfect storm'' of factors led to the closure in January 2016. New in-home streaming such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, along with the proliferation of Red Box rental kiosks were one factor. Another was a change in terms of his lease at the shopping center where the store is located.\n\nHawkins, who had owned the store for its last 10 years in business, credited a loyal customer base for helping keep the store in business for a quarter of a century.\n\nEd Debevic's\n\nEd Debevic's was another family favorite, near 20th Street and Highland Avenue. Sassy waitresses served burgers and meatloaf at the retro-style diner through the '80s and '90s. The jukebox, photos and snarky neon signs went to auction when the diner closed in the early 2000s.\n\nFarrell's Ice Cream Parlour\n\nRobert Farrell opened the first of these old-fashioned ice-cream parlors in Portland, Ore., in 1963.\n\nThe family-friendly franchise came to the Valley in 1968, brought by Robert Garland, a World War II veteran who founded the Garland Advertising Agency, known for creating the branding for Del Webb's Sun City.\n\nGarland was credited with coining the line, \"Farrell's features fabulous food and fantastic fountain fantasies for frolicking, fun-filled, festive families.\"\n\nThe ice-cream shop was a popular party destination, thanks to novelties such as the Zoo, a 10-pound ice-cream sundae that vest-wearing servers wheeled to your table while making oinking noises and blaring sirens.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1990 — from the presidencies of Lyndon B. Johnson to George H.W. Bush — Garland operated five Farrell's locations around Arizona. He closed shop around 1990, when the national chain, which had passed hands among several investment groups, foundered. Garland died in 2003.\n\nChocolates by Bernard Callebaut\n\nMaster chocolatier Bernard Callebaut first brought his exquisite confections to Arizona in 1996, when he opened Chocolaterie Bernard C in Scottsdale's Hilton Village.\n\nCallebaut's Belgian family had been in the chocolate business since 1911. When the business was sold in 1980, he moved to Alberta, Canada, and started his company.\n\nThe candies — more than 48 varieties — were made in Callebaut's factory in Canada using chocolate imported from Belgium, walnuts from France, and hazelnuts and almonds from Italy.\n\nThey had no artificial preservatives, vegetable oils or animal fats, and the whipping creams and butter were so fresh that the chocolates came with two-week expiration dates.\n\nThe stores, including one in Chandler and Phoenix, sold champagne truffles, boxed collections and seasonal specials such as chocolate yule logs, the traditional French chocolate-and-cream confection.\n\nIn a 2000 story about the best chocolate for Valentine's Day, Seftel wrote, \"In this town, if you want the best, it means a trip to Chocolates by Bernard Callebaut.\"\n\nThe Chandler store closed in 2004, and the rest of the chocolates began to disappear from Arizona, and most of the country, about four years later. The good news? The company is still around and you can buy the chocolate to be shipped to your home.\n\nBaker Nursery\n\nBaker Nursery was open for about 46 years until it finally closed down its doors in late 2014.During its time in business, employees helped landscape countless Phoenix-area homes, making the valley greener and full of life with yards and gardens of hibiscus and citrus trees.\n\nThe founder, Jim Baker, bought the location at 40th Street and Osborn Road in 1968, competing with large mega-stores like Walmart and Home Depot. In 2006, he signed the company over to three of his six daughters.\n\nA-1 Beer\n\nThere was a time when every city had its own breweries, and A-1 was the major player in Phoenix. It was later bought by a larger national brewery and the quality slipped a bit. If you remembered the brand from the 50s, when it was the “Western way to say welcome,” you thought of a crisp pilsner. Those who remember the canned beer from the 70s, have less fond memories.\n\nHarkins Camelview 5\n\nAfter a 42-year run as one of the Valley's preeminent movie theaters, Harkins Camelview 5 in Scottsdale closed in December 2015, replaced by a new 14-screen cinema next door at Scottsdale Fashion Square mall. Harkins announced plans in 2013 to close Camelview, which long ago carved a niche in the Phoenix area as a destination for independent, foreign and artistic films.\n\nDowntown Deli\n\nA longtime fixture in downtown Phoenix, the Downtown Deli shuttered its doors on May 22, 2015. The deli was known for its Skyscraper sandwich with corned beef piled high with pastrami and Swiss cheese. Glenn Schultz, who owned the deli with wife Trish, said the landlord raised the rent, forcing the business to close. But, there's hope. Schultz said they're hoping to relocate the business somewhere else downtown.\n\nMy Florist Café\n\nThis bakery, sandwich shop and wine bar was one of the first of the new wave of restaurants in the central Phoenix area when it opened in 1996. It offered a pricey, but delicious, peanut butter sandwich and offered a white wine with which to pair it. The piano performances by Nicole Pesce would delight crowds.\n\nBack in its 1990s heyday, My Florist Café attracted a cool crowd of bohemians and suits, folks who had almost no downtown Phoenix-area hangout alternatives. Here you could get decent grub and big-city vibes to go with it.\n\nIt closed suddenly in 2010. More eateries had filed into downtown by then. The iconic sign was left over from when the building did house a florist beginning in 1947. Below it now is a chain hamburger restaurant.\n\n12 Valley restaurants that stand the test of time\n\nKarsh's Bakery\n\nThis venerable kosher bakery, known for its handmade challah and rye breads, Kaiser rolls and Jewish pastries, fell victim to the times. It could not compete with high volume bakeries and increasing rents. It was one of the last old-school bakeries, where bakers made pastries, bagels and breads by hand each day.\n\nKarsh's Bakery closed in March 2014, ending nearly 50 years in business. On its last day, there were lines around the block with customers who started their wait before doors opened at 7 a.m. Owners said at the time that they hoped to find a smaller, more affordable location and re-open.\n\nCine Capri\n\nThis single screen theater was still viable. But the real estate it was on was eyed for redevelopment. Responding to an outcry from the community, developers tried to incorporate a Cine Capri-like theater into plans for high-rise office buildings. But negotiations soured. There was talk of putting the fate of the corner on the city ballot. The land owners announced plans to demolish the theater, effectively ending the arguments. Harkins Theaters has replicated the large screen curtained experience in two multiplex locations.\n\nBlakely's\n\nBlakely's was a string of service stations through the Phoenix area. Attendants in white uniforms would pump gas, fill up tires and check oil. Patrons were either given a free glass, or a receipt slip that could be saved and redeemed for dinnerware. The glasses, which were painted with cactuses, have become collectibles. The chain started in 1937. It was bought by Gulf Oil in 1963.\n\nScottsdale 6 Drive-in\n\nThis drive-in was demolished in 2014, years after it shut down. It was the latest in a string of drive-in movie theatres to close, the result of changing habits and tastes among movie-goers. Scottsdale 6 closed its doors in 2011. The Phoenix area used to be dotted with the outdoor screens. A partial list of names: Big Sky, Pioneer, Nu View and the Thunderbird.\n\nFollowing national trends , Arizona has lost almost 50 drive-ins in the past half-century. The Apache Drive-in, in Globe, closed in 2013, leaving only one drive-in theater still existing in the state: The WestWind Glendale 9 on 55th Avenue, south of Bethany Home Road.\n\nGuedo's Cantina Grille\n\nA popular taco shop that operated in downtown Chandler for 30 years closed in December 2015 after being acquired by a firm that plans to bring a new residential and retail development to the site.\n\nGuedo's Cantina Grille's longtime owner, William \"Guedo'' Samora III, confirmed the property had been acquired by COR Arizona Avenue Company LLC. The developer has been working for several years to bring the new mixed-use development to the corner, which is mostly vacant and includes a parcel of city-owned property that Chandler officials have sought to have developed.\n\nCookiez on Mill\n\nThis family-owned treat shop opened on Mill Avenue at Fifth Street in Tempe in 2003. Arizona State University students came in after class, football games or date nights to make their own ice-cream sandwiches, assembled with from-scratch cookies and more than 20 ice-cream flavors.\n\nChoices of cookies included peanut butter, oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip, and were used to sandwich rocky road, cookies and cream, mint chocolate and vanilla ice cream.\n\nThe shop, which also sold smoothies and other sweet treats, was housed in the historical Goodwin building, constructed in 1907 by Garfield A. Goodwin. The small space was added in 1912. Before housing Cookiez on Mill, it housed a Wells Fargo agency and the Tempe Daily News office.\n\nThe shop closed in November 2011.\n\nPinnacle Peak Patio\n\nPinnacle Peak Patio in Scottsdale, an iconic steakhouse, closed on June 28, 2015. Generations of visitors, hankering for an Old West experience, set foot in the dusty wooden establishment, known for its 2-pound porterhouse steaks and of neckties hanging from the ceiling.\n\nPinnacle Peak Patio started out in 1957 as a small store that sold beer and bait to fishermen traveling to nearby lakes. The original owner, wanting to increase sales, offered a simple steak dinner consisting of a 32-ounce Porterhouse steak cooked over mesquite wood. Its reputation grew as a place known for snipping off the necktie of anyone who dared enter its doors dressed so formal\n\nWhen the business closed, the owners expressed that they were looking for a new location to reopen some day.\n\nMonti's La Casa Vieja\n\nTempe's iconic Monti's La Casa Vieja, among the longest-lasting restaurants in Tempe and which was housed in the historic Hayden House on Mill Avenue, closed on Nov. 17, 2014, after nearly 60 years in business. The restaurant was opened in 1956 by the final owner's father, Leonard Monti, two years after he bought the Hayden House, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\n\nMicheal Monti, the last owner of the restaurant, said of the historical site that even though the business is closing, \"the tradition and history aren't going away.\"\n\nThe downtown restaurant, which had been the gathering place for countless groups through the years and known Valley-wide for its steak, Roman bread and historic memorabilia, was shut down mainly for the cost of production and the high cost of beef.\n\nBig Apple\n\nBill Johnson's Big Apple, a 59-year icon at 3757 E. Van Buren St., closed May 24, 2015. The Phoenix restaurant was the last remaining in a chain that once had seven locations. The eatery was known for its Western decor and sawdust on the floor. The waitresses wore cowboy hats on their heads and toy six-shooters on their hips.\n\nHanny's\n\nBack when Phoenix residents went downtown to buy clothes, this was one of the department stores of choice. Shopping districts moved to malls and power centers in farther-flung areas. Hanny’s sturdy concrete structure stood vacant for years. The fire department would set it on fire for structure practice. But it has been reinvented and occupied as a wine bar and restaurant since 2008. Patrons can stand over the old elevator shaft. Names of clothing brands still decorate the walls.\n\nGreasewood Flat\n\nGeorge \"Doc\" Cavalliere opened Greasewood Flat, the iconic Western watering hole in north Scottsdale, in 1975. With its picnic tables, laid-back ambiance and rustic wares, the bunkhouse-turned-saloon east of Pinnacle Peak became a popular hangout for bikers and tourists, cowboys and families to kick up their boots and relax.\n\nAfter 40 years in business, Cavalliere’s passing in 2010 forced the family to sell the property to pay estate taxes and other expenses, and the saloon shut soon after. Taylor Morrison Homes bought the 43-acre property in 2013 and planned to build 80 houses there.\n\nHenkel AG (formally the Dial Corp.)\n\nHenkel AG, parent company of the Dial Corp., announced in October 2016 that it was shuttering its Scottsdale, Arizona, offices. The company said it would combine the operation with Sun Products Corp., which Henkel acquired in June 2016. Both companies were to move to a facility in Stamford, Conn.\n\nArizona lost roughly 375 jobs.\n\nHenkel acquired the Dial Corp., formally one of Arizona's largest corporations, in December 2004 for $2.9 billion.\n\nDial Corp.'s history in The Valley began when Greyhound, the company that owned Dial Corp., moved its headquarters to Phoenix in 1971.\n\nIn 1989, a new headquarters was built near downtown Phoenix. The building resembled a bar of soap and would be known as the Dial Tower.\n\nThe company moved to Scottsdale in 1997.\n\nHenkel is a Germany-based company that sells Purex and Persil laundry detergent, Dial soap and Right Guard deodorant, among other beauty products, detergents and adhesives.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/life/2019/07/01/things-to-do-in-phoenix-arizona-in-summer-indoors-outdoors/1505006001/", "title": "Summer in Arizona: 100 things to do to survive the Phoenix heat", "text": "Arizona Republic\n\nIf it's June in Phoenix that means it's hot and likely to get hotter for a while. If you've been here for more than five minutes, you know that. But summer in Phoenix has its upside.\n\nThe winter visitors are gone, and so many residents have gone on vacation that doing almost anything fun is easier. Rush hour is shorter, restaurants and clubs are less crowded, water parks and splash pads all around town are open.\n\nSo in the spirit of summer fun, we have 100 things to do in the Phoenix metro area. Some are indoors — museums, restaurants, discounted movies — and some are outdoors, like kayaking on Tempe Town Lake and nighttime scorpion hunts.\n\nFor even more things to do, go to azcentral.com/things-to-do and azcentral.com/travel-explore.\n\nSummer fun: A guide to the best things to do and see this summer in metro Phoenix\n\n1.

Tubing on the Salt River\n\nTubes, coolers, friends and weird sunburns. It never gets old. You and your pals can take two cars, park one where you want to get out of the river and drive the other to the entry point south of Stewart Mountain Dam, then retrieve the car by the dam after your float.

Eat hot, stay cool\n\nAlthough it might sound illogical, the best way to stay cool is by adding chilies to your diet. There's evidence that hot foods work as culinary air-conditioning. That's why many of the world's best spicy dishes come from India, Mexico and Thailand.\n\nHere's how hot cools: Blood vessels close to the surface of your skin, especially on your face and neck, expand so the blood can throw off heat. This causes your internal temperature to decrease and your skin temperature to rise. Next, you sweat, and as the sweat evaporates, it cools you off.\n\n7. Golfland Sunsplash\n\nOpen attractions at Golfland Sunsplash in Mesa, subject to change, include the wave pool, Caribbean Water Works, Splash Water Harbor Slides, Master Blaster and Storm Rider.

WaterWorks at Arizona Falls\n\nSitting in the \"water room\" is a bit like being behind a waterfall at this attraction that's part public art and part working hydroelectric plant.

Herberger Park, 56th Street and Indian School Road, Phoenix. srpnet.com/water/canals/azfalls.aspx.\n\nA hidden gem: Arizona Falls on Arizona Canal has been Phoenix's gathering spot for 100 years\n\n11.

Head for the beach\n\nWhen most folks think of the beach, they thinking about heading to California or Mexico to get to the sandy ocean shores. Arizona has beaches of its own, however. Here are three of the top beach destinations in the state.\n\nLake Havasu State Park: At nearly 11,000 acres, Lake Havasu State Park is by far the largest of western Arizona's parks.\n\nAt nearly 11,000 acres, Lake Havasu State Park is by far the largest of western Arizona's parks.

Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers\n\nIs there a better way to beat the heat than frozen custard? Maybe one or two. But this is a good one.

Muddle mint with ice, then add water or iced tea for a refreshing summer drink.\n\n16. Base & Meridian Wildlife Area\n\nAt the confluence of the Salt and Gila rivers, this is a super place to watch birds — great blue herons, screech owls, belted kingfishers, to name just a few — spot javelinas, beavers, Sonoran mud turtles and other mammals and reptiles, and drop a fishing line (you'll need a fishing license).

Eat cool foods\n\nEating fruits and vegetables with high water contents will help keep you naturally cool. So, when it's hot, fill up on carrots, lettuce, kiwi, cucumber, watermelon, peaches, pineapple, celery, peppers, eggplant, radish, cantaloupe and summer squash. Frozen grapes are another quick cool-down.\n\n23. Browse Changing Hands Bookstore\n\nYou're reading this, so you like to read.

Keep your cocktails cooler\n\nRegular ice cubes melt too quickly, diluting the best cocktails into a watery mess. Buy a tray that creates 2-inch-square cubes, which melt slower and keep your drink cooler for longer. Better yet, get an ice-ball maker. A giant sphere of ice just looks so much classier.

Metro Phoenix is home to some of the best courses in the country, if not the world. Trouble is, for half the year they're outside the price range of anyone who isn't a pro (or a 1-percenter). But if you're willing to put up with the heat (and drink a lot of water), there are great discounts available during summer. Because, you know, no one wants to play in the heat. But with hydration, it's really not that bad. Your slice, on the other hand ...\n\n69. Grill. A lot.\n\nNo one wants to fire up the oven when it feels like an oven outside. So fire up the grill instead. The food tastes better, it's less mess in the house and you don't have to stand outside the entire time it's cooking. Go inside, have a cool drink while the chicken, ribs and veggies char to perfection. Here are two good sites for inspiration: amazingribs.com and grillgirl.com.\n\n70.

The coolest food\n\nNo cuisine is more light and refreshing than Japanese sashimi (thinly sliced raw fish) and sushi (bite-size delicacies made with vinegared rice, but not always with raw fish). And thanks to the modern wonders of airplanes and refrigeration, you can enjoy both of them safely even in the middle of a desert summer.\n\nFor a top-quality, fairly traditional fish feast, try Hana Japanese Eatery (602-973-1238, hanajapaneseeatery.com) or Hiro Sushi (480-314-4215).\n\n98. Flagstaff Scenic Skyride\n\nHead to Arizona Snowbowl near Flagstaff and ride a chairlift to the top of an extinct volcano about 11,500 feet above sea level. Hint: You'll probably need a jacket. While you take in the breathtaking views of northern Arizona and beyond, a Forest Service ranger can tell you about the flora and fauna below.\n\nDetails: 10 a.m.-4 p.m. daily. From Flagstaff, drive 7 miles northwest on U.S. 180 to Snowbowl Road. Turn right and go 7 miles to the lodge. $15-$24; free age 5 and younger. 928-779-1951, www.snowbowl.ski.\n\n99.

Crank the AC and watch a winter movie\n\nPop some corn, grab a blanket and feast your eyes on wintry landscapes and snow-capped mountains.

They appear in our inboxes and on our feeds like clockwork, sandwiched between big box store discounts and emails from friends.\n\n4,706 positive cases one day.\n\n40 deaths another.\n\nOver 400,000 recovered to date.\n\nMore than 6,100 lost.\n\nIn the routine of it all a callus grows, a protection against what these numbers actually stand for — people.\n\nBehind these figures are storytellers and hard workers, Cubs fans and pie bakers, mothers and daughters, fathers and sons. Behind these numbers are our fellow Iowans.\n\nThe Iowa Mourns project is a result of months of research to reveal the stories of neighbors and friends lost to the pandemic. In writing about them, we focused on the light of their lives instead of the darkness of their diagnoses, and sought to chronicle who they were, what they did and how they’ll be remembered.\n\nIowa Mourns was made possible by an unprecedented partnership of nine daily newspapers across Iowa’s two premier newspaper organizations — the Register, Ames Tribune, Burlington Hawk Eye and Iowa City Press-Citizen of the USA TODAY Network; and the Council Bluffs Daily Nonpareil, Mason City Globe Gazette, Quad-City Times, Sioux City Journal and Waterloo Courier of Lee Enterprises. Journalists from all over the state contributed, ensuring we painted a true picture of how Iowa has changed from river to river.\n\nWe remain committed to telling these stories. If you would like your loved one remembered in this way, email me at ccrowder@dmreg.com or submit their name here.\n\nTogether, we can make certain the Iowans lost will always be more than a number.\n\n— Courtney Crowder\n\nREMEMBERING:\n\nA\n\nConnie Abegglen, 74, Merrill.

In those long days indoors, many of us have spent vast amounts of time entertaining ourselves at home, which means we're watching more TV, streaming more movies, blasting more music and reading more books. At least, it meant that for the USA TODAY Life staff, since we spend most of our time finding the best entertainment choices for our readers.\n\nTo entertain a group of entertainment reporters, a movie, TV show, book, album or podcast has to be more than just good enough. It has to stand out from all the pop culture we spend our time reviewing and writing about. So here are 100 things that managed to divert and distract us from the news at a difficult time (and a few that fell decidedly flat).\n\nMovies\n\n1. “13th”: I was not prepared for the visceral reaction I had when I watched this Netflix documentary. Directed by Ava DuVernay, this powerful film tackles the history and policies that have produced the current prison boom in the United States, from the enactment of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, to the present day prison system where African Americans are unfairly over-represented. It is a must-watch film. -Mary Cadden\n\n2. “American Psycho”: We’ve all been feeling a little “psycho” being locked up during stay-at-home orders, but nothing compares to the serial-killing tendencies of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a wealthy New York investment banker. -Jenna Ryu\n\n3. “Athlete A\": I’m a former gymnast and a current journalist, so when those two worlds collide, I’m all in. This documentary, chronicling how the Indianapolis Star broke the story of systemic abuse at USA Gymnastics, is triumphant and gut-wrenching in equal measures. It speaks to the power of a free press and the ability of the human soul to overcome tragedy. -Alison Maxwell\n\n4. “Bad Education”: A story of school administrators embezzling from a high-achieving, Long Island, N.Y., school system doesn’t sound like the most scintillating movie pitch, but Hugh Jackman and Allison Janney create compelling, entertaining characters in HBO’s darkly comic look at the corrupting effects of the American drive for success. -Bill Keveney\n\n5. “Barry Lyndon”: A grievously underrated 1975 Stanley Kubrick masterpiece. I spent three full hours exclaiming, “Look at that depth of field!” and “It’s like a painting!” to an empty room. I am cool and all the boys like me. -Barbara VanDenburgh\n\n6. Black-and-white movies: More time at home offers a chance to revisit film classics or finally get to ones you’ve heard about but haven’t seen. My random sampler includes: “The Best Years of Our Lives” (1946), which poignantly depicts the toll war takes on the winning soldiers; “A Face in the Crowd” (1957), which offers a sharp-eyed, early look at the demagogic power of television; and Stanley Kubrick’s “Dr. Strangelove” (1964), a dark comedy about nuclear self-destruction famed for Peter Sellers’ three-role tour de force. -B.K.\n\n7. The “Bourne” film franchise: Matt Damon as an amnesiac spy with a devastating kill set delivers the thrills, even upon repeat watching. For a decidedly different action film set in Europe, try 1968’s “Where Eagles Dare,” an exciting if somewhat implausible World War II rescue adventure starring a fascinating duo: Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. -B.K.\n\n8. “Braveheart”: July 4th weekend felt like a good time to conquer this three-hour event of a movie, which lived up to its campy, bloody and epic reputation. -Kelly Lawler\n\n9. \"Dark Waters”: A must watch for anyone who loves a legal thriller or a movie based on a true story, about chemical contamination of a small town. -Morgan Hines\n\n10. “Disclosure”: Quarantine is an opportunity to educate oneself. The documentary, which counts Laverne Cox as an executive producer, traces transgender representation in TV and movies. -Erin Jensen\n\n11. Disney animated movies (a lot of them): After several weekend days spent in the wonderful world of Disney+, I have the following assessments: The “Frozen” music is mostly terrible, the live-action “Lady and the Tramp” is wildly underrated and we should go back to the glory days of 90-minute animated musicals like “Mulan” and “Aladdin.” - K.L.\n\n12. “Elf”: One day in lockdown, my pre-K daughter wanted to pretend it was Christmas. We decorated sugar cookies with red and green sprinkles, made Santa hats from construction paper and watched Will Ferrell prance around New York City in tights proclaiming, “The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.” -Jennifer McClellan\n\n13. “Emma”: Anya Taylor-Joy is perfectly cast as Emma, a wealthy youth with hubristic views on her matchmaking abilities. The chemistry between her and Johnny Flynn’s Mr. Knightley is undeniable and, like all great Jane Austen adaptations, peaks while they are dancing at a ball. -J.M.\n\n14. “Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga”: If there was ever a time for a feel-good movie, it is now. And that movie is “Eurovision.” Inspired by the actual Eurovision song contest, and even featuring some of its past contestants and winners. The Netflix film is a perfect balance of sweet and slapstick. Stars Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams are everything.Well, almost everything. Dan Stevens steals quite a few scenes and there is, of course, the music of Abba. I laughed, I cried, I downloaded the film’s \"Song a Long\" and have it on constant repeat. -M.C.\n\n15. “Hamilton”: Having never seen the stage production, I’d always regretted not being able to watch Daveed Diggs rap 6.5 words per second while jumping off a table during “Guns and Ships.\" On Disney+, \"Hamilton\" was as good – if not better – than I expected. But it was the little things that stood out to me while watching the filmed performance of the Broadway musical: the use of the bullet as a character, that look on Leslie Odom’s face when he defiantly sings, “I am the one thing in life I can control” during “Wait for It.\" All in all, I’m satisfied. -Jayme Deerwester\n\n16. “Her”:\" Maybe watching a 2013 movie about a man falling in love with a Siri- or Alexa-like voice wasn’t the greatest idea during the height of quarantine and lack of human connection. But also, who cares? Get yourself some catharsis and watch a movie for which Joaquin Phoenix should’ve won an Oscar. -David Oliver\n\n17. “Hitch”: I rewatched the 2005 Will Smith film during quarantine, and it remains my favorite rom-com. Enough said. -M.H.\n\n18. “Inception”: Ten years after its release, I rewatched “Inception,” a movie I had never conceptually been able to understand until now (kind of). The 2010 Christopher Nolan film, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, follows a corporate espionage plan to infiltrate the dreams of a competitor. -J.R.\n\n19. James Bond movies: About halfway through an attempt to watch all of the Bond films, I mostly resent my parents for letting me watch “Austin Powers” before showing me what inspired the parody. -K.L.\n\n20. Orson Welles films (other than \"Citizen Kane\"): If you like “Kane” (1941), often voted the greatest film of all time, don’t miss two other Welles-Joseph Cotten collaborations: as director and star in 1942’s “The Magnificent Ambersons” and as actors in 1949’s “The Third Man,” which has the added bonus of zither music! -B.K.\n\n21. “Palm Springs”: Yes, the plot is just like Bill Murray’s “Groundhog Day.” I don’t care. This winning comedy starring Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti was a treat on Hulu, after bypassing theaters. The pair had great chemistry and the movie was sweet, funny and sort of thought-provoking, too. -Gary Levin\n\n22. “Showgirls”: I don’t know what it says about me that watching 1995's “Showgirls” (streaming on HBO Max) for the first time has been a highlight of self-quarantine. I love a movie that's so bad it’s good, and this is an all-timer of the genre. -B.V.\n\n23. \"The Surrogate\": This 2020 feature debut of filmmaker Jeremy Hersh tells a thought-provoking story of a woman (Jasmine Batchelor) who agrees to carry a child for her married gay friends, only to learn the fetus has Down Syndrome. It’s a complex and emotional film that deftly explores weighty issues of race, class and ability. -Patrick Ryan\n\nTV shows\n\n24. “13 Reasons Why”: I started this show back when it first made waves years ago, but after going back to the beginning and watching all four seasons during the pandemic, I highly recommend you don’t do the same (at least not when the world is already stressful enough). This Netflix series is packed with heavy and disturbing elements, so instead of providing an interesting escape, it turns into a depressing undertaking. -Sara Moniuszko\n\n25. “Better Call Saul”: With final-season production postponed by the pandemic, you’ve got time to catch up with AMC's “Breaking Bad” prequel, which might be the best spinoff series ever. Bob Odenkirk is great in the title role, but Rhea Seehorn’s Emmy-worthy performance was the jewel of the just-concluded Season 5. -B.K.\n\n26. “Big Little Lies”: I’m embarrassed to say it took me this long to watch HBO's incredible miniseries. Although a lot of the plotlines and themes are heavy, the series provides the perfect binge option that will keep you hooked. (And the twists and turns may even help you escape from the world’s problems for a bit.) -S.M.\n\n27. “Damages’’: Glenn Close and Rose Byrne are terrific in every season of FX's legal thriller. -Dawn Gilbertson\n\n28. “Dead to Me”: The Netflix series starring Christina Applegate and Linda Cardellini will surely take you to the “Are you still watching?” screen. With twists and turns in every episode, we’re grateful they are renewing it for a third and final season. -Amy Haneline\n\n29. “A Discovery of Witches”: Witches and vampires. Good and evil. Love and hate. Supernatural power struggles and scientific discovery. This Netflix series (and book series on which it’s based) has it all (including Matthew Goode as a brooding, love-struck vampire). -J.M.\n\n30. “Dispatches From Elsewhere”: Created by Jason Segel (\"How I Met Your Mother\"), AMC's \"Elsewhere\" focuses on four diverse strangers, struggling through challenges in life, who unite to find magic in the world. It’s fantastical, surreal, mind-bending, and one of the few things that has made me smile during this dark time. -A.M.\n\n31. “Doc McStuffins”: When you become a parent, your bingeing takes a turn. But we admittedly love watching Disney Channel's confident Black doctor care for her toys even when we wish to never hear “time for a checkup, time for a checkup” ever again. -A.H.\n\n32. “Elementary”: I had always loved Sherlock Holmes-like detectives on shows like “Monk” and “Psych,” and enjoyed this CBS take on the most famous literary detective, played by Johnny Lee Miller. But the real reason I devoured all seven seasons was Lucy Liu's Watson. -K.L.\n\n33. “Expecting Amy”: Anyone who loves Amy Schumer's brand of honest comedy will enjoy this HBO Max docuseries, an unwatered-down recount of her difficult pregnancy, during which she suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, an extreme form of morning sickness, and attempted to tour and film a stand-up special. -E.J.\n\n34. “Felicity”: I adored J.J. Abrams’ college-set WB series, even if I was one of the fans who checked out after Felicity Porter’s (Keri Russell) ill-advised Season 2 haircut. Finally, I’m seeing this Felicity-Ben-Noel love triangle (Team Noel!) through to graduation. -Kim Willis\n\n35. “Five Came Back”: This documentary series on Netflix highlights the work of five Hollywood directors who, at the top of their careers, joined the U.S. military during World War II to document the many facets of the war. Modern-day directors analyze both their predecessors and the films. It's powerful on its own, and life-changing if paired with the documentary “Nazi Concentration Camps,” which shows some of the government-funded footage shot by the directors. -M.C.\n\n36. “Floor is Lava”: I started watching this Netflix competition show about an extreme version of the childhood obstacle game to be ironic, and now I can’t stop. -Hannah Yasharoff\n\n37. “Friday Night Lights”: An NBC show that I watched only sporadically the first time around, this combo of sports and soap, which followed Buzz Bissinger’s book and a movie, won me over. -G.L.\n\n38. “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight” I rewatched “The Good Wife” and caught up on “The Good Fight,” and couldn’t help but fall in love all over again. Both are perfect ways to view how the world changed under both the Obama and Trump administrations, respectively – with smart writing and brilliant performances. Watching both series is like taking walks up and down a spiral staircase: Spinning around and around only to arrive somewhere new yet alarmingly familiar. -D.O.\n\n39. “The Great British Baking Show” My favorite form of comfort TV is this quaint British series full of soggy bottoms and delectable treats. I watched all the streaming seasons in the first few weeks of quarantine. -K.L.\n\n40. “Holey Moley” Come on. Sometimes, you just want to see a miniature-golf player knocked into the drink by a whirling windmill blade. If so, ABC has you covered. -B.K.\n\n41. “Jane the Virgin’’: This CW series (streaming on Netflix) has long been on my to-watch list and I loved it, even the over-the-top antics of Rogelio de la Vega (Jaime Camil). -D.G.\n\n42. “John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City”: John Mulaney’s performance in his Netflix stand-up special “Kid Gorgeous\" is as close to a perfect routine as I’ve seen. -E.J.\n\n43. “Justified”: I binge-watched six seasons of this FX gem on Hulu in less than a month, one of them in a single day. And now I desperately miss Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant) and Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggins). -D.G.\n\n44. “The Last Dance”: ESPN’s 10-episode documentary (streaming on Netflix July 19) is a great retrospective about the Chicago Bulls’ six NBA championships, but it also reveals much about the players – Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Steve Kerr and others – and about sports and culture in the 1990s. -B.K.\n\n45. “Little Fires Everywhere”: If you binged “Big Little Lies” and are looking for your next drama/mystery series, look no further than Hulu's “Little Fires,” starring Kerry Washington and Reese Witherspoon. What’s even better? It’s only one season, so no long commitment required! -S.M.\n\n46. “Lovesick”: This British show (Netflix) follows Dylan (Johnny Flynn), a perpetually in-love man who tests positive for chlamydia and must contact women he’s slept with to let them know. As he revisits past flames, he reveals a backstory that has consequences for Dylan’s present, when he’s in love with his best friend (Antonia Thomas), who’s engaged to someone else. But don’t let that description fool you: The show is hilarious and its characters nuanced and compelling. -J.M.\n\n47. “Mad Men”: AMC's take on the Madison Avenue advertising world is just as intoxicating now as it was when Don Draper (Jon Hamm) and company finished their run five years ago. Aside from the obvious Mid Mod eye candy, the show’s abruptly changing 1960s culture and depiction of a business constantly on the brink of collapse feel oddly timely amid the coronavirus crisis. -K.W.\n\n48. “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”: I’ll admit, I was late to the game with bingeing this feel good, award-winning Amazon series about a 1950s housewife turned aspiring stand-up comic. But what better time to catch up on all the shows I wished I watched than during a pandemic? Cheering on Midge (Rachel Brosnahan) as she uproots her life and starts anew felt like a fitting story for a time when many people are reflecting on the world and their priorities. -Charlie Trepany\n\n49. “Medici: Masters of Florence”: I’m a sucker for any kind of historical fiction, and binged through all three seasons on Netflix during time off, which provided entertainment and a new topic of interest. I spent a good deal of time Googling and reading up on the Medici family after various episodes to compare historical sources with the show. -M.H.\n\n50. “Money Heist”: This Spanish Netflix series is excellent. I thought I wouldn’t be able to get past watching a show dubbed into English, but the plot line is so exciting (and anxiety inducing) that I don’t even notice anymore. -Rasha Ali\n\n51. “Motown Magic”: I’d like to thank the creators of this Netflix kids show for allowing me to listen to The Temptations, The Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas and Marvin Gaye while my kids watch TV. -J.M.\n\n52. “Nate Bargatze: The Tennessee Kid”: To boost my mood during the current climate, I’ve been turning to beloved stand-up specials. Bargatze’s delivery in this Netflix special makes me laugh out loud! “Olivia?” -E.J.\n\n53. “The Office”: I was a fan of the British version starring (and co-created by) Ricky Gervais, but never quite cottoned to Steve Carell’s Michael Scott. But a pandemic binge-watch of NBC's nine seasons of this series endeared me to a stellar supporting cast (and there are so many of them!) and far more nuance than the UK edition could accomplish in its measly 14 episodes. -G.L.\n\n54. “Ozark”: When your days are spent indoors, a thriller like “Ozark” can bring some much-needed excitement. My family turned this on because we’d heard it was good and thought, “Why not?” Once we started watching, we couldn’t stop. -C.T.\n\n55. “Queer Eye”: The latest season of Netflix's “Queer Eye” dropped June 5 and has provided such a pick-me-up during the pandemic. Have I imagined what the experts – Bobby Berk, Jonathan Van Ness, Karamo Brown, Tan France and Antoni Porowski – would say to help me improve my life? Absolutely! -E.J.\n\n56. “Ramy\": This Hulu series has been on my “to watch” list for far too long, and I’m so glad I finally started. Star and creator Ramy Youssef’s semi-autobiographical dramedy, which follows a millennial Muslim man in New Jersey torn between his faith and wanting to fit in with American culture, is fun to watch and unlike anything else on TV right now. -H.Y.\n\n57. “Reconstruction: America After the Civil War”: As an alternative to cable news shows fixated on the controversy of the moment, often with little context, try history. PBS’ four-hour 2019 documentary from Henry Louis Gates is a great starting point to learn more about the history of racism, voter suppression and other topics that are just as relevant today. -B.K.\n\n58. “Say I Do\": So maybe you’re ready to release with a good cry? The couples featured in Netflix's “Say I Do” (and their devotion to each other) will have you bawling – in the best way. Each receive the wedding of their dreams with help from interior designer Jeremiah Brent, fashion designer Thai Nguyen and chef Gabriele Bertaccini. -E.J.\n\n59. “Schitt’s Creek”: This six-season Pop TV comedy (now on Netflix) is a riches-to-rags delight that has heart, charm and so many witty and quotable one-liners. Watching the Rose family navigate going from bazillionaires to living in a small town they once purchased as a joke was the perfect mindless diversion. As Alexis frequently said, “love that journey for me.” -A.M.\n\n60. \"Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker\": If quarantine has left you feeling less than motivated, this Netflix period drama chronicling the story of Madam C.J. Walker, whose fierce determination made her the first African American self-made millionaire, might just be the kick in the pants that you need. -A.H.\n\n61. “Snowpiercer”: Sure, the 2013 Bong Joon-ho sci-fi movie about class struggle was awesome, but TNT's new remake gives us Daveed Diggs as the world’s coolest post-apocalyptic homicide detective on a 1,001-car train bound for nowhere. -Brian Truitt\n\n62. “The Sopranos”: In the time it took Meadow Soprano to parallel park in the divisive series finale, I binge-watched David Chase's HBO mob masterpiece and am already itching to start it again. It's a funny, tear-jerking and often surreal exploration of family in a moral gray area, and Edie Falco as Carmela Soprano is the GOAT. -P.R.\n\n63. “Supernatural”: Worried that I was running through too many TV shows in quarantine, I came up with a solution: Watch one really, really long series. There are 15 seasons of CW’s (and formerly WB's) mystical drama (minus a few episodes in the final season yet to shoot because of the pandemic), and the brotherly ghost fighting has been more than satisfying. Bonus: I’m only nine seasons in. -K.L.\n\n64. “Treme\": Revolving around a national emergency, racial tensions and police corruption, David Simon's HBO series set in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina couldn’t feel more on-point right now. The show’s exhilarating, authentic music and conspicuously great food are pretty good coping mechanisms for COVID-19, too. -K.W.\n\n65. “Unorthodox”: I needed to be immersed in a TV show to distract myself from the increasingly tragic news about the pandemic, and this four-episode Netflix series, about a woman who escapes an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, certainly sucked me in. -K.L.\n\n66. “Upload”: This new Amazon comedy from Greg Daniels (“The Office”) offers a funny, insightful take on the benefits and dangers of technology as the consciousness of a dead man (Robbie Amell) is moved to a digitally created virtual afterlife. The complicated relationship forged with the very alive tech worker assigned to manage his afterlife (Andy Allo) is poignant and funny. -B.K.\n\n67. “We’re Here”: In this HBO series, three former competitors on “RuPaul's Drag Race” – Shangela Laquifa Wadley, Bob the Drag Queen and Eureka O’Hara – transform residents of small towns for a drag show, which (spoiler alert!) typically helps ignite an internal makeover as well. -E.J.\n\n68. “Yellowstone”: This popular Paramount Network drama has something for fans of Westerns and Kevin Costner. But what it really offers to viewers stuck at home is the most marvelous Big Sky, wide-open scenery, vistas of mountains and fields and streams from location shooting in the Rocky Mountain states. -B.K.\n\nBooks\n\n69. “And Then There Were None” by Agatha Christie: I had never read any of Christie’s classics, so I started with this one, which tops many best-of lists. It did not disappoint. The tale reads like a game of “Survivor” as visitors lured to an island die one by one. The twist at the end is worth the wait. -A.M.\n\n70. The Charlotte Holmes series by Brittany Cavallaro: The four mystery-filled novels center on teenagers John Watson and Charlotte Holmes, whose great-great-great grandfathers were quite the crime-solving duo. The kids are a formidable pair in that same vein, too, though they also have to navigate their own complicated family legacies and feelings about each other. -B.T.\n\n71. “The Cruel Prince” by Holly Black: I love young adult fantasy fiction, and Black has a compelling series about fairies, politics and finding your place in the world, starting with this novel, which I read in a single day. -K.L.\n\n72. “Death in Her Hands” by Ottessa Moshfegh: After thoroughly enjoying the emotion, humor and writing style of “My Year of Rest and Relaxation,” I couldn’t wait for Moshfegh’s next book. Unfortunately, the story is a bit of a snoozefest, and Moshfegh gets a little too caught up in the inner workings of the protagonist’s mind. -A.M.\n\n73. “Ex Machina” by Brian K. Vaughan and Tony Harris: Not the slick sci-fi movie but the even better 50-issue comic-book series that marries “The West Wing” and superheroes. The mayor of New York City is a former masked vigilante who balances running the Big Apple with dealing with supervillains and interdimensional threats. -B.T.\n\n74. “The Fire Next Time” by James Baldwin: Esteemed writer Baldwin's book is split into two: The first part, a letter to his nephew about the history of race in America; the second, an essay on his experiences with religion and race. Baldwin's writing is beautiful and striking, and his prose will stick with you long after you reach the final page. -H.Y.\n\n75. “Fleishman Is in Trouble” by Taffy Brodesser-Akner: This was the first title that my quarantine book club read, and it proved a fruitful discussion starter. Conversation ranged from how much being a woman/man is part of one’s identity to whether it’s OK to grow together and apart in relationships. Much wine was happily consumed. -Carly Mallenbaum\n\n76. “Florence Adler Swims Forever” by Rachel Beanland: I reviewed this book and it was the first that entirely held my attention. I was so enthralled by the plot that I woke up thinking about it at 3 a.m. after the first afternoon of reading. -M.H.\n\n77. “Followers” by Megan Angelo: I came for the interesting premise of two women trying to game the social media influencer system; I stayed for the nail-biting commentary about the dangers of internet usage and the downsides to celebrity culture. -H.Y.\n\n78. “Hard Times: An Oral History of the Great Depression” by Studs Terkel: The current economic climate is stressful and I thought I might read up on a similar time – the Great Depression. I have heard stories from my parents, who were born into the Depression. They have passed, but I found a great deal of additional perspective from the late author and historian Terkel, who compiled a book of experiences from a cross section of people, both socially and economically diverse, who lived through that dramatic period of history. -M.C.\n\n79. “How to Make a Plant Love You” by Summer Rayne Oakes: To supplement my quarantine gardening hobby, I picked up this highly recommended book on plant parenthood. More than a guide on how to not kill plants, the book ponders our relationship with nature, something I’ve been thinking about a lot from the confines of my apartment. -K.L.\n\n80. “Know My Name” by Chanel Miller: Miller, the survivor in the Brock Turner rape case formerly known as Emily Doe, tells her empowering story about reclaiming her name and healing after surviving sexual assault. -J.R.\n\n81. “Learn to Lucid Dream” by Dr. Kristen LaMarca: The internet has endless resources on how to lucid dream (should you be as interested as I am on the topic), but LaMarca’s book efficiently condenses all of the most effective practices into one book. So far, I’ve had two lucid dreams! -C.M.\n\n82. “A Little Life” by Hanya Yanagihara: Who knew someone could write 800+ pages of torture and never let up? A trigger warning disguised as a novel, this disturbing work is full of unrelenting trauma. I will discuss this book with you if you read it, for sure, but I can’t in good faith recommend it. To anyone. -D.O.\n\n83. “The Long Call” by Ann Cleeves: In the North Devon-set novel, Detective Matthew Venn investigates a murder that hits close to home: One that could possibly involve the church community he turned his back on years ago or his beloved husband, with whom he has made a new life. A serious page-turner that keeps you guessing. -M.C.\n\n84. “A Man Called Ove’’ by Fredrik Backman: I haven’t stopped recommending this beautiful book about a curmudgeon and his outgoing neighbors. -D.G.\n\n85. “Normal People” and “Conversations With Friends” by Sally Rooney: After binge-watching and falling in love with Hulu's “Normal People,” I went back to read the source material. I didn’t think I could love it more than the series, but I did. That prompted me to read Rooney’s earlier hit, “Friends,” which Hulu is also developing into a series. Book or series, Rooney’s meditations on the messiness of love will hook you. -A.M.\n\n86. “Red, White and Royal Blue” by Casey McQuiston: The queer romantic comedy novel I wish I had as a kid. The president’s son and the Queen of England’s grandson falling (literally) into a forbidden romance? Don’t walk – run – to read this. Surprisingly steamy to boot. -D.O.\n\n87. “The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt Disney Company” by Robert Iger: I’m a Disney junkie, so I jump at the chance to learn about anything behind the scenes from the House of Mouse. In addition to providing an interesting look into Disney’s relationship with Pixar, Marvel and more, it has some great insight about how one of the world’s most recognizable CEOs got to where he is today. -H.Y.\n\n88. Ruth Ware’s books: Ware is the contemporary queen of the psychological crime thriller. Here’s my ranking of the books from best to great: “The Death of Mrs. Westaway,” “The Lying Game,” “The Turn of the Key,” “The Woman in Cabin 10,” “In a Dark, Dark Wood.” -A.M.\n\n89. “So You Want to Talk About Race” byIjeoma Oluo: Oluo’s book was written for many types of people, including white people working toward becoming effective allies. For that group, I can say that it’s an educational gift. -C.M.\n\n90. “War and Peace” by Leo Tolstoy: OK, so I still have 300 pages left, but I’m in the home stretch of this massive Russian tome. I plucked my dusty, unread copy off the shelf back in March, so when people asked what I did during the great plague of 2020, I could say I read “War and Peace.” -B.V.\n\nMusic\n\n91. “Chromatica” by Lady Gaga: This high-energy pop album was probably meant to be blasted at crowded clubs rather than in my living room with just me and my dog, but I’ll take my dance parties where I can get them. -C.T.\n\n92. “Dear Evan Hansen Original Broadway Cast Recording”: The soft pop score of this Tony-winning musical, with vocals from the great Ben Platt, helped get me into a work-from-home groove, unseating other Broadway cast albums in my recently played feed on Spotify. -K.L.\n\n93. “Fetch the Bolt Cutters” by Fiona Apple: Apple couldn’t have known the world she’d be releasing her fifth album into when she recorded it, but this primal scream of righteous anger is exactly what these plague times call for. “Kick me under the table all you want/ I won't shut up” is my new life motto. -B.V.\n\n94. “Hamilton Original Broadway Cast Recording”: What’d I miss? Five years of listening to this infectious blend of rap, R&B, jazz and good ol’ musical-theater standards, that's what. Spotify may think I have a problem. -B.T.\n\n95. “Let’s Dance” (2018 remastered) by David Bowie: I’ve head-bobbed my way through the opening hook of “Modern Love” about a hundred times since quarantine started, and it’s not getting old. When this classic Bowie album was released in 1983, we used to have family dance parties around the record player in our living room. Now I’m streaming it as I do burpees and push-ups inside my condo. It’s still perfect. -A.M.\n\n96. “RTJ4” by Run the Jewels: Rap duo Killer Mike and El-P wrote most of this album in 2019, well before the racial reckoning currently cascading across the U.S., but the lyrics are eerily prescient. Listening now is a powerful call to action, a message of urgency to fix so much that is broken. You’ll be singing earworm “Ooh la la” for days. -A.M.\n\nPodcasts\n\n97. \"Armchair Expert\": The weekly podcast by actor Dax Shepard and co-host Monica Padman isn’t exactly an escape from reality, but their conversations with celebrities, journalists and academics about deep things like addiction, racism and yes, even the coronavirus pandemic, are sure to stretch your mental muscles. And there’s no better time than now to try to improve upon ourselves. -A.H.\n\n98. “The Happiness Lab”: The show from Laurie Santos, the professor behind the super-popular Yale course about “the science of well-being,” is the soundtrack for my outdoor walks because it has a winning podcast combination: fascinating stories, science and self-help. -C.M.\n\n99. “The Office Ladies”: To keep myself from re-watching “The Office” for the billionth time, I instead turned to a weekly recap podcast that goes episode by episode, hosted by actresses Jenna Fischer (who played Pam Beesly) and Angela Kinsey (Angela Martin) with occasional cameos from the rest of the cast. -H.Y.\n\n100. “This Is Love”: The latest season of this audio series about romance and connection (which I listen to while I fold my laundry) is all about animals. Of course, I tear up over the episodes of a heroic guide dog and the goose with a human BFF. I tend to immediately retell the \"Love” stories to my loved ones. -C.M.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/felixvailgone/2016/12/29/felix-vail-gone-one-wife-dead-two-other-missing-jerry-mitchell/95895894/", "title": "GONE", "text": "Jerry Mitchell\n\nDecember 30, 2016\n\nMy office telephone rang, and a woman asked, “Would you be interested in writing about a serial killer living in Mississippi?”\n\n“Yes, I would,” I replied.\n\nThe woman’s name was Mary Rose. She told me her missing daughter, Annette, had been married to a man named Felix Vail, and that Annette wasn’t the only one gone. She knew of two others.\n\nA day after Mother’s Day, May 14, 2012, I met the 64-year-old, bright, short-haired woman and followed her to the property in Montpelier, Mississippi, where she planned to confront Vail.\n\nShe told me what she was going to say to him: “You may never go to jail, but I want you to know that I know and a lot of others know that you took the lives of these three women. You haven’t really gotten away with it.”\n\nWe parked and walked up to his gate, which was locked. She told me he lived down this path.\n\nI followed her over the gate, and we walked down the path, the tall weeds blocking the light.\n\nWhen we reached a clearing, we could see two trailers — a silver one gleaming in the sun and a second one 28 feet long and damaged.\n\nI followed her to the silver trailer. She knocked. No one answered.\n\nShe checked the door. Locked.\n\nCupping her hands, she peeked inside and saw no one.\n\nSo where is this Felix Vail guy?\n\nI turned around and noticed a patch of woods next to the trailers.\n\nWhen I looked back, Rose was marching toward the damaged trailer. I hurried to catch up.\n\nShe checked the front door. Locked.\n\nCircling the trailer, she noticed the back window was missing. She pulled the plastic off the window and slipped inside.\n\nShe opened the front door. Now I could see.\n\nShe rummaged through the trailer and began tossing things she found.\n\nA machete clanked on the floor. Another machete clanked beside it. Then another. Then another.\n\nThen a long sword clanked. Then another. Then another.\n\nA chill ran up my spine, and I glanced back at the woods. Could he be watching us?\n\nFelix Vail discovered he could disappear.\n\nThe blond boy stepped into the sandbox where he liked to play on the family’s dairy farm in the community of Montpelier a half-hour north of Starkville, Mississippi.\n\nHe figured out that, if he stood in the sandbox where a tree blocked his mother’s view, she couldn’t see him.\n\nHe would take one step back, then another, then another, slipping farther and farther away.\n\n“She’d come and find me out there in the orchard 100 yards away,” he recalled in a series of recorded conversations he had with undercover private investigator Gina Frenzel. “I’d be fine or climbing one of the trees.”\n\nHe drifted off for hours at a time, and later, overnight.\n\nHe began testing other boundaries, tasting what he called the “nonsexual” parts of a girl in the neighborhood.\n\nWhen his mother caught him and scolded him, he slid down the wall, crying. “I just crumbled,” he recalled. “I just wanted to die. It was the only time in my life.”\n\nWhat upset him most was he couldn’t do it anymore. “It wasn’t a wrong thing until she was told it was wrong,” he said. “Damn ego, my mother. She totally polluted her son with ego and lies.”\n\nAt school, he excelled. In fifth grade, he made straight A’s, but five times the teacher noted he was “inclined to mischief.”\n\nHe also excelled on the farm. At age 16, he produced 130 bushels of corn in a 5-acre contest, topping every farmer in Clay County.\n\nHis father, Ray, gushed to the newspaper, “I thought my patch was good, but he beat me easily. His is the best I’ve ever seen.”\n\nA year later, Vail volunteered for the military, hoping to be a pilot. When he took an aptitude exam, “I scored the highest score,” he recalled.\n\nBut the military found him unfit for military service. “They said I was not the kind of person who would follow orders,” he recalled, “and that I would be a disciplinary problem.”\n\nOther signs of trouble arose. After his mother announced the family couldn’t keep their mother cat’s offspring, he scooped up the kittens and shot them, recalled his sister, Kaye Faulkner.\n\nWhen a charismatic evangelist came to town, he became one of about a dozen teenage boys who responded to an “altar call” at the Montpelier Baptist Church.\n\nHe told his family he believed he had been called by God to preach.\n\nOn the day he delivered his 10th sermon, he said he felt an “infinitely greater” power, which he compared to sticking his finger in a light socket. “I started getting electrical rushes and thrills and tingles and ... sweat popping out.”\n\nHe later wrote that he saw a “being” that day, “shimmering like a moon-sized sun with infinite energy radiating out from it in all directions at once.”\n\nSuddenly, he said he knew the deepest thoughts of parishioners. “I knew who was screwing who.”\n\nHe never preached again.\n\nFateful meeting\n\nBy the time Felix Vail received his diploma from Montpelier High School in 1957, he was already working an enviable job at one of several plants surrounding the Cities Service (later known as CITGO) refinery in Sulphur, Louisiana — thanks to his favorite uncle, a supervisor there.\n\n“I’m making lots of money,” he recalled. “I have two cars, a motorcycle and a boat. I’m dating about 20 women.”\n\nSlender and 6 feet tall, he drove his Karmann Ghia convertible to nearby Lake Charles, where he hung out at the country club and strolled across the McNeese State College campus, searching for the prettiest women he could find.\n\n“He told me he was an ordained minister,” recalled Cynthia Miller, a student then. “I asked, ‘Where’s your Bible?’ He said, ‘I don’t have it with me.’ ”\n\nShe said he took her to a McNeese football game and afterward asked her for sex. She turned him down.\n\n“Suppose the world ends tomorrow,” he said. “You’ll never know.”\n\n“Well,” she replied, “then I’ll never know.”\n\nSome, however, took him up on his offer. “The majority of women were available to me just for the asking,” he recalled.\n\nMany noticed his light blond hair and piercing blue eyes. “He looked,” one sorority member recalled, “like he had been kissed by heaven.”\n\nMary Horton noticed him.\n\nShe had grown up in the Louisiana swamps, where Cajun food and music overflowed.\n\nShe became homecoming queen at Eunice High School, where she graduated and began attending McNeese State College. She was so popular all five sororities invited her to join.\n\nShe chose Chi Omega, and her friends marveled at how, no matter what, she seemed to find the good in people.\n\nHer cute figure and perky personality captivated many men, and the football team nominated her for the homecoming court.\n\n“All of us horny men were secretly in love with her,” recalled Vail’s friend, Bob Hodges. “She was a doll, very sweet. I would have lifted that girl up on high.”\n\nBy 1960, she began to date Vail, who took her to company shrimp boils, where they stuffed themselves and danced the night away.\n\n“I am so deliciously happy!” she wrote in one of many letters to a childhood friend. “Felix and I have been doing some really unusual things this week and having fun.”\n\nDriving around in his blue Lincoln with a white hardtop, the couple visited an African-American church, played 45s at his relatives, dined at A&W Root Beer and sipped from the same glass of lemonade.\n\nBut their relationship was not all bliss.\n\nOn June 20, 1960, Mary confided, “I really do love Felix, but I don’t think that I like him anymore. He really is sweet, but we don’t see eye to eye on things.”\n\nShe talked of being miserable with Vail and asked her friend to set her up on a date with someone else, hoping Vail would leave her.\n\n“I never could break up with anyone,” she wrote. “I always keep hoping when there is no hope.”\n\nIn response to that date, Vail came to her, sharing that he was suffering from a disease.\n\n“What disease?”\n\n“Mary.”\n\nShe welcomed his words. “He did all the talking, and I just listened. I really had nothing to say — I mean, about us,” she wrote. “He said he’s changed. I have to.”\n\nThe couple dated again, and she continued to see others.\n\nShe joined classmate Kelley McFarland at a house party, and McFarland later heard Vail was so angry he wanted to kill him.\n\nMcFarland said he tracked down Vail at a bar on Cities Service Highway and approached Vail, who responded, “I’d rather not talk about it here.”\n\nThe two men met in the dark woods. Although McFarland sensed Vail’s anger, he and Vail exchanged no blows and went their separate ways.\n\nAfter this, Mary described herself as “miserable,” writing that “Kelley and Felix (were) threatening to kill one another.”\n\nVail remained jealous, she wrote. “Felix says that he doesn’t even want me to walk around the block with another boy now, and I know just what kind of miserable feelings he’s going through. It’s just tearing me up, and I can’t do anything.”\n\nShe reiterated her love for Vail in letters. “He’s going to move to Lake Charles next week, so he’ll be closer now.\n\nOne night at a pool party, Vail “walked up to Mary and just slapped the heck out of her,” recalled her former boyfriend from high school, Leonard Matt.\n\nHe wanted to retaliate, but others held him back.\n\nBefore fall ended, Vail told Mary he wouldn’t give her a Christmas gift because he didn’t believe in giving at designated times.\n\nShe planned to buy him something anyway, “even if it’s a lollipop,” she wrote her friend. “This is one thing I love, and it won’t change for me.”\n\nWhen her friends questioned his refusal to give, she defended him, calling him a “wonderful person.”\n\nIn an Oct. 12, 1960, letter, Mary confided, “I say things that I don’t mean when I’m angry — like at Mom and Felix, for example, and I usually say the ugliest things to the ones that I love most because they are capable of hurting me the most. You always hurt the ones you love, the ones you shouldn’t hurt at all.”\n\nSadness and fear\n\nFelix Vail and Mary Horton married on a sunny day, July 1, 1961, in Eunice, Louisiana. When he slipped on her wedding ring, she nudged him, reminding him to say the marriage vow. As they headed for their honeymoon in Orange, Texas, rain pelted their gray convertible, drenching them before they could get the top back up.\n\nThat fall, she dyed her hair brown, back to her original color, and began her job as a second-grade teacher at Moss Bluff Elementary School.\n\nFellow teacher Myrtis Quinilty gave her a ride each day. She said they decided to join a local gym together because “Felix did not want her to lose her figure.”\n\nWhen December came, Mary worried she might be pregnant, and Quinilty said Vail didn’t want a child.\n\nA fellow teacher drove Mary to the doctor, where she learned the news. “We had been so careful and still I got pregnant,” Mary wrote.\n\nFor a week in February 1962, the couple celebrated a “real honeymoon” in Acapulco, Mexico, where they rode in a boat, soaked in the sun, ate lobster and listened as a band serenaded them.\n\nBack home, Mary dyed her hair blond. Vail worked the late-night shift and often stayed gone. When he returned, he talked about playing golf and bowling in leagues.\n\nMary wrote in a May 3, 1962, letter, “Felix hasn’t been acting so sweet earlier, but I haven’t helped. I never stand up for him or say anything nice to him.”\n\nHer sister-in-law, Sue Jordan, told her the only reason Vail believed Mary wanted to get married was to have a baby — not because of him.\n\nAfter Mary heard this, she wrote her friend, “I can see, looking back, from many things I said how they could have been misunderstood.”\n\nShe insisted “we are very happy now,” but her sadness seeped through, writing how unattractive she felt being pregnant.\n\nShe switched her hair color to baby blonde. A month later, she tried silver blonde.\n\nOn the couple’s first anniversary, they greeted their baby, Bill, whom she adored and sang to.\n\nWithin a month, she suspected she might be pregnant again.\n\n“My stomach has begun to get larger, and I don’t eat much,” she wrote. “It kind of excites me in a way.”\n\nShe talked of expanding her skirt. “Wonder if it’s not a tumor or something else. It hurts when you press my stomach on the right.”\n\nInside the Maree Apartments, where they lived in Lake Charles, strange things happened. One morning, the couple awoke to find their front door had been removed from its hinges.\n\nAnother time, they found the front door on their apartment wide open. Nothing was missing.\n\nMary began receiving threatening calls.\n\n“She was afraid,” Quinilty recalled. “Mary told me, ‘Felix and I decided it must be somebody watching because he only calls when he’s not here.’ ”\n\nDespite her fear of drowning and of anything that crawled, Vail took her by boat into a wildlife reserve, where she saw an alligator sunning itself before slithering into the water.\n\nWhen they spotted snakes curled up on the muddy bank, Vail blasted them with his shotgun. Dirt rained down.\n\nHe gunned the 40-horsepower motor, taking her way out into the Gulf of Mexico “until we couldn’t see the camps anymore,” she wrote, “and the water was so rough that I was a little scared.”\n\nShe heard “a funny creaking noise, and I just knew that the boat had sprung a leak because we had hit the waves so hard like at Acapulco.”\n\nVail bailed water, and they made it home.\n\nShe confessed to several Chi Omega sisters that her husband had done “something awful” in Mississippi. She wouldn’t say what.\n\nShe spoke with her mother about divorcing him, recalled her brother, Will Horton. Their mother, Lillie Mae Horton, a devout Catholic, urged her daughter to stay and work things out.\n\nDeath and disappearance\n\nDarkness had long enveloped Shell Beach on Oct. 28, 1962, when Vail drove up in his boat at 7:30 p.m., saying his wife, Mary, had accidentally fallen into the Calcasieu River while they were laying trotlines.\n\nAfter two days of searching, authorities recovered her body near the spot where he had told authorities she disappeared.\n\nHer funeral followed the next day, Halloween.\n\nHer former roommate Cynthia Miller, attended with her husband, wearing a black maternity dress.\n\nWhen she walked up to Vail to share her condolences, he replied, “I’m sorry y’all couldn’t come to our party.”\n\n“What party?”\n\n“We called y’all, but y’all weren’t home.”\n\nThe words stunned her because “I never got a call from him,” she recalled. “My husband didn’t like him at all.”\n\nThe more she pondered, the more puzzled she grew. “What is he talking about a party at a funeral? Mary is dead.”\n\nFour days after the funeral, deputies arrested Vail at work, hauling him to jail and questioning him. He refused to take a lie detector test.\n\nThe coroner ruled the death an “accidental drowning,” and Vail walked free from jail days later.\n\nMonths later, he picked up his son, Bill, from the Louisiana home of his late wife’s aunt and headed for Mississippi.\n\nFelix Vail traded the Mississippi hills for the San Diego cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean. His brother, Ronnie, was stationed there in the Navy, doing four tours in Vietnam, where he earned three bronze stars.\n\nVail left his son, Bill, behind with his mother and father, who continued to operate the family’s dairy farm in Montpelier.\n\nIn 1965, Mercy Hospital employed him as a technician, and he began working for Dr. Ivan Baronofsky, an open-heart surgery pioneer who had been chief of surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.\n\nFellow surgeon Dr. Elliot Senderoff recalled Baronofsky’s experimentations, including a wild one that failed to curb angina with X-rays. “He was always having ideas about ways to do things.”\n\nVail oversaw a kennel of 40 dogs for the heart research and helped operate a heart-lung machine. At night, he took college courses in English and speed-reading, working toward a college degree.\n\n“I have to go to bed,” he wrote his mother, Nell Rose, in a March 9, 1965, letter. “It is 10 p.m., and we have surgery tomorrow at 7:15 a.m. I will have help with the pump on this one, but after it, I’ll have to operate it alone. I hope the first patient doesn’t die. Quite a few people do in heart surgery, so it is possible.”\n\nHe urged her to lie about his whereabouts. “You can tell people about my job, but tell them I am in Alaska.”\n\nWithin a few months, he returned to Mississippi and took his son, Bill, back with him. From that point forward, Bill split time between California and Mississippi.\n\n“I kept changing my accent so as not to attract attention,” Bill said in an interview he recorded months before his 2009 death from cancer.\n\nWhen “love-ins” began at the park, Vail visited them, watching people listen to music, roll around in the grass and smoke marijuana.\n\nAfter an affair with a married nurse, he traded his medical work for life as a hippie, hitchhiking, bicycling and exploring. For months, Bill lived on a farm run by a religious cult called the Holy Order of MANS.\n\nHe said his father made him try marijuana and LSD as a child. “He thought it would enlighten my mind. I didn’t like it.”\n\nAs for companions, “my father went through more girlfriends than I could count.”\n\nOne of them was Robin Sinclair. She met Felix Vail at a San Diego bus stop in 1967.\n\nThe 17-year-old slender brunette was spending the summer with her sister when he approached her.\n\n“He was into the metaphysical, getting in touch with the subconscious,” she recalled. “He was a different person than I had ever met before.”\n\nThey began dating. When summer break ended, she returned to the San Francisco Bay area without him.\n\nIn October 1968, while listening to Iron Butterfly and other bands play at a concert, Vail appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. She saw it as a sign they belonged together.\n\n“He was always on a very even keel, like he was a little detached and studying everybody,” she said. “He was the observer.”\n\nVail had his young son with him, and they bounced from place to place.\n\nBill “was neglected,” Robin recalled, “and Felix let him smoke pot. Bill would just run wild. He would make some friends with people at a hamburger stand, and they fed him.”\n\nAt the time, she said, “I was young and naive and concerned with my next joint. I didn’t worry about any of that.”\n\nAfter being evicted for failing to pay rent, they watched another couple’s home over the Christmas holidays, she said.\n\nBefore the pair returned, she learned she was pregnant, sharing the news with Vail. “He said, ‘Well, I don’t think you’re emotionally stable enough to handle the pregnancy.’ ”\n\nWhen morning came, Vail had vanished with his son, she recalled.\n\n“A friend told me that he went back to Mississippi, that it was time for his son to go to school and that he didn’t want to be with me.”\n\nHeartbroken, she moved back in with her parents. “There was no place to go, and I was sick, sick, sick.”\n\nIn August 1969, she gave birth to her daughter, Simone, and penned Vail an angry letter.\n\nTwo months later, he showed up, and she told him, “Get out of here. I don’t want to see you again.”\n\nVail and Sharon Hensley meet\n\nFelix Vail spent time in a second-story apartment on Nob Hill in San Francisco.\n\nOne night, a neighbor above him knocked on his door, saying they were filming upstairs and had run out of electrical plugs. Could they plug their extension cord into one of his outlets?\n\nVail agreed, and the neighbor invited him to watch them make their porn film. He stepped upstairs, glimpsing the writhing bodies.\n\nOne day while housesitting at a high-rise apartment, he stripped and stepped out onto the balcony, soaking up the sun. Some time later, he looked up to see a brunette joining him.\n\nShe was 20 with long, dark hair. Her name was Sharon Hensley, so attractive that she had modeled while growing up in North Dakota.\n\nThey became friends and then more than friends, despite him being a decade older.\n\nVail handed her a copy of “The Grape Cure,” the 1928 book in which author Johanna Brandt claimed a combination of fasting and eating grapes had cured her of stomach cancer.\n\nDespite physicians condemning the diet as “quackery,” Vail and Hensley became believers, filling a bathtub with grapes they collected from vineyards.\n\nThey hitchhiked across California, living off the land. Vail’s 8-year-old son, Bill, accompanied them as they slept near vineyards and orchards.\n\nHe recalled his father sharing how his mother died. “(He said) he and my mother were out fishing …, that a boat had come by and caused a big wave and knocked my mother out of the boat and she didn’t know how to swim, had on no flotation and immediately sank and drowned. My father said he almost died trying to rescue her.”\n\nThen one summer day, when his father thought he was outside playing, he overheard his father sobbing and speaking to Sharon.\n\n“He told her that he had murdered my mother,” he recalled. “I heard the girlfriend saying, ‘Oh, I know you just must feel responsible for it.’ … He said, ‘No, you don’t understand. I really did kill her.’ ”\n\nEmotions flooded Bill. He wanted to hit his father. Then run. Then cry.\n\n“I was just so angry with my father,” he said. “He was actually a good father in many ways, but still how do I reconcile what I’ve just heard? I couldn’t.”\n\nShortly after that, the trio hiked to Mexico’s Baja Desert, where they camped and fasted, “which is miserable for an 8-year-old,” he recalled.\n\nHe decided to pray. “I really started talking to God, and just said, ‘God, get me home.’ ”\n\nTo him, home meant Mississippi, living with his grandparents.\n\nAfter their desert trip, the trio trekked north until they reached a vineyard near Merced in in central California, where Bill met a 13-year-old migrant worker.\n\n“He was very curious about me living with no shirt and no shoes,” he recalled. “We got to be friends.”\n\nIt was Aug. 21, 1970, when Bill began to share the story of his father with his new friend. “The more he heard of my story, he said, ‘Why don’t you just turn him in to the police?’ ”\n\nWhen Bill heard those words, “It was like ‘ding.’ The light came on,” he recalled. “He told me there was a town about two miles away, and I started walking right then.”\n\nIn the town of Livingston, he found the police station, where he told officers he was hungry and tired of using the drugs his father gave him, that he wanted to go back to school and live like other kids, and that he had overheard his father admit to killing his mother.\n\n“At first, they didn’t believe me, just kind of shooed me out, said, ‘Yeah, kid, go away,’ but I was committed,” he said. “I was not going to take ‘no’ for an answer.”\n\nHe camped out on the front steps until one detective listened.\n\nAt a beach along the Merced River, authorities found his 31-year-old father and 21-year-old Sharon Hensley, carrying a bag filled with LSD capsules.\n\nTheir only food? A bag of grapes.\n\nPolice charged the couple with LSD possession and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\n\nNewspapers across the U.S. printed stories about the arrests, and the National Enquirer published a photograph of the towheaded boy playing with a “lawn toy instead of drugs after being placed in a foster home.”\n\nVail received a six-month jail sentence, plus three years’ probation, after pleading guilty to a lesser charge of LSD possession.\n\nCalifornia authorities shared their information with Louisiana authorities. Once again, the district attorney in Lake Charles passed on prosecuting Vail for murder.\n\nBill returned to Mississippi to live with his grandparents, who gained full custody.\n\nOn Jan. 23, 1971, he saw his father and Sharon Hensley in their driveway.\n\nHe stood frozen, wondering where he could run. “I really thought he was going to kill me,” he said. “My grandmother came back out and reassured me that he wasn’t going to hurt me.”\n\nAfter a while, he and his father sat down and spoke, and his father said he did not blame him for time spent in prison, Bill recalled. “He actually blamed the girlfriend, which was strange ‘cause she had nothing to do with it.”\n\nVail’s family questioned how he and Sharon could legally be in Mississippi when they were supposed to be serving their time on probation in California. They soon realized they couldn’t.\n\nA day later, the sheriff came. He told Vail’s family he had a cablegram from California, asking him to pick up the couple for questioning.\n\nVail’s mother told the sheriff she didn’t know where her son was.\n\nFour days later, Vail and his girlfriend, Sharon, hid on a car’s floorboards as his family transported them out of town. At the bus station in Grenada, Mississippi, the family gave the couple enough money to return to the West Coast.\n\n“Don’t know if (it) was the right thing to do,” Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family. “We definitely feel that they both need psychiatric help. But there seems to be no way that can be arranged. So God help them, and us, is our prayer.”\n\n‘She believed in love’\n\nSharon Hensley grew up in the state capital of Bismarck, North Dakota, where buffalo once roamed free on the hills. A post-World War II baby born five days before Christmas in 1948, she dated football players and belonged to the high school’s Demonettes, an award-winning dance team founded by a former Rockette.\n\nOne summer day, she and her best friend, Connie Woodworth, stepped into the Missouri River and nearly drowned. Another time, when they drove with their boyfriends on a gravel road, Sharon panicked rounding a curve, and the car rolled three times.\n\nThrown clear, she rushed to check on her friends. When she discovered they were OK, she wept, Woodworth recalled. “She was a person who cared deeply for her friends and family.”\n\nThe girls graduated in 1966, and Sharon attended Bismarck Junior College, where she took classes in dancing and acting, performing in a play with her older brother, Frank.\n\nYounger brother Brian adored his sister. Although she was 11 years older than him, when the radio brimmed with Beatles songs in 1964, Sharon and her girlfriends played the records and had him dance with them.\n\nWhen summer came, he tagged along with them as they sunbathed on the river’s sandbars. “It was heaven for a 6-year-old,” he said.\n\nThey picnicked, played volleyball, snapped Polaroids and tossed a new toy called the Frisbee, he recalled. “I just remember sunshine and happiness.”\n\nIn 1967, Sharon discovered she was pregnant. Wanting to escape her hometown, she followed her brother Frank and other classmates to San Francisco, where thousands of other young people were already gathering for the “summer of love.”\n\n“She believed in love,” Brian recalled. “She believed in happiness. She believed in flowers and beads.”\n\nAfter arriving in the Bay area, she stayed in a home for unwed mothers, where she gave birth to a girl she named “Cherry” after the popular Neil Diamond song. She told friends she wanted to keep the child, but was unable to.\n\nTwo years after leaving for California, Sharon was in jail and her mother, Peggy, headed there with a $5,000 cashier’s check to bail her out. “I’m going to get Sharon and bring her home,” she announced.\n\nBut when she returned, Sharon wasn’t with her.\n\n“She said she had lost her daughter,” Brian recalled. “She cried almost every night.”\n\nDepression overwhelmed his mother. “She was never the same after that.”\n\nIn the summer of 1972, Sharon appeared unannounced with Vail at her childhood home in Bismarck. They had been hitchhiking, eating macrobiotic foods, meditating and practicing yoga.\n\nThe more the family witnessed, the more horrified they became. Sharon wore a mini-skirt with no panties and had armpit hair and leg hair like a man, Brian recalled. “I thought she was freaking way out.”\n\nShe had been losing weight and with it some of the curves that made her a model. She was also losing clumps of hair.\n\nShe seemed brainwashed, Brian said. “You could just tell she was not the same person, that this guy was controlling what she was saying.”\n\nIf someone asked her a question, “either Felix would answer the question for her, or she would look at Felix while she was giving the answer.”\n\nBrian went one day with Vail to the Elks Club, where his father was a member. “They had a workout room, and Felix gets totally naked.”\n\nVail tested out the exercise equipment then strolled into the steam room, where “these older gentlemen just freaked out on him because he was hippie looking and walking around naked.”\n\nThe men forced Vail to leave. When he objected, insisting he was a guest of Harry Hensley, one man shot back, “The hell you are. I know Harry Hensley better than that.”\n\nBrian said he traveled with the couple to a small grocery store. While Vail distracted the clerk, Sharon stuffed jars of grape juice into a duffle bag. “I could even hear the bottles clanging.”\n\nWhile the clerk questioned what was going on, Sharon dashed out with the bottles. When the clerk tried to pursue her, Vail stood in the way.\n\n“We got away,” Brian recalled. “The cops didn’t come.”\n\nThe couple left North Dakota and traveled to Mississippi, where they stayed with Vail’s family. On the dairy farm, they helped paint the family home.\n\nThe couple also sunbathed in the nude, drawing more than a few glares from neighbors.\n\nPeggy Hensley received a telephone call from Sharon, who said she and Vail were heading to New Orleans and then to Miami to make pornographic films.\n\n“What daughter tells her mother she’s going to do a porno?” Brian asked. “I think it was a cry for help. That’s what my mom thought.”\n\nHe said his mother wanted to travel south in hopes of getting her daughter back, but his parents were unable to do that.\n\nIn early 1973, Sharon telephoned and talked of traveling to South America, where she and Vail would eat natural foods and write a book, Brian recalled.\n\nIt was the last conversation any family or friends had with his sister.\n\nSharon’s last letter contained a picture, which showed her holding a pen and sitting at a table at the home of Vail’s parents. She captioned the Polaroid: “Making travel notes.”\n\nWhen Brian gazed at the photograph, all he could see was her sorrow, a shell of the sister he loved.\n\nSharon disappears\n\nIn New Orleans, Sharon Hensley worked as a table dancer at a strip club — something Vail said she had done before in San Bernardino, California, and Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\n“Guys would give her another $100 to dance on their table, rather than go to the next table,” Vail recalled. “She’d make a $1,000 a night sometimes.”\n\nVail left with Sharon for Miami, where they lived in a commune and worked at a health food store not far from the Voyager Inn, where the porn movie, “Deep Throat,” had been surreptitiously shot for $25,000. Now on its way to grossing $600 million, the film helped turn Miami into a mecca for porn flicks.\n\nThe couple managed to get a telephone number for Len Camp, who had worked on the iconic movie, and Vail recalled a man approaching them.\n\n“He asked if we had ever been in movies and did we realize the camera might love us?” Vail recalled. “He didn’t say porn.”\n\nThe couple took him up on the offer, which paid them $500 a day, he said.\n\nWhen they arrived, there was no script. Instead, they ad-libbed sex scenes, Vail recalled.\n\nRather than casting Vail in the part of a sexual stud, the director had Vail take on a different role. “You get on the bed, and you start masturbating,” he recalled. “They walk in and look, and you’re surprised.”\n\nFor him, it was hardly enjoyable. “So much of it was ridiculous.”\n\nMonths passed, and Sharon Hensley’s family never heard from her. Worried, her mother telephoned Vail’s mother.\n\nIn March 1974, Sharon’s mother received a letter from Vail, who wrote that he was in west Florida: “I share your concern about Sharon but then she is of age and she should have the right and freedom from you to decide for herself how she wants to live her time on earth.”\n\nHe wrote that he last saw Sharon about a year ago in Key West with an Australian couple traveling around the world. All he recalled was the first names of the couple, who were talking with Sharon about “island hopping around South America and the West Indies and they talked of stopping in Hawaii for a while, maybe a couple of years in the Philippines, then India, Egypt and the Mediterranean islands and coasts. I don’t know which of these (if any) they decided on or in what order.”\n\nBrian remembered his mother throwing down the letter, not believing a word.\n\n“Felix didn’t remember the boat’s name, the couple’s last name or much of anything else,” he said, “but, boy, he sure had down their travel itinerary.”\n\nIn fall 1975, Vail’s mother wrote the Hensley family about what her son had told her: “He was surprised that you had not heard from Sharon by this time.”\n\nVail told his mother the names of the couple that Sharon left with were Frank and Sally — different names than he gave a year earlier.\n\nVail explained that before Sharon left, she burned all of her identification cards, got new IDs and declared that she would become a completely different person.\n\nHis mother told her family, “My heart goes out to you. I know how hard (it) would be if Felix had gone like that.”\n\nVail’s son, Bill, recalled his father taking him aside and mentioning Sharon. “He said she would never bother anyone ever again.”\n\nThe words upset Bill, who believed his father had just confessed to another killing. “There was not a soul I could tell about it because I had had my experience in court when I was 8,” he wrote. “No one would believe me. It would be my word against his, and no one would believe a 13-year-old.”\n\nWhile riding a bus back home to north Mississippi in 1975, Felix Vail spotted a 17-year-old girl seated behind the driver. He scooted beside Sharon Campbell, who was half his age. He told her how fit she looked, saying he needed someone like her to keep him fit.\n\nIn a 2014 sworn statement, she said she felt flattered and shared her telephone number. Not long after returning home, he showed up in a yellow Volkswagen bug.\n\nDuring one conversation, he shared that his first wife had drowned while they were fishing. She felt sorry for him.\n\nHe talked of California, the mountains and other places he had visited. His words intrigued her, so different from her cloistered upbringing that she had begun to rebel against.\n\nHe wanted her to travel with him, and she told him the only way her parents would let her do that would be if they were married.\n\nOn July 24, 1975, they tied the knot and honeymooned in Gulf Shores, Alabama.\n\nThe couple never consummated the marriage because he was unable to “obtain an erection,” she told Louisiana prosecutor Hugo Holland.\n\nAfter their honeymoon, the couple, along with her 1-year-old son, traveled to Clinton, Oklahoma, where Vail said he had a job.\n\nDuring the day, he left, and she and her son hung out at the hotel, swimming in the pool.\n\nSeveral weeks later, she went with Vail to visit his relatives in Louisiana. There, she said a niece told her, “You probably need to know that he killed his first wife.”\n\nShe said the niece continued, saying, “Yeah, they arrested him. … We all believed that he did it. … He drowned her out of a boat.”\n\nThe teenage bride discounted what she was hearing, thinking he would be in prison if he had killed someone.\n\nBut as months passed, she concluded he “had no value in the female gender,” she said. “He hated women.”\n\nShe later traveled with Vail to his parents’ home in Montpelier.\n\nWhile there, he “was outdoors doing something around that yellow (Volkswagen) bug,” she said. “I walked out there. I don’t think he knew I was coming out there.”\n\nHe opened a compartment, and she said she saw “sinister, surgical looking saws of all shapes and sizes in a neat, neat formation. They were so clean … like you would see in a surgery clinic. I mean, they were that sterile.”\n\nTo her, the sight screamed evil. “It scared me. I said, ‘I’m not going anywhere with you.’ ”\n\nShe left, annulled the marriage and never looked back.\n\nIn 1977, Vail joined a crew for Western Geophysical, a seismograph company with an office in nearby West Point, Mississippi.\n\nThey traveled across the U.S., stomping geophones into the ground. The devices helped locate oil and natural gas pockets.\n\nMost of the crew were in their 20s. Vail was the exception. Fit, thin and tan, he wore a pageboy haircut, but his craggy neck gave away that he was approaching 40.\n\nMembers of the crew said Vail regarded eating meat as unholy, but believed marijuana and LSD were “God’s creations,” giving insight into the divine.\n\nWhen the crew discovered Vail missing one day, they retreated to find him hanging from a tree. He was meditating, arms crossing his chest.\n\nWorking with the crew that summer, Vail found himself in jail again.\n\nOn June 28, sheriff’s deputies arrested him near Bath, New York, less than an hour and a half south of Rochester, on a charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance.\n\nVail explores ‘enlightenment’\n\nOn a bus heading back to Mississippi, Vail ran into a woman named Ella from Holland. “She was rich,” he said. “She had made her money in Transactional Analysis.”\n\nThis new approach to psychoanalysis had become a national rage, fueling such bestsellers as “I’m OK, You’re OK” and “Games People Play.”\n\nElla planned to attend the International Transactional Analysis Association Conference in San Francisco, but in the meantime, “she was going to see America,” Vail recalled.\n\nHeading for New Orleans, she exited the bus instead with Vail and went with him to his childhood home of Montpelier. From there, they rode together on his motorcycle across the country until they arrived at the symposium in August 1977.\n\n“It was one of the most interesting weeks,” Vail recalled.\n\nWhile there, he listened to speakers about Transactional Analysis, which describes parent, adult and child “ego states” when people interact with each other\n\nVail recalled a presentation from a group known as the “Frog Pond,” which believed that people could have their lives transformed, just as fairy tales described frogs being transformed into princes or princesses.\n\nDuring that presentation, the Frog Pond people shared sexual research, Vail said. “Normally, orgasms are only a few seconds. They found a way to sneak into the orgasm and hold the orgasm … (for) several hours.”\n\nAfter the conference, Vail headed south, reconnecting with an old friend, Brian Biedebach, and a San Diego native named Carolyn, whom he had dated in 1975 in Placerville, California. Their romance had flourished in that old Gold Rush boomtown, but when she returned from work one day, Vail had vanished like the prospectors.\n\nNow reunited, the pair resumed their relationship. They married on Christmas Eve 1977 and rented a modest house in San Bernardino. “He decided he had allergies to everything,” she recalled. “We had to scrub the house from top to bottom and put plastic on things.”\n\nWhile she worked at her job, he never found one, other than trying to grow marijuana once in the back yard.\n\nShe covered all the couple’s expenses, paid to get his teeth fixed and even bought him a Karmann Ghia. “I was paying for so many things, I was starting not to trust him.”\n\nHe signed a note to repay her for the car, but she said she “never saw a dime.”\n\nShe had long been frugal with her earnings as a teacher, saving $23,000 toward a future home.\n\nWhen Vail learned of this, he became upset she wouldn’t give him some of it, telling others, “Carolyn doesn’t believe in community property.”\n\nShe did pay about $600 (the modern equivalent of nearly $2,400) for him to attend the Erhard Seminars Training (known as est), where trainers promised participants they could break free from their pasts.\n\nWhen Vail returned home, he kept her up all night, saying he should be an est trainer “because he was so much more enlightened,” she recalled.\n\nHe insisted they drive two hours to San Diego to talk with her mother, trying “to alienate me from my mother by convincing me that she never loved me,” she said. “How stupid was that. How stupid was I.”\n\nThe marriage disintegrated soon after the couple went on a double date with Biedebach and Alexandra Christiansen. While they drove in a car together, Carolyn said Christiansen glared at Vail in the rearview mirror and asked, “So why did you get married?”\n\nThe next day, Vail left with Christiansen.\n\nCarolyn said she soon found out he also had an affair with a neighbor. “I was so furious.”\n\nShe telephoned Vail’s mother and detailed what had happened. “Doesn’t this surprise you?” she asked.\n\n“No,” his mother replied.\n\nThat response confirmed that he had “a history of behaving this way,” she recalled. “If your parents don’t defend you, there’s something wrong there.”\n\nWhen he showed up later to collect a few things he left behind, she had friends serve him with divorce papers.\n\n“He was not responsible. He was immoral. But, boy, he knew it all.”\n\nAfter taking the divorce papers, Vail backed his car all the way across the property until he smashed into her MGB sports car.\n\nAbout a month later, he telephoned and told her, “I love you.”\n\nUtilizing a phrase popular in est circles, she replied, “I got it.”\n\nShe never looked back, moving more than 100 miles away. “He was so mentally deranged I couldn’t get far enough away.”\n\nAnnette\n\nIn summer 1981, Mary Rose and her teenage daughter, Annette Craver, greeted people at a friend’s yard sale in the Montrose neighborhood in Houston, Texas, not far from Rice University. They had contributed a few items before their move to San Antonio.\n\nThey had just returned from a vacation in Mexico, and Annette felt heartsick, still infatuated with a boy named Adolfo, who was unable to join her in America. Two years earlier, her father, a Vietnam veteran, had died in a car crash in Mexico.\n\nWhile people poked through stacks of clothes and books, Vail pulled up on a motorcycle and spoke with Annette, a singer-songwriter who at 15 was so bright she was starting her senior year at a private school aimed at those entering the medical profession. He was 41 and had done some carpentry work in the area.\n\n“When I saw her, I thought, ‘That’s going to be my new girlfriend,’ ” he recalled.\n\nAfter moving with her daughter to San Antonio, Rose struggled to find work and relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nAnnette boarded with an art teacher near her high school and dreamed of becoming a midwife, assisting with three births. Vail began to visit her there.\n\nIn April 1982, Rose and her daughter invested in a Tulsa home that had a rental cottage behind it. Rose began renovating both of them.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Annette joined her mother in Tulsa. Vail appeared a few days later.\n\nHe convinced Annette to leave with him on his motorcycle. They lived off the $500-a-month Social Security check that she received from her father’s death, Rose recalled. “It was over one year before I saw her again.”\n\nThat fall, Annette became pregnant and underwent a painful abortion. “Ideally, we should have been ready to have it, go off into the woods and live happily ever after, but as it was neither of us was ready (me mainly),” she wrote. “That sure shot down my ‘I can’t wait to have a baby’ trip.”\n\nThe couple rode south of the border, stopping near Cancun at Isla Mujeres, where her old boyfriend lived, Annette wrote in a Dec. 4, 1982, letter to her mother. “The first couple of nights I looked everywhere for him.”\n\nShe confessed, “Felix has come close to leaving me a couple of times already because of my fantasy that Adolfo was better than anyone I could ever be with, including him.”\n\nSeven months later, she saw her old flame. “He’s teaching children, doing artwork,” she wrote her mother in a postcard. “He asked about you.”\n\nThe couple trekked to Sausalito, California, to see friends.\n\nJerry Woodall recalled seeing the couple outside. “They were in a sleeping bag at 10 in the morning, about 20 feet away. Felix was on top of her and having sex. Annette was looking at me, grinning and waving.”\n\nHis then-wife, Meredith McMackin, recalled the scene as “just embarrassing. We were trying to ignore it.”\n\nShe recalled Vail as a “very handsome” and “spiritually enlightened” man who seemed to have it all together.\n\nShe noticed, too, “this coldness and controlling aspect to his personality. Annette was so open and alive, but I think he just totally dominated her. He would try to convey that he was this higher form of being. At first, I thought maybe he was evolved, but then I realized it was this arrogant act.”\n\nLater that summer of 1983, police in California arrested Vail for violating probation a dozen years earlier.\n\nAnnette telephoned Woodall, who gave her $200.\n\nAfter Vail walked free from prison, he and Annette decided to marry. Because she was only 17, she needed permission.\n\nShe told her mother that she loved Vail, that the couple was already “spiritually married” and that the couple would marry in Mexico if she refused.\n\nNot wanting to lose her daughter completely, Rose said OK.\n\nOn Aug. 15, 1983, the couple married in Bakersfield, California.\n\nFour months later, Annette turned 18, making it possible for her to collect more than $98,000 on life insurance policies taken out by her late father. Accompanied by Vail, she withdrew all the money in cash from a San Antonio bank. She bought a Fiat convertible that Vail liked and paid for his dental work.\n\nIn a letter to a friend, she described her husband as “a separate entity from his family. I’ve met them all, and we visit but infrequent. And Felix has established his own code of ethics which free him from any obligation.”\n\nOne day in April 1984, Rose returned home to find Annette waiting on her doorstep. She spoke of divorcing Vail and enrolling in college.\n\nShe talked, too, of Vail’s temper, Rose recalled. “She confessed to me that she had lied to me about Felix breaking his hand by dropping a pot on it. She said the truth was Felix took a swing at her face. She dodged the blow, and he hit the wall.”\n\nA few weeks later, Vail showed up, Rose said. “They fought almost constantly. He left after a few days. He was insanely jealous of her, would go into a rage when she talked of her desire to go out with younger men.”\n\nShe and Annette worked on renovating the two homes, enjoying their time together, she recalled. “We started a garden.”\n\nAnnette received a letter from Vail, who vowed their time apart would fuel their love. “After we hung up,” he wrote, “I went out to a park and ran and hung and talked with god and smoked some and shot some pool and rode with the top down out through the marsh playing ‘Iron Butterfly’ [“In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida”] and bathing every inch of your body-spirit being with love.”\n\nHe referred to their being apart as “deprivation jail” — “only this time it’s your ego that is our (my) jailer.”\n\nThe idea of her cutting away ego’s “feeder roots and creating roots between your spirit and the cosmic ground of loving makes me hot for you,” he wrote her. “My mind is kissing you everywhere.”\n\nVail returned to her daughter’s life, Rose recalled. “Annette told me, ‘Felix is the wisest person in the world, and I can’t make decisions without him.’ ”\n\nHis influence on Annette grew stronger. She compared Vail to God, Rose said.\n\nThe reunited couple insisted Rose leave. “They became very angry and adamant about me getting out and deeding the place over to Annette.”\n\nRose said Annette fell under Vail’s control and became hostile, accusing her of being a thief.\n\nShe felt devastated. “I have never felt so low in my life.”\n\nWhen thoughts of taking her own life swept over her in spring 1984, she said she realized she had to leave to survive, heading to California to stay with family and friends.\n\nBefore departing, she deeded the house to Annette for $7,000.\n\nWhen Rose later spoke to Annette about the two cats she left behind, Yawni and Puff, Annette shared that Vail had killed them, calling them “a bother.”\n\nIn a July 24 letter, Rose encouraged her daughter to keep their communication open and continue her education. “I feel afraid that you are allowing all of Felix's attitudes to become yours and hope that you will be able to sort out what is true and what is manufactured through his fear.”\n\nBy the time that letter arrived, Annette had already added Vail to the deed. A month later, she deeded him both homes.\n\nAs fall neared, the couple told neighbors they were leaving on vacation. When Vail returned to Tulsa in October, he was driving the Fiat alone.\n\nA neighbor, Wende Austin, asked where Annette was. Vail replied that Annette had a lot of money on her when they parted company and that she might see some people she knew in Denver.\n\nUpon learning that Annette had failed to return, Rose telephoned Vail. “He told me that while they were camping, Annette had a sexual dream about being with other men in Mexico, and she wanted to go there,” she recalled. “He claimed that the dream made them both realize that she should have her freedom.”\n\nThe next day, she said Vail told her he had put Annette on a bus with $50,000, but gave no further details.\n\nHis explanation made no sense to Rose, who wondered how her daughter could have been carrying this much cash since the couple hadn’t planned in advance to split up.\n\nOn Oct. 22, 1984, Rose filed a missing person’s report. She told the Tulsa Police Department that each person who talks with Vail “gets a different story about the amount of money that Annette took with her and where she might be. We all believe that he knows where she is or has done something with her.”\n\nFelix Vail answered the door, seeing Detective Dennis Davis and another officer from the Tulsa Police Department. It was Jan. 22, 1985, and Vail had been expecting them.\n\nWeeks earlier, he had dropped off a photograph of Annette at Davis’ request. Two weeks before that, Vail had filed for divorce, citing an inability to find her after a “diligent search.”\n\nHe invited the officers in, and they chatted for more than two hours.\n\nDavis said her mother, Mary Rose, mentioned her daughter had received more than $90,000 from her father’s estate.\n\nVail confirmed that was true, saying the couple had spent much of that money traveling in foreign countries. He said they kept their money in cash because they didn’t trust banks and that he had found about $10,000 in cash when he returned home.\n\nThe next day, Vail telephoned a lawyer, who promised to talk with the officers and tell them to “leave me alone,” he wrote in his journal.\n\nBy the time Davis returned five days later, Vail had a detailed alibi: The couple left Tulsa between noon and 3 p.m. Sept. 13, 1984, and stayed the night in a hotel in Claremont, Oklahoma. After two nights of camping on the river, Annette awoke and told Vail she had decided to leave him. He took her to the Trailways Bus Station in St. Louis and left before she bought the ticket.\n\nHe told the officers she told him she was headed for Denver, where she planned to get a fake ID card and leave for Mexico.\n\nThey asked Vail if he would take a lie detector test. He said no.\n\nAfter the officers left, Vail wrote in his journals about Annette’s mother, Rose. She is “making Davis dance, and he’s trying to make me dance.”\n\nVail claimed Annette had bought a gun. “I regret some not letting Annette kill her [mother] when she wanted to & Annette is free of her (at least as long as she stays incommunicado).”\n\nHe wondered what to do about Rose. “Now how do I get free of her short of giving her the property?” he asks in his journal. “One way (that I don’t know how to do) is prove to Davis she is manipulative old whore who’s [sic] motivation is accusing me (of whatever) is mostly money and very little if any parental concern for Annette.”\n\nHe scribbled a letter to Rose. He blamed her for the “bad things” in Annette, saying she had “stymied the love between us to the point where we both decided that she could get more ... from miscellaneous emotionally and sexually hungry men than she was getting from me.”\n\nHe wrote that after the couple came back from Costa Rica, Annette “began seeing friends and relatives ... and doing what she called completing her relationships with them for the purpose of getting ready to drop everybody and start over.”\n\nHe wrote that she “disappeared herself from you because she realized that you probably would never voluntarily stop re-energizing in her and superimposing on her the same value system you live by that makes her see you and your mother (and herself partially) as zero self image whores for approval in the form of male attention as prerequisite to the periodic and temporary permission to feel good about yourselves.”\n\nVail explained the two left each other “with no plans to communicate in the future … I have not the slightest idea where she might have gotten to by now. I will tell you that I love the spirit part and very much respect her right to freedom and so I also assure you that even if I did know, I would not tell you.”\n\nHis response felt like a cold slap to Rose. She could feel police interest in her daughter’s disappearance growing cold, too. Perhaps they would be less skeptical if she talked to them in person.\n\nShe returned to Tulsa in April 1985, letting Vail know she would be in town.\n\n“Dear Mary, I would like to see you to [sic],” he wrote her. “I think it could be more than lovely to be with you some. I look forward to it. Love, Felix.”\n\nWhen she arrived, she was unable to reach him and grew worried about her daughter. She slipped inside the rental cottage where her daughter had lived. All of Annette’s clothes were gone, and so were nearly all her possessions, including the diary she kept.\n\nInside a Barbie suitcase, Rose found a photograph of her daughter and several of her identification cards. She also located things that Annette had written, including a Feb. 17, 1984, note that contradicted Vail’s claim that the couple had spent most of her inheritance on their travel to Mexico and Central American countries.\n\nInstead, the note detailed how they used the money to buy the Fiat, pay off all of Vail’s loans, and deposit $36,000 into Louisiana Savings. “As of today, we have $41,600 in cash.”\n\nRose shared the information with police.\n\nDetective Davis showed up again, “acting like Columbo with two more questions,” Vail wrote in his journal.\n\nHe had told Davis before that he and Annette kept their money in cash. Now he acknowledged the couple divided the money into smaller cashier’s checks.\n\nAfter a while, Davis left. Vail hoped the answers satisfied the detective.\n\nHe dreamed about Annette in bed “with this great big ugly fat guy,” he wrote in his journal. “She was feeling dumb and ridiculous for having let him into her and being at the same time as high as she could be … (from) the energy of his desire and attention.”\n\nVail never heard again from the detective, who closed the missing person’s case.\n\nRose kept telephoning, hoping to talk with Vail. She tried him at home in Tulsa. She tried him at his parents’ home in Mississippi.\n\nOn Sept. 14, 1985, she finally reached him in Tulsa. When she asked about Annette’s missing clothes, he told her he had given all of them to charity.\n\nWhen Rose asked about Annette’s whereabouts, he refused to say where she was.\n\nShe mentioned that she was talking to police. When she pressed for more details about what happened to all the money that Annette inherited, she said Vail shot back, “That’s all you really care about — her money.”\n\nShe hung up.\n\nEach day in his journals, Vail wrote about his encounters with women. He hopped from bed to bed, sometimes in the same night.\n\nWhen the sex was good, he described it as “electric” and “mutually orgasmic.” When he was unable to have sex with a woman, he blamed it on her “fat.”\n\nWhen problems arose in the relationships, he blamed their egos, never his own.\n\nDecember came, and temperatures dipped below freezing. Vail watched television, “vibrating on commercials.”\n\nHe thought about Annette. He had told Tulsa police she was schizophrenic and suicidal. Now he wrote that everyone he had met 3 or older was “schizo.”\n\nLess than two weeks before Christmas, he stepped out into the snow at 1 a.m. After watching the movie, “The Hotel New Hampshire,” he returned to the icy white, this time in his bare feet. “It’s coming down in bigger flakes now & around 2 inches, it is magic to walk & frolic in it, falling & fallen, clothes on & clothes off.”\n\nBurning bridges\n\nFed up with the lack of progress in her daughter’s disappearance, Rose returned in 1987 to Tulsa, where she began working at her old job as a manager for the Bakery on Cherry Street.\n\nShe spent thousands on private investigators. When they were unable to locate Vail, she decided to look herself.\n\nTipped off that he was staying at someone’s house, she went there with a friend and found him sitting outside.\n\n“So where did Annette go?” she asked.\n\n“Mexico.”\n\n“Where in Mexico did she go?”\n\nHe told her that he and Annette had made a pact they would contact each other after five years.\n\nHe never looked up, never stood up and never looked her in the eye.\n\nShe walked away, shaking her head in disbelief. She didn’t believe a word.\n\nVail became fast friends with Tulsa native Scott Porter, an expert in martial arts who held more than one black belt.\n\nVail believed he was a martial arts expert, too, after practicing flying kicks into a mattress.\n\nEach morning, he and Porter worked out, lifting weights together before hitting a Chinese buffet.\n\nOver lunch, Vail shared that he had never felt bound by society’s rules, Porter recalled. “He dropped his silverware and began eating with his hands like a caveman.”\n\nAt nights, the pair played pool, drank beer and sometimes visited strip clubs in Tulsa, where Vail tucked dollar bills into the strippers’ panties. “Tulsa had more churches than gas stations,” Porter said, “but also more strip clubs than anywhere else I’ve lived.”\n\nBack home, Vail listened to the songs of Porter, who still dreamed of a career in music.\n\nThe two men reminisced about the women missing from their lives. Vail, at 45, had been married to Annette, just 18, and Porter, at 28, had dated Rose, who was 36.\n\nPorter had driven Rose to California before returning home alone. “My heart was absolutely broken,” he recalled. “She needed to move on, and I didn’t.”\n\nNot long after Annette vanished, Rose telephoned Porter and shared her suspicions that Vail had something to do with her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nPorter began examining each word his friend spoke.\n\nWhile he discussed his hopes of reuniting with Rose, he noticed Vail never mentioned that possibility with Annette.\n\nOne night, Vail seemed more open. “He was crying like a baby,” Porter recalled, “angry it didn’t work out differently.”\n\nVail explained that Annette “wanted to ‘recreate’ herself and that she didn’t want any contact with any portion of her past life. She wanted to totally break with herself.”\n\nWhile Vail talked of breaking with the past, Porter was busy searching for his.\n\nHe had been adopted and decided to move to Minnesota to reconnect with his birth parents. While there, he met his future wife, Jennie.\n\nReturning to Tulsa with a small son and another on the way, he renewed his friendship with Vail, who was so kind he later watched the boys while the couple went out on dates.\n\nOnce, during a discussion of fidelity, Porter said Vail shared that he felt “nobody could ever be faithful to one person.”\n\nMonths later, Vail “starts hitting on my wife,” Porter said.\n\nUpset about this, he took Vail on a walk and confronted him.\n\nVail denied it all, Porter recalled. “He said, ‘No, no, she was hitting on me.’ ”\n\nAs they crossed the Arkansas River Bridge, a fleeting thought ran through his head. “I was wanting to throw Felix off and wondering if I’d get away with it.”\n\nViolence and jealousy\n\nVail began dating Beth Field. She was attracted to his intelligence, and the pair grew close.\n\nArguments followed, and he kept calling her a “whore.” During a December 1987 argument, he became so violent he ruptured her eardrum, according to court records.\n\nShe told Vail there was no justification for physical violence, and she said he replied, “If you quit behaving like a whore, I’ll quit hitting you.”\n\nShe recalled discussing the issue with a therapist. “I finally told this woman, ‘It’s all very nice, but one of us is going to be dead before this works.’ ”\n\nField took the advice of a close friend and attended an intensive 10-day meditation course in August 1988 on Colorado’s Western Slope. To her surprise, Vail came, too.\n\nAfter the course, she received a telephone call from Rose, sharing details about the disappearance of her daughter, Annette.\n\nFrom that point forward, Field said she began to examine Vail’s words more closely, realizing “the probability that he had taken Annette’s life.”\n\nHe told Field he and Annette had gone camping, that she decided she wanted to get away from her mother and that he had helped her set up an opportunity for her to change her name and move on.\n\nVail denied any involvement in Annette’s disappearance.\n\n“Then one time,” Field recalled, “he said, ‘What if I said yes?’ ”\n\nFour months after the meditation course, he entered her home unannounced. Already drunk, he accused her of “imagined promiscuity,” according to the court order.\n\nHe slapped her, struck her and threw her across the bedroom.\n\n“Will I get out alive?” she asked.\n\n“It depends on what you tell me,” Vail replied.\n\nThe judge gave her a protective order, requiring Vail to keep his distance. Two weeks later, the sheriff reported that Vail was nowhere to be found.\n\nField said she felt caught in a “sick, addictive relationship, and it took quite some time to fully unravel it.”\n\nOver time, her attachment to him began to fade.\n\nWhile Field was visiting a meditation center in Texas in 1990, Vail arrived and castigated her, and she felt the same anger and defensiveness rising up as before, she said.\n\nShe walked away to compose herself, and when she returned, she sat down next to him. “I told him, ‘There is a part of you that goes off, and it’s sick and it’s dangerous.’ ”\n\nShe said he looked at her and asked, “Really?”\n\n“Yes, really.”\n\nThis time, the message seemed to soak in.\n\nVail left the next day, and with a single exception about five years later, she did not see him again.\n\nMary Rose moved to Ashland, Oregon, in 1989, working as an administrator for a private Waldorf School. She was hoping for a quieter life than the one she had in California.\n\nMore than a year later, she visited a psychic, asking if she could talk about her daughter Annette.\n\nThe psychic put her hands over her forehead and spoke. “Oh, my gosh, this is not something I usually talk about when I see images like this.”\n\nShe never shared what she saw, but Rose knew her daughter was dead and that she needed to get to the bottom of this.\n\nIn the summer of 1991, she removed the back seats from her Toyota van and put in a makeshift bed for sleeping. She made curtains to hang over the windows.\n\nShe had previously talked by telephone with Felix Vail’s sister, Sue Jordan, who now lived in Canyon Lake, Texas.\n\nNow Rose decided to drive the more than 2,000 miles there, hoping she might find out more in person.\n\nJordan answered the door and invited her in. The two women sat in the living room, and Jordan recalled the last time she saw Annette. In October 1984, the family attended the Cam-Cal Fair in Sulphur, Louisiana, along with Vail and Annette.\n\n“She told me Felix was giving Annette a hard time,” Rose recalled. “He criticized the way she was dressed.”\n\nDays after the fair, the couple left together, and a few days after that, Vail returned alone, “extremely distressed, eating meat and drinking alcohol,” she said Jordan told her.\n\nThat struck Rose as strange because Vail was a longtime vegetarian.\n\nJordan shared that Vail told her that Annette wanted to leave, that he took her to a bus station and that she left with some Mexican men, heading for Mexico.\n\nJordan also mentioned that Vail’s first wife had drowned. That was news to Rose.\n\nBefore she left, she said Jordan remarked, “Oh, you know, there was another woman that disappeared. I remember her mother calling my mother for years, checking to see if they’d heard from her. I think her name was Sharon.”\n\nAfter the conversation, Rose sat down at a typewriter, pecking out every word she could remember. She also telephoned the public library in Lake Charles.\n\nThe librarian remembered the 1962 drowning of Vail’s first wife, Mary. She recalled that he had taken out life insurance policies on his wife prior to her drowning. She also said the insurance companies were suspicious and didn’t pay the full value.\n\nThe librarian made copies of those newspaper articles and mailed them to her.\n\nAfter reading them, Rose reached out to Mary’s family in Louisiana, speaking to Will Horton. He shared his suspicions about Vail and a copy of the 1971 National Enquirer article. When she read it, she learned that Sharon’s last name was Hensley.\n\nThat solved one problem, but created another. Where was Sharon Hensley from? She had no idea.\n\nIn 1994, she read in the newspaper about Dolores Strehlow’s disappearance from Medford, Oregon, seven years earlier. Police had just arrested her husband, thanks to the work of Detective Terry Newell.\n\nShe contacted Newell, who was able to help her find the family of Sharon Hensley.\n\nWhen Rose dialed the Hensley family, Sharon’s mother, Peggy, answered.\n\n“Do you happen to know who Felix Vail is?” Rose asked.\n\n“You bet I do.”\n\n“We need to talk.”\n\n‘A fraud, bum and kind of a joke’\n\nNow back in Mississippi, Vail lived with his mother and father in their home in Montpelier.\n\n“Beginning lucid in the daily conscious waking dreaming and in the nightly sleep dreaming is the beginning purpose of this journal,” he wrote May 6, 1988. “A 24-hour-a-day lucid conscious spirit presence is my nature. … Starting tonight all the dreams go in this book.”\n\nIn one dream, he made his “fat” wife (whom he called “my cow wife”) disappear so he could be with a beautiful, black-haired woman.\n\nDuring the day, he worked some on the family’s farm. He also tinkered with his Fiat and used his gravity boots to hang upside down in a barn.\n\nOne day, he “chased off a poor three-legged hound dog,” he wrote in his journals. The next, he “shot the 3-legged dog and cleaned up the garbage.”\n\nHe detailed winning pool games and bedding women, sometimes having sex in a grain bin, an old bus or their homes while their husbands are away. “We are amping each other’s electric in a way we both desperately need right now in our lives,” he wrote Feb. 28, 1992.\n\nIn 1992, Robin Sinclair telephoned a Mississippi newspaper, wanting to buy an advertisement to remind Vail that he had a daughter he had never met.\n\nThe newspaper put her in touch with Vail, and the two began to write letters and talk on the telephone.\n\nIn one note, Vail “stated he had never gotten over me,” she recalled.\n\nShe felt confused by his words, she said, because she was already living with a man who made her happy — and who would become her future husband.\n\nWhen Vail arrived a few months later, she said the same magic she had felt more than two decades earlier had vanished. “I realized that he was a fraud, bum and kind of a joke.”\n\nPursuit for justice\n\nMary Rose contacted everyone she could think of, including the FBI.\n\nThe detective who had helped her before, Terry Newell, made contact with Jim Bell, a national expert in serial killings working for the FBI.\n\nWhen Rose talked with Bell, she felt she had hit the jackpot.\n\nHe was interested in working on the Vail case if he could swing the time. He remained busy with active serial killer cases, helping train task forces across the U.S.\n\nVail’s son, Bill, told Rose that he was willing to testify, as long as authorities provided protection to his family.\n\nBoth the Tulsa police and the district attorney’s office in Lake Charles revived their investigations into Vail, now considered a suspected serial killer.\n\nBell suggested the victims’ families gather with authorities at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, to share information on Vail.\n\nHe was unable to work on the case and left the FBI in 1995. The meeting in Quantico never materialized, and the cases involving\n\nVail grew cold again.\n\nRose felt devastated. She had worked so hard to make something happened and nothing had. She knew the other families felt devastated, too.\n\nShe sought counseling to help her cope with the grief.\n\nOne night, she listened to a recording of Annette performing her songs, including “Sunset in Winter”: “I’m dying, leaving orange tears, blood upon your face … Throw me gilded kisses, silent sorrow, but do not stay up and wait for me, for I may not return.”\n\nTears streaked down her cheeks. She knew Annette would never return.\n\n‘Not the man I know’\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Vail began dating a woman in Mississippi. At the time, he was 55, and she was 44.\n\n“In 10 years, I never saw a temper,” the woman said.\n\nShe recalled Vail taking care of his parents before their deaths. “Felix was very attentive,” she said. “He was just a kind man.”\n\nAlthough he never worked a job, she said he was the most frugal person she ever met. “He could probably live off $300 a month. He got rental money from the house in Tulsa.”\n\nOne day, she tried to step across the swollen creek in front of her house. Knocked off her feet, the current dragged her downstream.\n\n“If I had died in the creek,” she said, “I would have been added to the list of people that Felix supposedly killed.”\n\nShe knew of the allegations that Vail had something to do with Annette Vail’s disappearance, but she was unaware of Sharon Hensley’s disappearance or suspicions surrounding Mary Horton Vail’s death.\n\n“That man,” she insisted, “was not the man I know.”\n\nRose moved to western Massachusetts, hoping to heal.\n\nIn the fall of 1997, family members and friends held her hands during a memorial service for Annette, whose songs played.\n\nAt night, Rose sometimes stepped outside, gazing at the stars and pondering the past.\n\nShe fumed at herself for letting Annette marry Vail, for failing to stand up to him and for leaving Annette behind in Tulsa.\n\nHer anger boiled toward Vail. Why, she wondered, was he not behind bars?\n\nA dozen years later, she read about a local support group for parents whose children had died.\n\nWould she fit in? She didn’t know, but decided to go anyway.\n\nShe shared stories about Annette, passing around her pictures and poetry.\n\nRose’s work with support groups and sessions with a local therapist helped her do something she had been unable to do for a quarter century — release the heavy burden she felt she had been carrying since her daughter’s disappearance.\n\nAfter a therapy session in which she had sobbed at Annette’s loss, she returned home and listened to one of her daughter’s songs.\n\nAnnette strummed a guitar, and her voice rose. Her mother felt the joy of her daughter and her all-too-brief life, finally able to listen to the music without weeping.\n\nSon’s mixed feelings\n\nVail’s son, Bill, became an Eagle Scout and graduated from Mississippi State University in the top 5 percent of his class.\n\nHe became a mechanical engineer, working for corporations such as Sinclair Oil, and remained active in church and Boy Scouts.\n\nIn 1984, Bill married his wife, Janet. Years later, he received a call from Rose and then from authorities.\n\n“They asked, ‘Did I believe he may have murdered her (Annette)?’” Bill said. “And I said, ‘Yes, I believe based on past experiences, it was entirely possible.’ ”\n\nHe explained his complicated feelings to Rose.\n\n“Felix is a mixture of opposite extremes — he is capable of incredibly unselfish love, and simultaneously he is capable of doing the incredibly selfish and black things he has done,” he wrote. “He values, even demands, honesty and integrity, yet he admittedly will lie whenever it is convenient.”\n\nVail held mixed feelings toward Bill.\n\nIn a letter to his son, he bragged about him holding “center stage with a whole room full of PhDs by simplifying logic sequence problems for them when you were 5.”\n\nBut in his journals, he criticized his son’s Christian faith as “herd animal mentality,” saying, “Ego finally took him over.”\n\nIn a letter, Vail told Bill that after death, he and his half-sister, Simone, should “split up whatever ‘stuff’ I will have accumulated … I love you both equally with all the heart I have.”\n\nBill replied in a letter: “I have always loved you. I can’t help but love you.”\n\nBut barricades remained to their relationship, the biggest of which was “the murder of my mother,” he wrote.\n\nHe mentioned the pain of learning about these two other missing women and recalled what his father had told him about Sharon Hensley.\n\n“I was so angry that you told me because there was absolutely no one I could talk to about it,” he wrote. “I had to keep it to myself knowing that no one would believe you had killed her based on those words, at least not in court.”’\n\nDiagnosed with esophageal cancer, Bill heard from doctors that he didn’t have long to live. “Now,” he told his uncle, Will Horton, “I’ll get to be with my mom.”\n\nMonths before dying in 2009, Bill talked about his father in a recorded interview with his pastor at Grace Church in Overland Park, Kansas.\n\n“Part of me loves him,” he said. “He was a good father. I know that’s hard to believe given what he’s done. ... I have to keep a distance because of what he’s able to do — for my family’s sake.”\n\nOn Jan. 3, 2009, Bill died, and Vail wrote in his journal, “I feel a large empty hole in my being where his life presence has been for 47 years.”\n\nHe then wrote about getting a good haircut.\n\nVail drove to Kansas, but skipped the funeral. If he had attended, he would have heard the recording, his son detailing how he overheard his father talk about killing his mother.\n\nWhen Vail learned of the recording, he wrote Pastor Tim Howey, asking for a copy: “Bill never mentioned to me in his whole life any of the negative stuff about drugs and murder that had been put in his mind about me.”\n\nVail blamed his son’s statements on “false memories,” saying, “I have not known about it until now and am stunned.”\n\nAs for the accusations of murder, he wrote, “I have saved several people’s lives. I have never taken any.”\n\nOn May 14, 2012, I went with Mary Rose as she tried to confront Felix Vail about her missing daughter, Annette. He wasn’t there, but she found a stack of machetes and swords in one of his trailers.\n\n“Could DNA tests be done to see if there is blood on these?” she asked.\n\nI was wondering the same thing.\n\nShe handed me a spiritual tome by the Holy Order of MANS. When I opened it, I read the words, “Look not into the past, for it is no more.”\n\nBefore we left the area, Vail’s sister, Kaye Faulkner, stopped us. She wanted to talk.\n\nRose and I sat in her living room as she spoke about attending the 2009 funeral of Bill Vail. “Bill said he overheard Felix saying he killed his mother.”\n\nShe turned to me. “You should get a copy of that recording.”\n\nShe was convinced, she said, that Felix had killed all three women.\n\nShe was surprised he was still alive. Last year, a tornado smacked his trailer, and he had somehow survived, receiving only minor injuries.\n\nI told her I was interested in talking to her brother. She gave me his cellphone number. She also shared the numbers for her other brother, Ronnie, and her sister, Beth.\n\nWhen Felix Vail didn’t answer, I left him a message that I was interested in speaking with him about these women’s disappearances. Ronnie promised to speak to his brother on my behalf.\n\nOver dinner, Rose opened two manila folders filled with hundreds of pages of documents she had collected on Vail.\n\nThere was the judge’s protective order for Beth Field after Vail had beaten her a second time and the National Enquirer article on the 1970 arrests of Felix Vail and Sharon Hensley.\n\nRose showed me similarities between the two letters Vail wrote — one to her after Annette disappeared and the other after Sharon disappeared.\n\nIn each letter, he insisted to the families that the women had gone away because they wanted to disappear, start over and leave their pasts behind.\n\nWas he the one who really wanted to leave his past behind?\n\nRose shared the 1962 autopsy report on Vail’s wife, Mary, and a stack of newspaper clippings on her drowning in Lake Charles.\n\nVail told deputies that he and his wife had gone trotline fishing, that she was shining a flashlight and that when she warned him about a stump, he jerked the boat to avoid it, and she accidentally fell out. He told them he dove into the water, but was unable to save her.\n\nLake Charles\n\nArriving in Lake Charles, I stood along the Calcasieu River, examining the place where Vail told deputies his wife had drowned.\n\nThe dark, swift river, which bore the Atakapa word for “crying,” swept by as I stood on the dirt.\n\nReassembling this case was going to be even tougher than I thought. Whatever reports the sheriff’s office had made at the time had all been lost.\n\nI stopped by the Southwestern Louisiana Genealogical and Historical Library, which shared copies from old city directories, and I began tracking down those who had lived in the Maree Apartments with Felix and Mary Vail.\n\nOne of them was Judson McCann II. When he finally answered the door, he invited me inside his apartment, filled with photographs of him deep-sea fishing.\n\nHe had been close with Vail, and Mary Vail’s death had always shocked him. He said he couldn’t believe she would be out on the river at night.\n\nHe also couldn’t believe Vail’s claim that he was laying trotlines. He and Vail golfed, but he never recalled Vail fishing. Instead, Vail used his boat to waterski.\n\nMcCann described Vail as a ladies’ man. “Many nights, his car wouldn’t be home, and Mary would be there with the lights on.\n\nWhen Felix was gone, it wasn’t because he was trotline fishing.”\n\nAnother close friend, Bob Hodges, told me that when Mary drowned, “I’ll be truthful with you, that was the end of my friendship with Felix.”\n\nHe never knew Vail to fish and described Vail’s explanation about how his wife drowned as “horse manure. That’s what I think of that story.”\n\nThe odds of one man having one wife drown and two others disappear seemed beyond belief.\n\nI decided to ask criminologist James Alan Fox of Northeastern University what the odds of such a scenario would be. “Smaller than the threshold of chance,” he said. “Either he tends to select partners that lead higher risk lives or something else is going on that’s more nefarious.”\n\nThe family of Vail’s wife, Mary, told me she had been a member of Chi Omega. I contacted a librarian from McNeese State University, who pulled out the old yearbooks and created a list of the members between 1957 and 1961. She shared the list, and I began contacting them.\n\nThey talked of how much she feared drowning. “Nobody believed it was an accident,” her college roommate, Sandra Sudduth Pratt, told me.\n\nI shared the Oct. 30, 1962, autopsy report with renowned pathologist Dr. Michael Baden of New York City.\n\nHis conclusion? Foul play took place in her death.\n\nThe report showed large bruises with bleeding into tissues on the left side of the neck, which he said suggested she suffered forceful neck trauma before entering the water.\n\nThere were also hemorrhagic bruises to the right calf and left leg above the knee, which he said were consistent with a struggle before her submersion.\n\nMost convincingly of all was the scarf authorities found around her neck that extended 4 inches into her mouth, which suggested traumatic asphyxia before entering the water, he said.\n\n“Somebody had to push that scarf into her mouth. She had to have that scarf wedged in her mouth before she went in the water.”\n\nJoining forces\n\nA half-century after his sister, Mary, drowned, Will Horton went out onto the Calcasieu River and gazed at the place where she breathed her last.\n\nHe never knew she died in this section of the river that snakes north of downtown Lake Charles. He had always believed she had drowned much farther south.\n\nHe said he had looked up to his sister, seven years older than him. “It’s haunting. I keep wanting to talk with her.”\n\nHe told me Mary Rose had contacted him in the 1990s. “You could have knocked me over with a feather when I found out there were two other women.”\n\nHe and Rose bonded in their common cause for justice. She shared letters Vail had written and other documents she had been saving since 1984. Horton shared his sister’s autopsy report, death certificate and other documents his family had been saving since her death in 1962.\n\nHe said he told Rose, “No matter what happens, this is going to be for all three women.”\n\nA cousin put him in touch with former detective “Rabbit” Manuel, who had headed up the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Office’s investigation back in 1962.\n\nManuel had worked thousands of cases, but he had never forgotten Mary’s death, Horton said. “He said Felix’s story just didn’t add up. The fishing tackle was dry. The trotline was dry. The boat was dry. Even Felix’s cigarettes were dry, despite him telling the deputies he dove straight in the water to save Mary.”\n\nHe and Manuel met with “Lucky” DeLouche, who directed the Violent Crimes Task Force, an elite unit that investigated homicides.\n\nThree young detectives took notes as they talked. Manuel shared details from the case, saying deputies wanted to prosecute, but the district attorney wouldn’t let them. Horton shared the autopsy report, Vail’s letters and his belief that Vail was a serial killer.\n\nHorton said DeLouche replied, “This absolutely fits the profile of a serial killer.”\n\nThe other detectives agreed.\n\nThe task force discussed sending Vail’s son, Bill, in to secretly record a conversation with his father. Horton objected, saying that might put Bill in jeopardy.\n\nDeLouche left the task force, and the case grew cold again.\n\nHorton gazed out at the Calcasieu River as Calcasieu Parish Deputy Ron Johnson guided the boat. He had fished and dived in this river since the 1960s.\n\nJohnson led us north of the old Halliburton docks, where newspaper articles said Mary’s body had been recovered.\n\nHorton said his sister feared drowning and refused to swim where she couldn’t see the bottom. “Mary was scared of the dark water, so why was she out there? And why was she out there without wearing a life preserver?”\n\nHe wondered why Vail had failed to seek help closer, rather than boating back toward Shell Beach, more than 5 miles south, especially since he claimed to have trouble cranking his engine.\n\nHe questioned Vail’s story about running trotlines, saying he had waterskied in that high-powered boat many times, but “I never saw a fishing pole. I never saw a tackle box.”\n\nHe said ski boats aren’t designed for trotline fishing because they sit up too high on the water.\n\nHe said a ski boat sits up high on the water, but a boat that sits close to the water is needed to run trotlines. “Felix didn’t even have a trolling motor.”\n\nHe questioned Vail’s claim that Mary fell from the boat when he steered to avoid a stump.\n\nJohnson said dredging during World War II enabled Navy ships, oil tankers and other vessels to use this waterway. He said a trotline can’t survive such traffic, and that’s why fishermen place their trotlines elsewhere.\n\nHorton said Vail never explained to the family what happened that night.\n\n“Our family had a lot of questions, but we never got any answers.”\n\nAnother disappearing act\n\nShortly after Rose rummaged through the old trailer, looking for clues, Vail disappeared again.\n\nHe returned on Labor Day weekend in 2012, only to sell his 17 acres and depart. He left his storm-damaged trailer behind, but the machetes and knives that had lined his floor were gone.\n\nI telephoned his brother, Ronnie, who told me, “I don’t know where he went. He probably doesn’t want anyone to know where he is.”\n\nRonnie, who had worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for 22 years, told me when he heard allegations of the disappearances of these women, “We were all just shocked.”\n\n“Did the FBI ever interview you?”\n\n“No. I’m surprised they haven’t.”\n\nAfter my story on Felix Vail, “Gone” appeared in The Clarion-Ledger on Nov. 11, 2012, I traveled to Montpelier to meet a man who had telephoned me.\n\nWesley Turnage grew up with Vail and recalled a conversation he had in the months following his 1963 graduation from Montpelier High School.\n\nHe said he had car trouble one day, and Vail gave him a ride to the Knickerbocker Manufacturing Co. in nearby West Point, where they both worked.\n\nDuring that drive on Mississippi 46, he said Vail talked first of his son, Bill, and then of his deceased wife, Mary, calling her his “ex-wife” — a word that struck Turnage as strange since the two were not divorced at the time of her death.\n\nHe said the longer Vail spoke, the angrier the man got. “You could see a rage in his eyes.”\n\nVail referred to Mary as a “bitch,” saying she thought another child would help solve their marriage problems, Turnage recalled.\n\nHe quoted Vail as saying, “She wanted to have another kid. I didn’t want the one I got. I fixed that sorry bitch. She will never have another one.”\n\nTime marched on, but he said he never forgot what Vail told him. “It’s like 9/11. Some things stick in your mind.”\n\nI returned to Lake Charles, puzzled by how Vail dodged an indictment in the 1962 death of his first wife, Mary.\n\nHer brother, Will Horton, joined me in the Calcasieu Parish clerk’s office as I pored through stacks of records, trying to find out more information about the grand jury that met on the case Jan. 7, 1963.\n\nFlipping through the pages, I noticed a lot of criminal cases had been dismissed in 1962. When I added them up, I realized then-District Attorney Frank Salter Jr. had the judge dismiss 882 criminal cases — more than three cases for each working day.\n\nHorton told me the original detectives in the case told him that Salter wouldn’t allow them to present the evidence they had collected against Vail.\n\nThat matched the stories I had heard from grand jurors’ families.\n\nHorton left while I continued to dig. A half hour later, he called me to let me know he was talking with District Attorney John DeRosier.\n\n“He’s from Eunice, just like me,” Horton said.\n\nI walked over and met DeRosier, a Vietnam veteran who viewed himself as the guy wearing the white hat and battling the bad guys. He even kept a life-size cutout of John Wayne in his office.\n\nHe said he would be willing to reopen the case if there was enough evidence.\n\nAfterward, I telephoned a retired lawyer who had known Salter.\n\nThe cheerful, white-haired man, who built boats and model airplanes, greeted Horton and me at the door, inviting us to join him at the kitchen table.\n\nA talented attorney in both civil and criminal court, Russell Tritico Sr. had won a 1980 civil judgment, forcing chainsaw manufacturers to put chain brakes on their products.\n\nThe 84-year-old retired lawyer recalled the corruption of those days. He worked back then under his uncle, Joe, who represented then-Sheriff “Ham” Reid, accused of taking bribes but never convicted.\n\nTritico said the sheriff was so paranoid, he stayed in his patrol car, and he never answered the telephone at home unless he heard the right sequence of rings.\n\nHe described Salter as a longtime prosecutor whose “close friends were mostly what I called hoodlums.”\n\nIn the 1950s, Salter began his legal career as an assistant district attorney for then-District Attorney Ed Shaheen, but when the senior prosecutor sought re-election in 1960, Salter ran against him.\n\nTritico said the major issue Salter raised was Shaheen had dismissed too many cases. “Then Frank becomes DA and does the same thing.”\n\nDismissals became business as usual, and defense lawyers showered office secretaries with gifts, especially at Christmas, he recalled. “It was easy money. Of course, the victim might not be happy.”\n\nHe knew about the 1962 death of Mary Horton Vail.\n\nWhen his uncle, Joe, ran against Salter in 1966, her death became a political issue. The candidate showed a photograph of her body after it was recovered from the river as proof of Salter’s political favors.\n\nI asked Tritico about Cities Service, and he told me the company was like the General Motors of the Lake Charles area. I knew Vail’s uncle, Thomas Finnie, had worked there as a supervisor and had arranged for Vail’s job.\n\nIn searching for Salter’s obituary, I had run across the one for his father, who also worked at Cities Service. When I visited Finnie’s 94-year-old widow, Virginia, she confirmed the couple’s friendship with the district attorney.\n\nI shared what Vail said about trotline fishing that night, and Tritico shook his head. The longtime fisherman questioned why Vail would have traveled so many miles up the Calcasieu River when he could have laid trotlines not far from where he kept his boat.\n\n“You don’t run trotlines in deep water.”\n\nFinding Felix\n\nSo where had Vail gone? Had he just disappeared like the women he professed to once love?\n\nI telephoned more of his relatives and friends. They were just as clueless as me.\n\nWeeks after “Gone” was published, I received a telephone call from a man who had read my nearly 9,000-word story online. We discussed Vail, the case against him and his disappearance before the man volunteered, “I know where he is.”\n\n“You do?”\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas. Would you like his post office box?”\n\n“You bet.”\n\nBack in Jackson, I telephoned Enzo Yaksic of Boston, the founder of the Serial Homicide Expertise and Information Sharing Collaborative. No matter what questions I had about serial killers, Yaksic had the answers, thanks to a huge database he had amassed.\n\nMy search for answers in the Vail case led Yaksic to contact Armin Showalter, acting chief for the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, which specialized in serial homicide investigations.\n\nYaksic shared a copy of “Gone” with Showalter, who in turn contacted Calcasieu Parish Deputy Randy Curtis, now taking on the Vail case.\n\nCurtis telephoned me, explaining that he was a 20-year law enforcement veteran who had been transferred from the Violent Crimes Unit to the Forensic Cold Case Division. After reading “Gone,” he called back, wondering if I knew where Vail was these days.\n\n“Canyon Lake, Texas,” I said.\n\nDays later, the deputy telephoned with news that the FBI had discovered Vail purchased property at 737 Shadyview Drive in Canyon Lake.\n\nOn Jan. 18, 2013, Curtis decided to confront Vail. He found the suspected serial killer at that address, living in a storage shed so large it could be a home.\n\nCurtis said he read Vail his rights before asking him about the death and disappearances of the women.\n\nVail refused to say anything, accusing families and The Clarion-Ledger of lying about him.\n\nThe whole time, Vail couldn’t stop smirking.\n\nThe sight of that smirk angered Curtis, who worked days, nights and weekends on the case.\n\nOne day, he called to tell me he had found something. Big.\n\nConsensus: Vail killed Mary\n\nNot long after this call, Will Horton shared the number of his cousin, who was in the same rosary group with a caretaker for 90-year-old Isaac “Sonny” Abshire Jr.\n\nI drove to Lake Charles and sat down with the man, who was finishing his lunch in front of the television. He remembered Vail well. The pair had worked together at a chemical plant next to the Cities Service refinery in nearby Sulphur. They refrigerated the chemical butadiene, used to produce tires.\n\nAbshire described Vail as “my helper” and “a good worker. I liked him.”\n\nVail was looking for a place closer to his girlfriend, Mary Horton, who was living in Lake Charles. Needing the cash, Abshire offered him a room for rent.\n\nHe accepted, and Mary became a frequent visitor. “I was kind of like a big brother to her. She was a sweet little girl.”\n\nAfter the couple decided to get married, Vail moved out.\n\nAt work, his disposition soured. He talked about how ugly his wife was when she was pregnant and that he didn’t like his baby.\n\n“Even a dog loves their children,” Abshire said he replied.\n\nOn the Friday before her drowning, the couple visited, bringing their infant son, Bill. Mary confided in Abshire, asking if he\n\nthought Vail could take her baby away.\n\nTwo nights later, word came that Mary had drowned in the Calcasieu River.\n\nDeputies contacted Abshire’s father for help in the search.\n\nAbshire and two fellow workers went out the next day to drag the river. The next morning, Oct. 30, 1962, he returned with one of them, Jimmy May, to continue dragging.\n\nWhile they were talking, “something popped up. A guy with binoculars asked, ‘Does she have blonde hair?’ I said, ‘Yes, that’s her.’ ”\n\nThey recovered the body, and Abshire could never forget what he saw. Her body was rigid, and a scarf was wrapped around her neck before going into her mouth. “It had a big ol’ knot in it.”\n\nThe deputies on the boat boiled in anger, all voicing the same opinion — that Vail had killed Mary. “They believed it was foul play.”\n\nA deputy shared copies of photographs taken that day, and Abshire had held onto them ever since, placing them in a folder he marked “Keep.”\n\n“You hung onto these photos for 50 years?” I asked.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe told me he gave the photos to Deputy Curtis. He also handed over a copy of the 1962 sheriff’s report, which listed 15 points suggesting Vail’s guilt.\n\nDespite being behind on major bills, Vail had managed to pay an entire year’s premiums in advance for a $50,000 life insurance policy on his wife. He had a second life insurance policy on her for $8,000, which promised to pay double if she died by accident.\n\nDeputies reported that witnesses said Vail told them he didn’t love his wife, that she was stupid and that she looked vulgar.\n\nDeputies also reported that Vail had “sexual relationships with other females and at least one male.”\n\nMost witnesses they talked to felt he was capable of killing his wife.\n\nVail told deputies that his wife was wearing an off-white leather jacket when she went into the water. But she wasn’t wearing the jacket when her body was recovered.\n\nInside his boat, deputies found two life preservers. Mary had not been wearing one, despite her fear of drowning.\n\nAs for the trotline, deputies found it coiled inside Vail’s tackle box.\n\n“That’s why,” Abshire told me, “they thought it was fishy.”\n\nWhen he returned to work, he told his co-workers what he witnessed.\n\nWord spread, and he said his boss hauled him in and told him to stop sharing what he saw.\n\nEventually, Abshire faced off with Vail. “He said he had lawyers that were ready to sue me for everything I had for all I was saying about him.”\n\n“Get your lawyers ready,” he said he replied. “I want to get on the (witness) stand and tell everybody what happened.”\n\nAfter some time passed, Abshire said Vail telephoned him, asking if he still wanted to tell everything to the lawyers.\n\n“Get ‘em,” Abshire said he replied. “I’m still ready to talk. I want to get on the stand and tell ‘em what I know.”\n\nNot long after, Vail left town.\n\nI asked him if he believed Vail had killed his wife.\n\n“Oh, my God, yes.”\n\nMarriage made in hell\n\nOver gumbo and crawfish étouffée, Steve Horton talked about his aunt Mary, whom his family adored so much that he and his wife had named their daughter after her. He showed me her 1962 death certificate, signed by the coroner, Dr. Harry Snatic. The certificate said she “fell from (the) boat while fishing and accidentally drowned.”\n\nHorton detailed the many errors. Snatic had put down the wrong date of her birth. The wrong date of her death. The wrong occupation (“housewife” rather than “teacher”).\n\nHe pointed to the neat signature, “William Vail.” It looked nothing like the handwriting of William Felix Vail that I was familiar with.\n\nHe then directed me to the date of Vail’s signature, Oct. 31, 1962.\n\n“That was the same day as the funeral, which was in Eunice,” he said. “How could he have signed this in Lake Charles?”\n\nHorton shared other documents, which showed Vail had failed to pay any money toward the $1,014 bill for his wife’s funeral, her headstone or her burial plot.\n\n“Dear Sir, I would have contacted you sooner if I had known anything definate (sic) about when I can pay you,” Vail wrote\n\nArdoin’s Funeral Home in 1963. “Thank you for your patience and I’ll be in your office the first part of April to settle the bill. Yours truly, Felix Vail.”\n\nVail never showed and never paid, despite receiving thousands on two life insurance policies he took out on his wife.\n\nThe funeral home won a $1,306 judgment in Mississippi against Vail. He still didn’t pay.\n\nIt was during a bridge game in 1969 that Mary’s mother learned Vail had never put a penny toward the funeral, Horton told me.\n\n“She was so embarrassed, she went and paid.”\n\nI spoke with funeral home operator Gene Ardoin. He remembered Mary as “a beautiful girl. They had a marriage not made in heaven, but made in hell.”\n\nTrip to Canyon Lake\n\nWhen I drove into the Canyon Lake neighborhood where Vail lived, I saw deer grazing on the lawns.\n\nPaperwork I copied at the courthouse showed David Thomason had deeded his property to Vail after he paid the back taxes.\n\nDigging into Thomason’s background, I discovered he and Vail shared something in common — each had a wife who died in an “accidental drowning.”\n\nI decided to dig deeper.\n\nThomason’s estranged wife, Kathey, had drowned in Canyon Lake on July 3, 2005. Her family still had questions.\n\nHer mother, Cathy Simon, still lived in Canyon Lake. She told me her daughter tried to get away from Thomason, who was charged twice with assault but was never prosecuted. “She was terrified of him.”\n\nOn the back lot of Vail’s property, I could see the boat Kathey supposedly fell from and drowned.\n\nFriends told me Thomason was out of town at the time.\n\nIf he did take out a life insurance policy on her, I couldn’t find it, but I did find that insurance companies had shelled out more than a half million in proceeds to him, including $215,400 for a house fire that the fire marshal had ruled a suspicious arson.\n\nVail now lived on this property, and when I pulled up outside his home, I noticed there were no windows. The padlocked fence had barbed wire across the top.\n\nI called out his name and told him I was interested in speaking to him about the missing women. There was no answer.\n\nOn March 10, 2013, I received an email from Gina Frenzel, a redheaded private investigator, whose colleagues nicknamed her “Batgirl.”\n\nObsessed with serial killers, she had read the e-book version of “Gone” before going online to discover Felix Vail was now living in Canyon Lake.\n\nThat was only an hour and a half away from her home in Kerrville, Texas, where her grandfather had been chief of police for 20 years.\n\n“I’m a licensed private investigator,” she wrote me. “Let me know if you need any help.”\n\nI promised I would. Later, I sent a second email, saying I would like to find out more about the suspicious burning of David Thomason’s house on the property where Vail now lived.\n\nOn April 3, she tried to talk to Thomason, and when she was unable to, she telephoned and said she was going to see Vail.\n\n“He won’t talk to you,” I told her.\n\n“Wanna bet?” she replied.\n\nShe called back later with the news that Vail had indeed talked. She told him she was an investigator looking into Thomason’s fire, and he had spoken almost nonstop to her.\n\nShe returned several more times, recording each of her conversations with Vail, who shared details about his life and lectured her about the dangers of ego, even as his own ego overwhelmed their conversations.\n\nHe claimed to have a genius-level IQ surpassing 140 and talked of memories from the womb, saying he could “feel the sunshine” on his mother’s belly.\n\nI shared information from Frenzel’s visits with the expert, Yaksic. He provided many hours of advice and insights, saying Vail seemed “more in line with a cult leader” than a suspected serial killer.\n\nFo", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/michigan/2015/11/14/front-edge-publishing/75504328/", "title": "Cousins -- writer and software guy -- grow startup", "text": "Frank Witsil\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nDavid Crumm and John Hile are distant cousins with similar interests -- and complementary skills -- who after long careers in other fields want to capitalize on publishing trends with their startup, Front Edge Publishing.\n\nThey're giving organizations and authors with something to say a chance to sell books.\n\nCrumm, a former religion writer for the Free Press, and Hile, a technology and software pioneer, found they could combine their talents and experience.\n\n\"As we grew up,\" Hile said earlier this week, \"I was always fascinated with what he did, and he was fascinated with the technology I did. We never thought those beams would cross so to speak, but circumstances in publishing led to that.\"\n\nWaves of tiny ideas can propel Michigan to more growth\n\nTheir company, which is nearly a year old and has about 10 part-time employees, is the latest iteration of a publishing business that the two have been working on since 2007. They said they are on track to bring in about $140,000 in revenue this year.\n\nThe company aims to capitalize on two trends: Online book sales and on-demand publishing.\n\nWhat sets their new company apart, they said, is software developed by Hile dubbed the BookMog, an allusion to the invention in the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbes that almost magically turns one thing into another. The software makes it quicker and easier to publish in digital and printed formats, the cofounders say.\n\nHere's our conversation with them -- edited for clarity and brevity -- about their new company.\n\nQuestion: What is the genesis of your foray into publishing?\n\nCrumm: We have been friends for more than 40 years, all our lives.\n\nHile: His grandmother was sort of the matriarch of our family and we had a lot of family gatherings. As we got into our careers, I found his career -- traveling around the world, interviewing Desmond Tutu, the pope a couple times, going behind the Iron Curtain after the fall of the Berlin Wall -- fascinating. Whenever we'd get together at family gatherings, I would sit next to him and pick his brain. In the meantime, I'd gotten into technology and software development. I have a patent in virus scanning. He was quite interested in that. At one point, I sold a software company to Compuware, so I found myself in a position to try something new. At the same time, the Free Press was cutting way back and David was looking at taking a buyout. We got talking about publishing and the publishing industry.\n\nQ: So how to you get your clients? Do people come to you, or do you seek them out?\n\nCrumm: The answer to that is both. We do seek people out, and people come to us. The company really is focused on working with organizations and we're just getting the kinks out of and scaling up to work with organizations.\n\nQ: What advice do you have for other entrepreneurs?\n\nHile: Be prepared to be persistent. Part of that, I think, is we had a vision we pursued and built the thing up in stages. We'd add components to these tools with each new book. This book is the first book with a fixed image at the beginning of each chapter, let's add that capability. We built it up gradually like that. For someone getting into business I'd say get everything down in writing. Make sure you keep accurate books. That's one of the biggest problems people have. Don't be afraid to try things.\n\nCrumm: One thing I'd add: You really have to understand the industry you're launching into. We began this company learning how to be small publishers, but because we understood the industry, we understood these crucial problems that suddenly in the last two years that any serious publisher has to publish on all formats. .\n\nQ: What is your long-range plan? Do you want to build the company to a certain size? Do you plan to sell or license the software? What is the endgame here?\n\nHile: We're open. I've sold a couple companies, and we know in the publishing industry acquisitions are normal. I wouldn't be surprised if at some point someone made a bid to acquire it. On the other hand, my idea would be to grow the company to the point where others can pick up equity and keep it going. My son worked with us for a while.\n\nCrumm: We really see ourselves unlocking the secret of book publishing for organizations and schools that have been shut out of it until now. Part of what we're doing is to prove we can build this solid, sustainable Michigan-based business and while we're doing it, we can help a lot of organizations.\n\nContact Frank Witsil: 313-222-5022 or fwitsil@freepress.com\n\nDavid Crumm\n\nAge: 60\n\nTitle: Cofounder, editor and chief\n\nExperience: Journalist for 40 years, including work as the Free Press religion writer, and a syndicated columnist for Knight Ridder; nominated five times for the Pulitzer prize; won the National Wilber Award six times\n\nEducation: University of Michigan, bachelor's degree; Knight-Wallace journalism fellowship\n\nFamily: Wife, Amy; two children, daughter, Megan Walther, 29; son, Benjamin, 26\n\nHobbies: Gardening, film studies\n\nCars: 2007 Pontiac Torrent\n\nJohn Hile\n\nAge: 65\n\nTitle: Cofounder, chief technology officer\n\nExperience: He is an inventor and software pioneer; holds patents related to security, data transfer and automation of computer-to-computer connections; was vice president of research and development for Hilgraeve, a computer software company that was sold to Compuware.\n\nEducation: University of Michigan, bachelor's degree\n\nFamily: Wife, Janice, two sons, Stephen, 30, and Paul, 26\n\nHobbies: Gardening, photography\n\nCars: 2007 Toyota Prius", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/03/12/coronavirus-vermont-live-updates-cases-closures-covid-19/5023835002/", "title": "Coronavirus in Vermont: Latest news and impact", "text": "Free Press Staff\n\nAs the situation surrounding the COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus continues to evolve in Vermont, here are updates and information.

As a result, grand list increases were less than initially estimated.\n\nThe new rate is set to $0.2750, meaning that for every $100,000 in property value, municipal taxes will be $275, the town said. The deadline for the first property tax payment has been postponed from Aug. 15 until Sept 15.

Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said.

He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

A month later, after 35 deaths, Scott ordered flags to be lowered on the eighteenth of every month until the end of the year.\n\nFifty-six people in Vermont have died from the disease; the most recent death was reported on June 18.\n\n____________\n\n============\n\nWednesday, June 17, 2020\n\nNo new cases have been reported in Vermont, which currently has 1,129 cases, according to the Vermont Department of Health's dashboard Wednesday.\n\nSo far, about 915 people have recovered from the virus and 53,663 people have been tested.\n\nOne person is in the hospital for COVID-19 and four are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n_________\n\nThe Farmers To Families nutrition assistance program has been extended through August, Vermont's congressional delegation announced Wednesday.\n\nA pair of Vermont-based organizations, Willing Hands and the Abbey Group, secured contracts to continue the food box-delivery program for two more months, according to news release from Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund is also supported by federal CARES Act funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19. Eligible “short-term borrowing costs” do not include principal payments, fees, or any interest on borrowings not directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMunicipalities can learn more, and apply, by visiting https://www.vermonttreasurer.gov/content/local-government.\n\n_________\n\nThree additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont, bringing the pandemic total to 1,130, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 914 people have recovered from the virus, the data showed, and 52,890 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 10 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\nMonday, June 15, 2020\n\nGov. Phil Scott extended a state of emergency through July 15. That action does not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but provides a mechanism by which guidelines can be updated (relaxed or tightened, as needed) in an orderly, methodical way.\n\n_________\n\nOutdoor camping facilities may operate at 100% capacity, beginning today, the governor announced. Campground use had been capped at 50% capacity.\n\nQuarantine guidelines from out-of-state campers will remain in place.\n\n_________\n\nOne additional positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Vermont on Sunday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,128, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 912 people have recovered from the virus, the data shows, and 52,557 people have been tested, the data showed.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n________\n\nDespite uptick in cases due to a cluster in Winooski in early June, Vermont seems to be back on a reliable path toward containing and tracking the coronavirus (# of cases dipped to just three over the weekend), according to Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.\n\nStatewide, effective ways of managing outbreaks can take place even as restrictions are relaxed, he said.\n\nSerology tests (that test blood for the presence of, or exposure to, coronavirus) would be of limited utility in Vermont, where the population that has been exposed remains very low by national standards (Levine's best guess is 5%).\n\nLess invasive and more comfortable tests (front-of-nose; saliva) are in development, and will, until a vaccine is developed, make it easier for people to seek out testing, Levine added.. Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Phil Scott and members of his cabinet announced a proposed $90 million in economic relief on Friday — phase two of a relief package he has proposed to restart the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFunds from the first phase are being considered by the Vermont Legislature currently. Scott had proposed $250 million in relief for businesses impacted by the pandemic, but expressed frustration at seeing the Legislature reducing the amount he asked for in his proposal. The Vermont House of Representatives announced Friday that it had fast-tracked a $93 million coronavirus relief package to Scott's desk for his signature.\n\n\"They're only including about a third of the money we recommended,\" Scott said during a news conference Friday. He added, \"While this pandemic has impacted everyone in the state, this crippled small businesses — the folks who provide the jobs that families rely on and generate the revenue we need for the services we provide in state government.\"\n\nThe second phase money, which will also be reviewed by the Legislature, provides assistance for long-term economic recovery, housing and community recovery, broadband expansion, and modernizing Vermont's regulatory programs.\n\nThe money being put toward relief from the pandemic was granted to the state through the federal CARES Act.\n\n__________\n\nNine additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Friday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,119, Vermont Department of Health data showed.\n\nAt the same time, 907 people have recovered from the virus, while 48,634 people have been tested, the data showed.

CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis Pramod Acharya Sugam Pokharel", "Aimee Lewis", "Pramod Acharya", "Sugam Pokharel"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/health/respiratory-viruses-surge-concern/index.html", "title": "Respiratory viruses could surge following the holidays, public health ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThere is growing concern among infectious disease and public health experts that the US could face even more respiratory infections in January.\n\nIt is “highly likely” that respiratory viruses could spread even more following holiday gatherings and New Year’s Eve celebrations, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Monday.\n\n“These are highly contagious viruses – and people have generally put Covid-19 and Covid vaccination behind them. They haven’t been all that attentive to flu. They’re not wearing masks,” Schaffner said. “And if you’re close together with other people, it’s an opportunity for all three of these viruses – flu, Covid, and even RSV – to spread from one person to another. So, we do expect a post-holiday surge in these viruses.”\n\nAt the same time, across the country, there has been a wave of flight cancellations and families stuck at the airport during their holiday travels.\n\nWhen that happens, “People are together for very long periods of time, and they’re not wearing masks, and they’re weary and tired and stressed, and those are occasions where people are more apt to spread the virus,” Schaffner said, adding that his own granddaughter had four flights canceled over the holidays. He recommends masking up while in the airport and on an airplane.\n\n“I think all of us in infectious diseases and public health would recommend that masks are not perfect, but they are an additional layer of protection,” Schaffner said.\n\nSome local health officials are bracing for a possible surge in respiratory illnesses following the winter holidays since that was seen recently following Thanksgiving, Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, said in an email to CNN on Monday.\n\n“After the Thanksgiving holiday period, we saw an uptick in COVID cases by about 58% through the beginning of the Christmas holiday on December 21,” Freeman wrote. “Deaths from COVID also rose during that same time period by about 65%.”\n\nFlu also surged after Thanksgiving, with more than a third of all flu hospitalizations and deaths at the time this season being reported in the first full week of data post-Thanksgiving, and cases also jumped nearly as much.\n\nCurrently, seasonal flu activity remains high in the US, but continues to decline in most parts of the country, according to data published Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Despite improvements, flu may not have peaked yet.\n\nCDC estimates that, so far this season, there have been at least 18 million illnesses, 190,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 deaths from flu.\n\nAs for the current state of Covid-19, increases appear to be relatively mild. Hospitalizations are ticking up in most states, although the overall rate is still just a fraction of what it was during other surges. New hospital admissions have jumped nearly 50% over the past month. Hospitalizations among seniors are nearing the peak from the Delta surge – and rising fast.\n\nFreeman said it is expected that reports after the winter holidays will continue to show increases in Covid-19 cases and deaths, likely attributable to increased travel across the country, large family gatherings, fewer people being up to date on their Covid-19 vaccinations and flu shots, and fewer people following mitigation measures, such as masking and social distancing.\n\n“Air travel is also back to pre-pandemic levels and there are no more restrictions on mask wearing on airplanes or in airports where viruses can easily circulate. Same for bussing,” Freeman said. “Fortunately, we are seeing less RSV in children from our high points earlier in December, so that respiratory illness is stabilizing and becoming less of a part of the triple threat of COVID, flu, and RSV.”\n\nAs health officials brace for a possible surge in respiratory viruses in the coming weeks, it might not be just flu, Covid-19 and RSV that sickens people, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.\n\n“We’re focusing on those three, but there are others out there – the common cold and others,” Benjamin said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOverall, “we should expect more respiratory diseases,” he said. “The best way to reduce your risk is of course to get fully vaccinated for those that which we have a vaccine, so influenza and Covid, with the new bivalent version, are the two most important right now.”\n\nBenjamin added that it also remains important to wash your hands often, wear a mask during holiday travels and stay home when sick.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/16/politics/biden-inflation-reduction-act-signing/index.html", "title": "Biden signs Inflation Reduction Act into law | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed a sweeping $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill into law at the White House on Tuesday – marking a major victory for his administration and the Democratic Party ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nBiden said during a signing ceremony in the State Dining Room that the legislation, called the Inflation Reduction Act, is “one of the most significant laws in our history.”\n\n“With this law, the American people won and the special interests lost,” Biden told an audience of Democratic members of Congress and administration officials. “For a while people doubted whether any of that was going to happen, but we are in a season of substance.”\n\nThe bill signing is the latest celebration of a major legislative accomplishment for Biden this summer, having already held bill signings at the White House last week for a bill aimed at increasing domestic semiconductor production and increasing benefits for veterans affected by toxic burn pits in Afghanistan and Iraq. Biden has also chalked up wins on several other fronts in the last few months, including a bipartisan gun reform bill, ordering the successful mission to kill al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, sending billions in aid to Ukraine to help that nation defend itself against Russia’s invasion and helping Finland and Sweden begin the process of joining NATO.\n\nAnd throughout Tuesday’s White House ceremony, the President underscored the significance of what he sees as his administration’s accomplishments – despite being written off when past negotiations for his legislative agenda failed.\n\n“Today, too often do we confuse noise with substance. Too often we confuse setbacks with defeat. Too often we hand the biggest microphones to the critics and the cynics who delight in declaring failure while those committed to making real progress do the hard work of governing,” the President told the audience. “Making progress in this country, as big and complicated as ours, clearly, is not easy. It’s never been easy. But with unwavering conviction, commitment and patience, progress does come.”\n\nThe act accomplishes several key Biden legislative agenda items, representing the largest climate investment in American history and making major changes to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years. The legislation will reduce the deficit, be paid for through new taxes – including a 15% minimum tax on large corporations and a 1% tax on stock buybacks – and boost the Internal Revenue Service’s ability to collect.\n\nIt will raise over $700 billion in government revenue over 10 years and spend over $430 billion to reduce carbon emissions and extend subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and use the rest of the new revenue to reduce the deficit.\n\nBiden, in his remarks, offered a blistering criticism of congressional Republicans for voting against the bill, turning their opposition into a call to action at the polls.\n\nHe underscored that “every single Republican in Congress voted against this bill.”\n\n“Every single Republican in Congress voted against lowering prescription drug prices, against lowering health care costs, against the fair tax system. Every single Republican – every single one – voted against tackling the climate crisis, against lowering our energy costs, against creating good paying jobs. My fellow Americans, that’s the choice we face – we can protect the already powerful or show the courage to build a future where everybody has an even shot,” he continued.\n\nA series of events focused on the rollout of the new law is expected to take place in the coming weeks. The White House says Biden will soon host a Cabinet meeting focused on the law’s implementation, travel around the country to highlight the bill’s impact on Americans and take part in a post-Labor Day White House celebration focused on the enactment of the bill.\n\nSenate Democrats had long hoped to pass a signature legislative package that would incorporate major agenda items for the party, but struggled for months to reach a deal that gained full support of their caucus.\n\nWest Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin – a major holdout throughout much of Biden’s term in office – played a key role in the legislation, agreeing to a deal that was announced at the end of last month. Schumer and Manchin attended Tuesday’s signing ceremony at the White House.\n\nBiden credited Schumer for the bill’s passage and in a sign of thanks, handed Manchin his pen after signing the bill into law.\n\nManchin later outlined the long, bumpy road to Tuesday’s bill signing, giving Biden “all the credit” for allowing the process to play out on Capitol Hill.\n\n“He knew enough, being a former senator. Sometimes you just gotta let us do what we got to do, and I gave him all the credit for that, and you don’t do something this of this magnitude with him – with the President of the United States – not having involvement on what’s going on,” Manchin told reporters following the bill signing.\n\nManchin also pushed back against a Congressional Budget Office analysis that concluded the new law would have little to no effect on inflation in the short term, telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that “they haven’t always been always right” and that the new law “basically puts confidence in the market.”\n\nAnd he also acknowledged it may take time for Americans to feel the effect of the law, surmising that there may be visible progress in “a year or two or three years … but it’s not going to happen in the next two, three, four months.”\n\nThe West Virginia Democrat also addressed Republicans in Congress, blaming what he said were “politics of the day” for their opposition to the bill.\n\nThe bill passed in the Senate earlier this month after 16 hours of amendment votes – known as a vote-a-rama – and the House of Representatives approved the bill along party lines this past Friday.\n\nThe bill Biden signed on Tuesday does not include several provisions that had been previously proposed as part of the President’s plan, including paid family and sick leave, universal pre-kindergarten, an extension of the enhanced child tax credit, as well as provisions to lower the cost of college.\n\nThe key legislative victory comes as the White House plans a major speech for Biden after Labor Day, which is being billed as a hard-hitting kick off for midterm campaigning.\n\nAides are preparing a speech in which the President will tout tangible, long-talked-about wins like lowering prescription drug costs and gun restrictions while hammering Republicans for being extremists who are in the pocket of special interests.\n\nDemocrats are fighting to maintain their narrow majorities in Congress. And it’s not entirely clear whether voters perceptions about the President or his party will improve in the fall following a summer of dismal polling.\n\nA CNN poll released in late July, for example, found that 75% of Democratic voters want their party to nominate someone other than Biden to the presidency in 2024.\n\nNow, the White House is aiming to make the most of a string of wins – including the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act – as part of a rush to reset his image ahead of the November elections.\n\nBiden on Tuesday appeared to make a campaign pitch focused on his optimism about the future of the country, arguing that he’s been able to deliver long-sought progress to the American people.\n\n“To me, the critical duty of the presidency is to defend what is best about America. … To pursue justice, to ensure fairness and deliver results that create possibilities that all of us can live a life of consequence and prosperity in a nation that’s safe and secure. That’s the job. Fulfilling that pledge to you guides me every single hour of every single day on this job,” Biden said at the signing ceremony.\n\nAmerican presidents, he added, “should be judged, not only by our words but by our deeds, not by our rhetoric but by our actions, not by our promise but by reality. And today is part of an extraordinary story that’s being written by this administration and our brave allies in the Congress.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Donald Judd", "Maegan Vazquez", "Donald Judd"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2020/05/29/as-bars-begin-to-reopen-what-will-austinrsquos-summer-music-scene-look-like/42437791/", "title": "As bars begin to reopen, what will Austin's summer music scene ...", "text": "Deborah Sengupta Stith\n\nAustin is the Live Music Capital of the World, and summer in the city is normally stacked with shows from local artists and touring acts in the city’s bustling entertainment districts, with plenty of opportunities to catch some tunes and sip some brews under the evening sky.\n\nBut this summer’s music calendar is shaping up to be the quietest one we’ve ever seen.\n\n“No decisions have been announced or made” about favorite summer music events like the Austin Symphony Orchestra’s Fourth of July celebration at Vic Mathias Shores, Austin City Limits Radio’s Blues on the Green concert series at Zilker Park or the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the fall, John Nixon from Austin’s Parks and Recreation department said on May 19. The following day, Austin health authority Dr. Mark Escott said he can’t envision large-scale events like the ACL Fest happening through the end of year.\n\nAs far as a summer concert season with touring acts from across the country, there’s “not much of one,” said Graham Williams, owner of Margin Walker Presents, the city’s premiere independent music promotion house.\n\n“You don't just decide you want to be on tour. It takes months to plan it out and you announce three or four months out sometimes and so if you can't really guess what's going to be happening a few months from now, it's pretty tough.”\n\nIn addition, different policies regarding public gatherings from state to state, county to county and city to city make plotting a tour during the pandemic a logistical nightmare.\n\nWilliams said we might see some smaller artists touring in the fall, but most larger acts are pushing their tours to 2021.\n\nOn May 22, Texas bars were allowed to open at 25% capacity and storied honky tonk the Broken Spoke was one of the first music venues to reopen its doors. Owner James M. White said he was “tickled to death to open up the bar.” As of press time, the governor’s guidelines require bar patrons to order from tables, not at the bar, and no dancing is allowed, so White said he would prioritize food, drink and music over boot-scootin’ for the time being.\n\nMost other popular music venues are taking a slower approach, citing the difficulty of covering overhead with the limited capacity and concerns about health and safety.\n\n“Things like nail salons and sit-down dining don’t have the same issues as a crowded bar. If it’s not crowded, we don’t make enough money to cover rent,” said Steve Sternschein owner of the downtown clubs Empire Control Room and Garage and the Parish.\n\nOwners of the Continental Club and the Saxon Pub expressed similar sentiments.\n\nJames Moody, owner of popular Red River touring destination the Mohawk, said his club will probably reopen at some point this summer, but there are no firm plans yet.\n\n“(We) need to prepare a bit more and learn a bit more before we proceed,” he said.\n\nWith the clubs quiet, some artists are exploring alternative venues for their music. A drive-in concert in early May packed a field in South Austin for a show by Ben Ballinger and friends. Other artists are exploring backyard concerts as a socially responsible concert experience.\n\nWilliams said larger scale drive-in shows would be “expensive and complicated” to produce, but we might see other artists hosting similar small events this summer.\n\nThe best way to keep up with what your favorite artist has in the works is to follow them on social media and tune into their live streams, which have become one of the main ways artists are connecting with fans during the pandemic. While you’re there, drop a couple dollars in the virtual tip jar. Musicians are struggling right now and every little bit helps.\n\nWant to hear some live music this summer?

Press\n\nSome towns are racing to rebuild their boardwalks for summer\n\nOthers expect to have only portions of beachfront restored\n\nA few are struggling to recover\n\nASBURY PARK, N.J. — Three months after superstorm Sandy, the once-devastated Jersey Shore is inching its way back with many beach towns promising that they will be ready for the summer season.\n\nSome towns, such as Belmar and Lavallette, expect to have their boardwalks restored by then although not all amenities will be available.\n\nOthers, such as Long Branch and Toms River, will have only portions of their beachfronts restored.\n\nAt the same time, hard-hit towns like Union Beach — which was mostly underwater at one point — struggle to come back. Officials there say the beach and boardwalk may not be ready until the end of the summer at the earliest.\n\nFollowing is a town-by-town list of coastal towns in the two most heavily damaged New Jersey counties — Monmouth and Ocean — and when those municipalities' officials hope to have repairs completed.\n\n1. Asbury Park. The boardwalk and beach will be ready by Memorial Day although sections may open earlier, City Manager Terence Reidy said.\n\nSuperstorm Sandy left significant damage at the southern end of the boardwalk near the casino and the area immediately south of Convention Hall. The city's sewer plant also was damaged. The total recovery cost is about $10 million. So far, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has given the city $700,000, Reidy said.\n\n2. Atlantic Highlands. The municipal harbor sustained about $40 million in damage from Sandy, and the marina is in the process of being rebuilt.\n\nTo date, the borough has spent about $3 million in its cleanup efforts of the harbor. Harbor officials are planning to reopen the facility by April. Shore Casino will open within a month, and the bait shop will reopen for the upcoming fishing season, officials said.\n\nBorough officials estimate that at least 75% of the costs will be federally financed.\n\n3. Bay Head. Borough beaches will be ready by summer, Councilman Brian M. Magory said.\n\nWith all major storm debris collected and sand collection waning, the borough's beachfront is in \"pretty good shape,\" Magory said. No project costs were available.\n\n4. Belmar. The beaches will be open by Memorial Day.\n\nThe borough expects boardwalk repairs to be completed by then as well. The rebuilding of the boardwalk pavilions, restrooms and other structures will not occur until 2014.\n\nThe borough awarded a $6.6 million contract to Epic of Piscataway to reconstruct the boardwalk; overall Belmar borrowed $20 million toward recovery efforts.\n\n5. Brick. Officials are confident that the township beaches will be open by Memorial Day.\n\nThe ocean beach sustained about $4 million in damage from the storm. Overall, the township sustained $43 million in damage. The dune system was destroyed in some areas, and the boardwalk at Brick Beach 3 was damaged, Mayor Stephen Acropolis said.\n\n\"The beaches are going to be open,\" he said. \"The issue is how much of the beach is going to be there. At some points during high tide the water comes right up to the base of the dune.\"\n\n6. Brielle. The waterfront area near the Manasquan River is expected to be open for the summer, borough officials said.\n\nThe estimated cost of cleaning up debris from Sandy is about $400,000. To date, the borough has spent about $375,000.\n\n7. Highlands. Snug Harbor beach will be open for the summer.\n\nThe borough sustained millions of dollars in damage to its municipal property, private homes, businesses and public properties. The borough's infrastructure damages are estimated to be $12 million.\n\nThe estimated amount spent to date on Sandy preparation and cleanup is $2.35 million, Borough Administrator Tim Hill said. The overall assessed ratable losses are estimated to be about $20 million.\n\n8. Island Beach State Park. The park is open from its gate south to Ocean Beach 1 — the northern 3.5 miles of the eight-mile-long park.\n\nThe entire park should be open and operating normally by Memorial Day weekend, said Ray Bukowski, park administrator. State officials do not yet have a cost estimate for repairs.\n\nDamage includes eroded dunes, boardwalks and beaches washed away, and the wreckage of the park marina. It is unclear whether the marina will be ready for the summer.\n\n9. Lavallette. Borough officials expect to have the boardwalk rebuilt by May 24 at a cost of $2 million.\n\nLavallette lost about 70% of its boardwalk to Sandy. The borough plans to award contracts to rebuild lifeguard facilities and wooden dune walkovers and for repairs to various street ends at the beachfront. Beach sand needs to be replenished.\n\nThe cost of these projects has not been fully assessed, but the borough remains optimistic that the work can be completed by Memorial Day weekend.\n\n10. Long Beach Island. Officials here say recovery efforts are progressing well and that about 90% of the island's 580 business will be ready for the summer season.\n\nLong Beach Township, the 18-mile-long island's largest municipality, has spent $15.8 million on storm-related cleanup.\n\n11. Long Branch. The beachfront will be open by Memorial Day; however, a one-mile section of boardwalk lost from Melrose Terrance south to Brighton Avenue will not be repaired by this summer.\n\nPier Village businesses are open; the city is finishing $200,000 in repairs to the steps, access points and bulkhead. The city estimates $7.5 million in damages.\n\nAt the north end, damage to the boardwalk promenade is estimated at $2 million. Repairs will be complete there before Memorial Day.\n\n12. Manasquan. Most beachfront facilities be will ready for Memorial Day weekend, including the one-mile boardwalk promenade, lighting and the public bathrooms at the inlet and Ocean Avenue beaches, borough officials said.\n\nThe borough will use temporary facilities for Brielle Avenue restrooms, and Seawatch facility repairs may not be completed. Ninety percent of the sand has been returned to the beaches.\n\nThe borough lost about $77 million in taxable properties from superstorm Sandy.\n\n13. Mantoloking. Parts of the borough's 2.2 miles of beaches will open this summer, Borough Engineer Robert Mainberger said.\n\nBut all beach access points were lost after superstorm Sandy, portions of the island were washed away near its bridge, and homes had significant damage from the storm and a fire from a gas main break. A cost estimate should be available by March, he said.\n\nAt the moment, though the bridge from the mainland has opened, the borough is still on emergency lockdown, and recovery projects include making side streets safe and completing demolition work. The municipality has a targeted mid-February as a repopulation date.\n\n14. Middletown. Middletown is in the preliminary planning phases of beach and dune restoration projects for the North Middletown, Ideal Beach and Leonardo areas of town, officials said.\n\n15. Ocean Grove. The beach and portions of the boardwalk will be ready by Memorial Day weekend, according to the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association.\n\nThe boardwalk will be fully operational from Bradley Beach to Embury Avenue and from the pavilion to Seaview Avenue. Only temporary beach access will be available from Embury Avenue to the pavilion and from Seaview Avenue to Asbury Park, a temporary walkway is being explored.\n\nTotal damage estimates were not available.\n\n16. Ocean Township. Most of the damage has been cleared, and recovery costs are about $800,000.\n\n17. Oceanport. Roughly 10% of 2,100 homes in the borough were damaged during Sandy; some 100 homes remain unoccupied, officials said.\n\nLocal officials estimate that of the $367 million in damage, the borough will need $360 million to rebuild private homes and $1 million to rebuild six businesses damaged in the storm. Officials indicated that the bill for emergency response from police and the Department of Public Works ran to $600,000.\n\n18. Point Pleasant Beach. Boardwalk repairs are set for completion by May 22; officials say recovery here is progressing well.\n\nDebris pickup is complete and efforts to sift sand are nearly finished. The borough is quoting repairs for the inlet area. Officials approved emergency appropriations of about $3.2 million for restoration and recovery and about $1.7 million for the boardwalk bid.\n\nOfficials estimate total recovery costs at about $7 million.\n\n19. Sandy Hook. Gateway National Recreation Area sustained about $180 million in damage, including severe damage to roads, concessions, utilities, the wastewater treatment plant and the potable water system at Sandy Hook.\n\nAs of last week, 80% of Sandy Hook had electricity, and the park had potable water, according to Pete McCarthy, coordinator of Gateway's Sandy Hook Unit. The goal is to have the park open for the summer with temporary restroom facilities.\n\n\"We're not going to be able to promise something and cast it in bronze,\" Superintendent Linda Canzanelli said.\n\n20. Sea Bright. The beachfront borough was one of the most severely devastated from Sandy with its utility lines ruptured and many of its homes and businesses damaged or destroyed.\n\nAll its beachfront facilities, including restrooms, a small boardwalk, and a bathing pavilion, were destroyed, according to Mayor Dina Long. In addition, many of the private beach clubs were destroyed.\n\nThe borough has been able to clear the storm debris. Utilities have been restored throughout the borough, except to one housing complex, and a quarter of the borough's population has been able to return to a repaired home, Long said.\n\nA handful of businesses have reopened. Long said she expects the beach to open on Memorial Day weekend and added that the borough will bring in temporary facilities.\n\n\"There will be a beach in Sea Bright this summer,\" Long said. She had no estimate of the cost of all the damage to borough property.\n\n21. Sea Girt. The first phase of Operation Comeback, which includes the boardwalk restoration and another project to repair the beach pavilion, is expected to be completed by Memorial Day, Borough Administrator Alan Bunting said.\n\nHe gave a \"high end\" estimate of $675,000 for both of those projects.\n\n22. Seaside Heights. Officials here say recovery efforts are moving along now that the borough made famous in MTV's Jersey Shore awarded a contract to rebuild the boardwalk at a cost of $3.6 million.\n\nThe deadline for that project's completion, May 10, mirrors the date that borough officials hope everything will be ready for visitors. The borough plans to seek bids soon for the repairs of two lifeguard bases and to rebuild two destroyed bathhouses.\n\nThe borough approved a $14.1 million emergency appropriation to cover what it estimates total recovery efforts will cost. Much of Funtown Pier amusement park and its iconic roller coaster were destroyed in the storm. The borough has spent about $4.5 million so far for debris removal and electric utility repairs.\n\nWith Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursement, officials estimate a $500,000 effect on the budget.\n\n23. Seaside Park. The beach and boardwalk will be open by Memorial Day, officials said.\n\nFourteen projects are on the borough's to-do list because of water damage in wake of Sandy. So far contracts have been awarded for six projects, including boardwalk repairs, fixing a flooded public works meeting, and electrical work at the marina.\n\nOfficials plan to have all projects bid by the end of February. They estimate the total cost of recovery efforts at $8 million, but it is not clear how much the borough has spent at this time.\n\n24. Spring Lake. Reconstruction of the two-mile boardwalk will be done before Memorial Day weekend.\n\nThe borough estimates that the total costs of the boardwalk will fall between $3 million and 4 million. Beach badge fees were raised this year to help pay for repairs.\n\n25. Spring Lake Heights. The borough had substantial damage in its parks from downed trees; work to resolve the problem should be completed by early spring, Borough Administrator Jay Delaney said.\n\nThe borough has awarded about $40,000 in contracts for tree removal so far with a final cost expected to be about $75,000.\n\n26. Toms River. The township expects to have a portion of its noncontiguous beachfront on the northern barrier island open by June 1.\n\nThe extent of that portion is contingent on how much of Ocean Avenue and Ocean Terrace, the road along the beach obliterated in the storm, is completed by then. The reconstruction of roadway began last week; however, much of the construction schedule revolves around the replacement of utilities under the roads, which is outside of municipal control.\n\nThe boardwalk will not be ready but should be under construction by the summer, according to municipal officials. Toms River lost two lifeguard houses, projected to cost $1.2 million each. The cost to replace the boardwalk is estimated at $2 million.\n\nThe cost of the wooden dune walkovers to access the beachfront will be about $250,000. The cost to replace the dunes and beach area on publicly owned land will cost about $1.75 million. The cost of reconstructing Ocean Avenue and Ocean Terrace, an integral part of reopening the beach, will cost more than $3 million, officials said.\n\n27. Union Beach. Borough officials say the cost of damage is still being calculated.\n\nSandy left hundreds of families without homes, and businesses and its elementary school were damaged. Fifty homes were swept away, and more than 200 others were damaged beyond repair.\n\nAbout 2,600 homes are in the borough. To date, 70 have been demolished, and 70 more are on the town's list to be taken down. The borough's $8 million budget has lost about $1.3 million of its tax ratables. Additionally, 14 police vehicles, three ambulances and a firetruck were damaged.\n\nBorough engineers are in the process of redesigning the boardwalk and beach area. However, borough officials do not expect the beach and boardwalk to be open until the end of the summer.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2019/05/15/travel-deals-summer-vacation-destinations-sale/3664210002/", "title": "Travel deals: Summer vacation destinations on sale", "text": "Karen Doyle\n\nGoBankingRates.com\n\nSummer may be prime vacation time, but sometimes our budgets don’t cooperate with our summer vacation ideas.

Those included a lack of existing infrastructure and the region’s intense heat in the summer, when World Cup tournaments are traditionally held.\n\nIndeed, the reports even went as far as to label Qatar’s bid as “high risk,” but the country nevertheless triumphed with 14 votes to USA’s eight in the final round of balloting.\n\nAt the time, Qatar promised to make the world “proud of the Middle East” as the first country from the region to host the tournament, while then-FIFA President Sepp Blatter welcomed the prospect of football’s showpiece event going to “new lands.”\n\n“I’m a happy president when we speak of the development of football,” he said.\n\nTwelve years later, Blatter is more critical.\n\nEarlier this month, he told Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger: “Qatar is a mistake … the choice was bad.\n\n“It is too small of a country. Football and the World Cup are too big for it.”\n\nBlatter said FIFA amended the criteria it used to select host countries in 2012 in light of concerns over the working conditions at tournament-related construction sites in Qatar.\n\n“Since then, social considerations and human rights are taken into account,” he said.\n\nWith a population of three million, smaller than that of Connecticut, Qatar has invested billions in its football infrastructure in preparation for the 2022 tournament.\n\nBut questions about just how Qatar won the right to stage the World Cup continue.\n\nAs recently as March 2020, the US Department of Justice alleged that bribes were accepted by top officials as part of the voting process to elect Russia and Qatar as the tournament host for the 2018 and 2022 events – claims Russian officials denied and Qatari officials called “false” in a statement to CNN.\n\nThe DOJ has been investigating allegations of corruption in international soccer, including FIFA, for years. To date, there have been more than two dozen convictions and some cases are ongoing.\n\nA statement from FIFA in April 2020 said it “supports all investigations into alleged acts of criminal wrongdoing regarding either domestic or international football competitions and will continue to provide full cooperation to law enforcement officials investigating such matters.\n\n“FIFA is closely following these investigations and all related developments in the legal processes ongoing in the United States and other parts of the world.\n\n“It is important to point out that FIFA has itself been accorded victim status in the US criminal proceedings and senior FIFA officials are in regular contact with the US Department of Justice.”\n\nFIFA was handed victim status by US prosecutors as they viewed football’s world governing body as having been almost hijacked by a number of corrupt individuals.\n\nHuman rights criticism\n\nQatar’s human rights record has also been in the spotlight ahead of the World Cup, particularly around the welfare of migrant workers.\n\nGiven the minimal infrastructure Qatar had in place at the time it was awarded the hosting rights to the World Cup, seven new stadiums have been erected ahead of the tournament, as well as new hotels and expansions to the country’s airport, rail networks and highways.\n\nThat has placed a reliance on Qatar’s migrant workers, who account for 90% of the total workforce, according to Amnesty International.\n\nSince 2010, many migrant workers have respectively faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation, and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nFIFA president launches explosive tirade against Western critics of Qatar 02:19 - Source: CNN\n\nHowever, Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) said the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” with “significant improvements” made around workers’ rights.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino also told CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies that he has seen “great evolution” in Qatar’s labor reforms, and the International Labor Organization has noted reformes like a non-discriminatory minimum wage that Qatar is the first in the region to adopt.\n\nMeanwhile, Qatar’s state-backed discrimination against LGBTQ people has also been criticized in the years leading up to the World Cup.\n\nSex between men is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison in the country, and a report from Human Rights Watch, published last month, documented cases as recently as September of Qatari security forces arbitrarily arresting LGBT people and subjecting them to “ill-treatment in detention.”\n\nA statement sent to CNN on behalf of the SC said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup, pointing to the fact that the country had, it said, hosted hundreds of international and regional sporting events since being awarded the World Cup in 2010.\n\n“There has never been an issue and every event has been delivered safely,” the statement read.\n\n“Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.”\n\nPerhaps the most obvious sign that this World Cup is different to most has been the decision to stage it in November and December, rather than June and July as is the norm.\n\nSweltering heat during the summer months in Qatar has necessitated the switch, although temperatures are still forecasted to rise above 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) later this week.\n\nOther changes to the organization of the tournament have been rather more last-minute.\n\nOn Friday, FIFA announced that no alcohol would be sold at the stadiums, and then on Monday, captains from seven countries were warned they would receive yellow cards if they wore armbands promoting inclusion and opposing discrimination.\n\nFIFA announced earlier on Monday that it had brought forward its “No Discrimination” campaign – which also has a designated armband – adding that “all 32 captains will have the opportunity to wear this armband” during the World Cup.\n\nFIFA’s equipment regulations state that “for FIFA final competitions, the captain of each team must wear the captain’s armband provided by FIFA.”\n\nTime will tell what the legacy of this World Cup will be, but if the past few days, months, and years are anything to go by, it is likely to be complicated and controversial.", "authors": ["George Ramsay"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/high-school/2018/11/07/red-devils-dedicating-season-coach-p-following-unexpected-death/1906363002/", "title": "Red Devils dedicating season to 'Coach P' following unexpected death", "text": "RICHMOND, Ind. – Asked to list her favorite memories with Casey Pohlenz, Kierra Wright remembers a specific practice, one that at the time wasn’t very fun.\n\nThe Richmond High School girls basketball team, coached by Pohlenz, was having a rough day.\n\n“We were having a terrible day at practice, and he threw the ball at the wall and yelled, ‘Run,’” Wright said. “It was so funny – I mean, at the time it wasn’t very funny.”\n\nPohlenz had a unique way of motivating his players – a way that they didn’t always understand right away. But with time, most learn to appreciate him. Everything he did was to make his players better not only on the basketball court, but off it, too.\n\nAfter 10 years as Richmond's girls basketball coach, Pohlenz died unexpectedly this past summer at the age of 43. Inspired by his legacy, the Red Devils are dedicating their 2018-19 season in his memory.\n\nRELATED:Hundreds gather to remember Richmond girls basketball coach\n\n“We’ve all come together and decided to play together,” said Zoee Woolridge, also a senior on Richmond’s basketball team. “We’re playing really well, freshmen are playing really well, stepping up – it’s going to be a really good season.”\n\nPohlenz, a native of Kansas, arrived in Richmond somewhat by chance. He coached boys basketball two years in Colorado, before meeting someone that put him in touch with the Earlham College Master’s of Arts in Teaching program, located in Richmond.\n\nWhile there, he spent time as an assistant on Richmond’s boys basketball staff before being hired as the girls head coach for the 2008-09 season.\n\nWhen Pohlenz took over, the Red Devils were coming off a 2-18 season, and had won 12 combined games in three seasons. His first winning season came in 2011, when they went 12-9, but he didn’t win any sectional games until the 2014-15 season.\n\nThat year was special. Led by Mackenzie Taylor, now a rising senior at Wright State University, and Destiny Perkins, now a sophomore at Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis, Pohlenz and the Red Devils went 20-5, winning a North Central Conference championship, and a sectional title.\n\n“Sometimes it was hard, because he was really hard on his players and it was hard at times, because people don’t always adjust to that stuff very well,” Woolridge said. “But you knew from the way he did it, it was out of his heart and he just wanted what was best for us.”\n\nWright was no different. At times, she clashed with Pohlenz, but this past offseason, things started to change. As Wright matured, the two developed a relationship, and she was expecting to have her best season under Pohlenz.\n\nIn a way, she was starting to understand his coaching strategies.\n\n“Over the summer, we were working out,” Wright said. “Me and Coach P used to go back and forth every day in practice. We got super close, and I felt real good for this season, I wasn’t going to give him an attitude, our bond was going to be great.”\n\nBut everything changed a day before their first scheduled summer league game.\n\nThe day was June 1, when players reported to an early practice. Pohlenz was nowhere to be found.\n\nIt was uncharacteristic of him to be late. It was unlike him not to show up. Even more surprising, it was unusual for him not to answer phone calls or text messages. One of his assistant coaches went to his house to look for him. Another stayed behind, eventually sending the girls home early.\n\n“That day we had practice and Coach P didn’t show up,” Wright said. “One of the assistant coaches called his phone and then went to his house. Will (Crawford, assistant coach) was here, he was like, practice is over, go home. Will called (senior) Kelsey Mullins into the coach’s office and was like, ‘It’s not looking good, we need to figure out what’s wrong with Coach P.’\n\n“I got home and I was stressing. I got a phone call from Molly Morken, she lives down the street from Coach P, and she called me, she was crying, she was like, ‘I think Coach P passed away.’”\n\nThe rest of the day was a blur for Wright. Sophomore Alayha Allen lives next door, so she was the first person Wright went to.\n\n“She collapsed in my arms,\" Wright recalled.\n\nWoolridge remembers breaking down when she heard the news.\n\n“We had to come back to the high school later on for the news and it was very bad when we all came back, it was just so emotional,” Woolridge said. \"It was a really big loss for a lot of us.”\n\nRichmond canceled its first summer league game. The rest of the season was in question.\n\nBut for the players themselves? There was never any doubt they would play the season out.\n\n“We didn’t go to that (first game), because it was obviously too soon,” Wright said. “But they asked us before we even finished, ‘Do you want to do this?’ And everyone as like, ‘Yeah, we have to. For Coach P, it’s a must.”\n\nThe only real question was who would lead them for the rest of the summer.\n\nThat question, too, was answered quickly.\n\nShane Hillard, a longtime friend, and former assistant under Pohlenz stepped in and offered to lead the girls until Richmond found a new coach. The coaching search was really over before it started, and Hillard was named Richmond's new head coach on June 27.\n\nHillard had spent five years as Pohlenz’s assistant, including when the current seniors were freshmen. Long before then, he worked as a volunteer at the Boys and Girls Club, and was well-known throughout the community.\n\n“We all were hoping before we found out who the coach was it would be Shane,” Woolridge said. “When we did find out it was, it was a big relief.”\n\nHillard, a 1992 graduate of Richmond High School, is tasked not only with leading the girls on the court, but helping them grieve when they need to.\n\nThey help him grieve about as much as he helps them.\n\n“It’s emotional at times, and we understand that as a coaching staff – there’s sometimes when it’s emotional for us,” Hillard said. “We just got to fight through it and make sure we get them through it and do things the right way for them and let them get through it on their own time, at their own pace, their own way. Everyone deals with grief differently. We deal with the girls differently, with whatever helps them get through the situation.”\n\nEvery now and then, the girls need to grieve. Every time something significant happens, they’re it’s another “first without Coach P.\"\n\n“We played our first game without him the other night; when the season started, we had our first practice without him, so everything is a step as you go through it,” Hillard said. “We’re just trying to get through it.”\n\nBut likely nothing will be as significant as the first time the Red Devils get a win this season.\n\nPohlenz ended the 2017-18 season with a career record of 99 wins, 126 losses. Were it not for a few cancelations, he could’ve celebrated his 100th career victory last season.\n\nThe Red Devils will celebrate it for him, whenever they get their first win this season.\n\n“Once we do get our first win, we will say that is his 100th win,” Woolridge said. “This whole season is for Coach P.”\n\nJesus Jimenez is a sports reporter for the Palladium-Item.

Labor Day was originally designed to honor workers as part of the American organized labor movement.\n\nWhen Labor Day started\n\nLabor Day was first celebrated unofficially by labor activists and individual states in the late 1800s, according to the US Department of Labor. New York was the first state to introduce a bill recognizing Labor Day, but Oregon was the first to actually codify it into law in 1887. Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York had followed suit by the end of 1887.\n\nJoshua Freeman, a labor historian and professor emeritus at the City University of New York, tells CNN that the holiday developed as unions were beginning to strengthen again after the 1870s recession.\n\nIn New York City, two events converged that contributed to the formation of Labor Day, Freeman says. First, the now-defunct Central Labor Union was formed as a “umbrella body” for unions across trades and ethnic groups. Additionally, the Knights of Labor, then the largest national labor convention, held a convention in the city, complete with a large parade. But the parade fell on a Tuesday at the start of September – and many workers were unable to attend.\n\nThe convention was a huge success, and unions around the country started holding their own labor celebrations at the start of September, usually on the first Monday of the month.\n\nAt the beginning, “it was a somewhat daring move to participate, because you could get yourself fired,” Freedman said. But over time, states began to recognize the holiday, and it became more common for employers to give their employees the day off.\n\nIt wasn’t until June 28, 1894 that Congress passed an act naming the first day of September a legal holiday called Labor Day.\n\nFreeman says that earlier that year, President Grover Cleveland sent in the military to squash the Pullman railway strike. Cleveland pushed through legislation to recognize Labor Day just days after the strike ended, in a “gesture towards organized labor,” Freeman said.\n\nA marching band at the Labor Day Parade in Silverton, Colorado, in September 1940. Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nWhat Labor Day means\n\nAt the time Labor Day was formed, unions were fighting for “very specific improvements in their working conditions,” Freeman said. Workers were fighting hard for the eight-hour work day most workers enjoy today. And Labor Day was an opportunity for them to come together to discuss their priorities – and for the country to acknowledge the contributions workers make to society.\n\nBut there was also a more radical political thread to the Labor Day celebration, Freeman says. The Knights of Labor were exploring the idea that “what we call the capitalist or industrial system was fundamentally exploitative,” he said. “It introduced kind of inequities and inequalities, not just in wealth, but also in power. So they wanted a greater say in society for working people.”\n\n“Back when Labor Day began, there were a lot of voices that were fundamentally challenging this emerging system,” Freeman added. Labor leaders at the time advocated for alternatives to the “capitalist wage system,” like collective ownership of corporations or socialism.\n\nTravelers queue up at the south security checkpoint in Denver International Airport as the Labor Day holiday approaches,on Tuesday, August. 30, 2022. David Zalubowski/AP\n\nThe evolution of Labor Day\n\nOver time, the radical politics around Labor Day became tempered. Around the world, most countries honor workers with a holiday called May Day, celebrated on May 1, which also has its origins in the late 19th century and the fight for the eight-hour work day. For a long time, Freeman says, Americans celebrated both May Day and Labor Day.\n\nBut eventually, Labor Day began to be seen as the more “moderate” of the two holidays, in comparison to May Day, which was originally established by the Marxist International Socialist Congress.\n\n“By the turn of the 20th century, calls for transforming American life, they pretty much disappear from Labor Day,” Freeman said. “As more and more employers began to give all their workers the day off, it became less associated specifically with unions.”\n\nAfter World War II, Labor Day celebrations had a brief revival, especially in cities like Detroit and New York City. But by the 60s and 70s, they had tapered off again.\n\n“I think most people just think of as the end of summer holiday,” Freeman said. “It’s not really associated with its origins that much.”\n\nCan you wear white after Labor Day?\n\nYou might have heard the outdated rule that you shouldn’t wear white after Labor Day.\n\nBut don’t worry: There’s no fashion police out there waiting to see if you don a white shirt in September. And the idea actually has a pretty problematic origin.\n\nThe rule was one of many 19th century style customs used to distinguish the upper and middle classes, according to Valerie Steele, a fashion historian and director of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology.\n\n“As you got more and more sort of ordinary people, whether middle class or lower middle class, being able to have enough money to try to dress fashionably, then there become more rules so that the more upper class people can say ‘yes, but you’re doing it wrong,’” Steele told CNN.\n\nWhite was tied to summer vacations – a privilege only few could afford. Labor Day represented the “reentry” into city life and the retirement of white summer clothes after a summer of leisure for the upper classes, Steele says.\n\nBut the arbitrary rule all but disappeared during the 1970s, Steele says. The 1960s “Youthquake” allowed young people to challenge old stylistic norms, including the Labor Day rule.\n\n“It was part of a much wider anti-fashion movement,” said Steele.", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/media/2022/08/25/when-is-summer-over-in-arizona/7880247001/", "title": "When does summer end in Arizona?

Pumpkin spice is no longer months too early!\n\nYeah, well. Not in Arizona.\n\nThe one-two punch of early school starts and blistering heat that lasts till October means Labor Day in Arizona is just, well, another Monday. A Monday most people don’t have to work, at least.\n\nBut it’s not the unofficial end of anything. In fact it’s more like the unofficial middle — the middle of summer, the longest slog.

Don't mind our searing heat\n\nI understand that Labor Day is a genuine holiday, established to honor the labor movement in the United States. That’s important and deserves recognition.\n\nBut in the manner of Presidents Day becoming synonymous with sales on mattresses, Labor Day has become the cookout holiday, the last gasp of grilling outdoors and throwing the Frisbee around while music plays on the patio or whatever.\n\nEVERYWHERE BUT HERE.\n\nWell, it’s pretty hot in Death Valley, too. But you know what I mean — Arizona is hot and it’s going to stay hot until you’ve taken down your Halloween decorations. We’ll resume patio life sometime in early November.\n\nLabor Day here is basically a demented Groundhog Day here, except it’s the same thing every year: six more weeks of summer.\n\nI grew up in Virginia. At that time, like most states back East, school didn’t start until the Tuesday after Labor Day. Thus, the unofficial end of summer. (If you played football, alas, the end of summer came on Aug. 10, the beginning of two-a-day practices. This was also the end of happiness in any form.)\n\nIt was an easy marker on the calendar. And a cookout, even if it has nothing to do with the intention of the holiday, was always a sure bet. Hot dogs, hamburgers and radio-station countdowns were the staples.\n\nBarf alert:Hot dog-flavored candy? Why Tailgate Candy Corn tastes like a mistake\n\nBut if I have to listen to the top-500-classic-rock-songs-of-all-time countdown to find out, yawn, whether this year’s No. 1 is “Stairway to Heaven” or “Free Bird” — and no one is saying I do have to listen, but if it’s right there … — I would at least like to be outside at a cookout.\n\nBy which I mean a cookout where you can be outside for more than 3 minutes before your skin starts to turn to withered parchment.\n\nYeah, yeah, I also understand that people in Arizona do have Labor Day cookouts. People with pools. And lots and lots of coolers and ice. Misters are a nice touch, as well. But it’s not the same.\n\nLife, death and relish:You can't go home again, but some flavors will get you close\n\nHalloween is the real end of summer in Arizona\n\nI mentioned Halloween. I’ve lived in Arizona for a long time, and as long as I’ve been here, that’s been our real Labor Day, at least in terms of signaling the end of summer. Although I should also point out that when my children were little there were years when we had to make last-minute costume changes because it was too hot to wear the original item.\n\nThere are people who will tell you that they don’t mind Arizona's endless scorching summers because the mild winters more than make up for it. These people are liars. Or at best, disingenuous.

They have state park passes, which ordinarily would have gotten them in. But by mid-morning the park had closed, albeit temporarily, according to the state park service's Facebook page. Closing early on high-traffic days is one of many precautions the state park system has employed to slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\nTwinkles snoozed in a stroller as the Hilgarts paused for a snack under a pavilion on the Seaside Park boardwalk. Twinkles has bad hips, and Mary Hilgart said bringing her into ocean waves has helped. \"And now, there's nowhere that I can bring my dog,\" she said.\n\nShore towns in New Jersey do not generally allow dogs on beaches during the summer season, but the dates vary from town to town. Even in Island Beach State Park, dogs are only allowed south of the designated ocean swimming areas during the summer, and must be on a leash, according to the parks service's website.\n\nMore: Quieter beaches at the Jersey Shore\n\nLike a few other towns in Ocean County and several more in Monmouth, Seaside Park is extending its beach staffing into September — and will also require badges on September weekends.\n\nThe Hilgarts hadn't thought much about the extension of beach fees until a reporter broached the subject. \"You know,\" Mary Hilgart said, \"the folks in New Jersey are known throughout the nation for paying the most taxes. Those taxes could cover state access to beaches ... you could surely charge those that are not from New Jersey and let people from New Jersey have access to our land.\"\n\nIn many ways this Labor Day weekend, with its postcard-perfect weather, has been the same as any other. Traffic slowed to a standstill on Route 35 the entire length of the Barnegat Peninsula, from Berkeley Township to Bay Head where it jukes away from the shoreline. Families with coolers and infants in arms mingled with packs of teenagers and young adults catching a few last rays before the weekend ends. Motorcycles and beach cruisers coasted languidly up and down oceanfront highways and avenues.\n\nMore: Check out these beaches at the southern end of the Shore\n\nBut in many other ways the specter of COVID-19 hung like an invisible rain cloud over what would ordinarily be the summer's swan song. Lines of diners and shoppers snaked at 6-foot intervals out the doors of restaurants and Wawas. Though certainly not ubiquitous, face masks are still commonplace, even outdoors on a windy weekend.\n\n\"I was on Long Beach Island earlier this summer and just super-impressed with how businesses were operating,\" said Ann Hedges, a Pennsylvania resident who visited Seaside Park for the day Sunday with her boyfriend Ben Danson. \"And we were just waiting outside for a sandwich, we stopped at White Oak Market, and they had a system.\"\n\nDanson said the pair would have tried to get away for a week in ordinary times, but in the summer of COVID-19, day trips were all they could manage. He said the extension of beach fees wouldn't mean much to them unless they decided to make another day trip.\n\nBoth Danson and Hedges have to make adjustments for the new school year, as each has a school-age child, and Danson is a teacher. Hedges said they haven't been able to visit her family in Maine since August 2019.\n\nMore: Which districts are reopening in person?\n\nThe Hilgarts' children are grown, but they have teacher friends and wondered how the new school year would turn out.\n\n\"Where's the road map?\" Mary Hilgart wondered. \"Where's the money for the additional safety precautions?\"\n\nArt Wright, a Maryland resident staying with his brother at the Shore, also had sympathy for teachers. He also grabbed some fresh air along the Seaside Park boardwalk Sunday.\n\n\"Teachers do a lot in a normal year to prepare for the year and run their classes,\" he said. \"To deal with these radically changing circumstances from week to week ... my heart goes out to them.\"\n\nWright said he also knows plenty of teachers, including relatives that teach here in New Jersey.\n\n\"I hear the stories and the situation varies a lot depending upon what district you're teaching,\" he said. \"It does sound like an awful lot of burden has been put on teachers' backs.\"\n\nMary Hilgart welcomed the return of indoor dining. She said lost her in pharmaceutical research and development job in April when her company reorganized. With indoor dining back up and running, she said she looks forward to visiting cafes to work on job applications.\n\n\"I'm grateful for what we have,\" she said.\n\nAlex N.

And like every other summer season, your sprint to Monday – Labor Day – seemed a blur.\n\nFor many, Labor Day is all about capturing that last blast at the beach, backyard barbecues, school retail bonanzas and the grudging realization that sun-soaked play days are no more.\n\nBut the day has a deeper meaning and marks a pivotal moment in U.S. labor history — and it had a pretty violent start.\n\nIn the late 1800s, the state of labor was grim as U.S. workers toiled under bleak conditions: 12 or more hour workdays; hazardous work environments; meager pay. Children, some as young as 5, were often fixtures at plants and factories.\n\nThe dismal livelihoods fueled the formation of the country’s first labor unions, which began to organize strikes and protests and pushed employers for better hours and pay. Many of the rallies turned violent.\n\nOn Sept. 5, 1882 — a Tuesday — 10,000 workers took unpaid time off to march in a parade from City Hall to Union Square in New York City as a tribute to American workers. Organized by New York’s Central Labor Union, It was the country’s first unofficial Labor Day parade. Three years later, some city ordinances marked the first government recognition, and legislation soon followed in a number of states.\n\nThen came May 11, 1894, and a strike that shook an Illinois town founded by George Pullman, an engineer and industrialist who created the railroad sleeping car.

The strike and boycott against trains triggered a nationwide transportation nightmare for freight and passenger traffic.\n\nAt its peak, the strike involved about 250,000 workers in more than 25 states. Riots broke out in many cities; President Grover Cleveland called in Army troops to break the strikers; more than a dozen people were killed in the unrest.\n\nAfter the turbulence, Congress, at the urging of Cleveland in an overture to the labor movement, passed an act on June 28, 1894, making the first Monday in September “Labor Day.” It was now a legal holiday.\n\nIn the coming decades, the day took root in American culture as the \"unofficial end of summer\" and is marked by parades, picnics and family/friend time.

A batch of lobster tails on the grill is so visually appealing, your guests will hover around the grill.\n\nLobster tails and other shellfish cook quickly on the grill, just follow a few tips and techniques so you don't overcook it. Nobody wants tough chewy lobster.\n\nGrilling lobster tails is easier than a whole lobster. Generally, when you buy the tails, they are all similar in size. Their smaller size make it easier to move each tail around on the grill. And you can, depending on the size of your grill, cook many of them at the same time.\n\nRead more:\n\nHere's how to make the perfect lobster roll\n\nMidsummer appetizers your guests will love\n\nYou can grill lobster tails whole or cut them in half. Many sources recommend to precooking them a few minutes before grilling, but it’s purely optional. If you plan on cutting them in half lengthwise, precooking is a good idea because it helps soften the shell, making it easier to cut.\n\nTo precook, place the whole tail in boiling water for about 2 minutes. Remove and place the tails on a work surface back side down. Use kitchen shears to cut through the soft underbelly and through the meat and shell. A good chef’s knife will work as well.\n\nIf you want to get fancy, you can cut a slit in the tail starting at the top, cutting just to about ½-inch from the tail fins. Loosen the meat from the shell and prop it up on top of the shell.\n\nTo grill, preheat the grill to a low medium, about 350 degrees. Grill lobster tails over direct heat whether you cut them in half or not. If the heat is too high, you run the risk of the meat cooking way too quickly and it can turn tough. Too high heat also can char the shells too much and they won’t look pretty.\n\nMost grocery stores sell previously frozen lobster tails. Try to cook them the same day you buy them. This summer 4-5 ounce (shell and all) previously frozen cold-water lobster tails averaged $5-$6 each at a local Kroger store. At that weight, you should end up with a good 2½ ounces of actual cooked meat.\n\nWarm-water lobster tails are bigger, so keep in mind they will take longer to cook.\n\nWhile lobster loves melted butter, keep in mind it will pack on the fat and calories. If you don’t dip or douse the lobster with melted butter, it’s a low-fat and -calorie food with less than 1 gram of fat for 3 ounces cooked meat. And the calories come in under 100 for 3 ounces.\n\nAppetizers: Pull-apart Lobster Rolls\n\nTry these tips for lobster tail grilling ease.\n\nBrine: This is optional, but it will add moisture and plump them up. Place 8 whole tails in 16 cups of water with ½ cup kosher salt and ½ cup sugar stirred in. Set in the refrigerator for 2 hours before grilling. Remove from brine, and rinse the tails well.\n\nCut: if grilling whole tails, use scissors to cut a slit along the back. Pry the shell open a bit so enough so you can baste the meat with melted butter, if using.\n\nSkewer: Run an 8-inch or longer metal or wooden skewer lengthwise through the tail. The skewer prevents them from curling whether it’s a whole tail or half.\n\nGrill: Place tails on the grill, with cut side facing for whole tails. For tail halves, place them cut side down first on a clean and well-oiled grill for about 2 minutes. If you par-cooked the lobster tails, figure about 3-4 minutes on the grill. If you didn’t par-cook, allow about 5-6 minutes depending on the size.\n\nBaste: To keep meat moist, melt some butter and season with fresh herbs. Baste the exposed lobster flesh with butter. Keep in mind delicate herbs like basil and tarragon lend slight nuances to lobster. Herbs like rosemary and thyme can be a bit strong. You can also mix in some garlic and chopped chives. Make extra butter to serve on the side if you like.\n\n\n\nGrilled Lobster Tails with Confetti Relish\n\n\n\nServes: 4 / Prep time: 35 minutes / Total time: 45 minutes\n\nNonstick cooking spray\n\n¼ cup thinly sliced green onions\n\n2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots or red onion\n\n2 to 4 tablespoons diced yellow bell pepper\n\n2 to 4 tablespoons diced orange bell pepper\n\n2 to 4 tablespoons diced red bell pepper\n\n¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n\n⅛ teaspoon salt\n\n⅛ teaspoon sugar\n\n1 teaspoon red wine vinegar\n\n1 teaspoon olive oil\n\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened\n\n1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme\n\n2 small garlic cloves, minced\n\n4 (6-ounce) lobster tails in shells\n\n4 cups watercress, trimmed\n\nCoat a grill rack with cooking spray.

What experts say ...", "text": "Three days off, the unofficial end of summer, and surging cases of COVID-19 may leave Iowans wondering — what's the safest way to Labor Day?\n\nVaccination status, setting, and crowd size all influence the answer, medical experts said. Here's how health experts break it down.\n\n'Make smart decisions.' Polk County warns of delta variant infections\n\nPolk County is \"very much in trouble right now\" due to high rates of COVID-19, health department spokesperson Nola Aigner Davis said. In August, there were more than four times the number of COVID-19 cases than there were in July — 4,358 compared to 958.\n\nThe latest:Children make up nearly a quarter of new COVID-19 cases in Iowa\n\nPolk County, like almost all of the state and almost all of the country, is rated as having high transmission rates of the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Aigner Davis doesn't recommend Labor Day gatherings outside of households or close family, and people at higher risk for the severe cases of COVID-19 should be extra cautious.\n\n\"We really want people to make smart decisions,\" Aigner Davis said. \"We've seen throughout the whole entire pandemic, when there is a holiday weekend, people forget there is a virus. Well, this virus doesn't forget you.\"\n\nA surge in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have followed.\n\n\"This is something we cannot keep doing to our community, to our hospitals,\" she said.\n\nCDC: People unvaccinated against COVID shouldn't travel for Labor Day\n\nDon't travel if you're unvaccinated, and if you are, weigh the risks, federal health officials said.\n\n\"People who are fully vaccinated, and who are wearing masks can travel, although given where we are with disease transmission right now, we would say that people need to take their own these risks into their own consideration as they think about traveling,\" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Wallensky said during a White House COVID-19 briefing earlier this week. \"First and foremost, if you are unvaccinated, we would recommend not traveling.\"\n\nKnow before you go:Bublé, Taylor, Incubus to require proof of COVID vaccination, for Des Moines concerts\n\nPeople should also be cognizant of the different strains of the virus floating around and that they may bring it back with them, said Christine Petersen, director of the Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the University of Iowa.\n\n\"We do understand holidays are a time where we want to see loved ones,\" Petersen said. \"So if everyone is vaccinated, and people are careful, short range travel is fine and can be something to do with caution. Going to other places with much higher rates of infection, or infection with different types of virus is probably not advised.\"\n\nSilver lining to a COVID-safe Labor Day? It's shaping up to be 'A lovely weekend to be outside'\n\nWhile COVID-19 might cast a metaphorical cloud over Labor Day, there shouldn't be many literal ones in the sky this holiday.\n\nThe National Weather Service is predicting a sunny 82-degree day — perfect for getting together outdoors.\n\n\"Thankfully, it's not a disgusting 95 degrees and 100% humidity,\" Petersen said. \"It looks like we might have a lovely weekend to be outside. The benefits of sunlight and fresh air when it comes to this pandemic is huge. If you're in a small group of people you know, and everybody is vaccinated, the chance you're going to transmit outdoors is next to nothing.\"\n\nAigner Davis warned that people should still keep a safe distance apart to avoid their respiratory droplets. She encouraged masks in crowds even when outdoors.\n\nThings to do::Renaissance Faire and dozens of other things to do in Des Moines, central Iowa\n\n\"Really, make smart decisions,\" Aigner Davis said. \"Like we always say, you may trust the person you're with, but we don't know where that person has been. We don't know who they've come into contact with at work, at school, running errands.\"\n\nBoth Aigner Davis and Petersen encouraged everyone to get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon they're able. It's free and widely available and dramatically reduces the chances of getting severely ill from COVID-19 and transmitting it. It would also be in the spirit of the holiday, and a favor to the health care workers who are stretched to their brink, Petersen said.\n\n\"This is a national holiday to celebrate the work everyone is doing, and we have health care professionals who have been working night and day for almost two years to keep our country safe,\" Petersen said.\n\nNick Coltrain is a politics and data reporter for the Register.

Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nThe first Monday of September—which falls on September 7th this year—is Labor Day. For many Americans, that usually means a long holiday weekend full of traveling, camping trips, and backyard barbecues. And while all of those activities are still possible in 2020, they'll likely look a lot different this year amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nCookouts and gatherings, for instance, will involve face masks and social distancing, while travel plans will lean towards road trips and nature getaways. According to new Airbnb data, half of all the site's bookings in the month of August were for locations within 300 miles of a person's home and bookings in remote areas for cabins and barns more than doubled compared to last Labor Day.\n\nRegardless of whether you're traveling or staying local this holiday weekend, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with health experts, urge Americans to be smart—and safe—if you're going to be around others. \"The more an individual interacts with people he or she doesn’t live with and the closer and longer each interaction is, the higher the risk is of getting infected with the virus that causes COVID-19,\" the CDC reminds people.\n\nBelow is everything you need to know to celebrate the unofficial end of summer during the pandemic. Whether you're hitting the road or hosting a cookout for friends and family, these expert tips will help you and your loved ones stay safe and healthy over the long weekend.\n\nHow to stay safe if you're traveling\n\nHaving an extra day (or more) off work makes traveling—whether driving or flying—a popular Labor Day weekend activity. But is it safe to travel during the COVID-19 pandemic? \"Due to widespread COVID-19 in the US, traveling will have some inherent risks,\" Henry Wu, MD, director of Emory’s TravelWell Center in Atlanta, explains. \"Travelers should weigh the importance of their travel against personal risk factors for severe illness (age, other medical problems, etc.), and their ability to practice preventative measures, including routine face coverings, social distancing, and hand hygiene.\" That being said, if you are traveling, make sure you take the necessary precautions and follow guidelines from the CDC.\n\nAlong with wearing a face mask while you're traveling to protect both yourself and those around you, the CDC says to use hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol frequently (or better yet, wash your hands) and carry disinfecting wipes for sanitizing high-touch spots like door handles or your airplane seat and tray table. If you're driving, consider packing your own food and beverages to limit the number of places you have to stop and the number of people you have to interact with. If you're flying, keep your mask on for the duration of your flight, sit in a seat that's socially-distanced from other passengers if you can, and avoid crowded areas in the airport.\n\nAs for which face masks are best, our experts put some of the most popular masks to the test and found the Athleta masks to be the best in terms of comfort and breathability. However, there are hundreds of other retailers selling cloth face coverings online right now, too.\n\nHow to stay safe during social gatherings\n\nIf you're hosting a cookout or party at home, the CDC has provided a set of guidelines for gatherings during the pandemic. Host the get-together outside whenever possible (or in a well-ventilated area) and limit the guest list to a select number of family and friends. Ask your guests to wear masks for the entirety of the event and to practice social distancing by standing or sitting six feet apart.\n\nAs for the food setup, the CDC recommends using single-serve options (like packaged snacks or individual condiment packs) or designating one person to be the cook/server so you don't have multiple people sharing utensils or handling food. Disinfect commonly touched surfaces (tables, door knobs, etc.) frequently and consider using disposable plates and utensils, as well, to help prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nNot comfortable traveling anywhere or hosting a cookout? You can still celebrate the holiday with a staycation in your own backyard. After all, the CDC says, \"Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.\"\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

But this year, the holiday weekend kicking off Friday potentially represents something else: a new beginning.\n\nStarting 6 a.m. Friday, restaurants, breweries and distilleries can open for indoor service at 25% capacity, with tables six feet apart and group dining capped at eight people, except for immediate family, Gov. Phil Murphy announced on Monday.\n\nNJ INDOOR DINING: Everything you need to know about this weekend's re-opening\n\nSurfaces such as menus and chairs must be disinfected, and restaurants are required to conduct daily staff health screenings. Diners have to wear masks when not seated, as well as when they are ordering and waiting for their food, and can only order from their seats.\n\nIt's the first time customers will be able to enjoy a drink and a meal inside since the COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally disrupted all of our lives in mid-March.\n\n\"I think we all know that September is the nicest month of the year, yet because of the school year, it gets cut off,\" said Tim McLoone, who owns three restaurants on the Asbury Park boardwalk. \"For so many years, we would struggle in August with pop-up thunderstorms, weekends getting washed out, then September's gorgeous.\n\n\"If we could all, in our industry, trade June for September, we'd do it in an heartbeat, and even into October,\" he said. \"This is a great bonus to get the opportunity to extend into September.\"\n\nMcLoone thinks the city may be busier this fall because \"a lot of people have moved here who were seasonal from New York and are now down the Shore. They're in no hurry to get back.\n\n\"I think that people have more freedom of movement since thy’re not chained to their desks and the train and the bus,\" he said. \"They have freedom to go. It's amazing to us, the demand.\"\n\n\"The writing is sort of on the wall that 'local summer' may be a thing of the past, right?\" said Jeff Plate, founder and CEO of Asbury Park Brewery.\n\nThis weekend's heralded return of indoor dining, the city's decision to extend the lifeguarded beach season through September and noted shifts in local real estate have combined to call the idea of \"local summer\" — where year-round residents enjoy a city relatively free of tourists — into question.\n\n\"You certainly do get the impression that a lot people that would come to (the) Jersey Shore and go home are sticking around,\" said Plate. \"So it's going to be interesting to see what happens in those winter months, and I think that it really can only be good for the city. The more people the better, the more business. You know, we lost a lot of opportunities at making good revenue in May and June, so hopefully we can make up for it in October if we have one of those great Octobers like we've had the past few years.\"\n\nMany business owners in the wake of Murphy's announcement said they are now facing fresh problems, just days before a holiday weekend.\n\n“I’m glad we’re finally able to start opening in limited capacity but again, he announced it like Monday that we can open on Friday, so that’s not ... really a notice for a restaurant,\" said Joe Cole, general manager of Georgie's Bar. \"We’re only a bar with a small kitchen, so for a huge restaurant now they’ve got to prepare. They’ve got to bring staff back.\"\n\nCiting Murphy's June 29 decision to call off indoor dining days before its expected July 2 resumption, Cole said he remains skeptical and added that Georgie's — a hotspot and community hub for the city's LGBTQ community for 20 years — will continue to offer only outdoor service for at least the next week or two.\n\n“With everything he was saying, that’s just like a lot to deal with right now,\" Cole said. \"And it being on top of a Labor Day weekend in the middle of the pandemic still, we’re just going to stick to outside. We’re going to give it a chance, see how other businesses (and) how the community react, because there are already negative people saying negative stuff about it. So I’m just going to step back a minute and see how everybody else takes it.”\n\n“For the industry’s sake, I am very happy (Murphy) is moving forward,” said restaurateur Marilyn Schlossbach on Monday. “For the logistics sake of this, (it’s) not the best weekend to scramble for this.”\n\nSchlossbach is the executive chef and owner of the Marilyn Schlossbach Group, whose Asbury Park Boardwalk properties include Langosta Lounge, Pop’s Garage and the Asbury Park Yacht Club. Those locations, as well as Schlossbach properties in Long Branch and Normandy Beach, will open for indoor dining in a very limited capacity starting Friday.\n\n“We’re just trying to figure out right now how we’re going to staff it with no employees,” she said. “Teachers are going back to school, kids are going back to school, kids are quarantining for college. It’s been the M.O. of this whole summer: Hurry up and wait, and then wait and hurry up.”\n\nSchlossbach's three Asbury Park destinations look out onto the city's incredibly popular beaches, which the local government recently decided will remain staffed by lifeguards and badge checkers through Sept. 30.\n\n\"Anytime there's more people in town, it's good for business,\" said Joe Maggio, longtime owner of Frank's Deli & Restaurant on Main Street. He recalled years past when boat, car and ceramics shows in the off-season would bring people to the city. \"Now, we do what we can do.\"\n\nAsbury Park Deputy Mayor Amy Quinn previously told The Asbury Park Press that continuing to staff the beach and charge for beach access throughout September is a necessity because of the crowds that are expected to continue visiting as COVID-19-related restrictions limit other entertainment and activity options.\n\n“Charging for beach badges, in September, to me, is crazy,\" Schlossbach said. \"I don’t know what that’s all about.

And while Murphy's announcement also cleared the way for indoor performance venues to reopen with restrictions, Plate said it's unclear if the brewery, which has earned a following by hosting punk, underground rock and comedy shows in recent years, is clear to resume live entertainment.\n\n“We want to provide that experience to people if we’re able to do it in a meaningful and also a safe way,\" Plate said. \"Certainly it’s something that we add to the rich tapestry of Asbury Park where we fill this niche with a certain kind of music and a certain kind of vibe.”\n\nMovie theaters can open at 25% capacity up to 150 people starting Friday, but the ShowRoom Cinema in Asbury Park will remain dark for the time being.\n\nAfter being closed for nearly six months there are no movies booked, facilities need to be cleaned and inspected, COVID-19 safety materials and concessions need to be purchased and staff needs to be contacted about returning to work, co-owner Michael Sodano said.\n\nThe ShowRoom's second location, located south of Asbury Park on Main Street in Bradley Beach, has seating for 315 under normal circumstances — meaning they could seat 78 guests per showing, but will still need weeks to prepare before re-opening.\n\nBut the original ShowRoom on Cookman Avenue in Asbury Park certainly won't be ready to be open by Friday, as its intimate scale makes opening for one-quarter maximum capacity impractical; of the three screening rooms in their Asbury Park location, the largest has 66 seats, meaning they could seat 16 people at most per showing.\n\n\"That's not going to possible at this point,\" Sodano said.\n\nAlex Biese has been writing about art, entertainment, culture and news on a local and national level for more than 15 years.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/03"}]}

While it was Corey Conners on Saturday, on Sunday's final round it was Hovland, who was just one stroke back of Koepka when his shot disappeared into the sod. Hovland ended up with a double bogey, removing any drama from this year's second major tournament.\n\nKoepka entered Sunday with a one-stroke lead over Hovland and Conners after he birdied three of the final seven holes of the third round Saturday — a day that challenged players with persistent rain and soggy conditions.\n\nHovland finished in a tie for second place with Scottie Scheffler, whose 5-under helped him to a 7-under for the tournament. Scheffler will no doubt be wondering what could have been had he not shot a 3-over 73 on Saturday.\n\nOdds boost:Add +1000 on golfer of your choice to win any tournament\n\nAfter rain pelted the Oak Hill course all of Saturday, conditions were the best they have been all tournament Sunday, with greens being soft and receptive and sunny skies with a light breeze.\n\nKoepka raced out to a remarkable start Sunday, deploying his short irons with precision. He birdied three consecutive holes — Nos. 2, 3 and 4 — after his approach shots at each fell within 10 feet to set up gettable birdie putts. That helped him open a three-stroke lead over Hovland, his playing partner in the final pairing of the championship round, through four holes.\n\nHovland, however, would gain a stroke on Koepka on the par-3 No. 5, after Koepka narrowly missed a 15-foot birdie putt that opened the way for Hovland to sink his birdie try.\n\nAt the par-4 No. 6, Kopeka's driver off the tee sailed well right of the fairway, landing in thick grass over the bridge and water hazard near the out of bounds area. His second shot, however, required power and precision to land it on the green and Koepka did just that, though his attempt at a long par save came up short. Koepka bogeyed the hole and Hovland, whose tee shot was in far better position, parred to cut into the lead.\n\nHovland settled before and after the turn, parring five consecutive holes from No. 8 through No. 12. Hovland did birdie Nos. 13 and 14, but Koepka stayed the course, birdying Nos. 10, 12 and 14 — though he bogeyed No. 11.\n\nThe major is Koepka's first since winning the 2019 PGA Championship at Bethpage's Black Course. Koepka is the 20th player to win at least five majors. He is one of six players to claim three or more PGAs, joining Jack Nicklaus (5), Walter Hagen (5) Tiger Woods (4), Gene Sarazen (3) and Sam Snead (3).", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2023/05/22/brooks-koepka-captures-pga-championship-exorcising-demons/70242570007/", "title": "Brooks Koepka exorcises demons to capture 2023 PGA ...", "text": "There have been long and hard moments over the past couple years when Brooks Koepka wondered whether he would ever get to experience the incredible week he just had on his way to winning the 2023 PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club.\n\nEver since he won his last major championship at the 2019 PGA, there had been nothing but grimness for the 33-year-old from West Palm Beach, Florida, and no, banking a reported $100 million to defect from the PGA Tour to LIV Golf, and even winning two events on that controversial circuit, did not quell his concerns about where his golf career was headed.\n\nHe endured a torn patella tendon in August 2019, a hip injury in 2020, and a terribly serious knee injury that included a broken knee cap in March 2021 which, at the time, had him thinking he would never again return to the form he needed over these four days to slay the treacherous beast called the East Course.\n\nNow, those doubts are a thing of the past. Koepka is back, and while it’s a shame we won’t get to see him play on the PGA Tour, there are always the majors, and that’s when he’s usually at his best anyway.\n\nSPORTS NEWSLETTER:Sign up to get the latest news and features sent to your inbox\n\n\"Yeah, this one is definitely special,\" Koepka said after he raised the weighty Wanamaker Trophy above his head as a massive, sun-baked, golf-worshiping gallery roared its approval late Sunday afternoon. \"I think this one is probably the most meaningful of them all with everything that’s gone on, all the crazy stuff over the last few years.\"\n\nHe opened the tournament with a ho-hum 72, then got hot in the middle with back-to-back 4-under-par 66s which put him into the third-round lead, one shot ahead of Viktor Hovland.\n\nAnd then, like the Koepka of old, he was a killer on the final day. He shot an excitingly volatile 67 that included seven birdies and four bogeys which made for an absolutely thrilling final round of action.\n\nWell, at least through 15 holes. With the tournament heading for what could have been a truly spectacular finish, we were robbed of that thanks to what happened to poor Hovland on the 16th hole. Trailing Koepka by just one stroke, he drove into the bunker on the right, then plugged his second shot into the grass face and ultimately settled for a sickening double bogey that gave Koepka an insurmountable four-stroke lead, essentially securing his victory.\n\n\"Just didn’t get out of the bunker,\" said a deeply disappointed Hovland, who finished in a second-place tie with world No. 2 player, Scottie Scheffler. \"Plugged in the lip and tried to get a drop and made a double bogey.\"\n\nIt was an appallingly terrible break, and what made it so incredible is that it mirrored exactly what happened to Corey Conners on Saturday. And when I say exactly, I mean exactly. Same spot in the bunker, same club trying to get out, same spot where the ball embedded, same double-bogey 6.\n\nThere will be 400 major championships played in the next 100 years, and we may never see a situation like that in terms of how uncannily similar the nightmare played out for both Hovland and Conners.\n\n\"I couldn’t see what was going on, but I had a pretty good idea,\" said Koepka, who sure didn’t seem too sympathetic about it. \"It was buried under the lip, which was unfortunate. Took a couple minutes to figure out the drop and just figure out what was going on.\"\n\nPerhaps it wouldn’t have mattered if Hovland had just parred the hole, but who knows how the final two holes would have played out if Koepka had only a two-stroke lead instead of a four-stroke cushion?\n\nAlas, we’ll never know. But we do know is this. A fully healthy and focused Koepka makes him a threat to win any major championship he plays in. He flashed all of the talent and determination that had led to his previous four major championship victories in the span of 22 months from 2017-19 and his being the No. 1-ranked player in the official world golf ranking for 44 weeks.\n\n\"Brooks is a great player, and now he has five majors,\" Hovland said. \"I mean, that’s a hell of a record right there. It’s not easy going toe-to-toe with a guy like that. He is not going to give you anything, and I didn’t really feel like I gave him anything either until 16.\"\n\nEven as recently as the Masters, Koepka was wondering where his game was headed. He blew a four-shot lead late in the third round and then shot 75 on Sunday at Augusta which allowed Jon Rahm to win. Koepka said he learned a big lesson that day about mental preparation and attitude, and he said he applied those lessons this week.\n\n\"I don’t think I win today if that didn’t happen, right?\" said Koepka, who became the first LIV player to win a major. \"Definitely take it and keep using it going forward for each event, each major, any time I’m in contention, but I’m not going to share. I can’t give away all the secrets.\"\n\nCan’t blame him for that.\n\nBut he was willing to share how difficult it was to overcome his health issues and to get back to the top of the mountain.\n\n\"It’s tough, it’s very hard to explain,\" he said. \"You can’t fathom how difficult it is just to get going. I mean, it was a lot worse than I let on to you guys, let on to everybody. Maybe only five, six people really know the extent of it, and it was hard. Cold weather, it was achy. The swelling didn’t go down until maybe a couple months ago.\n\n\"A couple years ago, I was just lost. Didn't know where my golf swing was; didn't know physically if I was capable of getting back to where I was. I don't know if I considered retiring, but I knew … if I couldn't play the way I wanted to play, then I was definitely going to give it up. I mean, the thought definitely kind of crossed my mind.\"\n\nSuffice to say, those thoughts are gone.\n\nODDS BOOST:Add +1000 on golfer of your choice to win any tournament\n\nSal Maiorana can be reached at maiorana@gannett.com.

Koepka managed one birdie and five pars during the miserable cold and rain over his first six holes of the third round to reach 13-under-par for the tournament, four better than Rahm, who had a birdie, two bogeys and three pars.\n\nRahm, 28, had the misfortunate of bearing the brunt of the bad weather both Friday afternoon and Saturday morning, while Koepka luckily finished his second round before the weather turned ugly Friday and didn’t have to return to the course until the third round began.\n\nNow they both face a very long, intense journey Sunday.\n\n“I'm not too concerned about playing 29 holes or however many holes we've got left,” said Koepka, who won four majors from 2017-19 but has dealt with a series of injuries to his right knee the past few years. “It’s part of the deal. I'm pretty sure I'll be up for it considering it is the Masters. So I don't think anybody should have a problem with that.”\n\nThen again, 29 or 30 holes of golf in one day is a lot for a man who now enjoys the no-cut, exhibition-style, 54-hole lifestyle of the Saudi-backed LIV circuit — albeit a man who is believed to not be the happiest golfer in the LIV stable.\n\nMASTERS ROUNDUP:Play suspended due to weather; Tiger Woods sits in last place\n\nIf he had been as healthy last year when he left for the far-less-competitive LIV life as he is right now, he was asked, would his decision to bolt from the PGA Tour been more challenging?\n\n“Honestly, yeah, probably, if I'm being completely honest,” Koepka said. “I think it would have been. But I'm happy with the decision I made.”\n\nKoepka and 17 other golfers who arrived at this week’s Masters left their regular tour jobs to go into the “sportswashing” business with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, the mastermind of the killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, as well as his golf-bro buddies in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the nation responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States and abysmal human rights violations against women and the LGBTQ community.\n\nOne golfer who was adamant that he would never leave the PGA Tour for LIV’s ridiculously fat paychecks is Rahm.\n\n“Shotgun (start), three days to me is not a golf tournament. No cut. It's that simple,\" Rahm said. \"I want to play against the best in the world in a format that's been going on for hundreds of years.\n\n\"I've never really played the game of golf for monetary reasons. I play for the love of the game, and I want to play against the best in the world. I've always been interested in history and legacy, and right now, the PGA Tour has that.”\n\nRahm, ranked No. 3 in the world, has one major title, the 2021 U.S. Open. Koepka, ranked 118th in the world, has won two U.S. Opens and two PGA Championships.\n\nThere’s still a long way to go, but it’s likely one of those two will be donning a green jacket Sunday evening. Augusta National officials could have banned all the LIV golfers from competing here, but refused to do so.

But in recent months, it's appeared that the tenor of their relationship has changed.\n\n\"Look, I'm going to give respect where respect is due,\" DeChambeau said in a news conference Wednesday when asked why he walked back to the 18th green to congratulate Koepka.\n\n\"He has won five majors, and he played better than me that week. And what was sad is that really nobody was there to congratulate him after.\"\n\nAt its core, DeChambeau said, the gesture was simply about respect, though there is some important context.\n\n\"He's a LIV Golfer and I am, too,\" he added. \"And obviously that's a part of it.\"\n\nSPORTS NEWSLETTERSign up now for daily updates sent to your inbox\n\nAs the Saudi-financed golf league hits the midway point of its second campaign this week with an event at Trump National Golf Club, Kopeka's win at the PGA Championship has given everyone affiliated with Team LIV a chance to take a victory lap – even the two men who were once at the center of golf's most public feud.\n\nWhile the victory was individually massive for Koepka, making him one of just 20 men to have won five majors or more, it has also become a rallying cry for LIV Golf. The league has long touted its team-centric, 54-hole format. But Koepka's win, which was the first major title for a LIV golfer, underlined both the foxhole mentality that exists among its players and the tension between them and the rest of the golfing world.\n\n\"Look, (Koepka's win) proves that we can play in major championships. Proves that the schedule is good enough for us to win major championships,\" said DeChambeau, who finished in a tie for fourth at the PGA Championship.\n\n\"Yeah, it's an individual sport, but there's a team component to it now. And it's really cool to see how (LIV golfers) are playing well not only for their teams and for themselves, but for an organization that deserves to be mentioned a lot more in a better light than what it is.\"\n\nKoepka said on Instagram in February that he and DeChambeau had \"squashed\" their proverbial beef, in large part because of their shared interest in LIV. \"I actually talk to him quite frequently because of what’s going on here at LIV. Pretty much on an every-other-day basis,\" Koepka said.\n\nTheir interaction Sunday served as the latest evidence of that, and the way LIV golfers have come to view one another's success as a point of pride.\n\nLIV Golf vs. PGA Tour\n\nKoepka's victory, which gave him a nice boost in the world rankings, has also reignited many of the LIV vs. PGA Tour debates that have been simmering in the sport. Should LIV golfers, like Koepka, be eligible to compete in the Ryder Cup later this year if they qualify? Should they earn world rankings points based on their performances in LIV events, like the one beginning Friday? And do their 54-hole events represent a step down in level of play or preparation?\n\n\"I gave up on that narrative about six months ago,\" another LIV golfer, Cameron Smith, told reporters Sunday. \"We're still out there. We haven't forgot how to play golf.\"\n\nCharles Howell III, a member of DeChambeau's LIV team, said Wednesday that he believes LIV golfers are \"still working as hard now or harder\" than when they were on the PGA Tour, despite playing fewer holes per event. He views LIV's lighter schedule as an advantage.\n\n\"I understand the majors historically have 72 holes, but there is nothing sacred about that number,\" Howell said. \"Fifty-four holes in a way can be a bit more pressure, in that it's condensed and you can't really afford to have a bad run of nine holes or so\"\n\nLIV Golf and its players have drawn widespread criticism over the past 18 months as the league – which is funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund – has used eight- and nine-figure contract offers to lure several marquee names away from the PGA Tour, creating a schism in the sport that has since spilled into federal court.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been accused of wide-ranging human rights abuses, including politically motivated killings, torture, forced disappearances and inhumane treatment of prisoners. And members of the royal family and Saudi government were accused of involvement in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist.\n\nLIV Golf has also drawn some ire in the political space for frequenting courses owned by former president Donald Trump; This weekend's event at Trump National is the first of three tournaments that will be held at Trump properties this year.\n\nDeChambeau, 29, is one of LIV's most well-known players, alongside Dustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson, Patrick Reed and Koepka. When he teed off Saturday at the PGA Championship, he was greeted with loud boos, ostensibly in relation to his role with LIV.\n\nHe grinned Wednesday when asked about the boos, in the context of a larger question: All of the acrimony he's received for joining LIV Golf, the questions about his ethics given the league's ties to Saudi Arabia – has it been worth it?\n\n\"When you talk about ethics, that's people's perception. I completely disagree with it, but everybody has the right to their own opinion,\" he said. \"Was it worth it? Absolutely. This has been beyond my dreams, what I could have imagined this becoming. And it's only getting better.

Catch him while you can", "text": "AUGUSTA, Ga. — Brooks Koepka was on the left side of the fairway on No. 8 with a 3-iron in his hand and the kind of uphill lie that he would have called a “killer” the last few years. Of course, the downhill lies weren’t so fun either. And trying to crouch low to the ground to get a good look at how a putt breaks? Forget about it.\n\nThe state of Koepka’s right knee was such that retirement was at least on the table if things didn’t improve. Koepka played the game to win major championships; the rest of this golfing life was just a job. If his body told him he couldn’t do it anymore, what was the point?\n\n“If I wasn't going to be able to move the way I wanted to, I didn't want to play the game anymore,” said Koepka. “It's just that simple. There was definitely moments of that.”\n\nBut more recently, Koepka has had no reason to fear the pain that might come when he bends and loads weight onto his right side and uncorks a powerful swing that made him the most fearsome player to see on a major leaderboard from 2017-19.\n\nAnd when he knocked that 3-iron right into the bank in front of the green on Friday, then watched it stop nearly pin high for a 13-foot eagle putt that he drained, Koepka might have become that player again.\n\nBrooks is back. But given which side of the professional golf schism Koepka has landed on, you better catch him while you can.\n\nEven if Koepka wins this Masters for his fifth major championship — and it’s looking pretty good with a three-shot lead in the clubhouse when officials suspended the round due to inclement weather — the next time you’ll see him (or won't see him, more likely) will be later this month in Adelaide, Australia, or the following week in Singapore. Back to the easy, breezy LIV Golf anti-grind that is so obviously beneath his talent and incapable of satisfying his hunger to be remembered as one of the greats of all time.\n\nHow do we know that? Because every time Koepka steps in front of a microphone, he says it without saying it.\n\nHe may never publicly acknowledge any misgivings about taking the LIV money last year when he was at a physical and mental low point in his career, but regret drips off his every word. When he says he misses competing against Rory Mcllroy and Scottie Scheffler, as he did last week, or admits that he might not have left the PGA Tour had he been healthy last year, we can all read between the lines.\n\n“If I'm being completely honest, I think it would have been (a more difficult decision),” Koepka said Friday. \"But I'm happy with the decision I made.”\n\nIs he really, though?\n\nKoepka at his peak is the ultimate big stage player. Deep down, he knows that’s not what LIV is about. There is little chance that beating Dean Burmester, David Puig and the remnants of Bubba Watson in 54-hole tournaments being broadcast on the CW Network does much to satisfy his ego as a competitor.\n\nBut Koepka left because he wasn’t sure he would ever be that guy again given the health of his knee. If you watched the Netflix series “Full Swing,” which documents last year on the PGA Tour through the eyes of a handful of star players, the Koepka-centric episode made it clear that he was in a lot of pain, emotionally vulnerable and wrecked with doubt about the future. At one point, he even admits to wife Jena Sims that he “can’t compete” anymore with the top players.\n\n“I go back to the first major I ever won — I’d pay back every dollar I’ve ever made just to have that feeling again for another hour,” he said at one point in the show.\n\nReality television isn’t always reality, but it appeared to capture at least some of what was going on with Koepka. He admitted Friday that when he left Augusta National last year after shooting 75-75 and missing the cut, he tried twice — unsuccessfully — to punch out the glass in the rear of his courtesy car.\n\n“I guess Mercedes makes a pretty good back window,” he said.\n\nGiven how dark Koepka’s state of mind was at the time, you can understand why he was compelled to choose a different path. He would not have been the first golfer to dominate the game for a time, then lose the magic for whatever reason and never get it back. At least in his case, LIV was offering something other than the agony of missing cuts and being just another guy out on the PGA Tour.\n\n“I think you look at the history of Brooks, he's always lived for these moments,” said Gary Woodland, who played with Koepka the last two days and watched him shoot 65-67 with just one bogey over his first 36 holes.\n\nThe shame of it, though, is that we’ll only see Koepka in these moments four times a year. Sure, regardless of whether he’s playing on the PGA Tour or LIV, Koepka will still show up at the majors and is clearly capable of winning them again.\n\nBut golf could use a fully healthy, firing-on-all-cylinders Koepka trying to battle Scheffler and Jon Rahm and all the other big stars as often as possible. The more often the top players are in the same tournaments, the better. But after this week, most fans will not see Koepka hit even a single shot until the PGA Championship next month.\n\nIt is a strange, unprecedented way to pursue becoming one of the greatest players of all time. But if Koepka wins this weekend, he’ll move up considerably on that list.\n\nWith two U.S. Opens and two PGAs, adding a Masters title would make Koepka just the ninth player to reach the five-major plateau in the last 50 years.\n\n“The whole goal is to win the Grand Slam, right?” he said. “I feel like all the greats have won here and they have all won British Opens as well. Look, I guess it's one more box for me to tick to truly feel like I've done what I should have accomplished in this game.”\n\nIf Koepka’s knee has truly come around for good after a gruesome, complex injury and long rehab, then it’s probably just a matter of time. On Friday, in admittedly calm conditions before the rain and wind swept through, he dominated Augusta National with power and precision. Aside from a slightly wayward drive on No. 17, he essentially put the ball where he wanted all day. Koepka went 5-under on the par-5s and played the other holes in even par, but that didn’t tell the story of just how accurately he was hitting his targets. If he had converted a few more putts from the numerous hole-high approaches he had on the par-4s, he might have been able to put away this tournament on Friday.\n\nNow, instead of talking about being unable to compete anymore, Koepka is saying he feels like he did five years ago.\n\n“I'm able to do everything I need to,” he said. “And the confidence is there. The confidence was lost just because of my knee and that was it.”\n\nIt would be a welcome development if golf has entered a second era where Koepka feels like a threat every time he tees it up at a big event. He’s that electric of a player and competitor.\n\nBut in golf’s current fractured state, he only gets four chances a year to beat the players he most wants to beat.\n\n“It is what it is,” he said. “It's the situation we've got right now, so I can't do anything about it. I just go play.”\n\nEnjoy it while you can.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Dan Wolken on Twitter @DanWolken\n\nMORE: Trees fall near spectators at Augusta National during second round", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/pga/2023/05/17/pga-championship-golf-leaderboard-live-updates/70228008007/", "title": "PGA Championship leaderboard 2023: Eric Cole in first; play ...", "text": "The first day of play at the 2023 PGA Championship is over.\n\nPlay was suspended due to darkness at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, New York, with a surprise name sitting atop the leaderboard.\n\nEric Cole, a newcomer to the PGA Tour in 2023, sits in first at 5-under.\n\nBryson DeChambeau, who sits right behind Cole at 4-under, will be attempting to be the first player from LIV Golf to win a major.

There are 11 groups that still need to finish their first rounds. PGA Championship organizers said play would begin again at 7 a.m. ET and that the second round \"will start on time as originally scheduled.\"\n\nNewcomer Eric Cole becomes sole leader after three straight birdies\n\nAmong all the big names near the top of the leaderboard, a rather unknown player has risen to take the top spot.\n\nEric Cole has taken over first place at the PGA Championship after a birdie on the 4th put him at 5-under-par, his third birdie in a row, to separate him from Dustin Johnson, Adam Scott and Bryson DeChambeau, who was the sole leader for much of the day.\n\nCole had been on the Minor League Golf Tour for much of his career, which began in 2009. He doesn't have any Tour wins and has appeared in just one previous major, the 2021 U.S. Open, in which he missed the cut.\n\nHis parents are professional golfers Bobby Cole and Laura Baugh. Bobby Cole won the 1977 Buick Open on the PGA Tour, and Baugh was the 1973 LPGA rookie of the year.\n\nTom Kim gets a little dirty\n\nSometimes when a ball goes off course, a golfer might have to get wet trying to find it.\n\nThen there's what happened to Tom Kim.\n\nAn ESPN camera cut to Kim with his arms and pants covered in mud while barefoot, after he appeared to get into a marsh or creek on the course. His caddie handed him a towel as he attempted to clean himself off. He later changed his shirt, but his mud-soaked pants were still on as he continued play.\n\nKim confirmed after his round he was indeed looking for a ball when things went awry.\n\n\"As soon as I went in, it was kind of sketch,\" Kim said in an interview with ESPN. “Once my foot got in there, there was no looking back,\" he added.\n\nAdam Scott, Dustin Johnson jump into tie for first\n\nBryson DeChambeau finally has company.\n\nAs play begins to wind down for the day at Oak Hill, Adam Scott and Dustin Johnson ramped up their play to join DeChambeau at the top of the leaderboard at 4-under-par.\n\nIt's been a magnificent back nine for Johnson, who birdied three of his last four holes, while Scott has continued his consistent play, with a birdie on the 14th to jump into a tie for the top spot.\n\nPhil Mickelson keeping pace\n\nThe last two PGA Championship winners didn't jump out to the best start, but they aren't out of the competition yet.\n\nThe 2022 champion, Justin Thomas, finished his day 2-over-par, and the 2021 champion, Phil Mickelson, is 1-over-par more than halfway into his first round.\n\nIt started off as a modest day for Mickelson, but he's been unable to hit any quality tee shots, setting him up to just try to save par on several holes. He bogeyed the 6th and 11th holes. Mickelson got his first birdie of the day on the 13th.\n\nJustin Rose chips in, afternoon starters get rolling\n\nJustin Rose has had an eventful opening, but he seems to be getting back on track.\n\nAfter two birdies on the first three holes, Rose had a setback on the par-3 5th hole, struggling with the putter and resulting in a double bogey. But when things looked to turn worse, he recovered with a birdie on 6th. The back-and-forth beginning seemed to be headed toward another bogey, but Rose chipped in a bunker shot from over 57 feet to save birdie and find his way back into the top five.\n\nMeanwhile, Australia's Adam Scott has played a mostly clean first round at 3-under-par through No. 10 hole, currently in second. He has four birdies and one bogey so far.\n\nBryson DeChambeau: Played 'a fantastic round'\n\nLeader Bryson DeChambeau told reporters after his first round he couldn't have drawn up a better round of golf, finishing his day 4-under-par.\n\n\"It's a fantastic round of golf at Oak Hill. It's a prestigious place. Very difficult golf course,\" DeChambeau said. \"Luckily, I was able to play some really good golf, hit a lot of fairways, did my job and made some putts.\"\n\nDeChambeau added that he has been most surprised about being able to hit with his driver straight. He also talked about his weight loss journey and other struggles that have made it hard to succeed on the course in recent years.\n\n\"I feel like I'm catching on and trending that direction. Figured out a couple things this week, and it certainly paidoff today,\" DeChambeau said.\n\nRough start for Tony Finau\n\nIt will take a miraculous comeback if Tony Finau is to win his first major. He's enjoyed a string of success with two wins and four top-10s this season, but it was anything but a hot start for the 16-year veteran.\n\nAfter starting the first round with three consecutive pars, things took a turn for the worse on the 4th. Finau began the hole with a shot in the bunker, and his second shot went only 29 feet, setting him up with a bogey. On the 5th, his opening shot went wide left and struggled to get on the green, before finishing the hole with a double bogey. He would bogey the next two holes to fall to a quick 5-over-par through eight.\n\nAustria's Sepp Straka quickly rising\n\nOne of the strongest starts to the day came in the afternoon with Sepp Straka, who birdied three of his first seven holes to start the day and jump into a tie for second at 3-under-par.\n\nA professional since 2016, the 27-year-old from Vienna, Austria is the first person from his country to earn a tour card, and won his first PGA tournament in 2022 with The Honda Classic. His best major performance was finishing 30th in the 2022 Masters.\n\nBryson DeChambeau ends his day on top\n\nAfter being in a brief tie with playing partner Keegan Bradley, Bryson DeChambeau ended his first round on top thanks to a string of four birdies in a seven-hole span. Meanwhile, Bradley bogeyed on the seventh and ninth hole to drop his score to 2-under-par, in a tie for fourth.\n\nDeChambeau is looking to become the first LIV Golf player to win a major championship after he joined the Saudi-backed tour in June 2022. Phil Mickelson and Brooks Koepka, another pair of LIV golfers, finished in a tie for second at the Masters in April.\n\nDefending champion has sluggish start\n\nDefending champion Justin Thomas had a solid back nine, highlighted by a birdie on the 10th hole, but was doomed by a double bogey on the par-4 No. 6, arguably one of the toughest holes at Oak Hill at 498 yards.\n\nAfter hitting his tee shot into the rough, his second shot went only 74 yards into the fairway. Thomas struggled the rest of the hole on his way to the double bogey. He later bogeyed the 9th before rebounding with a birdie on the 10th.\n\nPhil Mickelson returns\n\nThe 2021 PGA Champion Phil Mickelson has teed off, returning to the tournament for the first time since winning it in South Carolina two years ago. He was met with a roar from the crowd his name was announced to the crowd gathered at hole 1.\n\nThe 52-year-old hooked his first shot 303 yards to the left, but recovered to make par to start his day.\n\nNew leader as scores start dropping in afternoon play\n\nThe revamped course at Oak Hill favors players who can hit long, and Bryson DeChambeau has taken advantage of that. A birdie at No. 6 — his fourth in his last seven holes — allowed him to take sole possession of first place at 4-under. His stay as the sole leader was brief, with his playing partner Keegan Bradley matching his birdie at six. Both are now tied for first, as a wave of players making their afternoon starting times have made their ways to the course.\n\nMickelson is set to tee off at Oak Hill in a matter of minutes.\n\nHas Tony Finau ever won a major?\n\nNo. But Finau’s major championship history started at the PGA, so it’s only fitting that his first major title come at the PGA of America’s premier event, especially given his current form. Finau, who just teed off at No. 1 to start his round, has two wins and four top-10s this season, most recently at the Mexico Open just last month.\n\n\"I feel like a different player, more so than I’ve ever been. More confident in my game and my abilities than I’ve ever been and just who I am as a person and as a player,\" Finau explained. \"I think those things will serve me well as I continue down my path in my career.\"\n\nNot only is he in good form, but Finau’s game is a perfect fit for the demanding Donald Ross test that is Oak Hill.\n\n\"You’ve got to hit it far and you’ve got to hit it straight,\" said Finau, who ranks 17th in total driving, third in Strokes Gained: Tee-to-Green and first in Strokes Gained: Approach this season. \"This golf course is going to start from the tee box. If you’re not hitting enough fairways, you’re not going to be able to play this place very good.\"\n\n— Adam Woodard, Golfweek\n\nWorld No. 2 joins crowded top spot on the leaderboard\n\nScottie Scheffler closed out his first round in a tie for first place, joining Keegan Bradley, Bryson DeChambeau and Corey Conners.\n\nThe World Golf Ranking No. 2 player maintained a bogey-free round, including a birdie on Nos. 5, 8 and 14. Scheffler had a chance to take sole position of the lead on his final hole, but his long birdie putt spun out, leaving him with a par to close out the day at 3-under.\n\n\"It was a grind today,\" Scheffler said on ESPN.\n\nThe quartet for first place are followed by Ryan Fox and Viktor Hovland at 2-under.\n\nMasters winner Jon Rahm in free fall; Scottie Scheffler adds another birdie\n\nHe was looking to be the first player to win the first two majors of the year since Jordan Spieth did so in 2015, but it's looking like that simply won't be the case for Masters winner Jon Rahm. Over his last nine holes, Rahm has bogeyed six of them. He has plummeted down the board and sits at 5-over par, in a tie for 71st.\n\nSwitching to the 2022 Masters winner, Scottie Scheffler has put himself in excellent position for the rest of the tournament. Scheffler is through 17 holes and remains bogey-free. He birdied No. 8 after his lovely approach shot softly found the green, about 6 feet away from the pin. He is sitting at 3-under and in a tie for first, joining Corey Conners, and Keegan Bradley. It has been a trademark Scheffler round, avoiding big mistakes and saving par chances when his shots have gone slightly off-target.\n\nRevolving door atop leaderboard at Oak Hill welcomes two new members, but it doesn't last long\n\nFor the first time today, Corey Conners and Viktor Hovland climbed up to grab a share of the lead. Hovland has birdied two of his last four holes to move into the tie for first at 3-under, joining Ryan Fox and Conners.\n\nThe problem for Hovland and Fox, though, is that Conners is on a torrid pace and has birdied six of his last 11 holes, including three in the last four. The most recent birdie came at No. 15 and moved him into sole possession of first place, at 4-under par.\n\nTrouble, though, might be ahead as his tee shot on No. 16 landed well right in thick rough.\n\nFive players — Fox, Sahith Theegala, Keegan Bradley, Scottie Scheffler and Bryson Dechambeau — are sitting at 2-under and a tie for fourth.\n\nMore movement at the top at Oak Hill\n\nIn what has been the theme of the day, tough pin placements and challenging holes have created parity at the top of the leaderboard at the PGA Championship. Ryan Fox has been the steadiest player of the day so far, with four birdies against one bogey through 16 holes. He sits at 3-under par and in sole position of the lead.\n\nCorey Conners birdied No. 12 and Viktor Hovladnd birdied No. 2 to move into a tie for second place at 2-under.\n\nJustin Thomas had a very makeable birdie at No. 4, but took a long time to assess an 8-foot putt, only to see him push it left. That kept him at 1-under.\n\nScottie Scheffler, though, hasn't played the cleanest round, but he has scrambled exceptionally well and has avoided bogeys all day. His birdie on No. 5 moved him into that tie for second place at 2-under.\n\nLong par putt save seems to fuel Rory McIlroy\n\nRory McIlroy's day appeared as if it was going to get worse at No. 2, when his approach shot sailed the green and landed in a shelf below the pin. Then, he did this.\n\nThat saved par to keep him at 3-over par and still within striking distance. But it also seemed to settle him. Notoriously a slow starter, McIlroy then hit a beautiful tee shot on the par-3 third and converted his first birdie of the day.\n\nHis tee shot with the driver at the par-5 No. 4? He drilled it about 340 yards, finding only his second fairway of the day. His approach? A beautiful draw to land safely on the green for a long eagle putt. He tapped in for a birdie to move to 1-over par, just four strokes off the lead.\n\nChanges at the top, all of a sudden, as several golfers drop strokes\n\nKazuki Higa had charged out to a lead and then played steady golf for most of his first round at Oak Hill. Then, he came to No. 6. where he made a mess off the tee box, landing far left and needing a layup just to get back on the fairway. Even that shot couldn't find its mark, landing short and remaining in the thick grass.\n\nElsewhere, Keegan Bradley suffered his own double bogey to drop out of the co-lead. Bradley's came at No. 15.\n\nThat left Sahith Theegala as the lone player atop the leaderboard at 3-under par, but then he bogeyed No. 12. That now puts him at 2-under and in a co-lead with Ryan Fox, who has one birdie and seven pars in his last eight holes.\n\nThat has opened the door for a logjam of nine players who are at 1-under par, including World Golf Ranking No. 2 player Scottie Scheffler, LIV Golf's Bryson Dechambeau and Keegan Bradley. Of those, Scheffler has played the cleanest, and has maintained a bogey-free round with a single birdie on No. 14. He is through 11 holes.\n\nJoel Dahmen hits fan during PGA Championship practice round, buys his beer for the day\n\nIt was quite the start for Joel Dahmen at the PGA Championship.\n\nAhead of the first round at Oak Hill Country Club, Dahmen was in the final practice round Wednesday when a shot went awry and hit a fan in the calf.\n\nBut instead of just apologizing and signing the ball and giving it to the fan, Dahmen went the extra mile. After meeting the fan he hit, Dahmen asked how much beer costs at the course, which he said is $17 and was widely criticized last year.\n\nDahmen then pulled out a $100 bill and told the fan \"I got your beers today.\" Dahmen, who was become a fan favorite after his appearance on the Netflix documentary \"Full Swing,\" apologized on Twitter and told the fan \"hope you enjoyed the beers.\"\n\n— Jordan Mendoza\n\nLeaderboard starting to crowd at the top\n\nA three-way tie has formed atop the leaderboard at Oak Hill, with Kazuki Higa converting pars on six straight holes after he charged out to a score of 3-under. Keegan Bradley raced off to a hot start as well, birdying three of his first five holes. And Sahith Theegala has birdied three of his last four − Nos. 8, 9 and 11 − to join them.\n\nThat said, there are plenty of players within striking distance. Ryan Fox is the lone player at 2-under and in fourth place. But there are nine players sitting at 1-under par. One of them, Callum Tarren, bogeyed Nos. 5 and 6 to neutralize his hot start and brief hold of a co-lead with Higa. Tarren did, however, settle with pars on Nos. 7 and 8.\n\nRory McIlroy sliding, sliding down\n\nAs several players are capitalizing on soft greens and favorable conditions, Rory McIlroy is going in the opposite direction. He has posted bogeys in three of his last four holes, Nos. 15, 17 and 18 to move to 3-over par and a tie for 59th. It's not just one part of his game that's letting him down; he has misfired on some of his irons and has had to resort to two-putts at times throughout the round.\n\nSeveral early groups have turned to their second nine\n\nThe conditions right now at Oak Hill are spectacular. It’s comfortably cool because the sun is shining, and there’s very little wind for the players to contend with.\n\nKazuki Higa has leveled off since his quick start and has made six pars and a bogey, so as he plays his 13th hole, he’s at 3-under-par. He also has company on that number atop the leaderboard as Keegan Bradley has opened his round on the back nine with birdies at Nos. 10, 12 and 13.\n\nBradley, who is the nephew of former LPGA great Pat Bradley, won the PGA the first time he played it back in 2011. He beat Jason Dufner in a playoff, the same Dufner who won the tournament two years later at Oak Hill.\n\nBut Bradley has struggled in recent years, though he did break a four-year victory drought when he won the Zozo Championship last October.\n\n— Sal Maiorana, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\n\nTiger texted Rory McIlroy about something in his swing after recent lackluster finish\n\nA few weeks ago in Charlotte, Rory McIlroy tied for 47th, a substandard finish for a man who has dominated Quail Hollow and the Wells Fargo Championship for most of his career — McIlroy’s won the event three times.\n\nGolfweek’s Eamon Lynch reported on Golf Channel Tuesday that Tiger Woods texted McIlroy after the event and told him he saw something in the four-time major champion’s swing.\n\nAnd when Woods calls, you listen.\n\n— Riley Hamel, Golfweek\n\nCallum Tarren ties (then loses) share of lead; Rory McIlroy still unable to break through\n\nCalum Tarren had been doing his best Kazuki Higa impression until it went awry on No. 5. Higa, who birdied four consecutive holes early in his round to race out to the lead, briefly had company atop the leaderboard after Tarren posted three consecutive birdies to briefly grab a share of the lead. Tarren's tee shot on the par-3 No. 5, however, just rolled down the ridge of the green and set him up for a two-putt par that he mismanaged. Tarren's bogey dropped him to 2-under and a tie for second with Ryan Fox, who birdied No. 9.\n\nHiga, meanwhile, held steady and converted two challenging putts to par No. 1.\n\nElsewhere, Rory McIlroy, the No. 3 player in the World Golf Rankings, has been searching for his first birdie of the day but has been unable thus far to break into the red. He has parred each of his first five holes of his first round. In fact, McIlroy actually dropped a stroke on No. 15 after his nice shot out of the greenside bunker on No. 15 set up a makeable par putt that he pushed left. He tapped in for his first bogey of the day, moving him to 1-over par, in a tie for 33rd.\n\nKazuki Higa drops first stroke of his day; Callum Tarren starts hot\n\nSole leader Kazuki Higa, whose four consecutive birdies saw him race out to an early lead, dropped his first stroke of the day on his eighth hole, No. 17. His tee shot drifted left into the rough and then forced him to layup his second shot. His approach landed on the wrong side of the ridge on the green, which resulted in a two-putt and his first bogey of the day. The silver lining is that — thus far — No. 17 has been the most difficult hole on the course.\n\nHe remains at 3-under par, one stroke better than Callum Tarren in second place. Tarren, the 32-year-old British golfer, has started his round in excellent shape. He parred No. 1 and then posted consecutive birdies on Nos. 2 and 3 to shoot up the leaderboard.\n\nKazuki Higa does his best Tiger Woods impression on way to early lead\n\nKazuki Higa of Japan came out of the gates blazing with four consecutive birdies to take the early lead at the PGA Championship.\n\nAfter just lipping out a birdie putt on No. 10, his first hole of the round, Higa rolled in an 11-footer to go into red figures.\n\nThen, channeling Tiger Woods' iconic shot at Augusta National, the 28-year-old Higa rolled in a long birdie putt on No. 12 that just hung on the lip of the cup for a split second before tumbling in.\n\nThe 5-2 Higa continued his hot streak with two more birdies on the 13th and 14th holes.\n\nHiga, No. 99 in the world golf rankings, has played on the Japan Tour since 2017 and he has four career victories. He has made three starts on the PGA Tour this year and missed the cut in two, including the Masters. This is his first PGA Championship appearance.\n\nThe first eagle of PGA Championship has landed\n\nScott Stallings began his round on the 10th hole which, most golf analysts believe, will play as one of the easiest of the week on the East Course. Stallings proved that as he striped a drive down the middle at the 423-yard par-4. With 128 yards left to the flag, Stallings likely hit some type of wedge and he two-hopped it into the hole for an eagle-2.\n\nThe 38-year-old is a three-time winner on the PGA Tour, the last in 2014. He has said that if he wasn't a professional golfer, he'd be a pediatrician. Stallings has struggled this season as he has no top-10 finishes in 16 starts.\n\n— Sal Maiorana, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\n\nHow to watch PGA Championship 2023\n\nHere is the TV schedule:\n\nThursday, May 18 and Friday, May 19\n\n7 a.m.-1 p.m.: ESPN+\n\n1 p.m.-7 p.m.: ESPN\n\nThe tournament can be livestreamed on:\n\nIs Justin Thomas playing today?\n\nYes. If he’s going to win a third PGA this week, Thomas has to play the way he did two weekends ago at Quail Hollow which, when it isn’t hosting majors, is the annual home of the Wells Fargo Championship.\n\nThomas hasn’t won since his victory at Southern Hills and has only four top 10 finishes in the 19 events he has teed it up. But despite a tie for 14th on a course he knows well and has succeeded on, he felt like things were starting to click. Now the trick will be to carry that forward when he begins his PGA defense Thursday.\n\n“I’ve preached this to myself, I’m sure I’ve said it to y’all or I’ve said it to younger guys that ask, but how you learn is failure and negatives, and I feel like I’ve had a great opportunity for a lot of learning the past, whatever, six months, couple months, this year,” he said. “I said it in Charlotte a little bit, I’m starting to see a little bit of a light at the end of the tunnel.”\n\nThomas got off to an excellent start with a birdie on his first hole of the day.\n\n— Sal Maiorana, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\n\nOpening of practice facilities, golf course pushed back due to frost\n\nAll practice facilities and the golf course at Oak Hill Country Club were temporarily closed Thursday morning because of frost. To protect playing surfaces, everyone on-site was required to stay off any grass.\n\nThe practice range opened at 7:35 a.m. and the putting green at 7:45, pushing starting times back by a total of one hour and 50 minutes.\n\nRound 1 tee times begin at 8:50 a.m. on the first tee and 8:55 a.m. on the 10th tee.\n\nTemperatures are supposed to rise into the mid-60s by early afternoon under sunny skies and light winds.\n\nGALLERY: 10 beautiful photos of frost-covered Oak Hill\n\nJordan Spieth injury update\n\n“How are you feeling, Jordan?” a spectator shouted with genuine concern to Jordan Spieth from behind the rope lining the right side of the 13th fairway at Oak Hill on Tuesday as Spieth sauntered to his ball.\n\n“I feel good,” Spieth said imitating the deep baritone of James Brown.\n\nBut does Spieth, who withdrew from last week’s AT&T Byron Nelson, his hometown event, citing a left wrist injury, really feel so good, as the soul singer Brown would say? That we don’t know because when a reporter asked to speak to him about his injury, he declined and said, “But thanks for your concern.”\n\nSpieth, ranked No. 10 in the world, is bidding to complete the career Grand Slam this week by winning the PGA Championship. It marks his seventh attempt since winning the 2017 British Open for his third major title.\n\n— Adam Schupak, Golfweek\n\nMap of Oak Hill Country Club\n\nOak Hill Country Club’s East Course is regarded as one of top golf courses in America. It's also one of the most challenging. The East Course is built around part of Allen Creek, which weaves a hazard through half of the holes. The par-70 course plays 7.394 yards.

The Spaniard has amassed four wins already this season including the Masters in April — his second major championship victory.\n\nHowever, it’s Scottie Scheffler on top of the betting odds list, sitting at +700. He tied for fifth at last week’s AT&T Byron Nelson and grabbed a T-10 finish at Augusta National.\n\nAt double Scheffler’s odds is McIlroy (+1400), who is going through a bit of a funk. In his last three stroke-play events, the Northern Irishman has missed the cut at the Players and Masters, and tied for 47th at the Wells Fargo Championship.\n\n— Sal Maiorana, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\n\nPGA Championship dark horse picks 2023\n\nAlthough the field is littered with stars from both the PGA Tour and LIV Golf League, there are several names further down the odds list worth keeping an eye on.\n\nHere are five sleeper picks for the PGA Championship at Oak Hill: Tommy Fleetwood (60/1), Rickie Fowler (60/1), Adam Scott (80/1), Shane Lowry (90/1), Gary Woodland (90/1).\n\n— Riley Hamel, Golfweek\n\nRory McIlroy at Oak Hill in Rochester\n\nRory McIlroy stopped short of saying he has the home course advantage this week for the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club, especially when you consider he actually hasn’t played the East Course since its renovation.\n\n“It’s not as if I have a ton of local knowledge here compared to everyone else,” McIlroy said Tuesday before heading out to play a practice round to get familiarized with the changes. “The last two days are the most I’ve really seen of this golf course over the last couple years.”\n\nHe may not have much of an advantage regarding the subtleties of the course or the best way to negotiate the daunting challenge of the East Course, but McIlroy will likely be the darling of the massive galleries.\n\n— Sal Maiorana, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\n\nOak Hill Country Club designer\n\nA voluminous renovation has been ongoing for several years at Oak Hill, and the goal of renowned golf course architect Andrew Green was to restore the East Course as close as possible to the original design Donald Ross created nearly a century ago.\n\n— Sal Maiorana, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\n\nPurse for PGA Championship 2023\n\nThere will be $15 million in prize money awarded. The winner will take home $2.7 million.\n\n— Sal Maiorana, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\n\nWho's missing at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill?\n\nWill Zalatoris, who is ranked No. 9 in the world, is the only player in the top 100 not at Oak Hill as his season ended due to back surgery.\n\nJordan Spieth, No. 10 in the world, is battling a wrist injury which forced him to withdraw last week from the AT&T Byron Nelson. He practiced Tuesday, but it’s possible he might have to pull out. If he plays, he’ll start Thursday at 8:22 a.m. on No. 10 with Viktor Hovland and Shane Lowry.\n\n— Sal Maiorana, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\n\nLIV Golfers at the PGA Championship\n\nThe LIV Golf contingent has a stout record in the PGA. The 17 players in the field have combined for 32 top-10 finishes and have made 100 of 131 cuts (76.3 percent).\n\nEnglishman Paul Casey announced Wednesday that he's withdrawing from the tournament due to injury, leaving 16 LIV golfers in the field.

Last year's winner Scottie Scheffler and three-time champ Phil Mickelson are also among the stars in the field, which includes both PGA Tour and LIV golfers.\n\nFollow along for the latest action, leaderboard updates, highlights and more.\n\nTEE TIMES: Pairings for Thursday's first round\n\nHow did Tiger Woods do today at the Masters?\n\nPlaying in his first competitive round since mid-February, Tiger Woods posted an uneven first round at Augusta National. Through his first seven holes, Woods recorded four pars and three bogeys, before he recorded his first birdie at No. 8.\n\nWoods had played well off the tee with his drives mostly finding the fairways. His approach irons and putter was where he was let down, often leaving himself longer putts; he averaged 1.78 putts per hole in the first round.\n\nOn the back nine, Woods bogeyed No. 11, before posting three consecutive pars. He then came on late, notching back-to-back birdies on Nos. 15 and 16. He bogeyed the final hole of the round to finish 2-over par (74). That has him — as of 4 p.m. ET — tied for 54th and hovering around the cut line, which will see the top 50 players (including ties) after the second round moving on.\n\nNotable Round 2 tee times\n\nTiger Woods will return to Augusta National for Round 2 at 12:54 p.m. ET. He'll be featured in Group 27 with co-leader Viktor Hovland, who shot 7-under (65).\n\nCo-leader Jon Rahm will tee off shortly after in Group 29 at 1:18 p.m. ET, while fellow co-leader Brooks Koepka will get started earlier in the day at 8:18 a.m. ET in Group 5.\n\nA full list of Round 2 tee times here.\n\nMASTERS:Tee times, TV, streaming info for Friday's second round at Augusta National\n\nJordan Spieth wraps up Round 1 with clutch putt to save par\n\nSpieth preserved his 3-under (69) with a clutch putt on No. 18. He finished his first round with a par putt after finding the fairway bunker on his first stroke. That’s good enough for 14th place, where he’s tied with three other golfers. It could’ve been worse after he shot a double bogey on hole No. 13. He also had 2 bogeys and seven birdies on the day.\n\nScottie Scheffler tied for sixth after one round; rookie Sam Bennett hangs with him\n\nDefending champion Scottie Scheffler got off to a good start on No. 18, hitting a 295-drive up the middle of the fairway. But a missed putt squandered a birdie. He finished No. 18 with a par, ending the first round 4-under (68). He’s one of seven players tied for sixth place.\n\nAmerican amateur Sam Bennett, who was in the same feature group as Scheffler, matched the defending champion at 4-under (68) and is also tied for sixth place. Not bad for the 23-year-old's first-ever Masters appearance.\n\nJordan Spieth and Tony Finau miss eagles on No. 15\n\nJordan Spieth and Tony Finau had a chance to make up some ground on No. 15, but they both missed an eagle opportunity by the slimmest of margins. Finau's putt came up just short and Spieth veered slightly to the right. They both finished with a birdie.\n\nFinau had a similar hiccup on No. 16. He putted for birdie, but the ball rolled right over the hole. He finished at par, keeping him at 3-under par.\n\nJason Day seals clean round with key par putt on 18; Scottie Scheffler hanging around\n\nJason Day, over his last three rounds at the Masters, had shot a combined 15-over par. Thursday, in his first round at the 87th Masters, Day played bogey-free golf and notched five birdies to finish the day 5-under (67). He's one of two players tied for fourth.\n\nMeanwhile, defending champion Scottie Scheffler hasn't had the most efficient round, needing to scramble at times to save par. Scheffler, however, is staying well within striking distance, currently at 4-under par (and tied for sixth) after birdies on Nos. 13 and 15.\n\nScheffler's tee shot on the gettable par-3 16th, though, fell long of the pin and left him some considerable work for another birdie.\n\nJordan Spieth, unraveling, finds the water ... twice in Amen Corner\n\nJordan Spieth, who raced out to a score of 4-under par through 10 holes, has started to unravel a bit on Amen Corner. Spieth bogeyed No. 11, which was actually a favorable outcome because he found the water and scrambled to keep the damage minimal.\n\nBut on No. 13, on his approach shot from the pine straw, Spieth chose an aggressive play and tried to make the green. His shot didn't get enough loft and bounced short of the green, eventually finding the creek. He had to work to set up a shorter bogey putt, which he misread, forcing a tap-in for double-bogey.\n\nAfter dropping three strokes in as many holes, Spieth now sits at 1-under par, in a tie for 27th.\n\nLIV Golf's Koepka takes co-lead spot with birdie on 18\n\nJoining a pair of European players in Viktor Hovland and John Rahm atop the leaderboard, Brooks Koepka concluded his first round in a co-lead with them at 7-under par (65). Koepka, one of the star acquisitions of the LIV Golf tour, shot up the leaderboard with birdies on three of his final four holes (Nos. 15, 16 and 18).\n\nThey find themselves two strokes up on the next closest players.\n\nKoepka is one of 18 players — including six past Masters champions — from the LIV tour who accepted invitations to play this week at Augusta National. Koepka is seeking his first green jacket. A victory by a LIV Golf player would certainly present an interesting, if awkward, moment for Augusta National and the PGA Tour, which are named in an antitrust lawsuit LIV filed in August 2022.\n\nRory gets back to even par; Koepka representing LIV Golf well\n\nWorld Golf No. 2 player Rory McIlroy's first round at the Masters has been all over the place. He birdied No. 2, bogeyed No. 3, got a double bogey on No. 7 and then birdied two of his latest three holes — Nos 8 and 10 — to climb back to even-par.\n\nAs far as the LIV Golf players in the field, Brooks Koepka has been far and away the top player. He is just one stroke off the lead as he starts the final hole of his first round. Koepka actually had a makeable birdie putt at No. 16 that just missed the pin.\n\nJordan Spieth rebounds from bogey on No. 5\n\n2015 Masters champion Jordan Spieth had a solid front-9 and is currently sitting at 4-under par through 10 holes. Spieth had dropped a stroke at No. 5 but has otherwise played cleanly, converting five birdies, on Nos. 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8.\n\nDrizzle starts to fall; Scheffler finishes front-9\n\nThe first round has seen warm and humid — though mostly dry — conditions at Augusta National. Coupled with rain earlier in the week, the greens have been amenable to low scoring, but after 4 p.m. ET hit, a slight drizzle started to fall. As of yet, it hasn't appeared to affect conditions, but as the forecast the rest of the weekend is projected rain, it will continue to bear watching.\n\nDefending champion Scottie Scheffler posted a clean and efficient, bogey-free front nine. An eagle at No. 2 and a birdie at No. 9 has him sitting at 3-under par at the turn.\n\nAlso making the turn is one of Scheffler's playing partners Thursday, amateur Sam Bennett, who has excelled in his Masters debut, and is actually outpacing Scheffler, currently at 4-under. That score ties him for the lowest-ever front nine score for an amateur at the Masters.\n\nViktor Hovland on his shirt\n\nCurrently tied atop the leaderboard, Viktor Hovland caught some attention for something else on Thursday, his colorful shirt that featured an oversized bright pink flower.\n\n\"I had nothing to do with it,\" Hovland said after his first round. \"I just wear what they tell me to wear. It’s definitely a little bit out there, but I’d rather take these than the pink pants I had last year.\"\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nA couple of low scores atop the leaderboard\n\nA pair of players, Viktor Hovland of Norway and John Rahm of Spain, have opened up a two-stroke lead on the rest of the field. Both Hovland and Rahm are tied atop the leaderboard at 7-under par (65).\n\nHovland blistered out of the gate, picking up an eagle on No. 2 and then birdies on Nos. 6, 8, 9, 11 and 13. His pace slowed, however, as he had to scramble for five consecutive pars to close his round.\n\nRahm was the opposite story; he double-bogeyed No. 1 and then slowly chipped away, going bogey-free the rest of the way. Rahm birdied four of his last six holes to climb into a tie with Hovlan\n\nWoods gains a stroke with bogey at 18, ends round at 2-over par\n\nTiger Woods had to manage a difficult second shot at No. 18, shooting out of an uneasy stance in which his left foot was on the first cut and his right foot was in a bunker. That shot eventually found a green-side bunker, from which he also had to navigate a tough stance. He set himself up with a challenging, but doable par putt that he pushed just left with too much pace.\n\nThat means Woods will have some work to do Friday, as he finishes his first round at 2-over-par (74). That left him hanging around the cut line, which will see the top 50 players, including ties, after the second round advance.\n\nAs warm and humid conditions have remained at Augusta National, scoring chances are available. John Rahm, the third-ranked player in the World Golf Rankings, made consecutive birdies at No. 15 and 16 to move up the board. A lenghty birdie putt at 17 left him with a tap-in par.\n\nRahm is currently second overall at 6-under par, one stroke behind leader Viktor Hovland, who finished his round at 7-under.\n\nTiger makes it two in a row\n\nAfter muddling through the middle of the back-9, Tiger Woods bridied his second-consecutive hole at the par-3 No. 16. His tee shot left him a manageable putt just left of the hole.\n\nWoods also converted par on the 17th hole, keeping him 1-over on the day.\n\nTiger gets second birdie of the day at No. 15\n\nThough Tiger Woods's approach iron again, following the trend of his opening round, left him a difficult birdie opportunity at No. 15, he recorded his second birdie of his Masters with a challenging but confidently-taken putt. The putt broke from left to right, but Woods read it perfectly and now sits at 2-over par, with three holes left to play. He had previously recorded his first birdie at No. 8.\n\nViktor Hovland remains the overall leader at 7-under par after notching birdie-par-par at Nos. 13, 14 and\n\nOf the LIV Golf players, Brooks Koepka is the one who has performed best thus far, recording consecutive birdies at Nos. 7 and 8. Koepka finished the front-nine bogey-free and is 4-under par.\n\nElsewhere, amateur Sam Bennett of Texas A&M has showed he's ready for the big stage. At No. 1, Bennett drained a putt of about 15 feet and then chipped in at No. 2 to start with a birdie-eagle. He parred at No. 3 and is at 3-under.\n\nDefending champ Scottie Scheffler races off to hot start; Tiger stays unsteady\n\nAfter kicking off his Masters title defense at No. 1 with a steady par, Scottie Scheffler's approach shot on the par-5 second hole, from about 245 yards, landed softly on the green within five feet. It set up a tap-in eagle meaning that — already — Scheffler has done something he didn't do last year when he won the green jacket: record an eagle.\n\nAt No. 14, Tiger Woods continued his uneven play, landing his tee shot in the rough. Though he eventually saved par — after his approach shot hit the branch of a pine and kicked out just in front of the green — Woods remains at 3-over par and needs to shave some strokes off his score if he is to make a move in the first round.\n\nScottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy start first round; Woods still at 3-over\n\nThe star power continues to make their way to the first tee, as defending champion Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy start their first rounds.\n\nTiger Woods' last three holes on No. 10, 11 and 12 were par-bogey-par.\n\nWill Zalatoris withdraws from Masters\n\nWill Zalatoris became the second golfer to withdraw from the tournament on Thursday after leaving the course minutes before his tee time.

Woods is now 3-over through 11 holes.\n\nViktor Hovland still maintains the lead at 6-under. Cameron Young and Jon Rahm are at 3-under.

Scott Stallings has completed his round and is at 2-under after a birdie on No. 18.\n\nTiger hits first birdie, Phil Mickelson tees off, Hovland takes lead\n\nOne of the early storylines of the tournament is how well the golfers on the LIV tour will do in the tour's first major. One golfer, Kevin Na, has already withdrawn from the Masters after only finishing nine holes. Phil Mickelson, one of the most popular players on the LIV Tour, has teed off for his first round.\n\nWoods finally got on the right side of a hole and birdied the par 5 No. 8 and now is at 2-over.\n\nOn the leaderboard, Viktor Hovland has a one-shot lead at 4-under over Shane Lowry.\n\nTiger Woods 3-over through 7 holes\n\nWoods had a chance to get his first birdie but instead two-putted the par-3 sixth. On the seventh, he was 20 feet from a birdie shot but again ended the hole with a bogey. He is struggling and now sits at 3-over-par.\n\nViktor Hovland has joined Cameron Young at the top of the leaderboard at 3-under after he birdied the par-3 sixth hole. Canada's Mike Weir was the first golfer to finish his round as his playing partner Kevin Na withdrew earlier in the tournament. Weir finished his round with a 72, good for even par.\n\nTiger Woods struggling, Cameron Young surges to lead\n\nCameron Young, who is making his second Masters appearance, birdied his first three holes and is leading the way early.\n\nThe scores are slowly falling as now there are seven golfers within striking range at 2-under, including 2013 Masters champion Adam Scott, and Sergio Garcia, the 2017 champion.\n\nWoods continues to chug along and after bogeying the 5th hole, now sits at 2-over.\n\nSurprising leaders at the top, Tiger 1-over through three holes\n\nAdrian Meronk from Poland has two bogeys and two birdies and is currently 2-under.

(Pro tip: If you're a total newbie, watch the original 1977 \"Star Wars\" first.)\n\nBut which is the best of the best? These are the rankings you’re looking for.\n\n11. 'Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace' (1999)\n\nGeorge Lucas’ prequels get a bad rap and, well, they kind of deserve it at times. Especially this one. What basically is a two-hour trailer for the rest of Anakin Skywalker’s story is kind of a mess – he was immaculately conceived? What’s this about midichlorians and the Force? The pod-race set piece is fun the first five times yet gets old quick, Darth Maul is the coolest guy in the movie and he's in it for all of three minutes, trade negotiations are not the way to start a sci-fi movie, and as for Jar Jar Binks … yeah. One thing it does do well is set up the political atmosphere that leads to the Empire and introduces Anakin as the chosen one who will bring balance to the Force. Just not in the way anybody expects.\n\n10. 'Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones' (2002)\n\nThere are so many sleek special effects used in this thing that you miss the trash heaps and spit-and-gum filmmaking of Lucas’ original movies. Also, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman have ZERO chemistry as doomed lovers Anakin and Padmé – they have a picnic in the middle of the movie, battle monsters together on Geonosis and get married at the end, and yet even a modicum of actual romance isn’t to be found. That all said, \"Clones\" isn’t a bad film and it’s pretty good whenever Ewan McGregor’s Obi-Wan Kenobi is around: His and Anakin’s chase after Zam Wesell is a scene from the great Jedi buddy-cop comedy we never got, and the discovery of the Republic’s clone army on the rainy planet Kamino is obviously important. (Never forget, though: Stormtroopers > clone troopers.)\n\n9. 'Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith' (2005)\n\nIt’s no coincidence that the prequel that’s closest to the original trilogy in tone, story and theme is the best one. Anakin finally has his full turn to the dark side, though it still seems a little whiplash-y how quickly he goes from broody, anti-authoritarian kid to child-killing, baddest man in the galaxy. And Padmé dying from a broken heart is a little much. However, Yoda takes on Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious/Emperor in a neato lightsaber battle, when Order 66 comes down it’s a little heartbreaking, and Obi-Wan and Anakin’s violent brawl on Mustafar is arguably the most hellacious in any \"Star Wars\" film. (Those who miss those two mortal enemies definitely want to watch their rematch in the Disney+ \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" series.)\n\n8. 'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker' (2019)\n\nIt could also be called \"Star Wars: Attack of the Callbacks\" since it bends over backward – and sacrifices a lot of good storytelling and fun new characters (we totally heart little Babu Frik) – to pay homage to familiar faces and aspects from previous films. Jedi-in-training Rey (Daisy Ridley), reluctant hero Finn (John Boyega) and X-wing warrior Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) lead the ragtag Resistance against a returning Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) in a film that's full of logic fumbles and muddies the focus of the third and final trilogy. The evolving relationship between Rey and the First Order's hotheaded Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) goes some interesting places, and director J.J. Abrams' \"Skywalker\" is one last tribute to General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher) and the way certain returning characters have molded decades of this expansive story. Hardcore fans will find lots to love and it's plenty entertaining with bombastic spectacle, but \"Rise\" crashes and burns as an actual finale.\n\n7. 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' (2016)\n\nFor its maiden standalone voyage, \"Star Wars\" brass blended the old – the Rebel Alliance freaking out about the construction of the Empire’s mighty Death Star – with something new: In this case, a war movie digging into the battlefields on land and in space with insurgents rising up against “the Man.” The results are a mixed bag: Ex-con Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) heads up the squad of armed misfits to steal the Death Star plans, though a snarky droid ends up being the best character in the bunch (for the record, K-2SO is way cooler than C-3PO); the Empire is full of bickering bureaucrats, which is fun to watch though bad for getting the Death Star done in a timely manner; and Darth Vader power walks into scenes that both undermine his icon status yet also cement it. While the fan service goes too far – for example, the old-school CGI character who is just as distracting as Jar Jar – \"Rogue One\" does introduce some neato supporting aliens like Admiral Raddus, a military mashup of Patton, Churchill and a lobster.\n\n6. 'Solo: A Star Wars Story' (2018)\n\nA young Han Solo movie doesn't sound like a great idea ... until you actually see a young Han Solo movie. Mostly free of lightsabers, Jedi and Rebels, \"Solo\" is a \"Star Wars\" take on an Indiana Jones jam, and the first movie to tackle the underworld through its most famous anti-hero. This Han (Alden Ehrenreich) is an idealistic sort willing to go to extreme and illegal lengths to see his girlfriend (Emilia Clarke) again. Han and Chewie (Joonas Suotamo) are awesome together, Han and Lando (Donald Glover) aren't bad either, it boasts a bunch of new creatures and crooks, and the film even ties into \"Star Wars\" past in surprising fashion. This, not \"Rogue One,\" should be the template for future spinoffs.\n\n5. 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' (2017)\n\nFor those who love spectacular space battles, the cute audacity of porgs and bad guys with British accents snarling, “Rebel scum,” there’s a lot to love in writer/director Rian Johnson’s \"Episode VIII.\" Fans have plenty to unpack in a lengthy runtime and \"Last Jedi,\" like other franchise vehicles, demands repeat viewings, but Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is the coolest he’s been since \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" Plus, the next-generation heroes of the Resistance take a great leap in being a real rebellion like we saw in the original trilogy. Johnson is also winningly subversive, having Luke call out his own past and challenging the foundation that Lucas put in place 40 years ago – one character even says, “Good guys, bad guys. Made-up words.” The galaxy is no longer a hotbed of chosen ones, a place where a nobody, a lowly First Order janitor or a Resistance mechanic, can save the universe – a switch from the days of Anakin and Luke. \"Last Jedi\" is unsurprisingly dedicated to “our princess” Carrie Fisher, and her integral role speaks volumes to the legacy of the core characters played by her, Hamill and Harrison Ford, yet also points out the need for fresh icons to take the franchise to new heights.\n\n4. 'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi' (1983)\n\nLet's just put this out there now: Ewoks aren’t that bad. And the alien creature quotient is at an all-time high when you toss in Jabba the Hutt’s crew, Admiral Ackbar and Nien Nunb. What makes this movie so special are all the satisfying conclusions. Luke says goodbye to Yoda in a touching moment, Leia finding out that Luke is her brother is emotional but not cloying, the Rebel Alliance vs. Empire space sequence is a highlight, Han Solo is less of a scoundrel than ever, and Luke and Vader’s climactic father-son throwdown is a thing of redemptive wonder. Check yourself for a pulse if you’re not getting the chills after Vader tosses the Emperor down a shaft or when he says, “Let me look on you with my own eyes” to Luke before dying. A perfect ending – at least until ol’ George went and got rid of the Ewoks’ celebratory “Yub nub” song and stuck young Anakin in the Dead Jedi Ghost Club.\n\n3. 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' (2015)\n\nJ.J. Abrams introduces the best characters since fans first laid eyes on Han, Luke and Leia. Daisy Ridley's Rey is wicked smart and a capable hero in a universe with the baddies of the First Order on the warpath, John Boyega's ex-Stormtrooper Finn and Han are brothers from another mother, Oscar Isaac's pilot Poe is as cool and refreshing as a tall glass of blue milk, and Adam Driver's Kylo does his best Vader impression as a maniacal villain with some serious emotional issues. Abrams gets dangerously close to recycling old material, but instead he uses those familiar motifs to set the stage for an exciting third trilogy and crafts arguably the best final shot ever in a \"Star Wars\" film.\n\n2. 'Star Wars' (1977)\n\nWhether Han shot first or not, the original remains the real deal mostly because of all the great character moments. Luke is a whiny farmboy who has big dreams when he looks out over the two-sun horizon of Tatooine and he knows his destiny lies beyond. Old “Ben” Kenobi explaining to Luke that Darth Vader “murdered” his father Anakin, a scene that has much more richness revisiting it later. Han cynically explaining that hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster, though it seems like he’s trying to convince himself of this a bit. C-3PO constantly complaining to R2-D2 and Artoo taking it like a champ. And Leia putting on a brave face as she faces Vader and the destruction of her planet. Even Vader feeling there’s something up when Luke makes his trench run on the Death Star. We don’t need to know much about their history or where they come from to quickly fall in love with all these players as they begin their long journey.\n\n1. 'Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back' (1980)\n\nSimply the best. It might rank highly just due to AT-ATs, the Imperial Walkers that are arguably the coolest things that have ever stomped across a movie screen. Yet there is so much greatness to \"Empire\" on a surface level but also digging deeper. Vader’s reveal to Luke about being the kid’s father is an all-time truth bomb, and is made better when compared to Luke’s visions of the man behind the mask when training with Yoda. Luke training with Yoda and each kinda getting ticked off at the other is priceless. But really \"Empire\" is like a Star Destroyer full of these scenes: Han saving Luke in the deadly cold of Hoth by warming him up in Tauntaun guts; Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) betraying his old friend Han in order to save his city; Han and Leia’s \"I love you/I know” exchange before the smuggler gets frozen in carbonite. And on and on. You could argue that it’s one of the best sequels of all time but for this series at least, it’s the chapter that takes a cool sci-fi fairy tale with Arthurian overtones and sent it on its way to being a masterwork of storytelling.\n\nMore from the 'Star Wars' galaxy:\n\n'Return of the Jedi' turns 40:The 75 best 'Star Wars' characters, definitively ranked\n\nStar Wars Celebration:New movie will bring back Daisy Ridley as Rey, three films planned\n\n'Star Wars' fun facts:A stack of dirty dishes inspired the Millennium Falcon\n\n'The Mandalorian':How Baby Yoda, no longer a 'helpless little child,' grows up in Season 3\n\n'Andor':Diego Luna hopes his kids will be 'hooked' by the more grown-up 'Star Wars' series", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/entertainment/et-henry-thomas/index.html", "title": "'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' turns 40: Star Henry Thomas reflects on ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” celebrates its 40th anniversary, Henry Thomas, who starred as Elliott in the film, is reflecting on the movie and the fame that came with it.\n\nThomas spoke to CNN this week as an updated 4K Ultra HD version of the movie was released. It includes 45 minutes of new bonus footage of the Steven Spielberg directed classic.\n\nInitially, Thomas said, he didn’t understand the little alien who came to live in Elliott’s house.\n\n“I remember as a kid, you know, I was really into ‘Star Wars’ and ‘Indiana Jones,’ Thomas recalled. “I was given a script and I read it and I thought, there’s no laser fighting? There’s no starships, or battles, or fights?”\n\n“But it works. It works somehow,” he said.\n\nUntil he actually saw E.T. on set, Thomas said he thought “this guy with a finger that can heal you” was a silly concept. That changed when production started, the actor said, because Spielberg made everything so believable.\n\nHenry Thomas in a scene from \"E.T.\" Moviestore/Shutterstock\n\n“He was able to talk to you and make you feel like a peer and not feel as though you were being talked down to, which is important when you’re a kid,” Thomas said. “Especially when you’re a kid in an adult world, in an adult job.”\n\nAlthough Thomas hasn’t watched “E.T.” in 20 years (he said he can’t watch himself on screen), he understands why the movie has endured.\n\n“It speaks to our universal human compassion,” he said. “And we all have that. We all have the nurturer inside of us, right? So I think it speaks to that. It brings us back to being young.”\n\nThomas said he still gets recognized as the boy from “E.T.” but doesn’t mind. It was harder when he was a kid, a shock to the system when strangers across the world started saying hello.\n\nHenry Thomas in 2019. Nina Prommer/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\n“Suddenly, I wasn’t anonymous anymore. And that was a strange feeling as a boy,” Thomas recalled. “There was a book called ‘Never Talk to Strangers,’ and it was all about don’t talk to strangers, don’t talk to strange people that you don’t know, and unless your parents or your family know them, don’t talk to them, and then everybody’s talking to me.”\n\nAfter he got over the initial shock of fame, he learned that “E.T.” and the film’s director, have been wonderful to be associated with.\n\n“I imagine if it were a bad film that was universally reviled, we wouldn’t be talking about it now 40 years later,” Thomas said. “But also people, when they recognize me, they associate me with this great character, this kind of cool, rebellious young boy, and that’s a great thing.”\n\nDrew Barrymore and Henry Thomas in \"E.T.\" Bruce Mc Broom/Universal/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nIn addition to the never-before-seen footage of the movie, other bonus features in the new release include a look back on the movie, “40 Years of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,” along with “TCM Classic Film Festival: An Evening With Steven Spielberg.” There are also interviews from the cast and crew and a talk with composer John Williams about the movie’s famous score. (TCM and CNN are both part of Warner Bros. Discovery.)\n\nThomas said he recognizes how special “E.T.” is.\n\n“It is a rare and unique thing to be a part of, and I appreciate it so much more now because I know how rare it is to have a success in this industry,” he said. “Most films come and go in a couple of years and nobody remembers them.

But also, you are reminded, again and again, that this is a family reunion.\n\nHere then, in the spirit of family newsletters, a handful of takeaways:\n\nNo. 1: My favorite part of the weekend — everyone’s favorite part of the weekend — was the touching opening ceremony, a 40th anniversary gala that delivered more than it promised, and indeed felt like a family coming together after a long time, albeit stuck with each other and incapable of polite nothings. Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford explained to George Lucas why he can’t write dialogue. Liam Neeson made a Jar Jar Binks crack. Samuel L. Jackson lobbied to return to the series, despite his character’s death. Lucas, his seeming discomfort running neck and neck with his watery eyes, blurted that, look, “I’m not supposed to say this, but this was a film for 12-year-olds.”\n\nHamill said the fans were more supportive than his own family, and Ford, in a convincing deadpan, said that “Star Wars” has made “no difference in his life whatsoever.”\n\nThen John Williams and the Orlando Philharmonic played the film’s legendary score as the audience stood at attention, and finally, here is an image to burn in your head: 40 years of cast and crew, standing in the dark edges of the theater, listening and weeping.\n\nNo. 2: My next favorite thing at Star Wars Celebration was an art installation, designed by Rancho Obi-Wan, the vast Lucasfilm archive in Northern California, a Library of Congress for “Star Wars” toys and fan-created art and advertising materials and costumes and props from the series. The installation, evocative and touching, was a replica of a boy’s messy, middle-class bedroom, circa 1978, smattered with “Star Wars” bedsheets, music sheets, bootleg lamps, action figures, space ships, carpets, sleeping bags. I visited three times, and each time I witnessed fans of a certain age stop and stand a moment, then put hands to their mouths. Proust couldn’t have said it any better.\n\nNo. 3: On the third day of Celebration, an excited young boy dressed as Luke Skywalker shouted to an elevator full of passengers: “We just met Han Solo!” An adult rider asked: “The real Han?” And the boy’s grandmother said: “Come on. We’d be having sex right now.” On the first day of Celebration, coming out of the 40th anniversary event, a different young boy excitedly told his father: “My favorite part was when Han Solo came and then next best part was when the old man with the stick made the music happen.”\n\nNo. 4: Should the “Star Wars” movies end tomorrow — and Lucasfilm plans a couple more decades worth, so fat chance — there’s “Star Wars Rebels,” the lovingly smart animated series on Disney XD that’s attracted talent like Forest Whitaker and David Oyelowo. Or rather, there was “Rebels.” Dave Filoni, the series creator, as close to George Lucas’ creative heir apparent as the “Star Wars” universe has, stood before several thousand packed into a ballroom and said its fourth season, this fall, will be its last. He said every generation should get its own “Star Wars.” His eyes watered, and the audience gave a long standing ovation, a response as warm as the reaction to “The Last Jedi” a day earlier. If you have any doubt of Filoni’s star power, among the amateur Stormtroopers, there were cosplay Filonis, in his trademark cowboy hat and facial scuff.\n\nNo. 5: There’s so much licensed at Star Wars Celebration, it’s easy to forget, amid copyrights and trademarks, there were creations made from sheer love. Of course, that Dewback reptile couch, going for $10,000, came from love, too; same goes for that artist who sold “Star Wars” posters re-imagined as 1940s pulp-fiction covers. But what do you make of the full-scale models of Imperial Walkers (those metal moose-like weapons), and motorcycles retrofitted to resemble hover bikes? Lucasfilm art director Doug Chiang gave a fascinating talk on the company’s design philosophy — how the prequels draw from early 20th century handmade creations, while the original films are more rooted in the mass production and decay of post-WWII America. But where does Darryl Sorensen of Belvidere, Ill. (outside Rockford), fit in? He took the raw material of Chiang’s spaceships and redesigned his 2003 Saturn to resemble one. He commutes in it. It has targeting scopes and its own R2 droid. It sat on the exhibition floor here, much admired.\n\nNo. 6: One of the more pleasant surprises was running into Billy Dee Williams, Lando Calrissian himself. He wore a royal blue suit and matching sunglasses, rarely removing them throughout his “Smooth Talkin’” panel. At 80, he made a considerable case for his side career as a painter (he has work in the National Portrait Gallery), he said he will not be in a new “Star Wars” movie in the near future (“I’m not that interested in working that hard anymore”) and he held the sweet, calm, awkward energy of a man who had wandered in and sat bewildered, surrounded by people dressed like Lando Calrissian.\n\nNo. 7: Keeping thousands of “Star Wars” fans sitting patiently in a large, cramped room, especially after many had spent hours in line to get there, is a task no one deserves. Yet DJ Elliot and Mark Daniel, longtime Celebration MCs, have a niche: They asked for volunteers to give up their seats or they would start removing people, and the hall got quiet, until the joke hit slowly and rolled across the room. A couple of days later, Elliot asked if anyone (such as himself) met their spouse or partner through “Star Wars”? A surprisingly large number cheered. “I doubt George Lucas had that in mind,” Elliot said.\n\nNo. 8: It’s a good time to be a “Star Wars” fan: There is a new generation of fans/creators working alongside the first generation of fans/creators, intent on paying homage and making something new simultaneously. But one of the disappointments of the “Force Awakens” era was EA’s “Battlefront” video game, massively hyped, intricately detailed and deadly dull to play. It’s notable, then, that the panel for “Battlefront II” avoided those criticisms. Developers brought a beautiful trailer and a fresh take: The new game will be told from the POV of the Empire. It will bridge the gap between “Return of the Jedi” and “Force Awakens”; its characters so fully realized that a prequel novel, “Battlefront II: Inferno Squad,” is due in July. The game arrives Nov. 17. Leaving the panel, a young guy in a Darth Vader helmet, his voice made digitally baritone, boomed out: “Yes, but is it fun?”\n\nNo. 9: Speaking of vague promises of fun: Disney is building two giant “Star Wars”-themed worlds, in Orlando and Anaheim, set to open in 2019. To show the scale of the project, they brought footage of a large brown construction lot, inside which almost nothing is recognizable yet. They spoke of “going to ‘Star Wars,’” piloting the Millennium Falcon and drinking blue milk but offered almost no details of attractions. However, they did bring impressive concept art showing a slight Eastern influence — their “Star Wars” land is apparently set in Stevie Nicks’ living room. When the panel moderator asked if the land is a new planet, one of the Disney imagineers answered a bit sharply: “It’s new to you.”\n\nNo. 10: Star Wars Celebration, being a collector’s paradise, features a lot of Celebration-exclusives, available here for four days only, exclusive Legos, exclusive pins and posters. So give Gentle Giant, a Burbank, Calif., based geek-centric toymaker, props for making clever fun of exclusivity itself, and without ripping anyone off: They brought an $85 re-creation of the Trash Compactor monster from the Death Star — specifically, the weird green bird-lizard thing that was included with Kenner’s Death Star playset in 1978. The packaging played off the silver-striped Kenner boxes from vintage “Star Wars” toys, and the best touch: Also included were perfect replicas of Kenner’s cheap foam trash.\n\nNo. 11: Speaking of elaborate tributes to deep-cut “Star Wars” references: On Friday afternoon, roughly four dozen men, women and children, in matching orange space jumpsuits, chanting “Ice cream!” and carrying plastic ice-cream makers under their arms, made their way through the convention center, to the confusion of nearly everyone. Here’s the deal: That is called the Running of the Hoods, and it doesn’t get nerdier than this. Willrow Hood is the name of a character, seen for a fleeting second in “Empire Strikes Back,” running through Cloud City when Lando Calrissian orders its evacuation. The actor in the film, for reasons lost to time, was carrying an ice-cream maker. And so now, at every Celebration, in a bit of Pythonesque perversity, groups of fans periodically run through the crowds carrying ice-cream makers under their arms. And now you know.\n\nNo. 12: Attending a family reunion means inevitably being cornered by someone who wants to explain what they do with great intensity. You could do much worse than being cornered by “Star Wars” collectors. Their seminars drew some of the longest lines of attendees and offered some of the most improbable tales. Deep dives into food-related “Star Wars” collectibles anyone? Who knew about the great art found on a “Star Wars” tie-in from a Winnipeg restaurant chain? Or that Mexican cola caps with “Star Wars” images are fiercely sought? Another panel, on fakes and scandals, detailed master movie-poster forgeries and elaborate scams from former Kenner toymakers — all of which, even the bootlegs, can produce a piece worth something to someone, considering the market.\n\nNo. 13: Saturday ended the way you would have hoped, with thousands of “Star Wars” fans seated in a large darkened room, watching episode after episode, the smell of popcorn wafting over everything. After a day of hearing the series discussed abstractly and minutely, after hearing producers and designers promising even greater things in the future, it was nice, simple, a reminder of why everyone was here. Saturday night moved into Sunday morning, and Harrison Ford and Chewbacca ran into danger again, and in the back, a dad slept upright, his mouth hanging open. Beside him sat a young girl, his daughter, clutching a Princess Leia action figure. Wide awake, she elbowed her father:\n\n“Dad!

Celebrate Star Wars Day with these ideas for May the 4th", "text": "Holy Sith, you guys, Star Wars Day is upon us again.\n\n\"May the 4th\" is a day for all lovers of Jedi, the Resistance, the Skywalkers, the Hutts, Boba Fett, Baby Yoda, Gamorrean guards, Maz Kanata, General Grievous, Rancor Keeper and Jek Porkins (RIP) to unite and celebrate all there is in the galaxy far, far away. (Why May 4, you ask? Why, it's right there in the date, a play on \"May the Force be with you.\")\n\nThis Star Wars Day, fans will likely be in a nostalgic mood with the 40th anniversary of \"Return of the Jedi\" arriving later this month, though newer fans of Disney+ shows like \"Andor\" and \"The Mandalorian\" might be tucking into the 1983 film for the first time. (Fun fact for the kids: That's the one that spawned the \"It's a trap!\" meme. Thanks, Admiral Ackbar.)\n\nThe franchise has remained beloved to generations since George Lucas' original 1977 \"Star Wars,\" which means a lot of options forvarious ways to get your \"May the 4th\" on. Here are some of our favorites:\n\nMay the Fourth be with you!Celebrate Star Wars Day with our ultimate movie ranking\n\nWatch the 'Star Wars' movies. Or, more likely, watch them again.\n\nIf you can believe it, there are some people who've never seen \"Star Wars.\" But there's no excuse now that all nine movies in the Skywalker saga – as well as the spinoffs \"Rogue One\" and \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" – are a few clicks away on the Disney+ streaming service.\n\nLongtime fans can break out the Blu-rays and DVDs, hunt for VHS cassettes, or – if you want to really go old school – dust off the laser discs. And we do suggest you watch the original edition of \"Return of the Jedi,\" rather than the later special edition that took out the Ewoks' celebration song and inserted Christensen (rather than original \"Jedi\" star Sebastian Shaw,) into the Dead Jedi Club at the end.\n\n\"Yub nub.\" Never forget.\n\nStar Wars Celebration:New movie will bring back Daisy Ridley as Rey, three films planned\n\nBinge 'Star Wars' shows, including new animated series\n\nIf you haven't had the pleasure of seeing the completely adorable Baby Yoda (aka Grogu), now's the time to catch up with the first three seasons of the Disney+ Western-flavored series \"The Mandalorian\" – starring Pedro Pascal as the armored title gunslinger. Or if your tastes are more politically flavored, check out the intriguing drama \"Andor.\"\n\nDisney+ also offers a ton of animated projects for kids of all ages to watch. “Star Wars: The Bad Batch” follows the elite and experimental clones of the Bad Batch spinning out of the prequel-era \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars,\" which features Obi-Wan and Anakin before they turned into mortal enemies. Cartoon fans might also be down with the \"Tales of the Jedi,\" which revisits lightsaber warriors like Qui-Gon Jinn (voiced by Liam Neeson) and Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid) from back in the day; the second volume of \"Star Wars: Visions,\" an anthology featuring different anime creators and storytellers taking on aspects of the galaxy far, far away; and the new series \"Young Jedi Adventures,\" where Master Yoda teaches the Force to little rookies 200 years before \"The Phantom Menace.\"\n\nLet the blue milk flow and whip up some Mandalorian pog soup\n\nLuke Skywalker's Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru had blue milk on their breakfast table back on Tatooine, and you can enjoy it as well with these recipes. (Seriously, who doesn't want to try blue milk pudding?!)\n\nStarWars.com has a whole section of food-related fun for those who want to party hearty, including Imperial travel biscuits, Mandalorian pog soup and carbonite crunch bars. And if you need even more, the \"Star Wars: Galactic Baking\" cookbook is full of sweet treats to satisfy your little Jawas.\n\nMay the Fourth:What is Star Wars Day and when did it start?\n\nRead the further adventures of Darth Vader and pals\n\nIf the latest season of \"The Mandalorian\" and news of upcoming movies haven't been exciting enough, the rash of recent comic books and novels – most of them pretty rad – have fleshed out stories not seen in the movies. The flagship \"Star Wars\" comic is currently filling in the time between \"Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\" as Luke comes to grips with Darth Vader being his dad. (Forty-year-old spoiler alert!) And speaking of the former Anakin Skywalker, the \"Darth Vader – Black, White & Red\" anthology series features stories starring the Sith lord by a variety of writers and artists. (Comixology has a great digital sale going on to get newer comics and older series for cheap.)\n\nBook lovers will want to check out the \"Alphabet Squadron\" trilogy, which follows a group of New Republic pilots hunting a mysterious TIE Fighter group exacting revenge after the fall of the Empire (see: \"Return of the Jedi\"). If you want to take a trip in the wayback machine, \"Star Wars: Light of the Jedi\" begins the epic \"The High Republic\" saga set 200 years before the events of the movies.\n\nSay 'Punch it, Chewie!' to some kid activities\n\nStarWars.com offers a whole slew of things for crafty moms and dads to do with their children. Make a Baby Yoda pencil pouch, a Hoth snowglobe or a Death Star piñata, and print out various coloring sheets and word searches.\n\nIf your kids want some extra starpower, however, check out Daisy Ridley reading \"BB-8 On the Run,\" featuring her character Rey's little droid buddy. Plus, StarWarsKids.com is your one-stop resource for children to find out about all the characters and creatures fans love.\n\nBuy something fun and extremely nerdy\n\nLots of places discount their Star Wars merch on May 4, and StarWars.com has a roundup of all the coolest stuff, from Darth Vader luggage to Boba Fett tiki mugs. Lots of galactic video games are on sale, and if you've got time on your hands (and sufficient shelf space in your house), Lego is debuting its large collector's series version of the X-Wing Starfighter with Luke Skywalker and R2-D2 mini figures so you and your family can build to your heart's delight.\n\nAs the Mando might say, this is the way.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/04/28/new-movies-week-are-you-there-god-peter-pan-wendy/11726222002/", "title": "New movies this week: 'Are You There God?' and 'Peter Pan & Wendy'", "text": "Some of us saw \"Return of the Jedi\" five times at the movies in 1983, and those who've never had the pleasure are getting another chance.\n\nThis weekend, the \"Star Wars\" flick is back in theaters for its upcoming 40th anniversary.

But Margaret (Abby Ryder Fortson) is also dealing with her changing body, new friends, boys and her own religious identity, being the daughter of a Christian mom (Rachel McAdams) and a Jewish dad (Benny Safdie). Kelly Fremon Craig's insightful, touching adaptation is worthy of the influential source material.\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters\n\n'Are You There God?

Barrie's familiar fantasy world takes flight, as Wendy Darling (Ever Anderson) and her brothers are taken on a great adventure by Peter (Alexander Molony) and of course run afoul of Captain Hook (Jude Law). But there's just not enough freshness to justify its existence: Aside from writer-director David Lowery's lush visuals and more of a connection between Peter and Hook, it's the same \"Pan\" as it ever was.\n\nWhere to watch: Disney+\n\nIf you're in the mood for a kung fu Jane Austen tale: 'Polite Society'\n\nIn the refreshingly energetic action comedy, a Pakistani London teen (Priya Kansara) is an aspiring martial artist with big dreams of being a famous stuntwoman. But she first has to use her nifty spin kicks – a work in progress, to be honest – and youthful moxie to foil the suspiciously quick arranged marriage of her older sister (Ritu Arya).\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters\n\nIf you're keen on a horror movie about baby fever: 'Clock'\n\nAt 37, Ella (Dianna Agron) is a professional woman who hasn't had kids and wonders why she doesn't even like when they're around.

Great premise, just OK execution, but with a few really freaky visuals.\n\nWhere to watch: Hulu\n\nIf you're down for a blood-soaked World War II tale: 'Sisu'\n\nIn 1944 Finland, a grizzled prospector (Jorma Tommila) strikes gold, heads off to the nearest bank and runs into a bunch of Nazis holding several women hostage. Then they make the mistake of stealing his gold. Oops! Ultraviolent action ensues as our hero kills bad guys in all sorts of enjoyably brutal ways in the gleefully gory B-movie.\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters\n\nIf you're a sucker for shark movies: 'The Black Demon'\n\nJosh Lucas stars as an oil man tasked with inspecting a rig off the Mexican coast, so he decides to make it a vacation for his family. What he finds, though, is a gigantic megalodon shark seemingly ticked off because of all the oil leaking everywhere.

There was this Chewbacca toy — he has some belt thing he wears around his shoulder with small compartments on it, and in each of the compartments was a small Star Wars toy. My mom found one at a garage sale and bought it for me.\"\n\nKurt Russell (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2)\n\n\"Interviewing for the parts of Luke Skywalker and Han Solo. It's on tape, it exists — anyone out there can go to YouTube and see it. I didn't have any idea what I was talking about, something about a Death Star and a Millennium Falcon. I was actually in the final running, but I needed to give an answer to ABC to do a Western show. I asked George, 'Do you think you're going to use me?' He said, 'I don't know if I'm going to put you with him, or him with those two guys.' I gotta go to work, so I did the Western. I clearly made the right choice (laughs).\"\n\nJavier Bardem (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales)\n\n\"I’m 48, so that means the first one I saw (Star Wars), I was 8 years old. It’s funny, I remember myself being younger than that ... and being blown away. Like, 'Wow. What is that?' I saw it in Spanish — Darth Vader was speaking Spanish and all that. Then at school, I didn't play as Darth Vader or Luke Skywalker, I played spaceships. I was a spaceship. That’s what I wanted to be. I don’t know why. It’s crazy, huh?\"\n\nRidley Scott (Alien: Covenant director)\n\n\"I was depressed for a month when I saw Star Wars (in 1977). When I'm thinking of doing Tristan and Isolde, this guy (Lucas) has just done this film and I need to have my head examined. It threw me completely because I had just done The Duellists, which I thought was pretty good — we won a prize at Cannes (Film Festival) but they didn't know how to release it, God bless them. My friend and producer David Putnam said, 'Let's go and see this film that's playing at the Chinese. I feel it may be quite interesting. It's by a guy called George Lucas.' ... We went in and the theater was absolutely shuddering with expectation and I thought, 'This is what film ought to be.' \"\n\nJohn Cena (The Wall)\n\n\"I was very young and fell asleep in the theater during Empire Strikes Back. In my defense, everything was sold out, my dad took me to a late show, it was the first movie I ever saw in the theater and slept through half of it.

I wanted to be here with all of you because I know many of you feel the same way,\" said Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd, who spoke emotionally in front of a crowd of fans while wearing a custom white Tom Ford dress reminiscent of her mother's from the original 1977 Star Wars film.\n\nLegendary Star Wars composer John Williams conducted a stirring performance of Leia's Theme, and a video package featuring behind-the-scenes material and interviews with Fisher over the years left the audience sniffling.\n\nLucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and creator George Lucas also were on hand with a number of actors from the movie series, including Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams. Both Lucas and Kennedy teared up when speaking of Fisher near the end of the 90-minute panel.\n\n\"She had to hold her own against two big lugs, these goofballs who were screwing everything up. She was the boss and it was her war,\" Lucas said, recalling Fisher filming the first movie with Ford and Hamill, the Han and Luke to her Leia. \"She wore a dress during the whole thing, but she was the toughest one of the group.\"\n\nAdded Kennedy: \"She will be remembered forever, even by those who are not old enough yet to say the words, 'May the Force be with you.' \"\n\nThe 40 Years of Star Wars panel featured a variety of actors from the first six movies as well as Lucas remembering the origins of the franchise. His biggest cheer came when he revealed to fans that Star Wars is a film for 12-year-olds.\n\n\"You’re gonna go into the big world, you’re moving away from your parents being the center focus, you’re probably scared, you don’t know what's going to happen and these are some of the things you should pay attention to: friendships, honestly, trust and doing the right thing, living on the light side, avoiding the dark side,\" Lucas said.\n\nHayden Christensen remarked that playing Anakin Skywalker in the prequel trilogy was \"a childhood dream come true,\" though he admitted Lucas had to tell him to stop making lightsaber sounds during action scenes. \"It was a difficult habit to break.\"\n\nMark Hamill joined Lucas to talk about the casting of Luke Skywalker and revealed he wanted Lucas to get rid of Leia's iconic line to Luke, \"Aren't you a little short for a Stormtrooper?\" “I like short people,\" Lucas said. \"There’s the secret right here: I can’t even reach the floor.”\n\nHamill and Ford, attending his first Celebration, both poked fun at Lucas' word-spaghetti dialogue. \"I said to George, 'You can type this stuff, but you can’t say it. Move your mouth while you’re typing it,' \" Ford said.\n\nThe erstwhile Han Solo was in a good humor, doling out hugs to old co-stars like Peter Mayhew, who played Chewbacca, and taking jokes in stride about his recent flying snafu. Host Warwick Davis said he was happy Ford was there \"considering you landed your plane on I-4,\" with Ford responding, \"It was a good landing.\"\n\nFisher's co-stars also remembered her Star Wars career — \"She’s a hell of a Rebel but she’s also a beautiful princess,\" Mayhew said — though the most touching words came from Lourd. She spoke about how much the films and the fandom meant to her — she knows Fisher's entire \"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi\" speech by heart — as well as to her mom.\n\n\"That was why she loved you, because you accepted and embraced all of her: the strong soldier of a woman she was and also the vulnerable side of her who often openly fought her own dark side, knowing early on that we all have a dark side of our own,\" Lourd said. \"Nothing about her was a performance. She loved you, she loved these movies, she loved the people she got to make them with, and she loved this incredible character she got to create, this force called Leia.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/13"}]}

But in Iowa he said those circumstances didn't stop him from eventually walking the halls of Congress as a conservative.\n\n\"I can go as high as my character, my education, and my perseverance will take me,\" Scott said during his speech at Drake University. \"I bear witness to that. I testify to that.\"\n\nStay in the conversation on politics: Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nDavid Oman, a former Iowa GOP chair who attended one of the speeches, said segments of the conservative movement are yearning for a more uplifting candidacy that Scott could deliver.\n\nThe senator's biography, he said, contrasts with how Democrats describe the country and reminds him of a past Republican president.\n\n\"His message was spot on. I remember the ’70s and ’80s and I could almost say it was Reagan-esque,\" Oman said. \"It's sunny optimism and he has a compelling, humble, personal story, but a very optimistic take on the future of America.\"\n\nCan a 'sunrise' conservative beat Trumpism?\n\nScott said rather than compromising, the GOP should be about \"winning converts.\"\n\nAnd he gave a subtle nod to the 40th president when he told Iowans last week how the conservative \"movement can once again carry 49 states and the popular vote.\"\n\n\"This is what I see,\" Scott added. \"A new American sunrise.\"\n\nThe arch of Scott's life story appeals to a contingency of voters that could be an asset in a primary largely defined by former President Donald Trump running again, Republican strategists say.\n\n\"That is going to stand out in this field because a lot of people, especially Trump, are going to be anxious to describe America as though it's a hellscape,\" GOP strategist and political commentator Scott Jennings told USA TODAY.\n\nAnd unlike many of the other current or prospective contenders Scott isn't bound to defend everything the former president did or said because – he never worked for Trump.\n\nPolitics:Former Arizona AG withheld report that debunked 2020 election fraud claims\n\n\"So if you're Mike Pence, Mike Pompeo or Nikki Haley, and you're out there trying to convince a bunch of Trump supporters to switch, well, why would I buy Coke Zero when I can buy Coke classic,\" Jennings said. \"Scott doesn't have this problem.\"\n\nBursting the Trump-DeSantis bubble\n\nGOP consultant Liz Mair, a former spokeswoman for John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, said Scott is well liked among right-leaning activists, and is recognized as one of the smarter crop of possible candidates.\n\nBut she doubts that any \"sort of sunny cheery optimism is what sells\" with a base that wants to fight liberal America at the moment.\n\n\"I don't know that they see (Scott) as soft, but I think that the Republican base is pretty well convinced the country's going to hell in a handbasket right now,\" Mair said.\n\nThe big test for Scott if he runs, she said, will be getting voters to pay attention to him. Many – especially in the right-wing media ecosystem – are ping-ponged between Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, she said.\n\nA Feb. 16 survey by Quinnipiac University showed Scott barely registering at 1% among GOP voters when asked who'd they support for president, behind Haley, Pence and Pompeo.\n\n\"Anybody who doesn't have the big broad name ID and appeal of those two, it's going to be tough to build a campaign,\" Mair said.\n\nScott's money matches his moves\n\nCoupled with the Iowa visit, Scott's money indicates his political scope is bigger than being South Carolina's junior senator.\n\nSince being appointed to the seat in 2013, he has emerged as a fundraising powerhouse who has attracted mega-donors.\n\nDuring the 2022 campaign, for instance, Scott hauled in $43.1 million for his reelection, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\nA Scott-aligned super PAC, Opportunity Matters Fund Action, has almost matched that figure, raising about $37.3 million, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nThe group used that war chest to help a handful of Republican Senate candidates during the midterms by dropping millions in those races, in addition to doling out $250,000 in digital ads promoting Scott a month after he coasted to reelection.\n\nThe anti-woke Black Republican?\n\nScott holds many of the traditional conservative views on education, abortion, immigration and taxes, which he touted during the Iowa trip.\n\nAnd like other GOP presidential contenders, he underscored how the country must resist the \"grievance\" politics of the left on cultural issues. Yet Scott has spoken about how racism has negatively impacted his life.\n\nTwice he evoked how \"woke corporations\" appoint themselves as decision-makers, and that \"woke prosecutors and anti-cop activists\" are responsible for violent crime.\n\nBut Scott has also at different times in his career acknowledged the existence of racial bias, and the need to tackle it through public policy.\n\nIn an op-ed for USA TODAY in 2021, when pursuing bipartisan police reform legislation in the wake of George Floyd's murder, he spoke about being \"pulled over for simply having an improper headlight\" at age 21 and how the officer called him \"boy.\"\n\nStephen Graves, a University of Missouri political science professor in the Black Studies department, said the Scott split narrative is about establishing a brand of conservatism that appeals to white voters who are more moderate on cultural issues.\n\n\"Tim Scott really appeases that group of Republicans who understand the times we're in and knowing that they're not going to win future elections in a diversifying culture if they're wedded to that Trump rhetoric,\" he said.\n\nThee 2024 Republican field looks to already be the most racially diverse in the party's history with Haley and now 37-year-old entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy in the race.\n\nGraves said it will be telling to see how the base and potential rivals will react to Scott's dueling views on race.\n\n\"They want a Ron DeSantis-type who is going to stick it to the libs, and all the kind of rhetoric that comes along with that,\" he said.\n\n\"They're looking for a champion.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/04/12/sen-tim-scott-launches-exploratory-committee-president/11647809002/", "title": "Sen.

Other messengers that come along, it's a bit of a different story.\"\n\nScott focuses on America's progress, but not 'colorblind' to its past\n\nMuch like other GOP presidential contenders, Scott goes after Democrats and accuses them of being the party that practices \"grievance\" politics.\n\nIn the exploratory announcement video, the senator said Biden and his allies promote \"victimhood\" over \"personal responsibility.\" He goes as far to argue his political opponents are guilty of \"indoctrinating our children to believe we live in an evil country.\"\n\nScott has used many of the same lines his GOP counterparts have on the trail. He has evoked how \"woke\" companies appoint themselves decision-makers, and that \"woke prosecutors and anti-cop activists\" are responsible for violent crime.\n\nYet as a senator Scott has spoken openly about racism, admitting how it has negatively impacted his life. He described some of it in a series of Senate floor remarks in 2016.\n\nIn one of those speeches, Scott talked openly about “the humiliation” of being pulled over by police officers more than half a dozen times in one year.\n\n\"I do not know many African American men who do not have a very similar story to tell no matter their profession, no matter their income, no matter their disposition in life,\" he said.\n\nAt different times he has been involved in major legislative efforts attempting to tackle bias and discrimination through public policy, such as passing a landmark civil rights bill that made lynching a federal hate crime or the failed attempt at pursuing bipartisan police reform legislation in the wake of George Floyd's murder.\n\nDuring those behind-the-scenes negotiations, Scott spoke about being \"pulled over for simply having an improper headlight\" at age 21 and how the officer called him \"boy.\"\n\nScott jabbed Trump on Charlottesville\n\nIf Scott officially enters the 2024 fray, he will eventually have to contend with the presumed front-runner: former President Donald Trump.\n\nUnlike other GOP hopefuls, such as Nikki Haley and Mike Pence, Scott didn't work in the Trump administration which Republican strategists have told USA TODAY could be an asset in a crowded primary.\n\nIn terms of race relations, the GOP advisor to the campaign added how Scott has \"historically\" confronted Trump when necessary. He will again if there's a moment or issue that needs to be addressed, the source said.\n\nIn 2017, Scott said Trump's \"moral authority\" as president was \"compromised\" when the former reality TV star said that “many sides” were to blame for the violence during a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nScott was blunt that he would work with Trump when they saw eye-to-eye, but that he would speak out when the two disagreed.\n\nAfter the two met to discuss Trump's response, Scott told USA TODAY at the time that he tried to put the comments \"in a historical context\" for the president to understand.\n\nPolitics: Police documents detailing President Biden security information found on Belfast street\n\nMore: Anti-abortion group urges federal appeals court to uphold suspension of mifepristone approval\n\n\"I certainly started my comments on why I found the president’s comments unsettling and went over his comments,\" Scott said in 2017.\n\nThe New York indictment may benefit Trump in the short term with GOP primary voters and his rivals who, including Scott, criticized the district attorney. But multiple polls show a growing numbers Americans are taking notice of his legal troubles and not in a good way.\n\nAn ABC News/Ipsos poll released this month show Trump’s unfavorable rating had climbed to 61%, up from 55% a week prior. Another April survey by Economist/YouGov showed Biden holding a slight edge in terms of favorability.\n\nWhether or not Scott speaks out against Trump directly, in the wake of Charlottesville he took note of how Trump’s \"coattails (were) shorter\" as a result.\n\nAnd as in other instances where racism was the topic, he spoke candidly about his views.\n\n“Racism is real,\" Scott said in a 2017 interview with VICE News. \"It is alive.

While Trump has remained the front runner for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, it’s uncertain how his historic criminal indictment will affect his candidacy.\n\nNikki Haley: Haley announced her presidential campaign in February, making her the first prominent Republican to enter the 2024 race and challenge Trump for the GOP nomination.\n\nAsa Hutchinson: Hutchinson announced his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination earlier this month, labeling himself as a “non-Trump” candidate. Hutchinson is set to formally launch his presidential campaign on April 26.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: Biotech entrepreneur and investor Vivek Ramaswamy is also among the growing list of candidates seeking to be the Republican presidential nominee in 2024.

If elected, the South Carolina lawmaker would make history as the country’s first Black Republican president.\n\nRon DeSantis: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is another favorite for the GOP 2024 nomination – but second to Trump – despite having not yet launched a campaign for president. However, DeSantis is expected to announce his bid, especially as he’s been making rounds across the country, including stops in key early voting states.\n\nMore:Tim Scott moves closer to challenging Trump, other GOP rivals in 2024, forms exploratory committee\n\nMike Pence:Former Vice President Mike Pence is also among the group of Republicans considering a bid for the White House.

Tim Scott, R-S.C., headlined a town hall Monday in the key early voting state of New Hampshire, where he blasted President Joe Biden over the nation's debt and border crisis.\n\nHe fielded questions from Granite State voters for almost an hour at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College, offering a mix of quips and digs among his answers in what was all but a campaign stop before he is expected to officially announce a presidential campaign on May 22 in North Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nAfter Noel Licata, 18, from Tilton asked the South Carolina senator what qualities make a good role model, Scott asked how old he was.\n\n“Ok you can vote, I’ll answer this question,” Scott joked.\n\nStay in the conversation on politics:Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nScott: 'The proof of my life disproves your lies'\n\nThe South Carolina senator has campaigned heavily on his background as a child of poverty and the grandson of a man who had to drop out of school to pick cotton.\n\n“He was forced out of school and had to go start picking cotton, but he lived long enough to watch his grandson pick out a seat in Congress,” Scott said. “The proof of my life disproves your lies.”\n\nScott has not shied away from his future possible status as the only Black Republican candidate in the 2024 race – his ascension from poverty to becoming a U.S. Senator is proof, he argues, the American dream is still possible.\n\n“This may surprise some of y’all, I’m Black,” Scott quipped after being asked about how the GOP can appeal to voters of color.\n\nRelatedWhat Sen. Tim Scott does and doesn't say about race in 2024 exploratory announcement\n\nScott takes aim at Biden over southern border\n\nAs Title 42, a Trump-era COVID policy that made it easier to expel migrants at the southern border, is set to expire and result in a migration surge, Scott pinned the crisis at the border on President Joe Biden.\n\n\"If you don’t control your back door of your house, it’s not your house,” Scott said. “If you don’t control your southern border, it’s not your country.”\n\nWhen asked how he would solve the migrant crisis, Scott put it simply: keep constructing former President Donald Trump’s wall at the southern border, albeit without mentioning his potential 2024 rival by name.\n\n“We have to have actual dedicated resources for building a physical impediment. Technology in of itself won’t do,” Scott said.\n\nRelatedPentagon to send 1,500 active-duty troops to US-Mexico border to help with surge of migrants\n\nClean debt ceiling increase?

If you’re suffering from insomnia, give me a call, I’ll walk you through the numbers of the budget and you will take a good nap,” Scott said, touting his credentials as the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nAnd as the country nears a first-ever default as early as June 1, Scott went after Biden and congressional Democrats for their push for a clean debt ceiling increase without the spending cuts congressional Republicans have demanded.\n\n“No one thinks it’s a good idea,” Scott said of a clean debt ceiling increase with no strings attached. “We need a balanced budget.”\n\n'The luxury of shuttle diplomacy':McConnell could use ties to McCarthy and Biden to end debt fight\n\nN.H. voter: 'I'd vote for Tim Scott, but today's not the election'\n\nNew Hampshire is attempting to fend off a plan from the Democratic National Committee that stripped it of its first-in-the-nation primary status, which has become core to the state’s political identity. Scott sought to directly court New Hampshire voters in the state that has paved the path for multiple presidential hopefuls, even at the expense of his own home state of South Carolina, which the DNC newly crowned as the first state on its nominating calendar earlier this year.\n\n“Not gonna happen,” Scott told voters on whether he would support such a move in a line that perhaps received the most applause from the crowd. “They will hear this in South Carolina by the way too … I love being the first in the South but New Hampshire is staying the first-in-the-nation.”\n\nHolderness voters Peter Barach and Debra Barach, 58 and 46 respectively, said they were impressed by Scott’s laid back personality and his traditional conservative campaign platform.\n\n“I’m not a religious person, but I believe in faith,” Peter Barach said of Scott’s Faith in America Tour. “Sitting down with him, listening to Tim Scott face to face goes a long way.”\n\nAnd Licata, who only recently turned 18 and has yet to register to vote, said Scott exemplified his own values. Licata thinks the two frontrunners in the GOP primary, Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis are too “inflammatory.”\n\n“I’d like to see somebody who can unify the nation more,” Licata said, adding he is still completely undecided on a candidate. “If I were to vote today, I’d vote for Tim Scott, but today’s not the election.”\n\nScott promised, even before formally declaring his candidacy, that he will be in New Hampshire again, a lot.\n\n“I will be back so often that you’ll say, ‘He’s back again?’” Scott promised.\n\nBiden vs. TrumpBig challenges, but opposite ones, as 2024 rematch begins – Poll", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/05/22/senator-tim-scott-announces-hes-running-for-president/70244257007/", "title": "Senator Tim Scott announces he's running for president", "text": "Hi OnPolitics readers.

How will it affect existing HBO Max and Discovery+ subscribers? What about HBO cable subscribers? What shows and movies will be on it?

It's HBO Max and Discovery+ combined\n\nTwo years ago WarnerMedia, which owned media brands including HBO, Warner Bros., DC Entertainment and CNN, merged with Discovery, owner of Discovery Channel, TLC, HGTV, Food Network and Animal Planet. The newly created Warner Bros. Discovery promised a supercharged streaming service that would combine HBO Max from one company with Discovery+ from the other.\n\nThe new service will now host a diverse array of programming, from HBO titles like \"Succession\" and \"House of the Dragon\" to dozens of reality TV series from Discovery's portfolio, from \"Naked and Afraid\" to \"Love it or List It\" to \"Chopped.\"\n\nHow much will Max cost?\n\nThe company said Wednesday that the rebranded service will not change its price from the HBO Max prices. Here is a breakdown of all plan options:\n\nAd-Lite for $9.99/month: Includes two concurrent streams, 1080p HD resolution, no offline downloads, 5.1 surround sound quality.\n\nIncludes two concurrent streams, 1080p HD resolution, no offline downloads, 5.1 surround sound quality.

Discovery+ will remain available to subscribe to separately, for $4.99 a month (or $6.99 ad-free). But a stand-alone version of Max without the Discovery content will not be available\n\nWill cable HBO subscribers still get access to the Max streaming service?\n\nYes.\n\nIs Max going to cancel and disappear my favorite shows and movies as HBO Max did?\n\nUnder WBD leadership, HBO Max made controversial cost-cutting decisions that included shelving the mostly-finished \"Batgirl\" film and removing shows like \"Westworld\" from the streaming service entirely. Several projects were canceled to take advantage of tax write-offs, enabling the company to deduct the value of production costs for projects it deemed unpromising or that weren't prompting new subscriber signups. However, leadership has indicated that those write-downs won't be a major part of the strategy moving forward.\n\nWhat new shows can I expect on Max?\n\nWBD executives promised 40 new shows and seasons every month on Max.

Rowling.\n\nSome of the other new shows and films he announced included: A series about Colin Farrell's Batman villain \"The Penguin,\" \"It\" prequel series \"Welcome to Derry,\" a new \"Big Bang Theory\" spinoff; and unscripted series with Robert Downey Jr. and Jason Bateman, Will Arnett and Sean Hayes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2022/08/04/hbo-max-discovery-warner-bros-merger-explained/10234294002/", "title": "HBO Max and Discovery+: The merging streaming services, explained", "text": "What the heck is going on at HBO Max? What does it have to do with Discovery+?\n\nHBO Max, the home of prestigious HBO TV shows, Warner Bros. and DC Comics films, along with original series like \"Sex and the City\" revival \"And Just Like That…,\" is going through some major changes this week, as its new owner plots a new strategy for the streamer and its affiliated entertainment brands, including Warner Bros. movie studios, TBS, TNT and CNN.\n\nBut in summer 2023, starting in the U.S., Warner Bros. Discovery will begin the process of combining HBO Max with its corporate cousin Discovery+, the home of reality TV from the likes of Food Network, HGTV, Magnolia Network, TLC, and Discovery Channel. This will create one big streaming service under the corporate umbrella of Warner Bros. Discovery. But what does that really mean for subscribers to each service?\n\nWe explain why the popular streaming services, which have a combined 92 million subscribing households (most to HBO Max), are undergoing a makeover.\n\nWhy is HBO Max changing at all? Why is it combining with Discovery+?\n\nHBO Max is the streaming service started by the company formerly known as WarnerMedia, which included premium cable channel HBO, but also programming from cable networks including TBS, TNT and CNN and the Warner Bros. film studio. WarnerMedia was formerly owned by AT&T, but the conglomerate announced in 2021 that it would spin off WarnerMedia and merge it with Discovery, a company that includes networks like Discovery Channel, HGTV, Food Network, and streaming service Discovery+. The merger became official in April, and the new company is now called Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nHow well do you know 'Game of Thrones'?:Take the quiz\n\nThe deal put HBO Max under new management, with its own ideas about what HBO Max should be. CEO David Zaslav confirmed what leadership has said previously in an earnings call with investors on Thursday: Warner Bros. Discovery plans to eventually combine HBO Max and Discovery+ into one. \"Our main priority is launching an integrated (streaming) service,\" he said. The service will roll out in the U.S. in the summer of 2023 (and later in other markets), and the company will release more specific details in the months to come.\n\nIn the meantime, bits of Discovery+ are heading to HBO Max and vice versa.\n\nMore:The 50 best TV shows on HBO Max\n\nWhat Discovery shows are coming to HBO Max? Magnolia and more\n\nHBO Max is getting a big addition from its new corporate cousin: Chip and Joanna Gaines' Magnolia Network.\n\nHBO Max announced Thursday that \"select content\" from Magnolia, currently available to stream on Discovery+, will arrive on HBO Max on Sept. 30, including \"Fixer Upper: Welcome Home,\" \"Magnolia Table with Joanna Gaines,\"and all five seasons of the original \"Fixer Upper.\" The Gaines' latest series, \"Fixer Upper: The Castle,\" will premiere concurrently on Magnolia Network, HBO Max and Discovery+ on Oct. 14.\n\nWhat about Warner Bros. movies on HBO Max?\n\nOn Wednesday, news broke that Warner Bros. had axed a planned and mostly completed \"Batgirl\" film that was scheduled to premiere on the service, as well as DC Comics' \"Wonder Twins\" and \"Scoob!: Holiday Haunt,\" previously due this holiday season.\n\nIn addition to the canceled films, fans and reporters noticed Thursday that six HBO Max original movies had been removed from the platform, including \"Moonshot,\" starring Cole Sprouse and Lana Condor and Seth Rogen's \"An American Pickle.\" (The titles are still available to purchase from video on demand sites).\n\nIn the earnings call, Zaslav was firm that he does not believe in releasing films straight to streaming. \"We have a different view on releasing direct to streaming films and we have taken steps to course correct the previous strategy,\" he said, referring to previous CEO Jason Kilar's plan to offer original movies on HBO Max.\n\nMore:'Batgirl' star Leslie Grace posts tribute to fans after Warner Bros. axes $90 million film\n\nWhat other changes could come? For starters, CNN goes to Discovery+\n\nDiscovery+ announced Thursday that CNN programs such as \"Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy,\" \"Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown\" and \"United Shades of America with W. Kamau Bell\" will be available on Discovery+ on Aug. 19 in a new \"CNN Originals\" hub. (Bourdain's first travel and food show, \"No Reservations,\" was already on Discovery+ because it originally aired on The Travel Channel). Earlier this year, the CNN+ streaming service was scrapped by Warner Bros. Discovery leadership after just a month.\n\nAs far as other changes, kids and family programming is no longer a priority for the new company. CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels mentioned on the earnings call that they are unlikely to pursue new projects, although the company has a library of content from \"Looney Tunes\" to \"Animaniacs.\"\n\nZaslav also addressed worries that HBO will cut back on the number of shows it produces. \"We’re going to spend significantly more on the HBO Max product,\" he said. \"We're going to spend more money on content. We're a content company.\" (He did not elaborate on whether that means fewer but costlier shows).\n\nMore:The 10 best TV shows on Discovery+: From '90-Day Fiance' to 'MythBusters' to Anthony Bourdain", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/05/22/hbo-max-is-now-max-the-new-streaming-service-explained/70235353007/", "title": "HBO Max is now Max: The 'new' streaming service, explained", "text": "HBO Max is dead.

What happens to your favorite shows and movies? Will prices increase? Here's everything you need to know about the \"new\" streaming service, which brings together a diverse array of content, from \"Naked and Afraid\" to \"The White Lotus.\"\n\nWhen does HBO Max become Max? What happens to existing subscribers?\n\nAs of May 23, HBO Max is rebranded and replaced by Max. Users should still be able to access the service using their existing passwords and logins on their devices. You won't pay any more for Max than you did for HBO Max, at least until November 2023. Your settings and watch history should stay the same, and you should be able to pick up where you left off for any show or movie you were in the middle of enjoying. HBO cable subscribers, who get a free HBO Max subscription, will now have a free Max subscription.\n\nMore:HBO Max and Discovery+ are now one 'Max'\n\nWhat can I watch on Max?\n\nMax includes all programming from both HBO Max and Discovery+. That means you'll find episodes of \"Succession,\" \"Hacks\" and \"The Last of Us\" alongside \"Love It or List It,\" \"90-Day Fiancé,\" \"Dr. Pimple Popper\" and \"Guy's Grocery Games.\" It also includes many recent and classic Warner Bros. films such as \"The Batman\" and \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"\n\nSome new content will be available as of May 23, including the revival of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's \"Clone High,\" \"Gremlins\" sequel series \"Gremlins: Secrets of the Mogwai\" and \"SmartLess,\" a docuseries following Jason Bateman, Will Arnett, and Sean Hayes as they record their podcast on the road.\n\nHow much does Max cost?\n\nHere is a breakdown of all plan options and prices:\n\nAd-Lite for $9.99/month: Includes two concurrent streams, 1080p HD resolution, no offline downloads, 5.1 surround sound quality.\n\nIncludes two concurrent streams, 1080p HD resolution, no offline downloads, 5.1 surround sound quality. Ad Free for $15.99/month: Two concurrent streams, 1080p HD, up to 30 offline downloads, 5.1 surround sound quality.\n\nTwo concurrent streams, 1080p HD, up to 30 offline downloads, 5.1 surround sound quality. Ultimate Ad Free for $19.99/month (new): Four concurrent streams, up to 4K Ultra HD resolution, 100 offline downloads, Dolby Atmos sound quality.\n\nWill I still be able to get Discovery+ as a standalone service? What about HBO Max?\n\nYes. Discovery+ is still available to subscribe to separately, for $4.99 a month (or $6.99 ad-free). But a standalone version of HBO Max without the Discovery content is not available.\n\nIs Max going to cancel or drop my favorite shows and movies as HBO Max did?\n\nHBO Max made controversial cost-cutting decisions last year that included shelving the mostly finished \"Batgirl\" film and removing shows like \"Westworld\" from the streaming service (Disney+ recently followed suit). Several projects were canceled to take advantage of tax write-offs, enabling the company to deduct the value of production costs for projects it deemed unpromising or that weren't prompting new subscriber sign-ups. However, the company says those removals won't be a major part of its strategy moving forward.\n\nIs a 'Harry Potter' reboot coming to Max?\n\nYes. Executives in April announced a plan for a decadelong TV series adaptation of \"Harry Potter\" with new actors in the iconic roles, and executive produced by author J.K. Rowling. Other expected new shows for Max include \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight,\" a new \"Game of Thrones\" spinoff, produced by George R.R. Martin; a series about Colin Farrell's Batman villain \"The Penguin\"; \"It\" prequel series \"Welcome to Derry\"; and an undetermined new \"Big Bang Theory\" spinoff.\n\nMore:Here's everything we know about the 'Harry Potter' TV series so far", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewed/2023/04/14/how-watch-hgtvs-barbie-dreamhouse-challenge-hbos-max/11657442002/", "title": "How to watch HGTV's 'Barbie Dreamhouse Challenge' on HBO's Max", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

A perfectly nice monster, of course. It was Elmo.\n\nElmo asked Platt what was his favorite music to sing. Cookie Monster interrupted to ask what was Platt’s favorite cookie. “Oatmeal chocolate chip,” replied Platt in one exchange.\n\n“Good answer,” said Cookie Monster. “But, then again, there’s no such thing as bad cookie.” After a stellar group rendition of the song “C Is for Cookie,” Elmo presented his guest with a placemat. “A placemat for Ben Platt,” commented Cookie, proud of the rhyme.\n\nThis meeting of furry monsters and human singer is part of a new Sesame Workshop family friendly talk show on HBO Max called “The Not Too Late Show with Elmo.” It begins streaming May 27.\n\nOther guests during the initial 13-week episode run include Kacey Musgraves, the Jonas Brothers, John Mulaney, Lil Nas X, Miles Brown, Blake Lively, Dan + Shay, Andy Cohen, Hoda Kotb, Josh Groban, Olivia Wilde, Sara Bareilles, Jason Sudeikis, Sofia Carson and Ciara.\n\nThe show is the brainchild of Elmo — don’t tell him differently — and employs his Muppet friends: Cookie Monster is the sidekick, Rosita is the stage manager, Abby Cadabby is the writer, and various monsters are the directors, riffing on the idea that everyone wants to direct.\n\n“Throughout the 15-minute duration of the episode, Elmo is talking about one specific bedtime ritual, like putting on your pajamas or reading a book or brushing your teeth,” said Ben Lehmann, executive producer of “Sesame Street” and “The Not-Too-Late Show.”\n\n“Obviously, the whole thing is meant to be playful and a fun family experience so rather than spend a lot of time talking, we spend more time playing games like Hot Potato or Tic-Tac-Toe,” he said.\n\nThe talk show business may be ruthless, but late night hosts Jimmy Fallon and John Oliver make appearances and help sharpen Elmo’s interview skills. Elmo challenges Fallon to a stare contest, which is not entirely fair since Elmo doesn’t have eyelids.\n\nDuring a visit to “The Not-Too-Late Show” set in New York City before the pandemic shutdown, the technology used was both high-tech and low. Three digital cameras, a teleprompter and a microphone boom were employed, but a half-moon prop was dangled over Elmo’s desk on a pole with a wire, like a fishing gear. A crew member cut fake cookies into a crescent shape.\n\nThe team putting the show together was able to keep on schedule despite the virus pandemic. Equipment was moved to staffer’s homes so post-production, editing and sound effects could be done remotely.\n\nThe show’s emphasis on children’s nighttime routines comes exactly at a time when parents are looking for stable schedules. Sesame Workshop has also offered helpful resources and activities online during the pandemic. “It’s an important time to be there for families and kids, so we’re trying to do our part as best we can,” Lehmann said.\n\nIn an interview after the taping, Elmo said he was having a great time. “It’s wonderful meeting new people. Elmo gets to meet new guests on the show every day,” he said. “Elmo gets to learn about everybody, too. It’s wonderful.”\n\nHe said his favorite games include teddy bear dressing races, monster makeovers, freeze dances and tricycle races. Elmo promised plenty of music, sketches and games.\n\n“There’s a lot of good stuff in store. You’ll see.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2020/12/17/how-watch-hbo-max-roku/3938073001/", "title": "How to watch HBO Max on Roku", "text": "— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors. Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nIt's been a big year for HBO Max. The streaming giant only launched in May, but since then, it's established itself as a formidable player in the streaming wars, holding its own against strong competition from Amazon Prime and Disney+, and debuting the entire Warner Bros. 2021 lineup exclusively on the app.\n\nThe only catch? You couldn't watch HBO Max on Roku—until now.\n\nRoku and WarnerMedia (which owns HBO Max) announced December 16, 2020, that they reached an agreement that would finally allow Roku users to access the HBO Max app. This solves the seven-month headache Roku users have been experiencing since the new HBO streaming service debuted.\n\nStreaming breakthrough: HBO Max hits Roku devices Thursday ahead of 'Wonder Woman 1984' debut\n\nStarting December 17, 2020, Roku users can download HBO Max directly from the Roku Store. Here's what you need to know about HBO Max before you start watching.\n\nWhat is HBO Max?\n\nHBO Max is home to all HBO original content—like The Wire, Sex and the City, and The Sopranos—as well as a back catalog of cult-favorite TV series and movies, including Rick and Morty, Doctor Who, South Park, and more. The new streaming service also features original content, like Lovecraft Country, The Flight Attendant, and The Undoing.\n\nGet the latest on streaming, deals and more by signing up for our weekly newsletter. It’s free and you can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nHBO Max features more streaming content than its previous two iterations HBO Now and HBO Go, which predominantly featured content from the HBO suite alone. HBO Max features not only HBO original content, but a host of series and movies from big-name entertainment companies as well.\n\nHow do you watch HBO Max on Roku?\n\nWatching HBO Max on your Roku is now painlessly easy: Download the HBO Max app from your Roku Store and start watching.\n\nPrior to the agreement between Roku and WarnerMedia, we recommended hooking up your laptop to your television or purchasing a smart TV capable of hosting the app.\n\nReviewed: The best Roku devices of 2020\n\nThe agreement between the two companies is a huge move for the streaming app. Consumers have been calling for an answer to HBO's Roku problem since May, when the app launched. The move is a huge win to Roku users who have been begging for a better way to watch HBO original content without needing to purchase new equipment.\n\nHow much does HBO Max cost?\n\nHBO Max starts at $14.99 per month. If you sign up between December 3, 2020, and January 31, 2021, you can save 20% on your membership by pre-paying for six months upfront. You can purchase six months of the service for $69.99, saving about $20 on your subscription.\n\nAlternatively, if you're an AT&T Customer, you may be eligible for a free year of HBO Max with your phone or internet service.\n\nOne piece of advice: if you're currently subscribed to HBO through your cable provider, chances are you may have HBO Max included. Check with your subscriber to access the service and all its offerings. Otherwise, it may be time to cut the cord and consider streaming services instead of cable.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

Anthony’s 37 points against Nigeria in the 2012 games is a USA Basketball men’s record at an Olympics, as are his 10 3-pointers from that game and his 13-for-13 effort from the foul line against Argentina in 2008.\n\n“Carmelo Anthony is one of the NBA’s all-time great players and ambassadors,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \"We congratulate him on a remarkable 19-year career and look forward to seeing him in the Hall of Fame.”\n\nAnthony will remain part of international basketball for at least a few more months; Anthony is one of the ambassadors to the Basketball World Cup, FIBA's biggest event, which will be held this summer in the Philippines, Japan and Indonesia.\n\n“I remember the days when I had nothing, just a ball on the court and a dream of something more,” Anthony said. “But basketball was my outlet. My purpose was strong, my communities, the cities I represented with pride and the fans that supported me along the way. I am forever grateful for those people and places because they made me Carmelo Anthony.”\n\nAnthony was drafted No. 3 overall by Denver in 2003, part of the star-studded class that included James at No. 1, Hall of Famer Chris Bosh at No. 4, and soon-to-be Hall of Famer Dwyane Wade — he gets officially enshrined this summer — at No. 5.\n\nAnthony will join them at the Hall of Fame before long — the Hall of Fame said he will be eligible for the 2026 class. He averaged 22.5 points in his 19 seasons, spending the bulk of those years with Denver and the New York Knicks. Anthony has long raved about his time with the Knicks, and what it was like playing at Madison Square Garden, especially as a kid who was born in Brooklyn.\n\nHe was the NBA's leading scorer with 28.7 points per game in 2012-13, when the Knicks won 54 games and the Atlantic Division title.\n\n“The Garden,” Anthony said in 2014. “They call it The Mecca for a reason.”\n\nAnthony spent his first 7 1/2 NBA seasons in Denver, becoming the third-leading scorer in franchise history. His Nuggets teams had seven consecutive winning seasons and earned seven playoff berths, but they advanced in the postseason just once, ending in that six-game conference finals loss to the Lakers in 2009.\n\n“He wore that Nuggets jersey with pride and did a lot of great things while in a Denver Nuggets uniform, as well as all the other uniforms he wore in an illustrious career,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said Monday before Denver faced the Lakers in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals, hoping to clinch the franchise’s first NBA Finals appearance. “When you think of Carmelo, you think of one of the more elite scorers in NBA history, a guy that from the D.C. metro area goes to Syracuse and wins a championship and comes into the NBA and was just a bucket-getter from Day One.\"\n\nAnthony also played for Portland, Oklahoma City, Houston and ended his career with the Lakers last season. He went unsigned this year, and now his retirement is official.\n\nHe said in his retirement address that he's looking forward to watching the development of his son Kiyan, a highly rated high school shooting guard.\n\n“People ask what I believe my legacy is,” Anthony said. “It’s not my feats on the court that come to mind, all the awards or praise. Because my story has always been more than basketball. My legacy, my son ... I will forever continue through you. The time has come for you to carry this torch.”\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Greg Beacham in Los Angeles contributed.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/heat-index/2016/07/26/amare-stoudemire-retiring-member-knicks/87582446/", "title": "Amar'e Stoudemire retiring as member of Knicks", "text": "Jeremy Cluff\n\nazcentral sports\n\nAmar'e Stoudemire is retiring from the NBA ... as a member of the New York Knicks.\n\nStoudemire signed a one-day contract with New York on Tuesday to officially end his career with the team.\n\nHe is 33 years old and a six-time All-Star.

The way his daughters beamed when they got to meet and take a picture with Stephen Curry after the game. A conversation with Michael Jordan. Getting sought out by Magic Johnson for a talk about legacy. Private chats with teammates in the locker room, which he enjoyed tremendously.\n\nBut the quintessential one to Bryant came in the wee hours of Sunday morning inside a rented-out restaurant, where he was the guest of honor at a celebration arranged by Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade.\n\nBryant was publicly serenaded all weekend, and having 20,000 fans chant his name left him beaming. Having three longtime rivals quietly pay tribute meant even more.\n\n\"It was really special,\" Bryant told The Associated Press on Sunday night after scoring 10 points in his last All-Star appearance, a 196-173 win for the West over the East. \"Those are the things you don't get a chance to hear when you're competing against each other. To hear those stories now, you have such a deep sense of appreciation and such a brotherhood from all the years of competing against each other. It just felt good.\"\n\nThey gave him some silly gifts. They presented him with a giant bottle of wine, a 1996 vintage in a nod to his rookie season. And they told Bryant what he meant to their lives.\n\nThe dinner was secret, super-exclusive, invitation-only. It's something the trio started doing last season at All-Star weekend, calling the gathering the Gentleman's Supper Club. This year, the group wanted Bryant to be tied into it somehow.\n\nSo after All-Star Saturday festivities ended, the group headed out to the party that mattered most to them. Dinner was a fish dish, and it wasn't served until after 2 a.m. The wine and spirits were flowing long before that, and for a little while afterward as well. By the time everything had wound down, sunrise wasn't far away.\n\nBut to those who were there, it was most memorable.\n\n\"Respect,\" Wade said. \"That's what it was. It was about respect, ours for him and the respect he's given us. I just wanted to tell him that his respect meant a lot, means a lot, to my career. I went down a list of moments, gave people insight on Kobe and the way he thinks. It was just appreciation, man. His drive, his competitiveness, it helped me early in my career because I wanted to be on his level.\"\n\nBryant hasn't always had the tightest relationships with NBA peers. He's never been the sort that needs tons of friends, and his competitive juices sometimes kept him from allowing himself to get close with too many people. But now that his career is winding down, many close to Bryant are seeing some changes.\n\nHe has thoroughly enjoyed the tributes he's received in every city the Lakers have visited since his retirement announcement. He made his peace long ago with Los Angeles not being in position right now to compete for the postseason.\n\n\"This is amazing,\" Bryant said at the restaurant, glass in hand. \"I'm not the most social person, so to get this from you guys means absolutely everything to me.\"\n\nWade gave him a customized robe and some other clothes bearing his logo — along with a one-year subscription to Netflix, because Bryant is about to have a lot of time on his hands. Paul gave him a bunch of presents that he said would properly prepare Bryant for retirement, such as dental adhesive, reading glasses, compression socks and a cane. Anthony offered a magnum of Gaja Barbaresco, Italian wine for the player who grew up in Italy and says much like vino itself he got better with age.\n\nBut there was also a serious tone, as Bryant nodded during his speech toward his wife, Vanessa.\n\n\"The thing that I'll miss is matching up with you guys,\" Bryant told Wade, Anthony and Paul. \"Vanessa will tell you: I'll be in the bed for hours — hours, man — not sleeping, watching film on you guys because you are driving me (expletive) crazy.\"\n\nHe can start sleeping soon, if he isn't already.\n\nThe last All-Star Game is in the books. The NBA journey is almost over. He may have participated in his last practice on Saturday. The legendary ride has 27 games left, at the most. And before he left Toronto for a quick family vacation before the season resumes later this week, Bryant took one final moment to reflect.\n\n\"It has hit me,\" Bryant said. \"I feel very thankful. I feel very thankful. It's not an exciting thing. It's not a sad thing. It's just, I feel very thankful to be able to have had the career I've had.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/05/22/scotus-foie-gras-ban-naacp-desantis-florida-carmelo-anthony-tim-scott-mondays-news/70243969007/", "title": "Foie gras ban, NAACP, DeSantis, Carmelo Anthony, Tim Scott ...", "text": "The Supreme Court won't wade into the fight over foie gras, leaving California's ban in place.

The pair will pick teams from among the rest of the All-Star participants.\n\nThe other eight starters were also announced Thursday. After James, the rest of the starters from the Western Conference are his Los Angeles Lakers teammate Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Clippers forward Kawhi Leonard, Houston Rockets guard James Harden and Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic.\n\nJoining Antetokounmpo as starters from the Eastern Conference are Boston Celtics guard Kemba Walker, Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young, Toronto Raptors forward Pascal Siakam and Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid.\n\nSTARTER SNUBS:Who should have been voted an NBA All-Star starter?\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nKOBE IN RETIREMENT:His post-NBA life another award-winning chapter\n\nZION DEBUTS:Williamson tantalizes, but Pelicans wait to fully unleash him\n\nJames is a starter for a record 16th time. His 16 appearances are third-most in history behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 19 and Kobe Bryant's 18. James' 16 selections are also more than the East starters combined (13).\n\nJames was the overall leader in fan votes with 6,275,459. He has been a captain all three years the league has used the current format. James edged Doncic for the top spot by about 163,000 votes. Antetokounmpo dominated voting in the East with 5,902,286 votes, nearly twice as many as second-place Embiid's 3,110,185.\n\nThree starters will be making their first career All-Star appearances: Doncic, Young and Siakam. Doncic, 20, and Young, 21, give the NBA two All-Star starters age 21 or younger for just the second time ever. The only other time was 1998, when Bryant, 19, and Kevin Garnett, 21, started.\n\nStarters are determined through a combination of fan, player and media votes. Fan voting accounts for 50% of the formula, and player and media voting accounts for 25% each.\n\nAll-Star reserves chosen by the coaches from each conference will be announced next Thursday. The draft will then take place on Feb. 6, with James and Antetokounmpo first choosing among the starters, followed by reserves.

Steven Senne/Associated Press/FILE\n\n“This is a momentous honor reserved for one of the greatest champions to ever play the game,” Tamika Tremaglio, NBPA executive director, said in a statement announcing the news.\n\n“Bill’s actions on and off the court throughout the course of his life helped to shape generations of players for the better and for that, we are forever grateful. We are proud to continue the celebration of his life and legacy alongside the league,” Tremaglio added.\n\nThe league is not only retiring Russell’s number, but also plans to honor the five-time MVP by having a commemorative patch emblazoned on the right shoulder of the teams’ jerseys, while all courts will display a clover-shaped logo with the No. 6 on the sideline near the scorer’s table.\n\nRussell is the most successful player in NBA history and was the first Black head coach in the league.\n\nThe decision to permanently retire his number is similar to that of Major League Baseball, who did the same for baseball trailblazer Jackie Robinson in 1997.\n\n‘He inspired me to be a better man’\n\nRussell driving to the basket against the Lakers in the teams' final NBA playoff game in 1969, which the Celtics won and retained their title.

It was a sigh of relief stated in kind terms.\n\n\"This is not about me turning my back on New York, this is not about me turning my back to the fans, this is about a business decision,\" Anthony said in an interview on NBA TV from Oklahoma City, his new basketball home. \"It's time for me to think about myself from the standpoint of winning and understanding where the New York organization is at and where they're at and what they're trying to do.\n\n\"There is no bad blood, no hard feelings between me and the organization. As far as I'm concerned, I have nothing bad to say about those guys. I will always represent New York.\"\n\nIn New York, team president Steve Mills talked mostly about Anthony as a person, praising his social consciousness and even announcing that the Knicks were donating $100,000 to Anthony’s fundraising efforts for Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria.\n\nThe peaceful tone from both sides might have been the first time that the Knicks and the franchise cornerstone were totally without animosity really from the day that he arrived in New York. When the Knicks traded for Anthony in February of 2011, securing the superstar talent that the franchise had chased for years, he stepped into a team with mixed feelings about the deal that brought him.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nAnd it never really changed. Anthony took blame for the package that the Knicks, under the urging of Garden Chairman James Dolan, sent to Denver in the trade. Until the day he left he has been criticized for forcing the trade rather than waiting for unrestricted free agency, as if he was at the table with the Nuggets front office, picking through the Knicks roster and naming the pieces it would take to get him.\n\nNEW REALITY:Knicks bid farewell to Carmelo and welcome new reality\n\nPORZINGIS' TIME:Ready or not, Knicks now enter Porzingis era\n\nEND OF AN ERA:For better or worse, Carmelo and Knicks part ways\n\nTHE BREAKDOWN:Knicks trade Carmelo to Thunder\n\nThe Knicks certainly did blink in the deal, lusting after a star after being spurned by LeBron James the previous summer. The pile of assets set back the building efforts of Donnie Walsh. But let’s take a look now that the air is clear of Anthony’s tenure in New York. We ran a timeline in Sunday’s paper and it may still make Knicks fans bristle.\n\nBut let’s be real about Anthony’s push to get to New York, leaving aside the notion that he was the one star who really wanted to force his way to the city. Even with the package sent out – and in retrospect other than packing on picks, not one of the players has developed into the star that Anthony was or is. What Anthony was joining though, in a time before the Warriors packed on 10-deep rosters of star talent, was a team that you could believe was going to be a contender.\n\nAmare Stoudemire had not yet broken down. The Knicks hadn’t sniffed the playoffs in years, but entered the postseason with Anthony two months after the trade armed with Anthony, Stoudemire and Chauncey Billups, a pretty solid big three. And then Stoudemire injured himself in pregame warmups, Billups was bought out of his contract and the constant churn around Anthony began.\n\nA third star was put in place in Tyson Chandler and for three seasons the Knicks made the playoffs every year. Stoudemire again derailed slim hopes by punching a glass fire extinguisher cabinet. The Jeremy Lin chapter rose and dipped quickly and remains a complaint of Anthony critics. But as potent as Mike D’Antoni’s offense could be, making weapons of the likes of Lin and Landry Fields, the reality was that Anthony still needed to be the centerpiece and he knew what history has proven – that Lin was a marginal NBA talent. Was anyone in Houston howling for James Harden to defer to Corey Brewer last season? Remember, as critics point out that Anthony wouldn’t fit into D’Antoni’s system that both Anthony and D’Antoni were more than willing to unite in Houston this season if a trade could be worked out.\n\nThe high point came in the 2012-13 season when Anthony finished third in the MVP balloting and led the Knicks to a 54-win season and a place in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. With talented, respected veterans around him Anthony played both ends of the floor, doing everything he could to drag the team across the finish line as the vets faded one by one – Rasheed Wallace, Marcus Camby, Kenyon Martin and finally Jason Kidd giving in to age. The defining finish in memories now is not Kidd stepping toward retirement by the time the Indiana series began, but Anthony being blocked at the rim by Roy Hibbert. It’s the way it has gone for Anthony.\n\nPhil Jackson arrived and Anthony publicly embraced the new regime. Wooed by contenders as a free agent, Anthony took slightly less than the max contract he could get from the Knicks, providing Jackson with the flexibility he wanted to remake the roster. He maintained a belief as the pieces of that 54-win team were stripped away. The coach was fired a month after Jackson arrived when the Knicks missed the playoffs by one game and Jackson’s roster shakeup began, sending out Chandler, then J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert. Anthony’s knee gave out and surgery came. The worst season in franchise history was the result and the ugly squabbling began with Jackson’s ego searching for a way out of the contract he provided Anthony.\n\nWas all of this Anthony’s fault? Or in years to come – maybe this year – will the hearts grow fonder as the losses mount? This has a faint ring of the Patrick Ewing years in New York. While Ewing got closer to a title he was haunted by the failure to get a championship after joining the Knicks as the No. 1 overall pick with so much promise, but he was trying to do it in the time of Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon, a great player but just not great enough to top those fellow hall of famers. Will Anthony be looked at some day as a player who make the Knicks good, but not nearly good enough to match LeBron James?\n\nMaybe he will. Maybe he will get the once a Knick, always a Knick treatment when he returns and maybe for the next few years fans will grow to cherish that 54-win team as the good old days. For now, a kind farewell after nearly two years of acrimony is a good start.\n\nEmail: popper@northjersey.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2016/01/01/nba-70-for-70-december-facts-league-history/77944638/", "title": "NBA's 70 for 70: Facts from December throughout league history", "text": "AJ Neuharth-Keusch\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nAs the NBA celebrates its 70th anniversary, we go back in time to look at some facts from December throughout the history of the league, as well as some from this season.\n\n(Facts from 2015-16 season in italics)\n\n1.

Today we say goodbye to a dear friend who leaves us all her greatest work: her music,\" reads the statement.\n\nFor many years, Turner has lived a reclusive life while battling ill health, including a stroke in 2013, intestinal cancer in 2016 and a kidney transplant in 2017.\n\nThroughout her career, Turner’s life was one of musical greatness and personal trauma, as she fled an abusive relationship with her musical mentor and first husband, Ike Turner, to achieve unlikely pop stardom in the ’80s with “What’s Love Got to Do With It.”\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2023\n\nA native of Nutbush, Tennessee, the woman born Anna Mae Bullock began her singing career early – singing in the choir at Nutbush’s Spring Hill Baptist Church.\n\nBut it was seeing Ike Turner perform with his Kings of Rhythm band in 1957 that ignited Turner’s professional passion and unleashed her husky, seductive voice.\n\nAs the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, the pair stormed the charts for 15 years with robust soul-rockers “River Deep-Mountain High,” “Nutbush City Limits” and a Grammy-winning rendition of John Fogerty’s “Proud Mary.”\n\n'A true legend has passed':Bette Midler, Mick Jagger, Ciara, more stars mourn Tina Turner\n\nTurner fled from Ike in 1976, with only a gas credit card and some change to her name and spent the next several years making appearances on shows such as “The Hollywood Squares” and performing in Las Vegas cabarets.\n\nAlong with her signature look of a shock of teased hair, denim miniskirts that displayed her toned legs and a fierce gaze, Turner will also always be revered for her remarkable comeback at the age of 44.\n\nA cover of Al Green’s “Let’s Stay Together” arrived in 1983, peaked at No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100 and exploded in Europe.\n\nHer record label was reluctant to push her music and considered her a nostalgia act. But Turner proved her mettle, recording “Private Dancer” in a two-week span and with it, a triumphant return with her only No. 1 single, “What’s Love Got to Do With It.”\n\nThe song earned a record of the year Grammy Award and Tuner the status of being the (then) oldest woman to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nTurner’s recording career continued to thrive into the 1990s with albums “Break Every Rule,” “Foreign Affair” and “Wildest Dreams” while cultivating a younger audience with flashy videos for hits including “We Don’t Need Another Hero (Thunderdome),” “Typical Male” and “Better Be Good to Me.”\n\nTurner’s talents expanded beyond music. She also worked in films, making an appearance in the big screen version of The Who’s rock opera “Tommy” in 1975 and starring with Mel Gibson in “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome” in 1985.\n\nTurner was renowned for her sexy, elastic dance moves on stage – notably influencing Mick Jagger – and she toured relentlessly. Her outing to support “Private Dancer” played 180 dates in 1984, while subsequent tours filled arenas and stadiums worldwide.\n\nIn 2008-09, Turner took one final lap around the globe with Tina!: 50th Anniversary Tour, which was her last major public outing.\n\nDuring her second induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2021 (she was inducted with Ike Turner in 1991) for her solo work, Turner received the accolade remotely.\n\nTurner’s layered life led to a series of retrospectives over the years, including her 1986 revelatory memoir, “I, Tina” (turned into the 1993 film, “What’s Love Got to Do With It”); the acclaimed jukebox musical, “Tina: The Tina Turner Musical,” which earned a Tony Award for Adrienne Warren’s portrayal of Turner and is still touring after closing on Broadway in 2022; and the 2021 documentary, “Tina.”\n\nIn addition to her nine career Grammy Awards (eight as a solo artist and one with Ike), Turner was also recognized with a Kennedy Center Honor in 2005, as well as three Grammy Hall of Fame awards in 1999, 2003 and 2012, and a 2018 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nContributing: Bob Mehr, Memphis Commercial Appeal, part of the USA TODAY Network\n\nRead more about Tina Turner:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/27/entertainment/will-smith-chris-rock/index.html", "title": "Will Smith hit Chris Rock on Oscars telecast | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nChris Rock made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith’s shaved head, which did not appear to go over well with her husband Will Smith.\n\nWhile presenting the award for best documentary, Rock joked, “Jada I love you, ‘G.I.

It's a message that's not too far off those Jim Crow-era signs warning that blacks weren't welcome.\n\nNegro, go home.\n\nThat's what it feels like, at least. And for weeks, I've been struggling to come up with an alternative, less wounding interpretation. But how can I?\n\nThis is a musician who got rich off crass cultural appropriation of black music, who used to wrap his brand in the Confederate flag — a symbol inextricably linked to racism, no matter what its defenders say — and who has repeatedly issued profane denouncements of the very idea of African Americans pushing back against American inequality. Just last week, he trashed Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who's jobless right now because he dared challenge the nation's racism with a silent, kneeling protest during the pre-football game singing of the national anthem.\n\nMore:Police need military equipment to combat rising crime rates and police deaths\n\nMore:Trump is winning the statue war\n\nHaving Kid Rock open this arena is erecting a sturdy middle finger to Detroiters — nothing less. And the Ilitches, who've done so much for this city and also taken so much from it, should be the last to embrace that kind of signaling.\n\nThis isn't about music and whether Kid Rock is any good. Lots of people can argue, legitimately, about that.\n\nIt's about culture — our culture, in our city. This is a place of incredible, rich diversity, of immigrants and native peoples and the descendants of slaves, all hardened by our history but resilient and powerful in our determination for a bright future.\n\n\"I love America, I love Detroit and I love black people!\" Kid Rock said in 2011, when the local NAACP gave him an award — he gave $50,000 to Detroit-based organizations —purportedly in the hopes that he'd change some of his antics. He did, while the positive publicity lasted.\n\nBut Kid Rock’s actions, the symbols he chooses and the stances he favors — the dog whistle racism about Kaepernick, the twisted nods to the Confederate flag as a symbol of American pride — are incompatible with the pro-Detroit platitudes he sometimes mouths.\n\nThis is a man who is exploitative and resentful of the city’s population, not a man who is for Detroit and Detroiters.\n\nIt's hurtful. It's disrespectful. And in the context of the current national racial strife, born of racist torch marches, of presidential equivocations, and of a prolonged debate about the presence of racist history in our midst, I think the Kid Rock extravaganza at a new Detroit arena is absolutely nuts.\n\nI can admit to having just come to this position on this issue lately. Back when Kid Rock was announced as the arena's opening act, it bugged me, but didn't register as much more than an annoyance.\n\nThen Charlottesville happened. And then the president of the United States tried to muddy the national conversation on race by indulging false equivalencies between violent white supremacists and those who fight back against them.\n\nAnd through all that, Kid Rock's top billing at the arena opening began to chafe even more. Then he opened his mouth.\n\nAt a concert a few weeks ago, while performing the song \"Born Free,\" he broke into the lyrics to declare, \"F--- Colin Kaepernick,\" something he has done pretty consistently, it turns out, since Kaepernick first started kneeling in the fall of 2016.\n\nThere are certainly reasonable people who object to Kaepernick's chosen vehicle for protest — the flag and the anthem.\n\nBut Kid Rock's reaction is not a reasoned objection. It's just an ignorant and racist sentiment couched in awww-shucks patriotism, precisely the kind of thing that has characterized so much of his career.\n\nBack when he used to incorporate the Confederate flag into his performances, he said he \"never flew that flag with hate in my heart.\"\n\nThat doesn't even make sense. But it speaks to the power of his commercial cynicism. Play to the bigots who'll cheer the explicit signaling. Pretend to the rest of the world that it's just about feeling good about America — as if you can invoke the most racist parts of American culture without being stained by them.\n\nThat hypocrisy also echoes in Kid Rock's musical evolution, from a wanna-be hip-hop artist, eager to capitalize on the genre's commercial success, to a bold celebrant of what might politely be called the culture of white resentment. He follows the money — and the message can be tailored to preserve the cash flow.\n\nMore:Trump's moral failures on Charlottesville are shredding America's global reputation\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nAnd this is the note on which Olympia and the Ilitches want to open our new arena?\n\nI say \"our\" quite purposefully there, because Detroiters — of all hues and beliefs and economic class — have leveraged our financial future, pledging some $324 million in future tax dollars — including proceeds from a tax meant to support public schools — to help pay for this $863-million stadium.\n\nWe've also put our faith in the Ilitch family — again — to come through on the big promises they've made about what we would get in return.\n\nThat's not turning out the way we imagined, either.\n\nThe Ilitches pledged to ensure that 50% of the work done to construct this arena would go to Detroiters, a modestly fair proffer for all the tax dollars that went in.\n\nBut that target was missed by almost half, for many reasons, and $2.9 million in fines were levied against the companies who landed arena contracts.\n\nThe Ilitches also promised that this arena would be built simultaneously with the other developments that would make up the new District Detroit neighborhood.\n\nThis echoed their promise back in the early 1990s surrounding Comerica Park, pitched as a catalyst that would ignite development akin to Wrigleyville on the north side of Chicago.\n\nThat never happened, of course, and as the new arena prepares to open, nearly all of the promised development outside of the Ilitch investments — the new Little Caesars headquarters on Woodward, the new Wayne State Business School next to the arena and a slew of parking lots — are still to come.\n\nAnd that makes Kid Rock's opening appearances even more insulting.\n\nDetroit has given artistic birth to so many performers whose work appeals across racial, class and musical barriers. Stevie Wonder, Jack White, Aretha Franklin, Bob Seger — any one of them could have been the kind of choice that made all of Detroit proud.\n\nKid Rock could — and probably should — draw significant protests, launched from a community that has grown tired of being told its concerns don't matter, even when our money is used for something built in our own backyard.\n\nIt will be an inauspicious start, to say the least.\n\nAnd the signal it sends won't be appreciated — or easily forgotten.\n\nStephen Henderson is Editorial Page Editor of the Detroit Free Press, where this column first appeared.

Sign up for our newsletter series to ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nRock climbing may seem like a niche sport, possibly one fraught with danger. After all, it involves scaling the side of a cliff or simulated rock wall. But experts say it offers participants a wide variety of physical and mental health benefits that are not always found in other sports. And more people are climbing than ever – thanks in part to hit flicks such as “Free Solo” and “The Dawn Wall.”\n\nClimbing as a recreational sport became popular in the 1980s, with the nation’s first indoor climbing gym opening in Seattle. Today, there are more than 500 indoor climbing walls in the United States, powering a $493 million industry, according to market research firm IBISWorld.\n\nMore than 10 million Americans were taking part in climbing by 2020, and sport climbing debuted the following year at the Tokyo Summer Olympics.\n\nSport climbing debuted at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, held in 2021. Here's US athlete Brooke Raboutou. Maja Hitij/Getty Images\n\nThe new Olympic sport features three disciplines: bouldering, which is performed on lower walls without ropes; speed climbing, where the fastest person to the top wins; and lead climbing, where the goal is to climb as high as possible within a time limit.\n\nWhile rock climbing attracts thrill-seekers, others appreciate it as an excellent workout that also calms and sharpens the mind.\n\nHere are eight reasons you may wish to give rock climbing a try.\n\nImportant note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.\n\nIncreases cardiorespiratory fitness\n\nFast-moving sports such as running, soccer and cycling come to mind as workouts that elevate your heart rate. But climbing gets your heart pumping, too, as it involves a lot of pulling, pushing and lifting. And the more challenging the climb compared with your ability, the more of a workout.\n\nBouldering is performed without ropes. Here, a man practices at a Jakarta, Indonesia, mall. Adek Berry/AFP/Getty Images\n\nElite athletes with USA Climbing’s national team measured heart rates as high as about 150 beats per minute while they climbed, a pretty impressive number, said Zack DiCristino, the team’s physical therapist and medical manager. And indoor rock climbing was found to require the same energy expenditure as running 8 to 11 minutes per mile, according to a study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.\n\nBuilds muscle strength\n\nIt’s not surprising that hauling your body up a cliff wall builds muscle in your arms, but climbing is a full-body exercise. In addition to giving your biceps, triceps and deltoids a workout, it also calls on your abdominals, obliques, glutes, thighs, calves and more.\n\n“You build a lot of upper-body strength when you climb, especially in the hands and fingers,” DiCristino said. “But a lot of people don’t realize that if you’re using proper technique, your lower body gets quite a workout, too, with all of the squatting and jumping.”\n\nImproves flexibility and balance\n\nClimbing requires you to be able to stretch your arms and legs high and wide, plus contort your body into unusual positions. And, of course, you need to balance on tiny footholds. The more you climb, the better your flexibility, balance and coordination.\n\n“Climbing helps you be aware of your body and improves the way you move your body,” said Nick Wilkes, owner and head instructor at Devils Lake Climbing Guides, a guide service in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nEnhances memory and problem-solving\n\nMuch of rock climbing’s skill lies in determining and memorizing your climbing route beforehand. You also need to be able to problem-solve on the fly, changing your route or sequences if you encounter unexpected obstacles. “Climbing is very cognitive in nature,” DiCristino said.\n\nIndeed, activities such as climbing were shown to boost working memory capacity by 50% in a study conducted by University of North Florida researchers. And women are better novice climbers than men, because they are used to solving physical problems with their brains, Wilkes noted.\n\nBoosts communication skills\n\nCommunication skills are essential to your safety. Roped climbers have a companion on the ground called a belayer, who handles the rope through a device to manage the tension or slack, catch any falls and lower the climber. Throughout a climb, the duo must constantly communicate about such concerns as desired rope tension, when the climber wants to rest and when it’s time to come down.\n\nCommunication is key, with a climber and belayer, who handles the rope, building trust with each other. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\n“In order for me to be a better climber, I have to communicate clearly with the person belaying me so they know how I’m feeling, when I need a break or if I want to change the climb in any way,” said Lindsay Wenndt, a certified health coach, fitness trainer and owner of Atlanta-based Break Free Fitness.\n\n“The same is true if I’m the one holding the rope,” she said. “It’s my job to give encouragement when my partner feels she can’t do a certain move, point out a more efficient way to complete a route and be her biggest cheerleader when she crushes a new obstacle or goal.”\n\nEnhances trust\n\nBelaying – whether you’re the belayer or climber – involves a lot of trust since it’s essential to safety. “I have to trust my partner implicitly,” Wenndt said, knowing they’ve got her if she falls. “I also have to trust myself that I’m going to succeed in at least one thing on that route that I don’t think I can do.”\n\nYou can build trust more readily through climbing, compared with a lower-risk sport, Wilkes said. “Belaying someone, or being belayed, does have a life-or-death element to it,” he said. “This leads to a deeper experience for folks.”\n\nBuilds community\n\nIndoor climbing offers physical, social and psychological benefits, including camaraderie, according to a US Department of Veterans Affairs study on adaptive rock climbing for those with disabilities. And most climbers say the best thing about their sport is that it’s a tight-knit community, DiCristino said.\n\n“When you go to a climbing gym, they often have sign-up boards where people are looking for a partner to climb with,” he said. “It’s a great way to meet people.”\n\nCombats depression\n\nLike many other forms of exercise, rock climbing can help battle the blues. Researchers in Germany found rock climbing to be successful psychotherapy for adults with depression, thanks to its physical, social and mental benefits. If you’re climbing outside, you may get an extra boost as research also has shown spending time in nature is a natural antidepressant.\n\nClimbing is very reflective, too, Wilkes said. “It’s a great mirror that shows you how you deal with fear, disappointment and success, and how you deal with the rest of your life as well.”", "authors": ["Melanie Radzicki Mcmanus"], "publish_date": "2022/05/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/07/16/kid-rock-flown-confederate-flag-five-years/30226159/", "title": "Kid Rock: Confederate flag was dropped years before protest", "text": "Brian McCollum\n\nDetroit Free Press Pop Music Critic\n\nIn May 2011, Kid Rock stepped up to a Cobo Center podium to accept a Great Expectations Award from Detroit's NAACP, describing himself as humbled and overwhelmed by the moment.\n\nAnd that was the night, says a spokesman for the Detroit star, that Kid Rock quietly decided he would stop using the Confederate flag onstage.\n\nAmid ongoing protests about Rock's association with the controversial symbol, his team spoke with the Free Press on Wednesday to address the situation. It was the first detailed response from the musician's camp since a group of Detroit civil rights protesters launched a campaign against Rock and tour sponsor Chevrolet on July 6.\n\n\"It's been more than five years since he's had that flag on tour,\" said publicist Nick Stern. \"They're protesting something he's not even doing.\"\n\nRelated:Civil rights group to GM: Pull support from Kid Rock\n\nStern's assertion aligns with observations from Kid Rock concertgoers interviewed by the Free Press.\n\nPrior to the 2011 NAACP event — where flag protesters rallied outside — it had already been more than a year since Rock featured a Confederate flag in concert, Stern said.\n\nKid Rock had introduced the flag into his shows during the early 2000s, and in a 2002 Free Press interview he defended its use, calling it a symbol of Southern rock and rebellion. Outside the NAACP ceremony, about 40 protesters blasted Rock and the NAACP while burning a Confederate flag. Inside, Rock told the crowd he \"never flew the flag with hate in my heart,\" saying, \"I love America, I love Detroit, and I love black people.\"\n\nWhile his publicist offered few details Wednesday about Rock's thinking the night of the NAACP event, the ceremony clearly was a turning point for the musician.\n\n\"That was the impetus,\" Stern said. \"Since then, he's never flown it again.\"\n\nStill, that reality wasn't necessarily understood last week as protesters with the Detroit chapter of Al Sharpton's National Action Network (NAN) began demonstrating against Kid Rock at the Detroit Historical Museum, which houses a Rock-funded music exhibit. A press release announcing the demonstration described Kid Rock as someone \"who proudly displays the flag in his concerts\" and called on him to \"stop using (the) Confederate flag in his shows.\"\n\nThe NAN protests prompted a frenzy of national media attention on Rock and the flag, in the wake of the June 17 shooting of nine black people at a Charleston, S.C., church. The accused gunman, Dylann Roof, had posted online photos of himself with the Confederate battle flag, reigniting a larger debate about the flag's meaning and prompting its removal from the South Carolina state capitol.\n\n\"My biggest frustration is that (the protesters) are using Kid Rock's name and Chevy's name to get attention for themselves based on something he wasn't even doing — and that they didn't even know that,\" said Stern.\n\nDigital age controversy\n\nSo how did an artist who hasn't flown the flag in half a decade become one of the top national talking points in the post-Charleston conversation, complete with media confusion, fake viral stories and a brash Fox News Channel moment courtesy of Rock himself?\n\nThe Confederate flag has sparked understandable intensity in the aftermath of the Charleston shootings, with opponents decrying it as a lingering symbol of hatred and defenders calling it an enduring emblem of Southern heritage. Other public figures have become part of the bigger story, including rocker Tom Petty, who on Tuesday disowned his association with the flag in the 1980s, calling it \"downright stupid.\"\n\nBut the Kid Rock focus may also reflect the distinctive nature of media and information in the evolving digital age.\n\nThe current spotlight on Rock likely sprung from a June 29 op-ed guest column in the Oakland Press by Ken Hreha, a Dryden resident and flag opponent who has long pressed media outlets to provide more balanced coverage of the musician's relationship with the flag. Hreha, who declined to comment for this Free Press story, wrote that the musician is Michigan's \"most visible proponent\" of the flag and questioned Chevrolet's sponsorship of Rock's tour.\n\nHreha's column quickly made it into the Internet's viral social-media stream, shared by anti-flag activists and irate Kid Rock fans alike, and the star's Confederate flag history was abruptly back on the radar.\n\nWithin a week, NAN had launched its demonstration at the Detroit museum with about a dozen protesters, and from there the headlines flowed, washing across the digital landscape, reworked by content aggregators and hashed out on social media.\n\n\"It was our understanding that Kid Rock had used the flag, is using the flag and has tried to defend that flag,\" said the group's Rev. Charles Williams II on Wednesday.\n\nFollowing the Charleston shootings, said Williams, \"we realized that there is a culture that's been promoting the flag, and we saw Kid Rock being one of those people who was promoting it.\"\n\nBut clarity wasn't always at the forefront as the story developed: \"Kid Rock Refuses to Stop Displaying Confederate Flag at Concerts,\" read a Friday headline at the website Ultimate Classic Rock. An Associated Press story this week said protesters seek \"to persuade Kid Rock to stop displaying the Confederate flag at concerts.\" A fake news story flashed across the web over the weekend, claiming that Rock and fellow Michigan rock firebrand Ted Nugent were collaborating on a song titled \"Kiss My Rebel Ass.\"\n\n\"Outrage can now happen quicker than ever,\" said Matt Friedman, founding partner at the Farmington Hills public relations firm Tanner Friedman and a specialist in crisis image management. \"It seems like social media overall is outraged over new things every day.\"\n\nIn an ever-shrinking, consolidated news industry, nuance and detail are often neglected, Friedman said, as journalists chase \"controversial and easy-to-report\" stories that then emerge quickly and with little context. News media then feeds social media, which then feeds back to news media, in a fast-churning cycle that can leave celebrities caught wrong-footed.\n\nFriedman, who thinks Rock should have responded more quickly to the budding storm, said that whether or not the rocker has been unfairly portrayed, the controversy has a larger upside.\n\n\"The Confederate flag issue was brought to the surface,\" he said. \"So it's not all bad. It just is.\"\n\nA different flag\n\nProtesters have not focused exclusively on Rock's onstage use of the flag. Led by Williams, NAN protesters demanded that Rock also remove any Confederate imagery from the Internet and publicly renounce the flag.\n\nAs Hreha had done in his Oakland Press column, Williams also cited a recent photograph that appeared on Rock's website, with the musician flashing a thumbs-up at a table of items that included a Confederate-branded liquor flask.\n\nRock's representative said the flask was part of a collection of gifts presented to Kid Rock by fans on this year's sixth-annual Chillin' the Most fan cruise. Rock issues a photo of himself with gifts every year as a thank-you to fans, Stern said.\n\nProtesters also took the fight to Chevrolet, lining up a meeting with General Motors executives at noon today and demanding that the automaker pull its tour support.\n\nRelated:GM to meet with activists over Kid Rock sponsorship\n\nA GM spokesman said Wednesday the company stands behind its statement last week that it is committed to sponsoring Rock's tour, which will include 10 sold-out shows at DTE Energy Music Theatre in August.\n\nMuch like the ongoing Chevy truck ad campaign featuring Kid Rock's \"Born Free,\" this summer's tour puts a red-white-and-blue spin on the brand: The Chevrolet name and logo sit prominently over the stage, where an American flag backdrop appears late in the show during \"Born Free.\" A promotional video also plays midway through the show, linking Kid Rock, Chevy, baseball and apple pie.\n\nWhile the Rock camp largely maintained silence during the first week of the controversy, Rock himself jumped into the narrative on July 8 with an emailed remark to Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who relayed his words on air: \"Please tell the people protesting that they can kiss my ...\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Rock's publicist told the the Free Press it was a message directed specifically at the group of Detroit activists, not a defiant statement about the Confederate flag itself.\n\n\"He was saying these protesters 'can kiss my ass,' \" said the spokesman. \"Not 'kiss my ass, I'm going to use the flag.' \"\n\nWilliams, who said he took the remark not as a personal insult but as a denouncement of flag protesters nationwide, said he was undeterred.\n\n\"We're not going to let off of this,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/16"}]}

We got you, fam. Here's a guide to satisfying every cinematic taste:\n\nIf you love the Disney remake machine: 'The Little Mermaid'\n\nWhile the original is leagues better, a generation of young Disney fans will totally fall for Bailey, splendid as a teen girl who dreams of seeing the surface world. Her beloved Prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King) gets more to do with an expanded narrative, and the new Alan Menken-Lin-Manuel Miranda tunes are swell, yet the redo just doesn’t hit in the same joyous fashion.\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters\n\nHalle Bailey:New 'Little Mermaid' had to push herself 'past what I thought I could ever do'\n\nIf you're jonesing for Gerard Butler: 'Kandahar'\n\nCollaborating again with director Ric Roman Waugh (“Greenland”), Gerard Butler stars in the harrowing military thriller as an undercover CIA operative working in Afghanistan. When his mission is compromised by an intelligence leak – and the Taliban as well as other foes are after him – he and his translator (Navid Negahban) race to reach an abandoned base in Kandahar and catch a flight home.\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters\n\nIf you dig a 'Meet the Parents' vibe: 'About My Father'\n\nSebastian Maniscalco co-writes and stars in the comedy as a Chicago hotel manager ready to propose to his girlfriend (Leslie Bibb). But he needs his grandma’s engagement ring, and the only way he’s getting that is to take his Italian hairdresser dad (Robert De Niro) on a Virginia country club getaway to hang with her eccentric rich family. Cultures clash and misunderstandings ensue.\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters\n\nIf you're a Julia Louis-Dreyfus completist: 'You Hurt My Feelings'\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus plays a novelist who accidentally overhears her therapist husband (Tobias Menzies) – usually a pretty supportive guy – tell his brother-in-law he doesn't love her new book. The couple as well as their loved ones navigate insecurities, professional instability and even some silent treatments in Nicole Holofcener's relatable comedy about the white lies we tell and the truths we don't to help each other.\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters\n\nIf you want to see a teen girl annihilate bad dudes: 'The Wrath of Becky'\n\nThe darkly comic, gleefully violent sequel catches up with teen warrior Becky (Lulu Wilson), who last killed a bunch of neo-Nazis and this time needs to take righteous vengeance on woman-hating insurrectionists who murdered her friend and took Becky's beloved dog. (Seann William Scott co-stars as the baddies' fearsome leader.) It's a lean and mean survival movie just begging for a third head-exploding round.\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters\n\nIf you're a classic TV sitcom fan: 'Being Mary Tyler Moore'\n\nThrough Moore's own words plus interviews with luminaries such as Ed Asner, Rob Reiner and Lena Waithe, the documentary chronicles the beloved actress's life and work. She was a groundbreaking influence through her iconic comedy roles on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" and \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" which tapped into the feminist movement of the 1960s and '70s but also faced tragedy and struggles in her personal life.\n\nWhere to watch:Max\n\nIf you're paranoid about social media: 'Influencer'\n\nAfter Instagramming her way through a Thailand getaway, Madison (Emily Tennant) is a few days away from going home when she befriends the charismatic CW (Cassandra Naud), who volunteers to show her the best sights and food – as well as a deserted island. Things go awry predictably, though Madison's boyfriend and a self-help guru also get caught in various plot twists in a thriller big on modern technology but low on character development.\n\nWhere to watch: Shudder\n\nIf you want to see Jason Momoa take over a franchise: 'Fast X'\n\nThe fact that Momoa's flamboyantly villainous Dante Reyes is the coolest thing to see in the latest \"Fast and Furious\" is both good and bad. The actor is quite a playfully devilish sight giving Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew fits with vengeful scheming and a penchant for the sociopathic. Unfortunately, the franchise's usually eye-popping action sequences and bonkers situations don't rise up to Momoa's level.\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters\n\n'Fast X':Every 'Fast and Furious' film, definitively ranked\n\nIf you want to cry at a superhero movie: 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3'\n\nJames Gunn's gang of space misfits wraps up the trilogy with a fabulous, tear-jerking adventure. Hot-tempered raccoon Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) gets a touching origin story but also is wounded in a sneak attack, leading Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) and his teammates on a desperate mission to save the little guy. It's a cosmic quest that reminds us how great Marvel films can be with the perfect match of characters and filmmaker.\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters\n\n'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3':Every Marvel superhero movie, ranked\n\nIf you live for Keanu Reeves wrecking people: 'John Wick: Chapter 4'\n\nKeanu Reeves’ well-dressed hitman just wants to be retired but has to run, shoot and nunchuck his way through a gauntlet of former friends, pesky goons and one sadistic power player (Bill Skarsgård) to find his freedom from a shadowy cabal of assassins. We feel for Wick more than ever in this fourth film, be it a bullet battle in horrendous Paris traffic or trying to work his way up a long flight of stairs in the film's most epic scene.\n\nWhere to watch: Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon, Google Play\n\nRead our reviews of recent releases:\n\n'The Little Mermaid'Halle Bailey keeps Disney's live-action remake from being all wet\n\n'Fast X':Vin Diesel's 10th 'Furious' film stalls out, even with an evil Jason Momoa\n\n'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3':Chris Pratt's Marvel space misfits bow out gloriously\n\n'Air':It's all about the shoes, and A-list cast, in Ben Affleck's slam-dunk drama", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/05/22/the-little-mermaid-movie-review-halle-bailey-disney-remake/70239548007/", "title": "Review: Halle Bailey keeps Disney's live-action 'Little Mermaid ...", "text": "An important note for those venturing back under the sea for Disney’s new live-action “The Little Mermaid”: There’s no newt playing a flute, carp on a harp, or chub rockin’ a tub.\n\nThose concerned about a fishy revamp of the animated 1989 classic have good reason to be skeptical. The recent rash of Mouse House reimaginings has been mixed at best. But directed by Rob Marshall (“Chicago”) and featuring new songs by Alan Menken and Lin-Manuel Miranda, the expanded \"Little Mermaid\" revamp (★★½ out of four; rated PG; in theaters now) is a different animal than the original, a family-friendly film that was only 83 minutes long. And while not everything goes swimmingly, Halle Bailey splendidly buoys this \"Mermaid\" as the naive underwater youngster with dreams of exploring the surface.\n\nWith her pals, loyal guppy Flounder (voiced by Jacob Tremblay) and loquacious seabird Scuttle (Awkwafina), Ariel collects whozits and whatzits galore in her collection of human trinkets from the bottom of the ocean – for real, girl, no one needs 20 thingamabobs. She sings about wanting to see what’s on land, and Bailey wins hearts in the early going with a powerhouse take on “Part of Your World.”\n\nHalle Bailey:The new 'Little Mermaid' had to push herself 'past what I thought I could ever do'\n\n'Traumatic':Melissa McCarthy played 'Little Mermaid' villain Ursula without her wig\n\nIn this version, though, there’s a divide between mankind and the merpeople. It’s why Ariel’s dad, King Triton (Javier Bardem), warns her about surface dwellers, and when it’s clear that her wanderlust isn’t going away, he tasks exasperated crab Sebastian (Daveed Diggs) to keep an eye on her.\n\nThe love story at the heart of “Little Mermaid” is the same as it ever was: Ariel saves human dude Prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King) from a fiery ship incident and develops a serious crush. (So does he after hearing her gorgeous voice.) Enter Ursula (Melissa McCarthy), the conniving sea witch with designs on ruling her brother Triton’s kingdom. She strikes a wicked deal with Ariel to make her a human for three days, and the kid has to share true love's kiss within that timeframe or she’s Ursula’s forever.\n\n'The Little Mermaid':What to know about Disney's live-action version\n\n'We almost lost it':'Little Mermaid' composer remembers fight for 'Part of Your World'\n\nUrsula also takes her voice, but there's a different wrinkle to the spell in the new movie, which opens up the human world a lot more than the ’89 outing – and gives the prince an actual personality this time around, plus a song of his own (“Wild Uncharted Waters”). A welcome aspect of this retooled narrative is letting Eric and Ariel really get to know each other – even though she can’t speak – so that by the time of the romantic boat ride and Sebastian crooning “Kiss the Girl,” their feelings for each other ring true rather than haphazard.\n\nBailey is especially good at conveying her character’s evolving emotions with facial expressions rather than speech. That and the fact she can belt like a Broadway star will appeal to a new generation seeing “Mermaid” for the first time.\n\n'Ursula is everything':Melissa McCarthy loves her 'conniving' 'Little Mermaid' villain\n\nHauer-King is a solid Disney prince, who gets a helpful backstory in the updated film, but McCarthy is just OK as the sinister tentacled Ursula. The smoky-voiced performer is all over the place with a witches’ brew of styles, and her big number “Poor Unfortunate Souls\" is missing the delicious camp of the animated version. (Also, while she’s still the main villainess, her antagonism feels muffled by the forced-in conflict between humans and sea dwellers.)\n\nGet ready for a whole online discourse about the c computer-generated animal characters, though, for the most part, they blend better in the land and sea environments than their counterparts did in recent redos “The Jungle Book” and “The Lion King.” Sebastian doesn’t really look like any crab you’re likely to see on a beach, but Diggs gives him panache as Ariel’s supporting buddies have more to do here – even Scuttle gets a chance to rap some narrative exposition with the added tune “The Scuttlebutt.”\n\n'Brown Ariel is cute':Halle Bailey in 'The Little Mermaid' trailer thrills young girls\n\nMaybe it’s because Menken and Howard Ashman's 1989 numbers are so deeply entrenched in culture, but the new songs, while fine on their own, don’t totally jell with the original tracks. And the live-action element stymies a song like “Under the Sea” – not only have the instruments been taken from the fish, a certain joyousness is missing, too.\n\nAs excellent a “Little Mermaid” as Bailey is, it was better down where it’s wetter the first time.\n\nRanked:All the Disney live-action remakes", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/09/09/disney-little-mermaid-first-trailer-halle-bailey/8038800001/", "title": "'The Little Mermaid' Halle Bailey sings as Ariel in Disney's trailer", "text": "ANAHEIM, Calif. – \"The Little Mermaid\" is swimming and singing again.\n\nDisney unveiled the first teaser trailer for the live-action version of the 1989 animated film, showing Halle Bailey's mermaid Ariel singing \"Part of Your World,\" at the Disney fan expo D23 on Friday.

It's entirely separate from a live-action remake due in theaters with Halle Bailey and – possibly – Melissa McCarthy, part of the Disney studio's plan to remake many animated classics. ABC Entertainment chief Karey Burke unveiled the plans at the Television Critics Association press tour.\n\nBut if this all sounds familiar, it's because ABC announced plans for this project in May 2017, only to cancel it that August due to high costs, then said to be $25 million.

And it will become part of Disney's promotional machine to resurface the beloved characters for theme parks, merchandise, its Disney+ streaming service –which launches a week later – and the upcoming feature film, for which no release date has been set.\n\nCravalho \"shares the curiosity and the joy that Ariel has,\" she says, while Shaggy has watched the movie \"over and over and over and over again\" with his three daughters. \"After a while I felt Sebastian is me.

No, not the 1989 animated classic – he revisited Hans Christian Andersen’s 1837 fairy tale.\n\n“That was very helpful because I saw immediately a very modern story about a young girl who feels displaced and is working to change her life and also break down barriers and walls between herself and the human world,” says Marshall, who leans into that conflict between mankind and merpeople in the new live-action revamp, starring Halle Bailey as mermaid Ariel. “For me, it was a real antidote to our divided world that we live in.”\n\nThat’s not the only change, though. Here’s what else is new and different in the \"Little Mermaid\" remake, from fresh songs to modernization:\n\nPrince Eric finally gets a ‘Little Mermaid’ character arc – and his own ballad!\n\n“The Little Mermaid” still centers on Ariel’s yearning to explore the surface world, her dastardly deal with sea witch Ursula (Melissa McCarthy) and the blossoming romance between Ariel and Prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King). Unlike the ’89 film, Eric finally gets to musically shine with “Wild Uncharted Waters,” one of three new songs by Alan Menken and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and his backstory is revealed: He was a shipwrecked little boy adopted by the island kingdom’s Queen Selina (Noma Dumezweni).\n\nTheir relationship is similar to Ariel’s with her father King Triton (Javier Bardem), Marshall says. With Eric and his mom, “there's a feeling of misunderstanding one another and also not feeling that he belongs, like how Ariel feels like an outsider. And together they find each other as sort of kindred spirits.”\n\nAriel and Eric have a chance to fall in love before he needs to ‘Kiss the Girl’\n\nEric and Ariel spend a good amount of time sharing their sense of exploration and adventure – plus just get to know each other as he shows her his landscape where she’s a fish out of water – before the big romantic tune “Kiss the Girl.” “It's not just, ‘Oh, isn't she pretty? Isn't he cute?’ It's a deeper relationship,” Marshall says.\n\nAdds Bailey: “It was really a beautiful thing to be able to show their kind of gravitation toward one another through the divide of the two worlds that they lived in.”\n\nHalle Bailey’s Ariel gets a second solo showstopper\n\nThe young mermaid has her biggest musical moment early on, with the powerful ballad “Part of Your World.” Marshall thought she needed another song. “When she gets to land, what is she feeling?” he says. There was a certain challenge involved, though, since by that point, Ariel has lost her voice because of Ursula’s spell to turn her human. “We chose to do something in a cinematic way where you actually hear her inner thoughts musically.”\n\nThe result is “For the First Time,” where the audience gets to hear Ariel's internal song as she's introduced to the surface world. It’s about her “experiencing breathing air, experiencing a bath, experiencing this or that,\" Menken says. When she's finally reunited with Eric, \"she can't speak, and he says, ‘Oh, that can't be her.’ And then she's experiencing heartbreak for the first time. Gravity's pulling her down not only physically but also emotionally.”\n\nMelissa McCarthy's updated Ursula is a member of Ariel’s family\n\nMarshall wanted to “raise the stakes” of the story whenever he could, which is why Ursula in the new film isn't just some random nefarious villainess trying to rule the undersea kingdom but actually Triton’s sister (and Ariel’s aunt).\n\n“Why does she feel like she's the black sheep of the family? By making them brother and sister, he's banished her, (and) there's a sense that she never got enough,” Marshall says. “There's a sense of that rivalry between the two of them and who should be controlling the sea.”\n\n'Kiss the Girl' gets new lyrics related to consent\n\nNot only is Bailey the first Black Ariel, but Triton's other daughters are also a mix of ethnicities. Also, Miranda has updated lyrics for a few of the Menken and Howard Ashman classic numbers. For example, one verse of “Kiss the Girl” has been changed to reflect today’s views on consent: The crab Sebastian (now played by Daveed Diggs) used to sing, “There is one way to ask her/It don't take a word/Not a single word/Go on and kiss the girl” and now croons, “Use your words, boy, and ask her/If the time is right/And the time is tonight/Go on and kiss the girl.”\n\nBut not all the changes lie in “trying to be more modern,” Menken says. “Sometimes it's trying to be more economical. Sometimes you're trying to catch a different plot point that you want to serve. It happens every single time anything is adapted from one medium to another.”\n\nDon't be crabby: The fish don't play instruments in ‘Under the Sea’\n\nSome fans of the ’89 movie might be bummed there’s no sealife band accompanying Sebastian and Ariel in the underwater spectacular. “In an animated film, you can absolutely believe that animals are playing in a jazz quartet underneath the sea,\" Marshall says. \"It just doesn't work here because we're in real waters.”\n\nInstead, the director wanted to capture the “beautiful dance happening there” in the ocean with his photorealistic, computer-generated creatures. So Marshall enlisted members of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater to help craft “the most challenging” musical sequence the “Chicago” filmmaker has ever done. “I actually took that cue from Walt Disney himself because he had worked with Ballet Russes when he created ‘Fantasia.’ I thought, you know what, they can approximate the moves of these incredible sea creatures so we can actually create a big production number with only one live actor.”\n\nContributing: Rasha Ali\n\nMore on Disney's new 'Little Mermaid':\n\nReview:Halle Bailey keeps Disney's 'Little Mermaid' remake from being all wet\n\nHalle Bailey:New 'Little Mermaid' pushes herself 'past what I thought I could ever do'\n\n'We almost lost it':'Little Mermaid' composer remembers fight for 'Part of Your World'\n\n'Ursula is everything':Melissa McCarthy loves her 'conniving' 'Little Mermaid' villain\n\nContributing: Rasha Ali", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/24/entertainment/aladdin-anniversary-alan-menken-disney/index.html", "title": "'Aladdin' turns 30: Alan Menken on the journey of an animated classic", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt might be hard to believe, but this holiday weekend marks 30 years since the release of “Aladdin” – the animated classic that set the stage for multiple sequels, a live-action reimagining released in 2019 and even a Broadway musical. To mark the occasion, eight-time Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken, who nabbed two statuettes for his work on the movie, spoke with CNN about his memories from the making of the prescient classic.\n\nWhile the film is beloved by many – not only for how it showcases the vocal prowess of the late Robin Williams – Menken says none of it would have been possible without his late lyricist partner, Howard Ashman, whom he called “not replaceable.”\n\nThe accomplished composer also reflects on how Disney, as a studio, dealt with the portrayal of the Far East in the film and how a previous in-development version was in fact shelved due to concerns that predated cancel culture by decades.\n\nThis conversation has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.\n\nCNN: When it came to the development of “Aladdin,” was there a sense of hesitation at Disney in how to tell this story?\n\nAlan Menken, composer: “Aladdin” was started almost simultaneously with “(The Little) Mermaid.” While we were still working on “Mermaid,” we had started “Aladdin,” had a whole take on it and it was shelved. Part of the (reason) it was shelved, it was very irreverent, even more irreverent than it became, and there was a lot of concern about how it would affect Arab sensibilities.\n\nI remember when we were starting to do “Aladdin,” (we were) thinking about how (we) really wanted it to be a fun wink at the Hollywood take on the ‘Mysterious East’ and all of that because it had that kind of, I wanted it to have that Bob Hope/Bing Crosby road picture kind of tone to it, or the crazy wacky Fleischer cartoons.\n\nWe knew we were walking a line. Wokeness didn’t actually emerge out of nothing, and it’s not like it wasn’t there. Anytime you dealt with a stereotype on these pictures, it was very, very, very carefully scrutinized. Disney was not about to (be) caught being PC-insensitive.\n\nEditor’s note: Today, when viewers click on “Aladdin” on Disney+, a message appears first which reads in part, “This program includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures. The stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now. Rather than remove this continent, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversations to create a more inclusive future together.”\n\nCNN: I remember at the time, one of the first lyrics in the opening song of the movie, “Arabian Nights” (“Where they cut off your ears if they don’t like your face”), had to be changed for fear of it being insensitive. Did that serve as a hint of things to come, in terms of today’s standards of political correctness, etc.?\n\nMenken: That was changed as soon as the picture came out.\n\nAnd so we – Howard was gone – so I rewrote it to, “Where it’s hot and immense and the heat is intense, it’s barbaric, but hey, it’s home.” Now, even “barbaric” as an adjective for heat, still was overly sensitive. So for the live action movie, when Benj Pasek and Justin Paul were my lyricists, that was adjusted as well.\n\nThe really irreverent lyrics were in “Arabian Nights.” Because they were setting up a world and we were saying, “This is our tone. We’re winking at everything and making fun.” We were making fun of a genre, but making fun of a genre clearly can bleed over to making fun of a people.\n\nAlan Menken, seen here this month, spoke to CNN about his memories of working on the animated 'Aladdin.' Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP\n\nThere’s always a lot of back and forth about stereotype, and whether it’s the right stereotype and whether, possibly, it could be offensive or whatever. But that (lyric change) was the first spot where we actually said, ‘Okay, we gotta change that.’\n\nSpecifically about making the movie and working with the actors: You have previously spoken about what it was like to work with the late Robin Williams. Any other memories you care to share?\n\nMenken: In the (recording) room, Robin (was) a serious artist. He wanted to learn every note of “Friend Like Me” and “Prince Ali,” and so we rehearsed it dutifully. I think he was a little sore from being in the harness on (the 1991 Steven Spielberg movie) “Hook” all day.\n\nThen of course when we got to the recording sessions, and after he delivered faithfully exactly what I wanted from the song – that kind of Fats Waller style of singing the songs – then everyone said, “Okay, Robin, can you just go have fun?”\n\nAnd… that was where you just went nuts, because it was Robin “on.” And Robin “on” was incredible. Robin was actually a very sensitive, nice, sweet man. He was amazing to work with.\n\nWhat about Gilbert Gottfried, who died this year?\n\nMenken: Gilbert did not contribute musically (to the film). But from the press junket the film on for the last 28 years, or 29 years, Gilbert would always (say), “Where’s my song? You never gave me a song!”\n\nYou know, there’s always a big gap between people’s persona and who they are. He was a sweet, nice, unassuming guy, and gentle and sensitive and fun to talk to and a little nerdy and all the things, and then when he is “on,” you know, all this stuff would “blaaaaa!!!” out of him. And in animation there’s many of those experiences. There are hilarious anecdotes about people when they’re “on,” and it’s just amazing.\n\nAs you mentioned, you began work on this film with your longtime lyricist collaborator Howard Ashman, but then continued working on it with Tim Rice after Ashman’s death in March 1991. How do you look back on that time now, working with Ashman?\n\nMenken: He was just brilliantly smart, intuitive, had an amazing grasp of how we mix styles and vocabularies from our culture, from other cultures in a really hip and exciting and fun way. And all of the serious messages were kind of in subtext, but brilliantly in subtext. And that started with our stage shows, with “Little Shop of Horrors” in particular.\n\nAlan Menken, lower right, with Ron Clements and John Musker and behind the scenes on 'Aladdin' in 1992. Collection Christophel/Walt Disney Pictures/Alamy\n\nAnd Howard was a very, very fully developed jack of (all trades) – lyricist, book writer, director and producer. He really was just an amazing amalgam of so many gifts and talents.\n\nWhat about how the animated “Aladdin” has served as a basis for so many successful iterations that have followed, including the long-running Broadway show and the billion-dollar-grossing live-action film?\n\nMenken: Well, in the case of first (2017’s live-action “Beauty and the Beast”), then “Aladdin,” and now “Mermaid” (to be released next year), these really are not so much a progression…as really the animated (film) is the Rosetta Stone, and it’s just spokes on a wheel that come off of that – and that’s not conceptually on my part. It’s just the way the studio operates, the way each division operates. And it also allows the director of each iteration to kind of have a greater influence over how it differs from the animated (version).\n\nWith Broadway, I knew my agenda was I want to get in as many of the songs that Howard originally wrote as possible, and I leaned heavily on everybody to make sure the storyline reflected that. And I think it was a smart move. It was not like just a sentimental gesture towards my late collaborator, but the mystique of Howard’s work and the brilliance of his work is one of the biggest draws for our projects.", "authors": ["Dan Heching"], "publish_date": "2022/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/04/26/disney-little-mermaid-melissa-mccarthy-ursula-cinemacon/11745201002/", "title": "Melissa McCarthy's Ursula in 'Little Mermaid' is 'a conniving broad'", "text": "LAS VEGAS – Melissa McCarthy enraptured the CinemaCon crowd just like her undersea witch wraps her tentacles around a poor little mermaid.\n\nAt the convention for theater owners and studios, McCarthy took the stage on Wednesday to introduce her musical number \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" – the showstopper for McCarthy's evil Ursula – in Disney's upcoming live-action \"The Little Mermaid\" (in theaters May 26).\n\n\"It was truly such an honor to play one of Disney's most delicious villains,\" McCarthy said. \"Ursula is everything.

Well, unless we pay extra for it, that is.\n\nThe same goes for my snowbird parents, who live with us “in the Lower 48” six months out of the year. While they’re under the same roof, we can share. When they’re back at their house in Alaska, they’re on their own.\n\nSorry, fam. You’re getting booted. Here are tentative answers to some of the most-asked questions so far and my thoughts on the crackdown itself:\n\nWho has your Netflix password?:Check who's logging into your Netflix account and boot them\n\nIt's not me, it's Netflix:With password sharing on the block, how to boot your friends\n\nWhen does Netflix password sharing stop?\n\nIt could just be a matter of days now until Netflix cracks down on sharing passwords for anyone who doesn’t live in the same household in the United States. The streaming giant already made the changes in Canada, along with several other countries.\n\nNetflix has not shared the specifics of exactly how the crackdown on password sharing will work in America yet.\n\nLast month, Netflix caused quite a kerfuffle when it published information on its United States Help Center page that seemed to lay out the updated guidelines. To be clear, Netflix is adamant that was a mistake.\n\nNetflix password sharing primer:When does Netflix password sharing end? How much will it cost you? What you need to know.\n\nIn an emailed statement, the company said that for a brief time, “a help center article containing information that is only applicable to Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru went live in other countries. We have since updated it.\"\n\nNetFlix Canada password sharing\n\nIn Canada, where password crackdowns rolled out last month, the new ground rules seem to gel with what Netflix maintains, that passwords and accounts are for one household and one primary location, not for an ex and their fraternity brother, that cousin you only see during the holidays and your dog walker.\n\nYou can still share passwords, but only with up to two people you don’t live with, and you'll have to pay for it. People pay the equivalent of $5.88 more to, say, share an account with their daughter, who’s away at college under the Canadian plan.\n\nBased on how it’s working so far in other countries, we can guess how the password crackdown will impact us when Netflix announces the updates in the U.S.\n\nHow can I watch Netflix while traveling?\n\nIt looks like you’ll still be able to watch Netflix on your personal device or by logging into a new TV at a hotel or Airbnb when you travel, without worrying about getting logged out or paying extra after a specific amount of time on the road.\n\nWhy Netflix should crackdown on password sharing\n\nOpinion alert and a warning that it’s not a popular one: Netflix’s crackdown seems fair. We all love getting something of value for free – or at least cheaper than everyone else – but it’s often unsustainable.\n\nMaybe I only share my password with my daughter, and that seems fair. But other people might pay for one account and share it among 100 people. Is that the same?\n\nIt’s kind of like that person who scarfs down an entire restaurant meal, then complains about it (loudly) to get a freebie. Or the person who wears a new outfit a few times (tags hidden away) and returns it for a full refund.\n\nAnd what about those TikTok influencers who brag about making $15,000 a month buying deeply discounted products at Marshalls, then selling them for full price on Amazon to unsuspecting dopes like me? It’s not illegal, but it’s not exactly ethical, either. It makes sense that businesses have to reckon with that behavior and that the fallout impacts the rest of us too.\n\nNetflix says that more than 100 million households use a shared password globally. While other streaming services still allow the practice, they don’t encourage it, and there’s a good chance many will follow in Netflix's footsteps here. Is it their fault that some people take too much advantage of a good thing?\n\nJennifer Jolly is an Emmy Award-winning consumer tech columnist.

Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi CNN —\n\nGulf Arab states have launched a rare, coordinated campaign against streaming giant Netflix, calling on it to remove “offensive” material as they seek to regulate television content produced outside their jurisdiction.\n\nSaudi Arabia issued a statement on Tuesday on behalf of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, saying the bloc has asked Netflix to take down programming that violates Islamic values, including some content directed at children.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates, which issued its own statement, said that Netflix violated local regulations and “contradicts the country’s societal value.” Its media watchdog would be monitoring Netflix’s content “from now on” and will take action if local laws are flouted.\n\nThe statements didn’t specify what content was causing offense but Saudi state-run Al Ekhbariya news channel on Tuesday ran segments condemning the streaming service for “promoting sexual deviance” to children, in an apparent reference to homosexuality.\n\n“Pay a monthly fee to Netflix, and your child gets to watch this immoral content,” the voice-over says, as a blurred scene apparently showing a same-sex embrace from “Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous” is played with ominous music in the background. It cited social media campaigns calling for the banning of Netflix.\n\nGulf states have said that their grievance with the streaming service has to do with content that violates social norms, but Saudi Arabia has in the past demanded the removal of politically sensitive content too. In 2019, Netflix obliged the kingdom by removing an episode of “Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj” that mocked the kingdom.\n\nNetflix at the time defended its decision as a response to a “valid legal request,” adding that it nonetheless does “strongly support artistic freedom,” according to the Financial Times. Netflix didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nCensorship was not uncommon in Arab countries when TV viewing was dominated by state-run channels. The arrival of streaming TV, however, eroded governments’ ability to police content and heralded an era of Arabic television production outside the censors’ purview that has often caused controversy for breaking social taboos.\n\nAccording to Joseph Fahim, an Egyptian film critic, the effect of streaming services in the Middle East was akin to that of satellite TV several decades ago, when viewership moved away from terrestrial channels showing government-approved content. “There was a lot more freedom in this content,” he told CNN.\n\nOther global media companies have been less receptive to Gulf Arab states’ calls to restrict content that doesn’t suit their social norms. American film studios that previously complied with Arab censors’ requests for cuts to their movies have been refusing to do so of late, leading to those movies being banned in Arab countries.\n\nDisney reportedly rejected cutting LGBTQ scenes more than once this year, but its streaming service, Disney+ told Hollywood Reporter that content would “align with local regulatory requirements.”\n\nGulf states have increased the policing of LGBTQ-related displays of late. Several global brands that publicly supported gay rights during Pride Month in June were targets of boycott campaigns on social media. In June, Kuwait’s foreign ministry summoned a US diplomat stationed there over tweets “supporting homosexuality”.\n\nThe UAE, home to a large number of expatriates and one of the most liberal of the Gulf states, was among the countries that banned Disney movie “Lightyear” in June. The New York Times then reported that Amazon was pressured to restrict items and search results related to LGBTQ people.\n\nNetflix operates in an increasingly crowded streaming-services market in the Middle East. Among its rivals are Disney+, which launched regionally in June, as well as regional services such as OSN+, Shahid and Starz Play.\n\nFahim suggested that competition may also be a motivation for turning up the heat on Netflix. It sends the message “that if you want to make a decent, acceptable and widely shared experience, you have to go to regional streamers,” he told CNN. “It’s almost like this statement is waging the war against Netflix.”\n\nThe Middle Eastern streaming market, while relatively small for the likes of Netflix, is on a growth trend. Digital TV Research forecasts that paying subscribers on streaming services in the region are set to more than double to 21.5 million between 2021 and 2027, with Netflix leading the market.\n\nThe digest\n\nTurkey’s Erdogan says West’s ‘provocative’ policies towards Russia not correct\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday he didn’t think the West’s “provocative” policies towards Russia were correct after the European Union proposed a price cap on Russian gas, Reuters reported.\n\nBackground: President Vladimir Putin had earlier threatened to halt all supplies if the EU took such a step, raising the risk of rationing in some of the world’s richest countries this winter. Separately, Putin said on Wednesday that isolating Russia would be “impossible and the Moscow would seek business opportunities in the Middle East.\n\nWhy it matters: The war in Ukraine has left Turkey juggling ties between NATO allies and its neighbor Russia. Turkey has not placed sanctions on Russia but has called for an end to the war and sold drones to Ukraine.\n\nOPEC agrees to cut production after oil price slump\n\nOPEC said Monday it would reduce oil production next month by 100,000 barrels per day, the cartel’s first output cut since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, as it braces for a global economic slowdown to hit demand.\n\nBackground: Just a month ago, OPEC and allied oil exporters agreed to increase production in September by the same small amount — equivalent to about 0.1% of global demand – after coming under intense pressure from the United States and other big oil consumers to do more to bring down energy prices and inflation. In August, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told Bloomberg News that the oil market’s recent “volatility” may force OPEC+ to cut production.\n\nWhy it matters: A drop of more than 20% in global oil prices since the beginning of June has producers focused on the risk that a sharp economic slowdown in China, the US and Europe will sap demand for their crude. Analysts are calling the oil cut “symbolic”, with one expert saying that the alliance is “sending a signal to the market that OPEC+ is serious about cuts.”\n\nPalestinian man killed, 16 others wounded by Israeli troops in Jenin demolition operation\n\nA Palestinian man was killed and 16 others were wounded in an Israeli military operation in the West Bank city of Jenin, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said Tuesday.\n\nBackground: The Israel Defense Forces were in Jenin “in order to demolish the residence of the terrorist who killed three people in a deadly shooting attack in Tel Aviv the night of April 7, 2022,” the IDF said in a statement, adding that “a violent riot was instigated” during the operation. “The rioters burned tires, hurled rocks, Molotov cocktails and explosive devices at the forces, who responded with riot dispersal means,” the IDF said. The 16 wounded Palestinians were injured with bullets and shrapnel, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, and all were transferred to the hospital in Jenin. The ministry identified the dead man as 29-year-old Mohammad Sabaaneh.\n\nWhy it matters: The clashes took place in the same West Bank city where Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was killed during an IDF raid in May. The IDF admitted for the first time on Monday there was a “high possibility” that its troops fired the fatal shot. A senior IDF official said the soldier thought he was firing at Palestinian militants – although Abu Akleh was wearing a flak jacket marked Press – and that the soldier was “sorry.” Israel’s military prosecutor said it would not pursue criminal charges against the soldier, who was not named.\n\nAround the region\n\nKız Kulesi Nerede ?\n\nEnteresan bir görüntü! pic.twitter.com/wtKE8ZM3y3 — İbrahim ÖZKAN (@ibrahim_ozkan61) September 3, 2022\n\nIstanbul residents expressed outrage on social media amid rumors that one of the ancient city’s historic icons had been quietly demolished by the government.\n\nMaiden’s Tower, known as the pearl of the Bosphorus, has been closed and covered with tarpaulins for a year due to restoration work.\n\nThe controversy started when a video posted on Twitter suggested that the tower had been demolished. In the video, ships can be seen passing behind the tower through holes in the tarpaulins, giving the impression that no structure exists in the tower’s place.\n\nThe Directorate of Cultural Heritage and Museums in Turkey responded by saying the concrete components and cone part of the building that were added after a fire in 1940 had been removed “by adhering to the principles of universal protection” in order to increase its earthquake resistance.\n\nIt also shared a render of how the tower would look like when restoration is completed in 2023, more than one year later than initially planned. Once the restoration is completed, the building that hosted a restaurant until recently will serve as a museum, it said.\n\nThere are many legends about the origins of the tower. The best-known one is about the Byzantine Emperor Konstantinus, who upon being warned by a fortune teller that his daughter would die due to a snake bite, had the tower built on the Bosphorus, and locked her up there to protect her. Legend has it that a snake hidden in one of the fruit baskets that the emperor sent to his daughter eventually took her life.\n\nBy Isil Sariyuce\n\nTime capsule\n\nAn Olympic committee member (R) speaks to one of the Palestinian militants at the Munich Olympic Village in 1972. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nThis week marks 50 years since Palestinian militants from the Black September group took members of the Israeli Olympic team hostage during the Munich Games of 1972, in an attack that came to be known as the Munich massacre.\n\nEight armed men broke into the West German city’s Olympic village and held members of the Israeli team hostage in their apartment. A coach and an athlete were killed in the initial moments of the attack. Nine were held hostage.\n\nThe group conditioned the release of the hostages on the freeing of over 200 prisoners in Israeli and West German jails. Israel’s prime minister at the time refused. In a failed rescue attempt by West German police, all Israeli hostages were killed by the militants. Five of the militants were also killed by the police. Three were caught later.\n\nIn the following days, Israel retaliated by launching airstrikes in Syria and Lebanon on the bases of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was linked to Black September. Israel is said to have killed as many as 200 people in the operation, including scores of militants, but also innocent civilians and children.\n\nIn the subsequent month, Palestinian militants hijacked a German plane, demanding the release of the three surviving terrorists. Germany complied, and they were freed.\n\nSecurity spending was 50 times higher in the subsequent 1976 games in Montreal, Canada. Israel initiated Operation Wrath of God aimed at assassinating those involved in the Munich massacre. The operation lasted around 20 years and allegedly led to the killing of two of the three surviving terrorists. It was the subject of an Oscar-nominated 2005 film directed by Steven Spielberg.\n\nThis week, the President of Germany formally apologized for failing to keep the Israeli hostages safe. Last month, the families of the Israeli athletes struck a deal with Germany on increased compensation and accountability for the attacks.\n\nBy Mohammed Abdelbary", "authors": ["Abbas Al Lawati Mohammed Abdelbary Nadeen Ebrahim", "Abbas Al Lawati", "Mohammed Abdelbary", "Nadeen Ebrahim"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/02/03/ilhan-omar-super-bowl-grammys-weather-winter/11176824002/", "title": "Rep.

How’s the stock market doing?\n\nThe answer is pretty darn good. The S&P 500 has increased nearly 18% since Biden took office on January 20, 2021, hitting a slew of new record highs along the way. The Dow Jones industrial average is up more than 12%.\n\nThe Nasdaq’s performance has been less spectacular, especially in recent weeks, when rising bond yields helped push the index into a correction. Still, the tech-heavy index has gained over 6% since Biden took office.\n\nOther indexes have also had a rough start to 2022. The S&P 500 and the Dow have both lost more than 4% so far this year.\n\nBig picture: The strong first year of the Biden era adds to a run of market success under Democratic presidents — despite concerns about higher taxes.\n\nHow does Biden’s first year compare to that of former President Trump? The S&P 500 increased by nearly 24% in the first year of Trump’s presidency. The gains had reached 67% by the time he left office.\n\nThe economy has also made significant progress in some areas under Biden.\n\nThe unemployment rate, for example, dropped from 6.4% in January 2021 to 3.9% in December. Biden pushed Congress to approve his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, which included big stimulus checks, help for the unemployed and aid for small businesses.\n\nHe also signed a $1 trillion infrastructure bill into law, producing a bipartisan victory that unlocked billions for roads, ports and other projects.\n\nBut then there’s inflation, which soared to 7% in the final month of 2021, the highest level in nearly four decades.\n\nBiden acknowledged Americans are struggling with the high cost of living during a press conference on Wednesday, throwing his weight behind the Federal Reserve’s efforts to fight rising prices.\n\n“We need to get inflation under control,” Biden said.\n\n“The critical job of making sure elevated prices don’t become entrenched rests with the Federal Reserve, which has a dual mandate: full employment and stable prices,” he added.\n\nBiden noted that Americans are seeing rapid price increases at grocery stores, at the gas pumps and elsewhere.\n\n“Given the strength of our economy and pace of recent price increases, it’s appropriate … as Fed Chairman Powell has indicated, to recalibrate the support that is now necessary,” he said.\n\nWhat is the Fed planning, exactly? Tune back in next week, when the central bank is expected to hike interest rates at its February meeting.\n\nChina tries to avoid a major slowdown\n\nChina keeps slashing lending rates as authorities ramp up their efforts to stave off a sharp economic slowdown.\n\nThe People’s Bank of China on Thursday cut its one-year loan prime rate by 10 basis points to 3.7%, the second cut to the rate in a month, reports my CNN Business colleague Laura He.\n\nThe central bank also trimmed its five-year loan prime rate by five basis points to 4.6%, the first cut to that rate since April 2020.\n\nChina’s loan prime rate is the rate at which commercial banks lend to their best customers, and it serves as the benchmark rate for other loans. The five-year one, meanwhile, usually serves as a reference for mortgages.\n\nThe central bank’s decision to cut both rates is the latest in a series of steps that China has taken to loosen monetary policy, as authorities contend with a deepening slump in the real estate market and slowing economic growth.\n\nThe fear: China’s GDP expanded 8.1% in 2021, but the pace slumped in the final quarter. Analysts expect the country to struggle even more this year, as it tries to avoid coronavirus outbreaks with its strict zero-Covid policy, and as the property crisis continues to fester.\n\nWarning the West: Even Chinese President Xi Jinping called on Western central banks earlier this week to avoid hiking interest rates too fast to fight inflation, as his country’s policies head in the opposite direction.\n\nWhy Netflix is raising prices\n\nNetflix (NFLX) reports fourth quarter earnings on Thursday and all eyes will be on the streamer’s subscriber growth. But there’s also something new for investors and industry observers to wonder about: Netflix (NFLX) raising its prices.\n\nThe company boosted prices on Friday, a move that raised its stock price and eyebrows across the streaming world as well as the question, “why?”\n\n“They clearly believe they still have the pricing power to do so and that they provide an exceptional value for the money,” Andrew Hare, a senior vice president of research at media consulting firm Magid, told CNN Business.\n\nHare believes Netflix sees that the US and Canadian markets are maturing and it’s trying to generate more revenue per user.\n\n“Pressure is on to drive overall growth, generate positive cash flow, all while keeping up with rising product costs and competition,” he said. “Raising prices is just one lever they can continue to pull right now, though I’m not sure for how much longer.”\n\nBut as my CNN Business colleague Frank Pallotta reports, even modest price increases may be too much for consumers considering the influx of services in recent years from Disney+ to Peacock to HBO Max (which is owned by CNN parent’s company, WarnerMedia).\n\nStill, as goes Netflix so goes the rest of streaming. That means the price hike could give its rivals room to raise their own prices at some point.\n\nUp next\n\nAmerican Airlines, Baker Hughes, Travelers and Union Pacific report earnings before the opening bell.

(I’m kidding, of course, but we do have the internet and a nose for unfair generational disparities.)\n\nHere’s the thing: A study out of the UK this week says that half of the British public believe young people can’t afford to buy a home because they spend too much on coffee, Netflix and travel.\n\nIt’s the Avocado Toast Debacle all over again. In case anyone forgot: In 2017, an Australian millionaire said Millennials couldn’t afford to buy homes because they’re dropping “$40 a day on smashed avocados and coffees and not working.”\n\nOf course, generational misconceptions are nothing new. The idea that younger people don’t work as hard goes back to Ancient Greece, according researchers at the Policy Institute and the Institute of Gerontology at King’s College London.\n\n“Young people today love luxury; they have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love gossip in place of activity.” That sentiment, often attributed to Socrates, is over a thousand years old, but 51% of the British public agrees with it, researchers found.\n\nNaturally, the internet had some opinions about the researchers’ findings.\n\n“It’s true. Millennials are just $19.99/month from being able to carry the mortgage on a $1 million home that Boomers bought for chewing gum and a couple packets of matches,” tweeted @StephenPunwasi.\n\n“You would have to cancel Netflix for 2,300 years to save enough to pay for the average home price in the US,” tweeted @femmissgeek\n\nEven the researchers themselves expressed frustration with the narrative.\n\n“The suggestion that the huge challenges young people face in buying their own home can be solved by skipping fancy coffees and Netflix entirely misses the point — but it’s still believed by half the public,” said Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at King’s College London.\n\nOf course, Millennials’ inability to afford a home has nothing to do with our Netflix subscriptions (which, ironically, some of us still steal from our Boomer parents, thank you very much) or our daily $7 coffee (I’ll die renting before I give up my cold brew, you jerks).\n\nAllow me to — *cracks knuckles* — briefly run through some of the real roadblocks to homeownership among people born between 1981 and 1996.\n\nWe can’t afford it. The median home value in 1980 was $47,200, or $167,000 in today’s dollars. The median price of a single-family home in the first quarter of 2022 was more than two-and-a-half times more, at a The median home value in 1980 was $47,200, or $167,000 in today’s dollars. The median price of a single-family home in the first quarter of 2022 was more than two-and-a-half times more, at a whopping $428,700 We graduated into a financial and economic hellscape. Class of 2007, anyone? Crippling student debt. The college degree that all of our mentors promised would be the key to success has become an albatross for millions of graduates who can’t get their heads above water. Tighter lending standards. In the fallout of the 2008 recession, banks reined in their credit underwriting standards and made 20% down payments the norm. For a median-value home today, that’s an $86,000 down payment. LOLLLLLLL.\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY: 18%\n\nCrypto exchange Coinbase is laying off 18% of its employees — about 1,000 positions — as sthe company’s market value has tanked in the recent crypto meltdown.\n\n“We appear to be entering a recession after a 10-plus year economic boom,” CEO Brian Armstrong wrote Tuesday. “A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period.”\n\nBitcoin hit an all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021. Since then, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency has lost two-thirds of its value, tumbling below $23,000 Tuesday. It has lost about 25% of its value since Friday.\n\nETYMOLOGY CORNER\n\nBears. Bulls. Two big, scary mammals that serve as Wall Street shorthand for the stock market’s general mood. Bear = pretty much everyone’s selling. Bull = pretty much everyone’s buying.\n\nThis week, US stocks fell into a “bear” market, dropping more than 20% from their most recent peak in early January. That rout ushered in the end of the “bull” market that began in the spring of 2020.\n\nBut how did these brawny beasts acquire their status as the default metaphors for stock market sentiment?\n\nThere are a couple of etymological theories behind the terms. One dates to the 18th century and involves poets, proverbs and a bunch of English scalawags bilking investors out of their money. Another (almost certainly fictional) story refers to the way the two animals attack.\n\nLet’s start with the bear.\n\nThe term, according to Merriam-Webster, derives from “bearskin” which was used in the 18th century as a metaphor for speculative stock buying that’s known today as short-selling (aka betting that a stock will go down).\n\nIt comes from a proverb warning not to “sell a bear’s skin before one has caught the bear.”\n\nBearskin got shortened to bear, and here we are.\n\nThe term caught on after the South Sea Bubble of 1720 (and again later, after the 1929 crash that led to the Great Depression). The scandal is complex, but the gist is that a bunch of British swindlers ran up the price of a company that never made a profit and caused a financial meltdown.\n\nWhither the bull?\n\nWe’d have to ask (long dead) poet Alexander Pope why he selected the bull as the bear’s counterpart in this verse that alludes to his participation in the South Sea stock scandal:\n\nCome fill the South Sea goblet full;\n\nThe gods shall of our stock take care:\n\nEuropa pleased accepts the Bull,\n\nAnd Jove with joy puts off the Bear.\n\nIt’s entirely possible we got the term “bull” because Pope wanted something cool-sounding to rhyme with “full.”\n\nOne other theory…\n\nThere’s not a lot of evidence to support this one, but it’s made its way into Wall Street lore over the years, and it can be a helpful image for remembering what the two terms mean.\n\nThe idea is that a bear attacks by swiping its paws downward on its prey (downward swipe = stocks go down). A bull, on the other hand, thrusts its horns upward to gore the poor souls who cross its path (upward thrust = stocks go up).\n\nThere’s a bit of gruesome history linking bulls and bears in this way. Between the 1200s and 1600s in England, people would attend bull- and bear-baiting contests and gamble on the outcomes.\n\nIn that context, it’s not hard to see why modern trading is sometimes referred to as a bloodsport.\n\nEnjoying Nightcap?

Ron DeSantis and Rubio comfortably won reelection as voter concerns about the economy appeared to prevail over a message emphasized by Democrats focusing on abortion rights.\n\nIncumbent Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Rubio comfortably won reelection as voter concerns about the economy appeared to prevail over a message emphasized by Democrats focusing on abortion rights. Republicans flexed their muscle in gubernatorial races with Chris Sununu (New Hampshire), Ron DeSantis (Florida), Henry McMaster (South Carolina), Mike DeWine (Ohio) and Kay Ivey (Alabama) all winning reelection. In addition, former Trump White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders won the governor’s race in Arkansas.\n\nThe latest updates:\n\nGeorgia secretary of state: Raffensperger wins\n\nRepublican incumbent Brad Raffensperger emerged victorious in the race for Georgia secretary of state, beating out Democratic nominee and former state senator Bee Nguyen.\n\nRaffensperger held a solid lead over Nguyen in the polls throughout the race. The contest to be the state’s chief election officer, a down-ballot race that has previously garnered little attention, has gained increased importance in the wake of the 2020 election and unfounded voter fraud claims.\n\n-- Anna Kaufman\n\n3 takeaways from Georgia governor's race:Brian Kemp defeats Stacey Abrams for second term\n\nDemocratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin wins in Michigan\n\nRep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich, won reelection over Republican state Sen. Tom Barrett and Libertarian candidate Leah Dailey in Michigan’s new 7th Congressional District, ending one of the nation’s most expensive and closely watched House races.\n\nSlotkin was first elected from the 8th District in 2018, when she flipped a Republican seat that President Donald Trump won in 2016, and she was one of the few Democrats to win reelection in a district that voted for Trump in 2020. A former National Security Council and CIA staffer, she opted to run this year in the newly redrawn 7th District, which is centered on Lansing and would have voted narrowly for President Joe Biden had it existed in 2020.\n\nWhile Slotkin was endorsed by Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., a harsh Trump critic, Barrett was endorsed by former Vice President Mike Pence. Barrett, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, has focused his campaign on less spending, more energy production and criticism of Slotkin's voting record. Slotkin has struck back at Barrett's refusal to say if he would have accepted the results of the 2020 election, which he has called an \"unknowable thing.\"\n\n– Yoori Han, Cronkite News\n\nDemocrat Greg Landsman unseats Ohio Rep. Steve Chabot\n\nDemocrat Greg Landsman defeated Republican incumbent Steve Chabot in the House race for Ohio’s 1st Congressional District, the AP reported.\n\nLandsman, a former Cincinnati City councilman, won by a little more than 10,000 votes when the race was called.\n\nChabot represented Hamilton County for 26 years in Congress.

He regained his seat two years later.\n\n-- Rachel Looker\n\nSenate flip:Democrat John Fetterman flips U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania, beating Republican Mehmet Oz\n\nWisconsin governor: Evers wins reelection\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers won a heated re-election battle against Trump-backed Republican Tim Michels.\n\nA Marquette University Law School poll last week had them tied at 48%.\n\nEvers won the governor’s office by a thin margin in 2018 when he defeated Republican Scott Walker, a 2016 presidential candidate. Evers had been a school district superintendent and served as the statewide superintendent of public instruction in Wisconsin for nearly a decade.\n\nAs governor, Evers’s job approval has been slightly underwater in recent Marquette polls, with 46% approving of the job he’s been doing as governor and 48% disapproving.\n\nMichels is backed by former President Donald Trump, who has traveled to Wisconsin to campaign for him. The once low-key owner of Wisconsin’s largest construction company, the eponymous Michels Corp, Michels launched his bid for governor in April -- about 15 months after Biden revoked a key permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline, a project for which Michels’ company had a contract to build pump stations. It’s Michels’ third run for office.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nLive updates:Wisconsin Election Results 2022\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer wins reelection\n\nDemocratic incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer claimed victory in her bid for reelection as Michigan governor, successfully fending off a challenge by Republican nominee Tudor Dixon.\n\nThe contest, once seen as an easy win for Democrats in a major battleground state, tightened in the final weeks with a last minute push by the Dixon campaign helping her to inch closer in the polls.\n\nWhitmer is a veteran of Michigan politics, serving six years in the state House and eight in the senate before being elected governor in 2018.\n\nDixon spent years as a conservative TV commentator and producer of conservative news for students.\n\nDixon, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, denies the results of the 2020 election and has criticized Whitmer for her handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whitmer, like many other Democrats, emphasized abortion rights throughout the campaign and criticized Dixon for her no-exceptions stance on the procedure.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nPreviously:Michigan Gov.

Mike Lee, R-Utah, fended off Independent challenger Evan McMullin for a third term.\n\nWith just over half of Utah ballots counted, Lee had more than 55% of the vote compared to McMullin’s 41% when the race was called early Wednesday morning.\n\n-- Ella Lee\n\nVoted into history:Wes Moore to be Maryland's first Black governor; first Gen-Z House member in Fla., more\n\nIn victory speech, Fetterman says he’s ‘proud’ of campaign\n\nDonning his signature hoodie, Democrat John Fetterman addressed a raucous crowd of supporters early Wednesday morning after his narrow win against Republican challenger Mehmet Oz in the closely watched Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race.\n\n“We jammed them up, we held the line,” Fetterman said. “I never expected that we were going to turn these red counties blue, but we did what we needed to do.”\n\nIn his victory speech, Fetterman said he was “proud” of the issues he ran on, like abortion rights, increased minimum wage and health care.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nJohn Fetterman wins Pennsylvania Senate seat\n\nJohn Fetterman is the projected winner of the U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania, beating out Donald Trump-backed celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz and overcoming concerns that his stroke recovery had foreclosed his chances at victory.\n\nOpinion polls showed Oz gaining on Fetterman after the Democratic candidate's rocky debate performance.\n\nThe lieutenant governor suffered a stroke just days before the primary in May and has relied on closed captioning in recent interviews and the debate.\n\nIndependent analysts had predicted the Pennsylvania race would be the best chance for Democrats to pick up a Republican-held Senate seat. Fetterman and Oz have been vying for the open seat created by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey's retirement.\n\n\"It's official. I will be the next U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania,\" Fetterman tweeted early Wednesday morning.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nTexas Democrat Vicente Gonzalez reelected to House\n\nRep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, won his reelection campaign against GOP challenger Mayra Flores to represent Texas' 34th Congressional District, a setback for Republicans hoping to mobilize Hispanic voters.\n\nWith more than 88% of ballots counted, Gonzales led Flores by more than 8 points when the race was called.\n\nRepublicans have made inroads with Latino voters in states like Texas and Nevada, where Democrats are locked in tight congressional and statewide elections. But Gonzalez’ win is a blow to those efforts.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nNo victory or concession speeches tonight from Nevada Democrats\n\nJust as the crowd doubled in size at the Democratic ticket's election party on the Las Vegas Strip, Nevada's top candidates took the stage to thank their supporters – and encourage them to \"go home.\"\n\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Gov. Steve Sisolak said they didn't expect final election results to be available before the end of the night, but assured the crowd that they \"believe strongly when this is done, we're going to win this thing!\"\n\n\"It's going to be a couple of days,\" Sisolak said, \"so I encourage you to go home, get some sleep, and let the county continue (counting) tomorrow and Thursday. And we'll be celebrating then.\"\n\nAbsent of any victory or concession speeches tonight, Cortez Masto and Sisolak walked off the stage together as their supporters cheered. And soon after the two Democrats disappeared, the crowd quickly thinned out.\n\n– Rio Lacanlale\n\nNew Hampshire Democrat Chris Pappas reelected to House\n\nRep. Chris Pappas, D-N.H., won a second term serving New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District.\n\nPappas led Republican challenger Karoline Leavitt by more than 8 points; just under 80% of the vote had been counted when the race was called.\n\nIf Leavitt had won the race, she would have been the second member of Gen Z elected to the U.S. House of Representatives this election cycle.\n\n-Ella Lee\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar reelected in Texas\n\nDemocratic Rep. Henry Cuellar won reelection Tuesday, fending off an aggressive play by Republicans to remake the U.S.-Mexico border into a midterm battleground.\n\nCuellar’s victory over Republican Cassy Garcia holds the line for Democrats in an important stronghold for the party. Garcia was one of three Republican Latina candidates who ran competitive House races along the border after the GOP made inroads with Hispanic voters in 2020.\n\nCuellar is one of the most conservative Democrats in the House and narrowly survived a primary challenge this spring from a progressive challenger.\n\n– Paul J. Weber and Acacia Coronado, Associated Press\n\nRazor-thin margin in Georgia Senate race\n\nATLANTA – Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock told supporters late Tuesday he remains confident as Republican opponent Herschel Walker holds a razor-thin lead.\n\nWalker was ahead by less than 7,000 votes as votes continue to be counted as the clock hit midnight.\n\n“We always knew that this race would be close,” Warnock told supporters. “And so that's where we are. So y'all just hang in there. I'm feeling good.”\n\nWith about 88% of the total vote counted thus far, less than half a percentage point separates the two candidates.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNorth Carolina Sen.-elect Ted Budd: It's been a long night\n\nWINSTON-SALEM N.C. – It was later than he had hoped, but Ted Budd went before supporters shortly before midnight to claim victory in a U.S. Senate race in North Carolina.\n\n\"What an incredible and long night this has been,\" Budd said after a closer-than-expected win over Democrat Cheri Beasley.\n\nBudd's list of thank-yous included Donald Trump, whose endorsement propelled him to the Republican Senate nomination earlier this year.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nDemocratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham wins reelection in New Mexico\n\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, won reelection Tuesday over Republican Mark Ronchetti, a local TV weatherman turned politician who built his campaign on criticism of the first-term governor's performance, according NBC and ABC News\n\nGrisham, who served three terms in the U.S. House, was the first Democratic Latina to hold a governor’s seat at the time of her election in 2018. She ran then on a campaign focused on crime, education and immigration policy, but her reelection was centered on economic issues.\n\nAfter a failed bid for U.S. Senate in 2020, Ronchetti framed his gubernatorial campaign around Grisham's track record, blaming Democrats for a faltering economy and specifically blaming the incumbent's policies for New Mexico’s rank as second in the nation for violent crime. Ronchetti also got a last-minute endorsement this month from former President Donald Trump.\n\nA third candidate, Libertarian Karen Bedonie, a mother of eight and citizen of the Navajo Nation, polled in the single digits throughout the race. She initially hoped to run on the Republican ticket, and is among those that have questioned the validity of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n– Laura Bargfeld, Cronkite News\n\nDemocrats win in Hawaii Senate, governor’s races\n\nDemocrats easily won their races for the U.S. Senate and governorship in Hawaii.\n\nJosh Green overcame Republican challenger Duke Aiona for governor, while Sen.

Ned Lamont and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, along with Wes Moore, Maryland's newly elected governor, and Emilia Sykes, who rain in Ohio's newly redrawn 13th Congressional District – a closely watched tossup election.\n\n– Kathleen Wong and Christal Hayes\n\nDemocrat Janet Mills reelected as Maine governor\n\nMaine Gov. Janet Mills was reelected to the state’s governorship, beating her Republican opponent, Paul LePage. This will be Mill’s second term as Maine governor, according to NBC and CBS news.\n\nMills became the first woman elected as the state’s governor in 2018 when she was first elected. She also was the first woman to serve as the state’s attorney general, an office she served twice.\n\n– Sarah Elbeshbishi\n\nIn victory speech, Hassan offers credit for Bolduc\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maggie Hassan took the stage to an enthusiastic, and teary-eyed, crowd after NBC and CNN called the race in her favor.\n\n“Thank you to all the wonderful friends that are here tonight,” Hassan said, after continued chants of “Maggie” and “Six more years” from the crowd. “I love you too!\" Hassan said.\n\nHassan paused to credit Republican Don Bolduc for a hard-fought race, but not before shushing boos upon mention of his name.\n\n“No guys. No,” said Hassan, stopping the crowd. “I want to thank Don Bolduc for his service to our country. We share a love of country.\"\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nKiggans declares victory in Virginia\n\nRepublican Jen Kiggans declared victory in the hotly contested House race in Virginia, unseating Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria.\n\nSpeaking at her campaign’s election watch party at the Westin Virginia Beach Town Center, Kiggans gave a message of unity in her victory speech.\n\n“I believe it’s important to focus on the things that unite us, and not what divides us,” she said.\n\nKiggans wished her opponent well. “Although we may differ in our political ideologies, we certainly share a love for our navy and a love for our country,” she said.\n\n– Christina van Waasbergen\n\nDemocrat Ron Wyden reelected to Oregon U.S. Senate seat\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., won his reelection bid against Republican challenger Jo Rae Perkins, according to multiple reports.\n\nWyden, who led Perkins by more than 13 percentage points when the race was called, has been in Congress for more than 40 years overall, assuming his Senate seat in 1996.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nDemocrat Gov. Kathy Hochul wins New York governor race\n\nDemocratic Gov. Kathy Hochul won the New York governor’s race against Republican challenger Lee Zeldin, NBC and ABC reported.\n\nHochul unexpectedly became the state's first female governor in 2021, after former Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned amid sexual harassment allegations.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham: ‘Definitely not a Republican wave’\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said a \"red wave\" election didn’t appear to be materializing after Republicans were projected to lose Senate races in New Hampshire and Colorado, but he still predicted Republicans would take control of the upper chamber.\n\n“Definitely not a Republican wave,” Graham told NBC. “I think we’re going to be at 51, 52 when it’s all said and done.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nElection analysis: Even with Kemp, Vance wins, are midterm results more red ripple than wave?\n\nRepublican JD Vance wins Ohio Senate seat over Democrat Tim Ryan\n\nTrump-backed Republican author JD Vance won the Senate race in Ohio, beating Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, whose campaign had a fundraising edge but lacked national party support, according to NBC and ABC News.\n\nThe race has been one of the tightest in the country in recent polling and is a key test of the influence former President Donald Trump still wields. Trump endorsed Vance and went to Ohio to support him, telling rally goers in September that \"The entire MAGA movement is for J.D. Vance.\"\n\nIt’s also a bellwether for which way national tides are turning on Election Day. The Senate seat has been occupied since 2011 by Republican Sen. Rob Portman, who’s retiring.\n\n– Donovan Slack\n\nDemocrat Patty Murray wins reelection to Senate\n\nDemocratic Washington Sen. Patty Murray won reelection to the Senate against Republican opponent Tiffany Smiley after leading Smiley by nearly 15% with 56% of the precincts reporting, according to multiple reports.\n\nMurray will be serving her sixth term in the Senate. While in the Senate, Murray was the first female chair for the Veterans’ Affairs Committee and Budget Committee.\n\nRecent polls showing the race neck-and-neck suggested the veterans lawmaker was in the fight of her political life but an upset never materialized on election day.\n\n- Sarah Elbeshbishi\n\nPresident Biden congratulates Democratic winners\n\nPresident Joe Biden has completed congratulatory calls to Senator Chris Van Hollen, Senator Michael Bennet, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, and Representative Jennifer Wexton.\n\nVan Hollen of Maryland was reelected to his second Senate term, beating out Republican Chris Chaffee.\n\nBennet defended his Colorado Senate seat over Republican opponent Joe O’Dea for his third term in office. The race was competitive, according to multiple reports.\n\nBillionaire J.B. Pritzker swiftly beat Republican challenger Darren Bailey for reelection as Illinois Governor.\n\nIn a tight race, Virginia Democrat Jennifer Wexton won reelection to the U.S. House over Republican Hung Cao. This will be Wexton's third term.\n\n- Kathleen Wong\n\nRepublican Ted Budd wins North Carolina Senate seat\n\nTrump-endorsed Ted Budd won the race for a North Carolina Senate seat, defeating Democrat and former state Supreme Court chief justice Cheri Beasley.\n\nComing into tonight, the three-term GOP congressman had a five-point lead over Beasley in a poll by Emerson College Polling and The Hill, according NBC and ABC News.\n\nTheirs was among the most competitive Senate races this election cycle, seen as a potential factor in Republican efforts to gain the majority. The North Carolina seat was up for grabs for either party, with Republican Richard Burr retiring after his fourth term as Senator.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nShapiro win brings relief for Pennsylvania Democrats\n\nSWARTHMORE, Pa.- Bonnee B. Bentum feels safer tonight, knowing Democrat Josh Shapiro won the governor’s seat and blocked a Republican supermajority in Pennsylvania that could have threatened abortion rights and voting rights.\n\nShe said this as someone who works for a state Democratic senator, serves as an executive board member of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers, and mostly as a Black woman.\n\nBentum pointedly describes what was at stake: “My life, my daughter’s life…to live freely.”\n\n- Candy Woodall\n\nNew Maryland voter choses digital over paper vote\n\nTUXEDO, Md. - Bill Aylin is a lifelong voter, but he was still surprised when he voted for the first time in Maryland after moving from Georgia.\n\n“All of Georgia is digital and this one is mostly paper,” said Aylin, who found things at the Judith P. Hoyer Early Childhood Center \"radically\" different from what he was used to. But the Prince George's County polling place also offered two digital machines, so he chose to vote on one of those.\n\nHe said he feel it’s his duty to vote, and that he found the House and Senate races to be the most important. Outside of that there were some questions about bonds and borrowing money that drew his attention.\n\n“I’m fine with schools borrowing money,\" Aylin said. “I’m not fine with it for the government.”\n\n- Haley Smilow, Cronkite News\n\nRepublican Brian Kemp reelected as Georgia governor\n\nRepublican incumbent Brian Kemp won the race for Georgia governor, defeating Democratic candidate and now two-time opponent Stacey Abrams, according to NBC and ABC News.\n\nThe two faced off once before back in 2018, with Kemp narrowly claiming victory after a runoff election. This gubernatorial contest has been one of the most closely watched this midterm cycle as both candidates are major players in their parties.\n\nThe tightly fought race, along with Sen. Raphael Warnock’s bid to keep his seat in Congress, was expected to serve as a litmus test of just how strong the Democratic coalition in Georgia is and whether it can withstand an election largely viewed as a referendum on President Joe Biden, whose approval ratings have suffered throughout his second year.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBrian Kemp's win: 3 takeaways from the Georgia governor's race\n\nVirginia Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria unseated by Jennifer Kiggans\n\nRepublican state Sen. Jennifer Kiggans unseated incumbent Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., Tuesday in Virginia's 2nd District, which gained a more Republican tilt in redistricting but was still considered a toss-up.\n\nBoth Luria and Kiggans are Navy veterans who campaigned on promises to fight for defense and veterans issues.\n\nKiggans, who currently represents Legislative District 7 in the Tidewater region of the state, positioned herself as the candidate to restore American strength that she said has been injured by the policies of the Biden administration - policies she said Luria continually backed.\n\nLuria, a two-term House member, is also a member of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. A main thrust of her campaign was what she called Kiggans' failure to discuss her stance on results of the 2020 election.\n\n– Emilee Miranda, Cronkite News\n\nDoes early good news for Dems mean a red tsunami isn't materializing?\n\nTwo vulnerable House Democrats in Virginia swing districts appeared to be on their way to victories, perhaps signaling that a red tsunami many predicted isn’t materializing.\n\nCNN and NBC projected that U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., defeated Republican challenger Yesli Vega in the state’s 7th congressional district, a fiercely fought battleground, while Jennifer Wexton, D-Va., was the projected winner over Republican Hung Cha in the 10th congressional district.\n\n“I’m still waiting for the Red Wave to arrive,” veteran political handicapper Stuart Rothenberger said on Twitter. “It may still come, but I have not seen it yet. That does not mean the Rs won’t win the House and Senate.”\n\nRepublicans picked up a third battleground seat in Virginia, however, with CNN projecting Jen Kiggans defeated Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va.\n\nIn a fourth battleground House race in Rhode Island, Democrat Seth Magaziner is the projected winner over Republican Allan Fung, mayor of Cranston, R.I.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nRepublican Mike Crapo wins reelection to Idaho Senate seat\n\nRepublican Sen. Mike Crapo defended his Senate seat in the race against Democratic challenger David Roth.\n\nCrapo, a former attorney who previously served in the U.S. House and the Idaho Legislature, will now serve his fifth term in the Senate.

Gavin Newsom wins reelection\n\nDemocrat Gov.

Abigail Spanberger, top GOP target, wins reelection\n\nRep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., won re-election Tuesday over Republican challenger Yesli Vega in a redrawn Virginia 7th District, a potential bellwether for Democrats odds in the U.S. House.\n\nBoth Spanberger and Vega have law enforcement backgrounds. But Spanberger, a two-term congresswoman and the first Democrat elected to represent the 7th district since 1971, highlighted her bipartisan record throughout the campaign.\n\nVega, a first-generation Salvadoran-American and a one-term Prince William County supervisor, positioned herself as a check on the Biden administration. She got a last-minute endorsement from former President Donald Trump last week, but did not actively embrace it.\n\n– Emilee Miranda, Cronkite News\n\nRepublican Chuck Grassley reelected to Senate seat\n\nRepublican Chuck Grassley has defended his Iowa Senate seat against Democratic challenger Michael Franken, according to ABC and NBC.\n\nGrassley has served in office since 1959. The 89-year-old congressman will now serve his sixth term, which upon completion would make him the second-oldest member of Congress at 95 years old.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nDemocrat Josh Shapiro wins Pennsylvania governor\n\nPennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro bested Trump-backed Republican Doug Mastriano to win the governor’s race in Pennsylvania, according to NBC and Fox news.\n\nShapiro had been leading Mastriano by significant margins in recent polling.\n\nShapiro, the state’s attorney general since 2017, led Mastriano 52%-40% in a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll last week. He is a former state representative who cast himself as someone willing to take the fight to the status quo. Shapiro defended the state’s presidential election results in 2020 against an onslaught of legal challenges.\n\nMastriano, a state senator and retired Army colonel, marched on the U.S. Capitol in the Jan. 6 attack and was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, who visited the state to rally for him.\n\nMastriano supported unfounded claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election and held a hearing featuring Rudy Giuliani and Trump, via call-in, hyping voting irregularities.\n\n- Donovan Slack\n\nDemocrat Maggie Hassan wins reelection to U.S. Senate\n\nSen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., beat back Trump-endorsed Republican challenger Don Bolduc in a race that narrowed sharply in the final days despite the state being carried by President Joe Biden in 2020, according to ABC and NBC News\n\nHassan, who served as governor from 2013 until she entered the Senate in 2017, tried to distance herself from the president throughout her campaign. She criticized the administration for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan last year and for its handling of rising inflation.\n\nBolduc, a retired Army general, repeated false claims during the primary that the 2020 election was stolen, but he walked those back after securing the GOP nomination in September. In October, the National Republican Senatorial Committee stopped funding Bolduc’s campaign to prioritize other battleground states.\n\n– Ryan Knappenberger\n\nProgressive activist becomes first Gen Z-er to be elected to Congress\n\nA former March for Our Lives and ACLU activist, Maxwell Alejandro Frost, 25, won his election bid against Republican Army veteran Calvin Wimbish to represent Florida's 10th Congressional District, which includes the Orlando area.

O'Rourke's name recognition and charisma fueled Democratic hopes that he could win the governor's race.\n\nBut as of last week, Abbott was favored to win by nearly 10 points, according to FiveThirtyEight polling averages.

And the GOP overwhelmingly outspent Democrats to hammer this message across.\n\nDemocrat Charlie Crist centered his campaign on a pledge to protect abortion rights in his fight with Gov.

Bailey\n\nDonald Trump threatens Ron DeSantis (if he runs against him)\n\nDonald Trump is all but threatening Ron DeSantis with personal attacks if the Florida governor decides to run against him for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\n“If he runs, he runs,” Trump recently told a group of reporters, according to The Wall Street Journal. \"If he did run, I will tell you things about him that won’t be very flattering. I know more about him than anybody other than perhaps his wife, who is really running his campaign.”\n\nDeSantis, who is expected to win re-election as governor on Tuesday, has not commented on Trump's jibes; he also hasn't said whether he is willing to run against Trump in 2024.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nNancy Pelosi says she believes Democrats can hold majority\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she believes Democrats have a path to hold the majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nDuring an interview with PBS NewsHour, Pelosi said Democratic candidates are connecting with voters in their districts and focusing on what is important to their constituents, whether it be lowering costs, abortion or climate change.\n\n“We own the ground out there today,” Pelosi said. “Just because a pundit in Washington says ‘history says you can't win,’ is no deterrent for the enthusiasm we have out there. I think you'll be surprised this evening.”\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nVoting times extended at some polling sites after delays\n\nPolls in several states will allow voters to cast their ballots later than planned following unexpected delays.\n\nIn Georgia, where polls are scheduled to close at 7 p.m., at least two precincts are giving voters more time after opening late. A location in Cobb County will extend its voting time by 45 minutes and a location in DeKalb County will remain open an extra 39 minutes, according to state Democratic officials.\n\nA paper shortage in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, caused a judge to order voting sites there to remain open until 10 p.m. Polling places in the county were supposed to close at 8 p.m., according to the county’s website.\n\nAnd in North Carolina, voting will be delayed by an hour at three polling sites after one precinct opened late, leaving staff “locked out,” and two others experienced printing problems, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections.\n\n– Phillip M.

Election officials say the tabulation machines are certified by state and federal inspectors, which is required under the law.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's claims there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election have been roundly debunked.\n\n— Robert Anglen, The Arizona Republic\n\nOhio sets record for early voting\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose announced Ohio voters set a record this year for early voting in a nonpresidential election year.\n\nMore than 1.55 million Ohioans either voted early in-person or requested a mail-in absentee ballot for this election.\n\n“This is an increase of 3.9% over the previous record set in 2018,” according to the Secretary of State's office.

That's on top of the 2.5 million who've already voted early.\n\nGeorgia's polls close at 7 p.m. EST\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nIn Rep. Abigail Spanberger's Virginia district, inflation and health care drive voters\n\nFor voters in Prince William County, where Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger is on the ballot against Republican Yesli Vega for Virginia’s 7th Congressional District, the main issues include inflation and abortion.\n\nReba Gravelle, a 40-year resident of the Woodbridge area, said her candidate would have to support her views on abortion. “I’m a very pro-life person and so my candidate needed to support that,” she said.\n\nJoshua King, a veteran and current deputy sheriff, said health care brought him to the polls for Democrats. King also took into consideration his daughter, who has autism. “I support any candidate who decides that they want to help out our special needs community because they’re marginalized,” he said.\n\n– Kaila Nichols and Dante Nieto, Medill News Service\n\nIn Texas, Beto O'Rourke supporters argue with protesters over LGBTQ issues\n\nDemocrat Beto O’Rourke, who is challenging Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, held an Election Day meet-and-greet outside a public library in North Dallas this morning. While O’Rourke talked with a ring of supporters, far-right agitators jostled with onlookers and tried to disrupt the candidate’s speech, with little success.\n\nThe handful of anti-O’Rourke onlookers shouted statements about pedophilia and transgender rights that have become a refrain of the extremist right in Texas in recent months. Despite some high-spirited discussions with the candidate’s supporters, the hecklers were unable to push past them and get close to O’Rourke, who spoke to the crowd for about an hour.\n\nTransgender rights have become a political lightning rod in Texas, which has also seen a surge in protests and attacks on LGBTQ-friendly events such as family friendly drag shows. O’Rourke has been endorsed by several LGBTQ organizations, and has criticized Abbott for his support of policies that he says discriminate against LGBTQ people.\n\n– Will Carless\n\nBiden: 'MAGA Republicans' don’t care about Black communities\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden warned in an Election Day radio interview targeted at Black Americans that far-right “MAGA Republicans” don’t care about African-American communities.\n\n“This is not your father’s Republican Party,” Biden said on the “D.L. Hughley Show” when asked about his message to Black Americans who are still on the fence about voting.\n\nMAGA Republicans are “a different breed of cat,” Biden said in the interview, which was taped Tuesday morning. “They care about your community about as much as … well, anyway,” he said, without finishing the sentence. “You’ve seen what you’ve got from that community,” he added.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nNorth Carolina Senate race: Ted Budd supporters optimistic at polls\n\nWINSTON-SALEM, N.C. – North Carolina has never elected a woman of color to the U.S. Senate, and many voters don't expect that to change Tuesday.\n\nSupporters of Democrat Cheri Beasley say they are not exactly confident, but some remain hopeful: \"Some of the underdogs come out on top!\" said Jannet Blue, 58, a Department of Motor Vehicles supervisor who voted in Winston-Salem.\n\nBackers of Republican Ted Budd are more confident; his poll lead has grown in recent weeks, and voters said it just feels like a Republican year in the Tar Heel State. \"We need to keep working people working,\" said James Wilcox, 61, a Winston-Salem businessman.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nArizona voting machines: Maricopa County resolves ballot tabulation issues at some locations\n\nThe Maricopa County Elections Department found a solution for tabulation issues that affected about 60 of the county’s 223 voting centers, the county government said Tuesday.\n\nPrinters at the locations were not producing dark enough timing marks on ballots, according to Maricopa County’s official Twitter. To resolve the issue, county technicians changed the printer settings. The solution has so far worked at 17 locations and technicians have been deployed to the remaining locations to resolve the issue, according to the county.\n\nStephen Richer, Maricopa County recorder, issued an apology to voters on his personal Twitter, promising that “every legal vote will be tabulated.\"\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nPhiladelphia voting ‘going great’ so far\n\nPHILADELPHIA – Tuesday has been a “wonderful” day for voting in the city, according to Philadelphia Deputy Commissioner Nick Custodio.\n\n“It’s going great,” he told USA TODAY. “Nothing has risen to a level of concern.”\n\nThe overwhelming majority of voters have been able to cast ballots without incident and the processing has been “going smoothly,” Custodio said.\n\nPolls are open until 8 p.m. and voters can turn in mailed ballots until that time in Pennsylvania.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nFor some in New Hampshire, Biden’s stake in democracy gets through\n\nBEDFORD, N.H. – For some in New Hampshire, where presidential candidates flock every four years, President Joe Biden’s message that democracy is at stake resonated with some voters.\n\nJonathan French says it’s why he’s voting for Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan over Republican Don Bolduc.\n\n“I believe in democracy. Don Bolduc denies the election results from 2020,” French simply put. But at the same time, French isn’t sure if he wants to see Biden run again in 2024. “We’ll wait and see,” said French.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMailed ballots drive higher turnout in Philadelphia\n\nPHILADELPHIA – There is a higher turnout today and the bulk of the counting will be done tonight, according to Philadelphia Deputy Commissioner Nick Custodio.\n\nAbout 101,000 mailed ballots will be processed tonight, he told USA TODAY, with the first tally showing five minutes after the polls close at 8 p.m. in Pennsylvania. The counting will take “the normal amount of time,” meaning most of the results will be in tomorrow or Thursday, he said.\n\nCustodio is expecting a higher turnout in this election compared to 2018 because of mail-in voting, he said.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nWhy one voter in Philadelphia is staying home\n\nPHILADELPHIA – Standing outside a Save A Lot grocery store, Lori Dornan explains why she’s shopping after work instead of voting.\n\n“My vote will just give a politician more money and power.

Voters and children playing in the area were escorted into the voting room, he said, and the doors were shut.\n\nLibrary staff declined to comment on the incident. Police would not confirm whether a knife was involved, saying only that someone was taken into custody following a disturbance in which no one was injured. Voting at the library was disrupted for about 30 minutes, the poll worker said, but has since returned to normal operations.\n\n– Lawrence Andrea\n\nGet your 2022 live midterm election results here\n\nThe 2022 midterm elections are underway and American voters are hitting the polls to elect members of the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as governors in certain states.\n\nFollow our live coverage for Senate results, House results and gubernatorial results begin to roll in.

Voting rights groups worry the tactic called “overvoting” could lower voter confidence and slow down counting.\n\n“We have seen a few loosely organized groups pushing for folks to purposely overvote their ballot to make sure their ballot is hand counted this cycle,” said Liz Wester, director of the New Hampshire Voter Empowerment Task Force, a voting rights group.\n\nNew Hampshire Secretary of State, David Scanlan, told USA TODAY that the state is already prepared for hand counting; his office has sent more election workers to polling places to assist in counting ballots.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCommon Cause: Election glitches routine, with some 'weird' anecdotes in Ohio\n\nCatherine Turcer, executive director of Common Cause of Ohio, said most questions about voting have been routine, with a couple of “weird” examples.\n\nA priest in Toledo was checking the identification of voters, Turcer said. In Summit County, around Akron, a man was visiting polling places and just watching before being asked to move along, she said.\n\nBut most voting problems reported nationwide were routine, such as problems with voting machines forcing longer lines, not systemic, said Sylvia Albert, Common Cause director of voting and elections.\n\n“What we’re seeing is really what we see in every election, isolated incidents of some problems,” Albert said. “No election is perfect. Election officials are doing their job.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nFor some, Walker’s candidacy is about ‘grace and forgiveness’\n\nKENNESAW, Ga. – Former football player Herschel Walker’s personal controversies have made his Senate campaign a target for Democrats, but many Georgia voters think differently.\n\n“Herschel is real, he’s one of us,” voter Tricia Choi, 55, told USA TODAY. Choi said for many Walker's story is about the redemptive power of Jesus Christ, which she said appeals to faith-based voters.\n\nWalker, who is running to unseat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, has been accused of domestic abuse by his ex-wife. Most recently, allegations surfaced that he pressured former girlfriends to have abortions, which he has denied.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nMark Kelly, Blake Masters set for final pitch in Arizona Senate race\n\nOn one side is Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat and former astronaut whose wife was shot in the head by an angry constituent. On the other is Blake Masters, a tech investor and first-time candidate backed by a billionaire patron and endorsed by Trump.\n\nThe two are locked in what’s become an increasingly tight race, with Kelly’s initial advantage in the polls narrowing to a dead heat.\n\nWith hours to go until polling places close, Kelly planned to hit get-out-the-vote events in west Phoenix and Tucson. Masters planned to spend election night at the Arizona Republican Party’s watch event in Scottsdale.\n\nMaricopa County, where problems have been reported at one out of five polling sites, is home to Phoenix and is Arizona’s most populous county. It's also one of the largest in the nation – and while it has tended to vote for Republican candidates in recent years, Biden carried it in 2020.\n\nThe vote there will likely be critical to deciding the tossup Senate race.\n\n— Alison Steinbach, The Arizona Republic, Donovan Slack, and John Fritze\n\nSnowstorm greets voters in crucial swing county\n\nIt was a snowy Election Day in Washoe County, Nevada.\n\nThe county is crucial territory for Nevada – and the nation – as Democrat Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is fending off a challenge from Trump-backed Republican Adam Laxalt. The contest is among a handful that could determine who controls the Senate – and the fate of Biden's agenda for the next two years.\n\nMarc Picker, poll manager at Damonte Ranch High School, said turnout so far is among the highest he has seen despite the weather. One Democratic voter, Reno resident Margaret Smith, said few flakes wouldn't have kept her away.\n\n“I’m like the U.S. Postal Service – neither rain, sleet or snow will stop me from going out like Santa,” Smith said. “(Voting) is that important.”\n\nAnother Reno voter, Jim Lewis, agreed, despite being on the opposite end of the political spectrum. “If they like their freedom and liberty, they should go out there and not be afraid,” he said.\n\n— Jason Hidalgo, Reno Gazette Journal, and Donovan Slack\n\nStocks rally on expectations of GOP inroads\n\nStocks rallied Tuesday on expectations that Republicans will retake at least one chamber of Congress, likely the House of Representatives.

The closest place we can get to the truth and how candidates really think is through a debate,\" he said.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nIllinois county reports election-related cyberattack, but voting not compromised, officials say\n\nChampaign County, Ill., is fighting off an election-related cyberattack that is unrelated to actual voting operations, according to officials there, who say connectivity issues and computer server performance are making it harder – but not impossible – for people to vote.\n\n“The Clerk’s Office believes these are due to cyber-attacks on the network and servers,” Champaign County Clerk Aaron Ammons said in a news release.\n\nChief Deputy Clerk Angie Patton told USA TODAY that the clerk’s office has been the target of repeated DDOS, or Distributed Denial of Service, attacks and that she believes other counties may have been targeted as well.\n\nBut she said IT specialists have secured the Clerk's website – and election operations – and that no data or information has been compromised and the election is secure. She urged voters waiting in long lines to either wait or go to another polling place within the county since voters can cast their ballots there as well.\n\n— Josh Meyer\n\nAt the top of the Texas ticket: Gov.

O’Rourke caught the attention of the state and nation after running against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018. Abbott is fighting for a third term.\n\nAbbott has led ahead of O’Rourke in Texas polls; margins sometimes reach single digits. On Oct. 30, a poll by the University of Texas at Tyler showed Abbott leading by 6 percentage points among likely voters. Another October poll by the University of Texas Politics Project showed Abbott leading by 11 points.\n\nO’Rourke seeks to galvanize voters around abortion access and gun legislation. O’Rourke’s final ad ahead of Election Day centered around his support for abortion access.\n\n— Nusaiba Mizan\n\nBiden spending Election Day at the White House\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden is spending Election Day at the White House with no public events on his schedule.\n\nThe White House said he dropped in on a virtual phone bank by the Democratic National Committee to thank staff and volunteers and taped a radio interview targeted at Black Americans.\n\nThe president has already cast his midterm ballot. Accompanied by one of his granddaughters, a first-time voter, Biden voted in Wilmington, Delaware, on Oct. 29.\n\nBiden is expected to address the nation about the election results on Wednesday, though they are likely to be incomplete at that point.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nTrump says he voted for DeSantis, hints again at presidential run\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said he voted Tuesday morning for Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, while also dropping more hints that he’ll soon declare a third run for the White House, according to media reports.\n\nTrump spoke to the media after he cast his vote at the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center on Tuesday morning, according to video posted by the local CBS news station CBS12. Former first lady Melania Trump joined him. \"No matter who you vote for, you have to vote,\" Trump told a sparse crowd outside the polling station.\n\nTrump also repeated that he’ll be making an announcement a week from today at his Mar-a-Lago home and resort in Palm Beach, though he didn't say about what. \"I think Tuesday will be a very exciting day for a lot of people,” Trump said, adding that, “The country has gotten very bad.

That may be changing this year. Early voting numbers as of Tuesday morning show Republicans holding a slight edge of almost 4,000 votes over Democrats.\n\nIf the numbers hold up, it would represent one of the most dramatic electoral turnarounds in Florida history and may solidify the Sunshine State as a red, Republican state moving forward.\n\n— Sergio Bustos, USA Today Network-Florida Enterprise/Politics Editor\n\nYOUR GUIDE TO MIDTERMS:Voting rights, ballot access and key issues: A guide to midterm elections in your state\n\nDon Bolduc says he will accept Election 2022 results if he loses to Maggie Hassan\n\nRepublican U.S. Senate candidate Don Bolduc said Tuesday that his opponent, Democratic Sen.

That dynamic hands Trump enormous potential proxy power if the party makes good on its strong prospects and wins the House of Representatives in November.\n\nIn a sign that McCarthy may have mended some fences over the weekend and is trying to bolster his standing in Trump world, the House minority leader will lead a GOP delegation, which includes Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, to the southern US border on Monday.\n\nGreene, an extreme pro-Trump lawmaker, has warned McCarthy will have to satisfy a series of demands before he gets votes for speaker from her and like-minded Republican representatives. The trip will underscore how immigration – perhaps Trump’s signature issue – is a glue that unites GOP factions and is at the center of the party’s midterm election quest given the White House’s vulnerabilities on the issue.\n\nThe McCarthy drama, which for a while last week threatened to shatter his career – until an outwardly magnanimous Trump collected his vow of loyalty – was triggered when two New York Times reporters revealed that McCarthy had told fellow top Republicans that he was considering advising Trump to step down after the insurrection in January last year. The House minority leader flatly denied the claim and slammed the reporters, Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns, as tools of a biased, corporate media. But appearing on MSNBC, the reporters soon revealed a tape that obliterated McCarthy’s denials and appeared to leave him on wafer thin ground.\n\nIn another time, McCarthy’s eviscerated credibility might have destroyed his political future. But in an age in which most GOP power depends on Trump’s patronage, McCarthy’s subsequent recommitment to the Trump movement might have actually strengthened his claims to the speakership.\n\nAnd it proved that anyone with aspirations of power in the GOP, at least in the House, must make a similar decision to prioritize loyalty to Trump over simple facts and truth.\n\nThis is not a partisan point – it’s borne out by events of four tumultuous years of the Trump presidency, two impeachments and the ex-President’s lies that the 2020 election was a fraud. And it represents judgments by lawmakers about the views of their constituents in the pro-Trump base of the party, which remains strongly aligned with the ex-President and favorable to his alternative 2020 reality.\n\nMcCarthy and Trump spoke Thursday night to discuss the Times story. The younger man’s apparent success in papering over what could have been a political nightmare suggests that the same unwillingness to speak truth to the ex-President’s excesses that marked the GOP during his term in office will be a dominant feature of American politics in the midterm campaign and ahead of the 2024 election if Trump runs.\n\nA GOP midterm win would hand Trump a powerful weapon\n\nMcCarthy’s conduct has confirmed that a future GOP House majority would operate as a political subsidiary for the ex-President. This will give Trump a powerful weapon in Washington as he seeks to destroy the presidency of Joe Biden, his vanquisher in the 2020 election and possible 2024 rival.\n\nIn practice, it would mean McCarthy gives even greater latitude to vehemently pro-Trump members of the GOP conference – like Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, who is vowing to pummel the Biden White House with investigations if Republicans get the speaker’s gavel next year. Given that he’s even more in Trump’s debt than before, McCarthy may be in less of a position to reign in GOP radicals like Greene. The Georgia Republican, testifying last week in an unprecedented disqualification hearing probing whether she should be barred from office over her alleged role in the January 6 insurrection, repeatedly said she could not remember past comments or interactions and repeated false claims about Trump winning the election.\n\nIn a broader sense, events of the last few days pose grave questions for American democracy since Trump’s authoritarian streak has only become more extreme as he sought to overturn the 2020 election and seeks to turn the 2022 midterms into a pageant of personal revenge. And there is even less evidence that the House GOP, which has worked to whitewash his incitement on January 6, 2021, has the interest or the political capacity to do anything to curtail him in the future.\n\nTrump embraces new evidence of his power\n\nTrump understands the power dynamic perfectly. McCarthy’s phone call with the ex-President after the audio emerged reestablished that his future was in Trump’s hands and reinforced perceptions that Trump is the true locus of GOP power.\n\nThe ex-President relishes public displays of fealty. It suits him and his zeal for power for McCarthy to be portrayed in the media as his puppet and for McCarthy to turn political somersaults to retain Trump’s favor.\n\nThus, the ex-President told the Wall Street Journal in an interview on Friday that his relationship with McCarthy remains good because the minority leader had quickly moved to row back his apparent criticism.\n\nAnd referring to Republicans, who have largely embraced him after slamming his role in the Capitol insurrection, Trump said: “It’s all a big compliment, frankly,” adding, “They realized they were wrong and supported me.”\n\nDemocrats seize on Trump’s shadow\n\nStill, the latest example of Trump’s dominance of the GOP could play into Democratic claims that the former President represents a mortal danger to American democracy.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” Sunday that McCarthy’s conduct in recent days showed that he was a “liar and a traitor.”\n\n“This is outrageous. And that is really the illness that pervades the Republican leadership right now, that they say one thing to the American public and something else in private,” Warren said.\n\nBut the gravest moment of danger for McCarthy appears to have passed – at least for now – though there are no guarantees when it comes to Trump. The ex-President has a long record of souring on subordinates he once indulged. He, for instance, withdrew his endorsement of Rep. Mo Brooks’ Senate campaign after the Alabama congressman said it was time to move on from the 2020 election.\n\nSo McCarthy’s speakership hopes – already facing some skepticism from the pro-Trump wing of the GOP – will never be a sure thing right up until the moment that Republicans claim power if they win back the House in November.\n\nBut the California Republican can also count on strong loyalty of many of the GOP rank and file in the House, partly through his prodigious fundraising.\n\nSome party lawmakers told CNN’s Melanie Zanona, Manu Raju and Lauren Fox in recent days that the leader was not seriously damaged by the episode.\n\nMcCarthy has long considered the support of Trump’s base the critical factor in winning back the House. His entire strategy of downplaying the fallout from the January 6 insurrection has been directed toward this aim.\n\nAnd a huge GOP win in November would also bolster McCarthy’s authority and long-held hopes of becoming speaker. Political circumstances appear to be aligning with his goal. With each month that passes, the plight of Democrats – plagued by high gas prices and raging inflation – fails to improve and the McCarthy victory scenario becomes even more plausible.\n\nWhile there are profound questions raised by Trump’s enduring power, the failure of the Biden administration to meaningfully ease higher prices for everyday goods – even if other parts of the economy are roaring back – offers Republicans compelling arguments to make to voters.\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican who flipped a Biden state last fall, showed that Democratic campaigns rooted in the danger from Trump can be neutralized by sharp attacks on them over costly grocery bills and perceptions about a politicized education system.\n\nAnd while Washington commentators and Democratic lawmakers highlight the blatant nature of McCarthy’s lies, the fragmented and hyper-partisan nature of US media means their concerns will not move most Republican voters.\n\nTherein lies the essential logic behind McCarthy’s choice: the only outcome of his latest controversy that could imperil his hopes of becoming speaker would be if he ended up further estranged from Trump.\n\nSo his path forward was obvious. And that is likely to have huge consequences for what Washington looks like in January 2023 and beyond.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/14/politics/trump-documents-mar-a-lago/index.html", "title": "Mar-a-Lago -- and Trump -- have long caused concerns for US ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nRevealing an airstrike over “beautiful” chocolate cake. A trespasser from China carrying flash drives and electronics. Cellphone photos of the “nuclear football” briefcase. And now, classified documents recovered during an FBI search.\n\nMar-a-Lago, the stone-walled oceanfront estate Donald Trump labeled the “Winter White House,” has long been a source of headaches for national security and intelligence professionals. Its clubby atmosphere, sprawling guest-list and talkative proprietor combined into a “nightmare” for keeping the government’s most closely held secrets, one former intelligence official said.\n\nNow, the 114-room mansion and its various outbuildings are at the center of a Justice Department investigation into Trump’s handling of presidential material. After an hours-long search of the property last week, FBI agents seized 11 sets of documents, some marked as “sensitive compartmented information” — among the highest levels of government secrets. CNN reported Saturday that one of Trump’s attorneys claimed in June that no classified material remained at the club – raising fresh questions about the number of people who have legal exposure in the ongoing investigation.\n\nIn many ways, Trump’s 20-acre compound in Palm Beach, Florida, amounts to the physical embodiment of what some former aides describe as a haphazard-at-best approach by the former President to classified documents and information.\n\n“Mar-a-Lago has been a porous place ever since Trump declared his candidacy and started winning primaries several years ago,” said Aki Peritz, a former CIA counterterrorism analyst. “If you were any intelligence service, friendly or unfriendly, worth their salt, they would be concentrating their efforts on this incredibly porous place.”\n\nWhen Trump departed office in January 2021, it was Mar-a-Lago where he decamped, sore from a loss he refused to acknowledge. The club, with its paying members and large oil paintings of Trump as a younger man, was a welcome refuge.\n\nIt was also the destination for dozens of cardboard boxes, packed in haste in the final days of his administration and shipped in white trucks to Florida. People familiar with Trump’s exit from Washington said the process of packing was rushed, in part because the outgoing President refused to engage in activities that would signal he’d lost the election. When it became clear he would need to leave the White House, items were quickly stowed away in boxes and shipped south without a clearly organized system.\n\n“Trump kept a lot of things in his files that were not in the regular system or that had been given to him in the course of intelligence briefings,” said John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser. “I can easily imagine in the last chaotic days at the White House, since he didn’t think he was going to leave until the last minute, they were just throwing things in boxes, and it included a lot of things he had accumulated over the four years.”\n\nSome boxes, including some containing classified documents, had ended up at the club after Trump’s presidency concluded. When federal investigators – including the chief of counterintelligence and export control at the Justice Department – traveled to Mar-a-Lago in June to discuss the classified documents with Trump and his lawyers, they voiced concern the room wasn’t properly secured.\n\nTrump’s team added a new lock onto the door. But FBI agents returned to Mar-a-Lago last week to execute a search warrant on the property that identified three possible crimes: violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and criminal handling of government records.\n\nThe items taken away after Monday’s search included a leather box of documents, binders of photos, “miscellaneous top secret documents” and “Info re. President of France,” according to the search warrant. Trump and his allies have claimed he used his presidential prerogative to declassify the documents before leaving office, though haven’t provided any evidence of a formal process taking place.\n\n“My only surprise was that there wasn’t even more taken to Mar-a-Lago,” Bolton said.\n\nA habit of defying norms\n\nLast week was not the first time federal intelligence officials worried about how Trump was keeping the government’s secrets. Nearly as soon as he took office, Trump demonstrated a willingness to flout protocols for guarding sensitive information.\n\nIn 2017, he spontaneously revealed highly classified information about an Islamic State plot to a group of Russian visitors, including the foreign minister, that the US had received from Israel. It caused deep anger in both countries’ intelligence services.\n\nWhen he was briefed by intelligence officials in 2019 about an explosion in Iran, he later tweeted out a highly classified satellite photo of the facility – despite having heard officials’ concerns beforehand that doing so could reveal American capabilities.\n\nTrump preferred to receive intelligence updates electronically, according to his third chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, though he sometimes asked to keep physical documents from classified briefings.\n\n“From time to time the President would say, ‘Can I keep this?’ But we had entire teams of people to make sure those documents didn’t get left behind, didn’t get taken up to the residence. He would use them. That was his right as the President of the United States,” Mulvaney said.\n\nStill, the tracking of records was not a priority for Trump, according to several former officials. When he asked to keep sensitive documents, officials sometimes became concerned at what would happen to the material. When he traveled, aides often followed close behind toting cardboard boxes where they’d collected stacks of papers Trump had left behind.\n\nMixing business with pleasure\n\nAt Mar-a-Lago, worries about Trump revealing top government secrets — accidentally or otherwise — were amplified. The facility acts as a pool club, spa, restaurant and clubhouse for its members and their guests; the gold-trimmed Donald J. Trump ballroom can be rented for weddings and other events.\n\nWhile the Secret Service screens visitors for weapons and checks their names against a list, they are not responsible for protecting secret documents or guarding against potential interference.\n\nMembers flocked to Trump’s club when he was in town as President, and rules enacted early in his tenure against taking photos in the dining room were not always strictly followed.\n\nThat became evident in February 2017, when Trump hosted the late then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan for dinner on the patio. After a North Korean missile launch interrupted the meal, Trump and Abe huddled with their national security aides in full view of other diners, who picked away at wedge salads with blue cheese while snapping photos of the leaders’ impromptu crisis talks.\n\nLater, Trump’s aides insisted he had ducked into a secure room – known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) – to receive updates on the launch, and that he and Abe were simply discussing the logistics for their press statements.\n\nYet the flood of photos posted to social media by Mar-a-Lago members showed the two leaders poring over documents at their dinner table, along with aides working on laptops and Trump speaking on his cellphone. At one point, staffers used the flashlights on their cellphones to illuminate documents the leaders were reading.\n\nSoon after, some new rules went in effect to limit who could be at the club when Trump was there. Reservations were required two weeks in advance, and new limits were placed on the number of guests that members were permitted to bring.\n\nTrump returned to the Mar-a-Lago SCIF in spring 2017 to discuss launching an airstrike on Syria; at the time, he was hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping for dinner. Later, he said he returned to the table to inform Xi of his decision as they ate the “most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you’ve ever seen.”\n\nOne of the concerns Trump’s aides had at Mar-a-Lago was their relative inability to discern who exactly he was speaking with while he was there. Compared to the White House, with its strict access lists, it was sometimes unclear even to Trump’s senior-most advisers who he’d come into contact with at the club.\n\nTrump’s second chief of staff, John Kelly, worked to limit who had access to Trump at Mar-a-Lago, though there was little expectation he or any other aide would be able to fully restrict the President’s conversations with friends and paying Mar-a-Lago members. Kelly told associates at the time he was more interested in knowing who Trump was speaking with than preventing the conversations from happening.\n\nKelly also worked to implement a more structured system for the handling of classified material, though Trump’s cooperation in the system was not always guaranteed.\n\nManaging a variety of risks\n\nWhile at Mar-a-Lago, Trump did not always use his SCIF when viewing classified documents, according to one person familiar with the matter. And his penchant for sharing what he knew with his interlocutors was a source of constant frustration.\n\n“He was a difficult president to support in terms of trying to give him the information he needed while still protecting the way we collected it so that he wouldn’t accidentally or otherwise speak off-the-cuff and mention something that an adversary could use to track down where we had an agent,” said Douglas London, a former CIA counterterrorism official who served during the Trump administration.\n\nLondon said it was ironic Trump kept classified documents since the former President “wasn’t much of a reader.”\n\nKeeping classified information from Mar-a-Lago’s members was one thing; keeping out potential security threats proved to be its own challenge.\n\nIn 2019, a 33-year-old businesswoman from Shanghai was arrested for trespassing on the grounds of Trump’s club. At the time of her arrest, Yujing Zhang had in her possession four cellphones, a laptop, an external hard drive and a thumb drive. Prosecutors said they also found a trove of additional electronics – including a signal detector to detect hidden cameras – and thousands of dollars in cash in her hotel room.\n\nAnother Chinese national, Lu Jing, was also accused of trespassing at Mar-a-Lago later that year. Officials said during the incident, Lu was asked to leave by security before returning to the premises and taking photos.\n\nIt was never determined what either woman’s motives were in trying to access the club. Lu was found not guilty; Zhang was eventually sentenced to eight months in prison.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/12/politics/january-6-committee-trump-pence-invite/index.html", "title": "January 6 committee set to meet in person on Tuesday as it debates ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack nears its final chapter, members plan to meet in person on Tuesday and one of the most pressing questions they’ll address is whether the committee should formally request that former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence appear before them.\n\nSuch appearances are exceedingly rare in US history. According to multiple sources, the committee does not expect either man to testify, but some members and staff believe the invitations should be extended for the record.\n\n“How do you create a historic record without including formal requests for the two top witnesses,” said one source familiar to the committee’s work.\n\nMembers of the committee, including Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, have consistently said they’d like to hear from Pence and would welcome Trump’s testimony should he offer it on their terms but internal discussions about formally reaching out to both men has intensified in recent weeks now that the panel’s investigation will soon come to an end, the sources said.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, a member of the panel, told CNN, “Just speaking for myself, I would like to hear from both of them. Whether we actually will is a separate question.”\n\nA source close to Pence’s team told CNN that there have been intermittent conversations between the committee and legal counsel for Pence, but nothing has changed, meaning it’s unlikely he would testify.\n\nWhether the panel decides to call Trump or Pence could prove to be an important data point should the committee ultimately opt to submit a criminal referral for Trump – something members of the panel say they expect to seriously consider, while such a move would be largely symbolic in nature.\n\n“I tend to think that you will see us seriously have that debate, and I wouldn’t be surprised if we do criminal referrals,” committee member Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois told CNN in a recent interview. “I do think that as we come to the end of the investigation, we’ve already presented a lot to say there is some criminal culpability here.”\n\nRegardless of whether the committee issues referrals, the former President already faces potential legal jeopardy on a variety of fronts. The Justice Department is probing the handling of classified documents after Trump left office; federal investigators have steadily expanded their probe into the Capitol riot and the events leading up to it; and Trump is at the center of a criminal investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.\n\nIn addition to discussing the path forward on Trump and Pence, the panel is expected to use Tuesday’s meeting to continue to plan its next round of hearings, and work on its final report that is expected in December, sources tell CNN.\n\nThe committee also has to decide what to do about the five Republican lawmakers who have refused to cooperate with subpoenas: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and GOP Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania.\n\nIt continues to debate whether to subpoena other high-profile individuals, including Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nWith just a few months left before the year’s end, multiple sources acknowledged to CNN the committee does not expect it will ever hear from the Trump allies who have fought subpoenas such as Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows, and former deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino.\n\nThere are also several investigative threads that remain open-ended but with limited time left, the committee is now deciding what to prioritize, sources tell CNN. That includes issues related to the US Secret Service, the sources said.\n\n“We are in active deliberation and discussion about how to tie up loose ends in the investigation and then present a powerful report and set of recommendations to the Congress and the people,” Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a member of the committee, told CNN, acknowledging that whether to call Trump and Pence is on that list of loose ends. “The chair and the committee will have to work together to come to decide about what to do about people who haven’t testified so far.”\n\nChanging landscape\n\nOne factor weighing on members as they approach the September session is they realize the political landscape has shifted dramatically since its last hearing on July 21 – which took place before the FBI search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence and pre-dated several significant escalations in the parallel criminal investigations focused on efforts to overturn the 2020 election. And as committee members return this fall – even with a series of blockbuster hearings under its belt – the bar for its work to break through is exponentially higher.\n\nIn light of recent events, one source familiar with the committee’s planning said members and investigators are “taking some time right now to assess what makes the most sense” in terms of how best to proceed and “weave a coherent narrative.”\n\n“I mean, the country now understands all of the essential elements of the plot to overthrow the 2020 presidential election and install Donald Trump as president for another four years,” Raskin said. “There has been there’s been a lot of developments in terms of the Department of Justice and its own investigations, but of course that’s on a separate track from us.”\n\nMultiple sources involved in the committee’s work said they hoped its hearings and work helped generate public pressure and momentum – and led to the intensifying of the various criminal investigations into January 6. The committee has already begun handing over transcripts to the Justice Department, and DOJ has begun subpoenaing a wide array of Trump allies for information, including anything they’ve provided to the committee.\n\nInvestigators working on criminal probes have viewed some of the panel’s final actions as breadcrumbs for prosecutors, whose work will continue, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nWhile the committee’s recent request for a voluntary interview with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich may not ultimately lead to his testimony, the committee’s letter to Gingrich expounded on little-known details about his alleged role in the fake elector plot and his efforts to push election lies about Georgia. Both topics are avenues of interest for federal prosecutors, as well as an Atlanta-area district attorney investigating Trump.\n\nNew investigative leads\n\nEven as the committee deliberates on these matters, it is also continuing to pursue new leads, plan more hearings, and write a final report. The plans for what to include in potentially two more hearings this month still remain in flux, sources say.\n\n“I believe that we need to have at least one, if not two final investigative hearings that will supply information in a number of areas where mystery lingers and then I think we need to have a final hearing that will canvass our recommendations and explain why we think certain changes are necessary in order to prevent electoral sabotage and political violence in the future,” Raskin said.\n\nIn terms of areas where “mystery lingers,” the panel has asked the National Archives and Records Administration if any of the documents recovered from Mar-a-Lago are relevant to its investigation, sources say. It continues to investigate document destruction in the Trump White House sources close to the investigation tell CNN, and has even asked witnesses about whether Meadows, who stopped cooperating with the committee, burned documents in his West Wing office fireplace.\n\nBecause the Justice Department is conducting an ongoing investigation, both the National Archives and the January 6 committee have no window into exactly what the DOJ found during the Mar-a-Lago search, according to sources familiar.\n\nSeparately, the committee has asked the National Archives for the electronic communication Meadows handed over, but because that includes a large number of texts and emails, the agency is still processing. The committee doesn’t know yet whether there is anything new, or this just duplicates what he already gave them, according to those sources.\n\nInvestigators have also learned new information about the deletion of Secret Service text messages around the Capitol attack even if those messages have not been recovered, which sources say could appear in upcoming hearings.\n\n“It’s not clear that they are recoverable at this point. But we’re, we’re not giving up,” one source said. Referring to the texts the source added, “That’s not the only kind of evidence that exists.”\n\nKinzinger told CNN that members of the panel believe that former Secret Service agent Tony Ornato was personally involved in efforts to discredit the testimony of Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson while he was still at the agency, and said unnamed Secret Service officials and others simply adopted his side of the story.\n\n“I just think it’s so important to keep in mind that, through quote, anonymous sources, which we believe to be actually Tony Ornato himself, he pushed back against Cassidy Hutchinson’s testimony and said, it’s just not true and Tony will testify under oath. And then of course, has not come in to testify under oath,” he told CNN.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Secret Service for comment on this story.\n\n“Mr. Ornato plans to continue cooperating in the investigations related to the events of January 6,” his counsel, Kate Driscoll of law firm Morrison & Foerster, told CNN.\n\nHutchinson testified back in June that Ornato witnessed an altercation between Trump and his Secret Service detail over wanting to go to the Capitol on January 6.

I think she wasn’t going to be here – to help make this a reality,” Biden said.\n\nThe White House sought to play off the odd moment as nothing more than Walorski being “top of mind” for Biden.\n\n“There will be a bill signing in her honor this coming Friday, so, of course, she was on his mind,” said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. “She was top of mind for the President.”\n\nWhich, sure. Everyone make mistakes.\n\nBut that’s a pretty big mistake to make. And unfortunately for Biden, it plays into a caricature that Republicans – led by former President Donald Trump – have long been painting of him.\n\n“This guy doesn’t have a clue. He doesn’t know where the hell he is,” Trump said of Biden during the 2020 campaign. “This guy doesn’t know he’s alive.”\n\nAt another point, Trump said: “Biden is shot. I’m telling you he’s shot. There’s something going on.”\n\nBiden’s overall health didn’t play much of a role in the 2020 election, however. Forty-one percent of voters in the 2020 election exit poll said that only Biden had the mental and physical health to serve as president. The same number – 41% – said that only Trump had the mental and physical stamina to do the job. Another 8% said neither did.\n\nIn 2021, amid the bungled US withdrawal from Afghanistan, Tennessee Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty suggested that the handling of the situation “created doubt not only in my mind, in the mind of many, many Americans, but also doubt in the minds of our allies” regarding Biden’s ability to do the job.\n\nEarlier this year, Kansas GOP Sen. Roger Marshall, a physician, suggested that Biden should submit to yearly cognitive testing. “I think we’re all concerned for President Biden’s mental health,” Marshall said at the time. He added that he felt he had seen a “deterioration” in Biden’s mental health over the past year.\n\nHere’s what we know for facts: Biden is 79 years old. He is the oldest person ever to be elected to a first term as president and, if he runs for a second term, will be the oldest person to do that too. His most recent physical was last November. At that time, the White House doctor said that Biden “remains fit for duty, and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.”\n\nWhat we also know is that Biden’s age is an issue for voters well beyond the hardcore Republican base.\n\nIn a New York Times/Siena College poll conducted over the summer, Biden’s age was a leading factor among Democratic voters who said they preferred the party nominate someone else for president in 2024.\n\nAs The New York Times noted in a July story on Biden’s age, citing more than a dozen current and former senior officials and advisers:\n\n“[T]hey acknowledged Mr. Biden looks older than just a few years ago, a political liability that cannot be solved by traditional White House stratagems like staff shake-ups or new communications plans. His energy level, while impressive for a man of his age, is not what it was, and some aides quietly watch out for him. He often shuffles when he walks, and aides worry he will trip on a wire. He stumbles over words during public events, and they hold their breath to see if he makes it to the end without a gaffe.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden didn’t make it to the end without a gaffe.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/politics/senate-race-surprises-pennsylvania-georgia-analysis/index.html", "title": "Surprises rock the Senate races that will decide America's future ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nLate twists are rocking the tight Senate races that will decide the destiny of a chamber now narrowly run by Democrats – as well as the future direction of America itself – on Election Day in just 12 days.\n\nThe Democrats’ best chance of snatching a Senate seat held by Republicans may have been further complicated by John Fetterman’s shaky debate performance in Pennsylvania Tuesday night, which raised more questions about the stroke survivor’s fitness to serve.\n\nThat same question – albeit from different circumstances – is again swirling around Georgia Republican Senate nominee Herschel Walker after an unnamed woman claimed at a press conference Wednesday that he pressured her to have an abortion in 1993. The college football icon branded the accusation “a lie,” but after facing similar accusations by a former girlfriend, it’s opened him up to more charges of hypocrisy since he has before called for a national ban on abortion with no exceptions.\n\nMore on key Senate races Herschel Walker defends use of ‘honorary’ sheriff’s badge in Georgia Senate debate Democratic Senate nominees hold cash edge in fall home stretch but face GOP advertising onslaught Democratic senator in competitive Colorado race defends party on inflation Five takeaways from the Georgia Senate debate See Senate race ratings by Inside Elections\n\nMeanwhile in Arizona, where the Republican Party’s march to its anti-democratic fringe is gathering steam, Senate nominee Blake Masters was shown on camera vowing to ex-President Donald Trump that he would not go “soft” on false voter fraud claims. Separately, Masters on Tuesday told supporters it was fine for them to film drop boxes to prevent “ballot harvesting” amid a controversy over “vigilante groups” allegedly conspiring to intimidate voters using the early balloting boxes.\n\nListen to Trump pressure Blake Masters over election denialism 01:39 - Source: CNN\n\nThe volatile state of all three races – each of which could be pivotal to determining Senate control – underscores the huge stakes going into the election. It explains the intensifying fight between the parties and an increasingly nasty tone that is rattling debate stages across the country. And it comes as Democrats desperately seek to stop Republican momentum in the campaign, which is rooted in voter frustration about raging inflation and high gas prices coming out of the pandemic.\n\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s approval ratings have been driven down to levels that could prove disastrous for Democratic candidates. GOP attack ads are also creating a dystopian vision of a nation stalked by violent crime, while Democrats are hitting Republicans over their anti-abortion positions, following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade in June.\n\nIf Republicans win the Senate – in a year in which they are favorites to win back the House – they will be able to blitz the White House with investigations and crimp Biden’s presidency. They will also be able to halt the White House’s efforts to balance out Republican success in reshaping the judiciary on deeply conservative lines.\n\nFetterman’s debate struggles vex Democrats in critical race\n\nPennsylvania, which is critical to Democratic hopes of holding their majority in the 50-50 chamber, could end up being the most important Senate race in the country. Republicans only need a net gain of one seat to win the majority, so winning the Keystone State could help Democrats mitigate losses in other states where they’re on defense.\n\nEven after suffering a stroke in May, Fetterman had the momentum for much of the summer over celebrity surgeon Mehmet Oz. But the race has tightened in recent days. The Democrat’s struggle to articulate his positions and deliver attacks on his rival in Tuesday night’s debate caused reverberations of concern in Washington.\n\nFetterman had warned that he is still dealing with auditory and linguistic after-effects from his stroke but his struggle at times to find the right words on the debate stage was painful to watch. Several times, he seemed to lose his train of thought and repeated phrases. “To be honest, doing that debate wasn’t exactly easy,” Fetterman told supporters at a rally Wednesday night.\n\n\n\nThe question now is whether undecided voters will wonder whether he is well enough to go to the Senate – even if his doctors say that he is getting better all the time. It’s possible partisan lines are so cemented by this point that his performance will not matter. Still, more than 600,000 Pennsylvanians have already cast votes in the race and Fetterman’s debate showing – effectively a job interview – came at a moment when voters are making up their minds all the time, more than a week from Election Day. If he loses, his campaign will face questions over whether he erred in agreeing to debate Oz.\n\nFormer Republican Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania said Fetterman’s campaign had set the bar at a very low level, but not low enough for a debate that he called “disturbing on many levels.”\n\n“That was really an awful thing to watch. On a human level, I feel for John Fetterman,” Dent told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room” on Wednesday. “It just struck me that he is not ready. … I think it’s going to have an enormous impact on the race.”\n\nStill, Fetterman may win points for courage in not allowing his health to interfere with his political fight for Pennsylvanians. At his campaign events, he asks supporters whether they or their relatives have suffered a health crisis, and promises to go to Washington to secure for them the health care that he says saved his life.\n\nHear what Fetterman has to say after rocky debate performance 03:33 - Source: CNN\n\nIn multiple conversations with voters, CNN’s Jeff Zeleny picked up anxiety among Fetterman’s supporters about how his stumbles could hurt his chances, even if they weren’t personally backing away from him.\n\n\n\nBut one Fetterman backer, Craig Bischof, in the central town of Bedford, said his candidate “gets healthier every day” and had “come a long way.”\n\nOne woman, however, in the Republican-leaning town, Jan Welsch, said the Democrat’s performance was “embarrassing” and that Pennsylvania would be in deep trouble if it voted for him.\n\nBut such comments also raise the question of how much Fetterman’s ongoing recovery would really affect his job in the Senate – a chamber known to have its fair share of elderly and ailing lawmakers. Plus, it’s not as if a single senator has the power of a president, for example, who has to make and explain critical national security decisions. Then there is also the question of whether Fetterman is being unfairly treated for what is, in essence at this stage, a disability, in a discriminatory way that may not be tolerated in another workplace.\n\nBut Fetterman badly needs to change the subject. Oz gave him some material to work with on Tuesday night, and the Fetterman campaign quickly released an attack ad based on the Republican’s comment that “local political leaders” should have a say, alongside women and doctors, on whether someone should get an abortion. The gaffe played directly into Democratic efforts to portray Oz and his fellow Republicans as too extreme for crucial suburban voters.\n\nHear what Fetterman has to say after rocky debate performance 03:33 - Source: CNN\n\nNew allegations hit Georgia GOP candidate Walker\n\nWhile Pennsylvanians were digesting the debate, voters in Georgia – thousands of whom have been flocking to polling places to cast early ballots – learned of a new alleged scandal hitting Walker, who was hand-picked by Trump and is trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock.\n\nA unnamed woman who claimed she was in a yearslong romantic relationship with Walker said the Senate nominee pressured her into having an abortion in 1993. The woman, referred to as Jane Doe to protect her identity, attended the press conference virtually with her lawyer, Gloria Allred, and read her statement. Her voice was heard, but her face was not shown.\n\n“He has publicly taken the position that he is about life and against abortion under any circumstance when in fact he pressured me to have an abortion and personally ensured that it occurred by driving me to the clinic and paying for it,” Doe said, accusing Walker of hypocrisy.\n\nAllred on Wednesday provided evidence corroborating an alleged relationship between Doe and Walker, but she did not provide any details corroborating the abortion claim.\n\nThe GOP nominee accused Democrats of orchestrating the attack.\n\n“I already told people this is a lie, and I’m not going to entertain, continue to carry a lie along. And I also want to let you know that I didn’t kill JFK either,” Walker said at a campaign event prior to the press conference. “I’m done with all this foolishness,” he added in a statement Wednesday evening.\n\nWalker has already been accused by a former girlfriend of encouraging her to have an abortion and then reimbursing her for the cost. He has denounced that claim as a “flat-out lie.” But presented with a copy of the check the first woman said was a payment for her procedure, he conceded it was his signature on the paper, although he said he did not know what the check was for. CNN has not independently confirmed the first woman’s allegations. She has remained anonymous in public reports.\n\nThe political impact of the latest claim was not clear. It could damage Walker, who is running significantly behind popular Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who’s running for reelection in a rematch against Democrat Stacey Abrams. But national Republicans keep coming to rally around Walker, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz hitting the trail with him on Thursday.\n\nThe abortion issue is hardly likely to help Walker in key suburbs and might dampen support among religious conservatives. But polling in the wake of the initial allegations against him showed his position in the race little changed, narrowly trailing Warnock. And Walker’s political mentor, Trump, showed in his bargain with social conservatives that a scandal-plagued private life need not be politically disqualifying. The former President repaid their faith in him by going on to construct a conservative Supreme Court majority. Politics may have reached a point of such polarization in the US that ideology, rather than the personality of the candidate, could be the driving force in some elections.\n\nA second woman claims GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker pressured her to have an abortion years ago. He denies it. 03:41 - Source: CNN\n\nDemocracy on the ballot in Arizona\n\nTrump’s influence is weighing on Arizona, where Masters is locked in a close race with Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly.\n\nIn a phone call captured in a Fox documentary, the former President is shown rebuking Masters after he said in a debate that he hadn’t seen evidence of election fraud in Arizona.\n\n“If you want to get across the line, you’ve got to go stronger on that one thing. That was the one thing, a lot of complaints about it,” Trump told Masters, using Arizona Republican gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake as an example.\n\n“Look at Kari. Kari’s winning with very little money. And if they say, ‘How is your family?’ she says the election was rigged and stolen. You’ll lose if you go soft. You’re going to lose that base,” Trump said.\n\nMasters was shown telling Trump: “I’m not going soft.”\n\nArizona has become a hotbed of election denialism in the wake of Trump’s 2020 loss in the state – which is reflected in the slate of Trump-backed candidates running up and down the ballot there. The elevation of such conspiracy theories has led to restrictive new voting laws across the country and fears about voter intimidation efforts.\n\nThe Arizona chapter of the League of Women Voters, for example, filed a lawsuit in federal court late Tuesday targeting groups and individuals that they say are conspiring to intimidate voters through a coordinated effort known as “Operation Drop Box.”\n\nThis is the second recent lawsuit filed in federal court targeting the conduct of individuals – some of whom are armed – who have been staking out and filming voters at ballot drop boxes in Arizona.\n\nMasters told KTAR News on Tuesday that it was alright for people to watch ballot boxes but that they should comply with the law.\n\n“If you are planning on watching the ballot boxes, stay whatever distance away, don’t intimidate voters, get your video camera out and record to make sure people aren’t ballot harvesting,” Masters said.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/us/state-abortion-trigger-laws-roe-v-wade-overturned/index.html", "title": "13 states have passed so-called 'trigger laws,' bans designed to go ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMany Americans anxiously anticipating the Supreme Court’s decision on Roe v. Wade may have been offered a glimpse of what’s to come when Politico revealed a draft Supreme Court opinion Monday night that would upend the landmark abortion rights case.\n\nThough the unearthing of the draft has no immediate effect on abortion access, the preliminary opinion, which was confirmed to be authentic by the court, would overturn Roe v. Wade if a majority of justices decided to join, leaving state legislators to weigh their own abortion policies.\n\nThe 1973 Roe v. Wade court decision affirmed the right to receive an abortion under the 14th Amendment, ruling that abortions were constitutionally protected up until about 23 weeks when a fetus could be able to live outside the womb.\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban, setting the court up to examine decades of precedent set by Roe. Some state legislatures have enacted policies to increase abortion access, including in California, which passed a law in March to eliminate out-of-pocket costs for abortion services covered by health plans, and in Colorado, where Democratic lawmakers codified the right to receive an abortion in the state.\n\nBut many Republican-led state legislatures have already moved to limit abortion access and others are poised to enforce restrictive laws that have remained unenforced since Roe was passed. In total, an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute finds that 23 states have laws aiming to limit abortion access, including some states that have multiple provisions in place.\n\nStates including Michigan, Wisconsin and West Virginia had abortion restrictions before the Roe ruling that have never been removed. Others have approved near-total bans or laws prohibiting abortion after a certain number of weeks – but many of them have been blocked by courts, including those in Alabama, Georgia, Iowa, Ohio and South Carolina.\n\nLegislators in 13 states have passed so-called “trigger laws,” which are bans designed to go into effect if Roe is overturned. In some cases, the law requires an official such as an attorney general to certify that Roe has been struck down before the law can take effect.\n\nThese are the states with “trigger laws” poised to go into effect almost immediately if Roe v. Wade is overturned.\n\nArkansas\n\nArkansas has a law on the books that would ban nearly all abortions in the event that Roe is overturned, except for in the case of a life-threatening medical emergency. A medical provider who violates the law could face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $100,000 or both.\n\nLast year, a federal judge blocked another bill passed by state legislators which aimed to block nearly all abortions and made no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho’s trigger ban would make providing abortions a felony punishable by up to five years in prison if Roe is struck down. Exceptions are provided to prevent the death of the pregnant person or in the case of rape or incest.\n\nIn March, Idaho legislators passed a separate bill modeled after Texas’ restrictive law, which prohibits abortion once fetal cardiac activity can be detected, which can happen as early as six weeks. The law also allows family members of the fetus to sue the medical provider who performed the procedure.\n\nThe ban was temporarily blocked by the state Supreme Court last month after abortion providers challenged it in a lawsuit.\n\nKentucky\n\nKentucky’s legislature passed a bill in 2019 which would ban abortions and make performing them a felony offense if the Supreme Court overturns Roe. Very limited exceptions would be provided to prevent the death or serious injury of the person giving birth.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLouisiana has a law in place that would ban a medical provider from performing an abortion procedure or providing drugs intended to induce an abortion in the case that Roe is overturned. The ban would not apply to life-threatening or serious medical emergencies, but requires the physician makes “reasonable medical efforts” to preserve the life of the adult and the fetus.\n\nMississippi\n\nMississippi law states that within 10 days of the state attorney general confirming Roe has been overturned, abortions are prohibited in the state. Limited exceptions are provided in cases of rape or when the procedure would preserve the mother’s life.\n\nMississippi passed a separate 15-week abortion ban in 2018, which is the source of the case currently in front of the Supreme Court. The court is expected to announce its decision in June, but a draft opinion revealed by Politico suggests a majority of the justices may be poised to strike down Roe.\n\nMissouri\n\nMissouri approved a law in 2019 that would make it a felony for medical providers to perform or induce an abortion except in cases of medical emergencies if Roe is struck down.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nA law approved by the North Dakota legislature in 2007 would ban abortion and make it a felony to perform the procedure except in cases when it would save the life of the mother. The law would go into effect “as a result of new decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States” that would make the provision constitutional.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill last month that would make performing abortions illegal in the state, only allowing exceptions to save the life of the pregnant person. The measure makes performing an abortion or attempting to perform one a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $100,000 or a maximum of 10 years in state prison, or both.\n\nA second bill signed into law last week sets a timeline for provisions to go into effect, depending on how the Supreme Court rules.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSouth Dakota has had a trigger ban on the books since 2005, when a law was passed to set up an almost outright ban on abortions in the event that Roe is overturned. The law would make it illegal to perform an abortion except in life-threatening medical emergencies and would become effective “on the date states are recognized by the United States Supreme Court to have the authority to prohibit abortion at all stages of pregnancy.”\n\nTennessee\n\nTennessee law contains a provision that would prohibit all abortions except those that would prevent the death of the mother and would go into effect 30 days after Roe is struck down. Medical providers could be charged with a felony for violating the law.\n\nTexas\n\nTexas’ so-called trigger ban was signed into law in June 2021 and would make abortions illegal unless the pregnant person’s life is threatened or they are at risk of serious injury. The law would go into effect 30 days after the Supreme Court issues a judgment overruling Roe.\n\nUtah\n\nUtah passed a law in May 2020 banning almost all abortions if Roe is overturned. Exceptions include cases of rape or incest, detection of severe birth defects, or prevention of the death or serious injury of the person giving birth. Performing an abortion in violation of the law is a second-degree felony.\n\nWyoming\n\nSigned into law last month, Wyoming’s bill added a provision that would make it illegal to perform an abortion if Roe is overturned, with extremely limited exceptions for cases of sexual assault, incest, or the risk of death or severe injury to the person giving birth.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/politics/douglas-frank-big-lie/index.html", "title": "The 2020 election wasn't stolen. But Douglas Frank and his bogus ...", "text": "Austin CNN —\n\nDouglas Frank, an Ohio math teacher, affixed his Texas flag print bow tie, led a booming rendition of the National Anthem and then walked a crowd through an absurd mathematical equation that he claimed proves the 2020 election was stolen.\n\n“Just about every county in the country was hacked,” Frank told the dozens of Texans huddled in a ballroom at a local country club on Sunday. When he finished speaking more than 90 minutes later, they gave him a standing ovation.\n\nThis is how the big lie that the 2020 election was stolen grows even bigger. More than a year later, there is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. But Frank is still winning audiences with lawmakers, election officials and voters across the country.\n\nCurrently on leave from his teaching position, Frank has traveled to Texas and dozens of other states, claiming he uncovered an algorithm proving the 2020 election was stolen nationwide, even as his conclusions have been debunked by mathematicians and election experts.\n\n“At the core of how our democracy works is that we have to trust election results,” said Justin Grimmer, a political science professor at Stanford University. “Luckily, the theory is so crazy that I think only the people who really want to believe or really, really want to see some conspiracy in the world would be persuaded. But nevertheless, I think there’s a real danger there.”\n\nFrank is just one in an army of conspiracy theorists, inspired by former President Donald Trump’s election lies, who are dedicated to trying to convince others the 2020 election was corrupt. As of December, it was a belief shared by a third of Americans, who said Joe Biden was an illegitimate president, according to an ABC News/Ipsos poll.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, he stood by his flawed conclusions, remaining adamant in his belief that the elections are rigged – regardless of the many experts who have disproven his claims.\n\n“I know the elections are not real. I know the elections are being manipulated,” Frank said in an interview with CNN. “Regardless of who wins. I just want ‘em to be fair.”\n\nConspiracy-minded ‘super moms’\n\nAcross the country, Frank has connected with women he has dubbed “super moms.” They are women who have embraced unfounded election conspiracy theories and are engaged in efforts to expose the nonexistent widespread fraud.\n\nIn New Hampshire, one of the women has pushed for a so-called forensic audit of her state’s 2020 election results and has promoted efforts to ban voting machines and move to hand-count-only elections.\n\nIn Colorado, women have organized door-knocking campaigns to try to uncover phantom voters.\n\nAnd in Pennsylvania, women have launched voter canvasses, pressured state GOP lawmakers to launch a 2020 election review and are now pushing to get rid of electronic voting machines across the state.\n\nWhat elevates Frank above the everyday conspiracy theorist are his financial backing and his intensive travel schedule.\n\nCritically, he has the backing of Mike Lindell. The My Pillow CEO is a deep-pocketed purveyor of election disinformation and told CNBC he has already spent $25 million on his efforts to push election fraud claims.\n\nIn an interview, Frank told CNN that he is an “expert witness” for Lindell’s attorney, and he is paid for specific projects. He said groups that invite him to speak cover the cost of his travel and lodging. Others donate money to support his efforts. Still, Frank insisted he wasn’t motivated by money or his newfound stardom among election deniers.\n\n“My goal is to be able to pay my bills, and it’s working,” Frank said. “I’ve been able to do this a year now and my bank balance isn’t getting smaller.”\n\nDebunking Frank’s fraud claims\n\nBefore Frank arrives at a speaking gig, he creates an elaborate slideshow complete with county-by-county graphs. An animated public speaker, he offers a bit of his bio, flips through the graphs and describes how a “sixth order polynomial” equation demonstrates that the election was stolen.\n\n“I was the perfect person in this world to discover this,” Frank told state lawmakers at a stop in Colorado. “I have exactly the right skills. I love swimming in big data.”\n\nThe equation may be better suited to math wonks, but Frank takes liberties in his presentation with snappy lines that succinctly – and inaccurately – describe his findings.\n\n“America was stolen by an Excel spreadsheet,” he told the crowd at a North Carolina event.\n\nIn Idaho, he explained his theory on phantom voters: “They are inflating our registration rolls, stuffing phantom ballots and then cleaning it up afterwards. It’s that simple.”\n\nHe has even absurdly claimed his discoveries could land Trump back in the Oval Office.\n\n“I’d like the country to stand up and say, ‘Wow, this thing was ripped off. Let’s do a do-over or let’s put Trump back in office,’ ” Frank said in an August interview on the Truth & Liberty livecast.\n\nGrimmer, the Stanford University professor, said Frank has a way of wooing crowds with his professorial demeanor but that ultimately his conclusions are meaningless.\n\n“I think this took my research group an afternoon. You uncover that there’s no basis for this,” said Grimmer, who looked at data for 42 states and found that Frank’s assessments do not provide any evidence of voter fraud. “But if you’re not someone who, like me, spends all day working on statistics and data, six order polynomials and nearly perfect correlations — it sounds like he’s uncovered something really impressive.”\n\nFrank uses the number of registered voters by age group and prior voter trends to predict voter turnout, then claims it is evidence of fraud when it aligns with actual voter turnout. Put another way: Frank’s analysis finds that age groups with more people have more people who vote, which Frank then interprets as fraud, Grimmer said.\n\n“Effectively, what he’s doing is he’s discovered that anything that you go out and measure in the world is closely related to itself,” Grimmer said.\n\nAside from Frank’s flawed interpretation of the math, there are extensive election security protocols in place that would prevent the kind of widespread hacking and phantom vote-stuffing that Frank has described.\n\n“If you even change a period, a period in the election programming, it sends up a red flag that immediately stops the entire process until we can identify what would have triggered that red flag,” said Isabel Longoria, the elections administrator for Harris County – the most populous county in Texas and home to some 2.5 million voters.\n\nIn Harris County alone, election officials inspect thousands of voting machines – repeatedly – in the months leading up to elections.\n\n“Six months out, we start checking all 13,000 pieces of voting equipment in Harris County, opening them up, do they turn on? Have they been tampered with? Can we take them to a voting location? Are all the buttons working?” Longoria said.\n\nElection officials run accuracy tests on the machines under the watchful eyes of bipartisan observers. On Election Day, officials track the number of people showing up to vote and the number of ballots cast – one of the many safeguards that would catch an election inflated by phantom voters, according to Longoria.\n\nLongoria said she is required by law to update the voter rolls daily, and she noted that it would be effectively impossible for even a coordinated group to break in and inflate the voters rolls in each individual county.\n\n“Breaking into multiple buildings, multiple systems in tandem, with not a single red flag going off in this incredibly sensitive system, all in unison, right? As you have all eyes on elections from every election staff,” Longoria said.\n\nLongoria revealed little frustration as she ran through the extensive checks and balances in the election system and debunked a wide range of conspiracy theories.\n\n“I love answering these questions, and I love geeking out and getting all the details,” she said. “My job is to make sure that you can feel, as a voter, good and secure about our system.”\n\nSpreading the big lie nationwide\n\nWhen Lindell and Frank met with Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill on two occasions last year, Merrill said, it also didn’t take much effort for him to discredit their wild election claims.\n\n“Every time they gave us an example, we were able to refute what they showed us without even knowing what they were going to do when they arrived,” said Merrill, who’s a Republican.\n\nAddresses they claimed were stocked with phantom voters turned out to be facilities like apartment complexes or assisted living facilities, where multiple people resided and were registered to vote.\n\n“The information that they had been sharing with us could have been cleared up by doing a simple Google search of addresses,” Merrill said.\n\nFrank acknowledged that the Alabama presentation had been a “complete botch” and blamed it on a newly hired staffer working on his team.\n\nTo others, Frank’s presentation is fuel for their baseless suspicions that President Joe Biden wasn’t fairly elected.\n\n“Some people say we know that other states are wrong, but we think Kentucky must be right,” Kentucky state Sen. Adrienne Southworth said. “And I say, well, how do you know? And they have no idea. They just assume, and so I said, well, that’s kind of the problem.”\n\nSouthworth held an event featuring Frank and, after seeing his work, said she had come away more convinced that 2020 was problem-plagued.\n\n“I think the whole world is on the edge right now of – are we going to continue trusting the system?” Southworth said.\n\nKentucky was just one of the stops on Frank’s nationwide tour.\n\nIn Missouri, a “voter fraud is real bootcamp” featured Frank and a state representative, with a flyer calling on county clerks to attend.\n\nIn Colorado, Frank met with Tina Peters, the Mesa County clerk now under investigation by the FBI and others for her alleged involvement in a security breach of the county’s election system last year. Peters has defended her actions, claiming she conducted a backup of the voting system to preserve records.\n\nIn Montana, the Montana Free Press reported that Frank met with staffers for the state attorney general.\n\n“We’re going into each state – clandestinely – and I meet privately with legislators and secretaries of states and attorney generals,” Frank said at an event in Dallas last year.\n\nThis week, in his return to Texas, Frank appeared with a handful of candidates running for everything from county offices to Congress. He urged the crowd not to buy into the idea that Texas is becoming a battleground state, insisting “they” – Frank never identified who – were stocking the state voter rolls.\n\n“They’re getting ready to switch you purple,” Frank said. “Don’t believe it. You’re red.”\n\nAfter his pitch to Lone Star State voters, he sat down for his interview with CNN and defended his efforts to undermine confidence in America’s elections.\n\n“It’ll be a constitutional crisis. It will be a crisis. It’s going to happen. It’s inevitable. It’s going to happen. And I’m helping that happen.

And with the costumes out, the picture for the Senate is clearer than ever.\n\nIt is pretty clear from the polling that control of the Senate will likely come down to four races: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania.\n\nMore on key Senate races Herschel Walker defends use of ‘honorary’ sheriff’s badge in Georgia Senate debate Democratic Senate nominees hold cash edge in fall home stretch but face GOP advertising onslaught Democratic senator in competitive Colorado race defends party on inflation Five takeaways from the Georgia Senate debate See Senate race ratings by Inside Elections\n\nThe math is simple. Democrats need to win three of these four races to maintain control of the Senate. For Republicans, it’s a slightly easier climb as they need to win only two of these four races.\n\nBut despite the ease of the equation, solving it is anything but easy. All of these races are well within the margin of error. Moreover, the states aren’t all that similar in demographics, which means that it’s plausible that any late movement or polling error could affect the states in different ways. Each state has unique issues affecting them, too.\n\nArizona is the easiest race to understand. Democrats have won the last two Senate races in the state, after not having won one since 1988. They’re powered by increasingly strong performances in the Phoenix suburbs among White college-educated voters and a reliable Hispanic base. (They’re also helped by one of the largest Native American populations in the country.)\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly hasn’t trailed in any poll released publicly. His advantage has slimmed in some recent surveys, though many of those are from outfits that don’t meet CNN’s standards for publications.\n\nOn average, Kelly has been up by about 3 points over Republican Blake Masters. A New York Times/Siena College poll published Monday gave Kelly a 6-point lead over Masters.\n\nMasters’ problem is fairly simple: His net favorability (favorable - unfavorable) rating is underwater. Unpopular Republican candidates is an issue that has plagued Republicans across the board. Meanwhile, Kelly’s net favorability (and approval rating) has been positive.\n\nThis has allowed Kelly to overcome President Joe Biden’s own unpopularity in the state.\n\nKelly’s consistent lead may be why a number of analysts (though not this one) have viewed the Senate as coming down to the other three states.\n\nThe best one for Republicans and arguably the most straightforward one is Nevada. The Times poll there out Monday and the average has the race tied between Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican Adam Laxalt.\n\nNevada seemed to be a state trending toward Democrats 10 years ago, after Barack Obama won it with ease in two consecutive elections. Republicans have lost the last two presidential elections in the state by decreasing margins, including a 2.4-point loss in 2020.\n\nRepublicans have been helped by movement toward them among Hispanics, as well as a large base of White voters without a college degree. The state’s economic base of tourism was hurt during the Covid-19 pandemic, when national Democrats were far more likely to push for Covid precautions.\n\nCortez Masto, unlike Kelly, has not carved out a base of popularity, according to the polls.\n\nThe final two states to the Senate math are the hardest to figure out. Georgia and Pennsylvania couldn’t be more different in terms of their demographic math, even if they both voted for Biden by slim margins in 2020.\n\nPennsylvania is a Great Lake swing state in which Democrats must win a healthy share of White voters without a college degree. That’s a group that has been running away from Democrats, which is why Hillary Clinton in 2016 became the first Democratic presidential candidate to lose the state since Michael Dukakis in 1988.\n\nIf border issues play an outsized role in a state like Arizona and a recovering gaming industry are pivotal in Nevada, the big non-inflation story in Pennsylvania is crime. Philadelphia, the most populated city in the state, has seen a jump in its crime rate over the last few years.\n\nRepublican Mehmet Oz has used the crime issue to close what was once a large advantage for Democrat John Fetterman in the Senate race.\n\nFetterman, though, has seemed to persevere, despite a stroke that left him off the trail for a period of time. He continues to nurse a small lead in the area of 2 to 3 points. The Times had Fetterman up 6 points, though much of that polling was taken before a debate last week that many viewed as a weak one for him.\n\nAdditionally, Republicans have tended to outperform their final polling the last few cycles.\n\nOz, for his part, has had a negative net favorability rating throughout the campaign, as he’s had to fight off charges of being a carpetbagger.\n\nWhile Pennsylvania (and Arizona and Nevada) may take a while to project, we should know who wins them by the end of November. That may not be the case in Georgia.\n\nGeorgia is unique amongst the four in that the candidate with the most votes needs a majority to win. Otherwise, there will be a runoff in December.\n\nAt this point, a runoff seems quite plausible. Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker are in a tight race. Neither one of them is anywhere close to 50% in the average of polls, with Libertarian Chase Oliver pulling around 3% of the vote.\n\nThe potential for a runoff isn’t the only thing that makes Georgia unique. The Peach State has, by far, the largest Black population of any of these pivotal races. Democrats have made a comeback in this deep Southern state because of a growing Black population, and the movement to Democrats among White college educated voters in the Atlanta area.\n\nGeorgia, though, is the most Republican of any of the aforementioned states. Biden won it by the smallest margin of any state he won in 2020. In January 2021 runoffs, Warnock along with Sen. Jon Ossoff became the first two Democrats to win Senate elections in Georgia in a generation.\n\nWarnock’s 2021 election was a special one to replace Sen. Johnny Isakson, which is why he’s up for reelection so soon.\n\nUltimately, Georgia may come down to the same thing that is occurring in most swing states this year. A Republican candidate in Walker who sports a net negative favorability rating with the backdrop of a deeply unpopular President.\n\nWhichever matters most to the rare swing voter will probably decide the winner in Georgia and who wins control of the Senate.", "authors": ["Harry Enten"], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/biden-macron-state-visit/index.html", "title": "Biden and Macron affirm commitment to Ukraine but diverge on ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday demonstrated a united front in addressing the ongoing war in Ukraine but offered divergent answers over their willingness to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin, relaying that they spent much their recent meeting discussing the invasion.\n\nBiden told reporters during a joint White House news conference with Macron that he “has no immediate plans” to contact Putin, but added that he’s prepared to speak with the Russian leader if he’s looking for a way to end the war in Ukraine. Biden also clarified that Putin has not done so yet.\n\n“He’s just miscalculated across the board,” Biden said of Putin following his bilateral meeting in the Oval Office with the French president. “And so the question is … how does he get himself out of the circumstances in? I’m prepared, if he’s willing to talk, to find out what he’s willing to do, but I’ll only do it in consultation with my NATO allies. I’m not going to do it on my own.”\n\nMacron said that once Ukraine sets conditions for a peace agreement, he’s willing to speak with Putin. The French leader told ABC’s “Good Morning America” earlier Thursday that he intends to speak with the Russian president in the coming days.\n\nFirm US support, Macron also relayed, “is very important, not just for the Ukrainians … but for the stability of our world today. Because if we consider that we can abandon the country and abandon the full respect of these principles, it means that there is no possible stability in this world,” pledging France’s own increased military, economic, and humanitarian support.\n\nThe French president’s trip to the White House alongside his spouse, Brigitte Macron, marks their second time as the guests of honor for a state visit, having first done so during Donald Trump’s administration in 2018. Thursday’s agenda for Biden’s first state visit since taking office has been filled with formal fanfare, with a list of events intended to highlight the strength of the critical relationship between the US and its oldest ally.\n\nAt the start of the news conference, Biden called the US and France the “strongest partners and our most capable allies,” taking care to note that “Emmanuel has also become a friend, as well as President of that great country.”\n\nIn his opening remarks, Macron praised Biden for fulfilling campaign commitments linked to addressing international challenges, saying “we’re being able to re-engage with you.”\n\n“I can only tell you once again how pleased we were with your choices that very much matched your history and your campaign commitments. The fact that you’re back on international challenges such as health and climate – it is really a New Deal,” the French leader said.\n\nEarlier Thursday morning, the Macrons had stepped onto the South Lawn of the White House for an official arrival ceremony, where a long slate of top French and US officials as well as thousands of other attendees greeted them. The pomp-filled program included military honors, a 21-gun salute, both countries’ national anthems, a review of troops and remarks by both leaders.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Biden referred to the Macrons as “close friends,” remarking that it is a “genuine honor to host you for the first state visit of my administration and to celebrate the current strength and vitality between France and the United States of America.”\n\nFrance, Biden said, is the United States’ “oldest ally” and an “unwavering partner,” referencing the history of the relationship from Lafayette to the beaches of Normandy. He said the alliance will “grow stronger for decades to come.”\n\nMacron referenced common values of the US and France, referring to the nations as “sisters in the fight for freedom” and calling for their countries “to become brothers in arms once more” in the midst of Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Macrons’ return for another state visit also follows a dramatic bounce-back in US-French relations compared to just a year ago, when Macron took the extraordinary step of recalling his ambassador to Washington over a US-Australia submarine deal that blindsided the French and cost them a multi-billion dollar defense contract. The rift appears to largely be behind them, and Biden and Macron have deepened their ties even more over the last year in their united efforts to combat the war on Ukraine.\n\nElysée announced that Macron gave the president four gifts: a vinyl and CD of the soundtrack to the film the first couple saw on their first date – “Un Homme et une Femme”, a cup from the house Christofle symbolizing links between France and the US, a sweater from the House Saint James and a watch from LIP Horlogerie. He also gave the first lady copies of “Madame Bovary” and “The Plague, The Fall, Exile and the Kingdom, and Selected Essays.” He gifted Vice President Kamala Harris a model of the Ariane 5 rocket – a reference to common interests on space shared by the US and France.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden and White House staff present the menu during a media preview ahead of the state dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe American president and first lady presented a custom mirror made of fallen wood from the White House grounds that’s a reproduction of a mirror that hangs in the West Wing, according to the White House. Additionally, the French president was gifted a custom vinyl collection of great American musicians along with “an archival facsimile print of Thomas Edison’s 1877 Patent of the American Phonograph,” the White House said. And the first lady gifted Mrs. Macron a pendant necklace designed by a French-American designer.\n\nAfter the official arrival ceremony at the White House, Biden and Macron began bilateral discussions for an Oval Office meeting which lasted just under three hours. Kicking off the meeting, Biden reiterated the importance of the alliance.\n\n“Things are changing rapidly, really rapidly. And it’s really important we stay in close communication. Doesn’t mean that every single solitary thing we agree on. That does mean we agree on almost everything,” he said, adding that they would work toward strengthening “security and prosperity.”\n\nMacron said the Russian invasion in Ukraine will be one of their main topics of discussion and that “sustainable peace” is about respecting sovereign nations.\n\n“We want to build peace and a sustainable peace means full respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine but at the same time a new architecture to make sure we have a sustainable peace in the long run,” Macron added.\n\nUS and French officials had not expected the visit to yield any major deliverables, but both sides see it as an opportunity for the two countries to deepen their partnership on a slew of global challenges. The two sides expected to advance working group discussions that were launched in the wake of last year’s submarine affair to step up cooperation on space, cyberspace and energy issues.\n\nIn a joint statement following their meeting, the two leaders “outlined a shared vision to strengthen security and increase prosperity worldwide, combat climate change, build greater resilience to its effects, and advance democratic values.”\n\nOf particular note, the two leaders wrote they “strongly condemn Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine and stress that intentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable.”\n\nOn the Indo-Pacific, the two leaders pledge to “continue to coordinate on our concerns regarding China’s challenge to the rules-based international order, including respect for human rights, and to work together with China on important global issues like climate change.”\n\nThere are areas of disagreement that were expected to come up.\n\nOne of the biggest points of tension will be over billions of dollars in electric vehicle subsidies included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which applies only to those manufactured in North America. Macron has slammed the measure as protectionist and French officials said he intends to raise the issue in meetings with Biden and congressional leaders. During Thursday’s news conference, Biden confirmed that they discussed the matter in detail.\n\nHe said the US makes “no apologies” for the Inflation Reduction Act, but he admitted there were “some glitches” and changes that may need to be made to the law.\n\nMacron agreed with Biden and reiterated his belief that they’re going to “resynchronize” and said he was not searching for an exemption for his economy but to “discuss the consequences of this legislation.”\n\nIn their joint statement, the US and France said they “reaffirm their shared goal of accelerating the global green energy transition. They look forward to the work of the U.S.-EU Taskforce on the Inflation Reduction Act to further strengthen the U.S.-EU partnership on clean energy and climate through mutually beneficial ways.”\n\nFollowing their morning at the White House, Jill Biden and Brigitte Macron also visited Planet Word, a language-focused museum in Washington. President Macron also attended a lunch at the US State Department.\n\nThursday evening, the Macrons returned to the White House for the first state dinner of the Biden administration. French guests include film director Claude Lelouch, Louvre Museum Director Laurence des Cars and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, according to the French official.\n\nA White House list of state dinner attendees also included comedian Stephen Colbert, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, fashion designer Christian Louboutin, Laurene Powell Jobs, ABC’s Robin Roberts, musician John Legend, Chrissy Teigen, Vogue’s Anna Wintour, film director Baz Luhrmann, as well as actresses Jennifer Garner, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Ariana DeBose. Biden family members, Cabinet members, politicians and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle – including Republicans Steve Scalise and Kevin McCarthy – were also on the list of attendees. New Orleans native Jon Batiste is performing musical selections.\n\nOn Wednesday, Harris welcomed President Macron to NASA to celebrate the cooperation of both nations in space. The first family also held a private dinner with the Macrons ahead of Thursday’s formal state dinner.\n\nDuring the last leg of their US visit, the Macrons will travel to New Orleans on Friday to highlight new efforts to expand French language education in the US.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Donald Judd Betsy Klein Sam Fossum", "Maegan Vazquez", "Donald Judd", "Betsy Klein", "Sam Fossum"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}]}

The 5-year-old Belgian Malinois named Jake suddenly became ill July 18 after he came into contact with a powdery synthetic street drug known as flakka during a routine contraband search. He died two days later after developing pneumonia and other complications. Fellow four-legged law enforcement officers yapped in the background at the Staton Kennel Complex in Elmore as Jake received a 21-gun salute, a traditional bugle playing of taps, a commendation from Gov. Kay Ivey and eulogies from law enforcement officials. Officials are still investigating the source of the narcotic at the Staton Correctional Facility.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Repairs and upgrades at earthquake-damaged area schools could cost more than $150 million. The Anchorage Daily News reports the Anchorage School District says the new estimate triples the original assessment of damage caused by the Nov. 30 quake. District officials say two schools need more than $20 million to repair and improve seismic performance; six schools may require at least $10 million; and improvement projects at 14 schools could cost at least $1 million each. District Chief Operating Officer Tom Roth says the estimates include immediate repairs needed and optional improvements that would improve the quake-readiness of schools. Roth says the district has spent $8 million to $9 million so far on post-quake repairs to return facilities to working condition.\n\nArizona\n\nTusayan: Fees could be going up at a large campground near the Grand Canyon’s popular South Rim entrance. A proposal by the Kaibab National Forest would more than double the overnight fees for single sites from $10 to $24 and at double sites from $20 to $48. The cost for large group sites at Ten X Campground also would go up from $75 per night to $125. Forest officials say the proposed hikes better align with prices at nearby recreation areas. They say additional funding would help maintain and expand the site and also allow them to bring in more seasonal workers. Officials say the campground fees haven’t gone up in more than 25 years. The public has until Oct. 31 to comment on the proposal.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State officials say the four companies providing coverage through the state’s insurance exchange under the federal health care overhaul law are seeking an average rate increase of about 2% for next year. Insurance Commissioner Allen Kerr said Monday that all four insurers cited the elimination of an exchange user fee in their rate requests. The highest average initial rate-hike request for individual plans came from Arkansas Blue Cross & Blue Shield at 2.89% and the lowest from QualChoice Life and Health at 0.51%. The average increase requested by Ambetter from AR Health & Wellness was 1.9%, and the average from QCA Health Plan was 0.56%. The requests are subject to an independent actuarial analysis under state law, and the Insurance Department has until Sept. 18 to approve rates for next year.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A conservation organization says it has achieved the first successful artificial insemination birth of a southern white rhino in North America, an important step in saving another rhino species from extinction. San Diego Zoo Global says mother Victoria gave birth Sunday to a healthy southern white rhino male calf in the barn at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park after 30 minutes of labor. Victoria was artificially inseminated with frozen semen from southern white rhino Maoto following hormone-induced ovulation. Victoria carried her calf for over a year – 493 days. Mother and calf will remain off exhibit to the public for now to allow them to bond. The calf will eventually be introduced to the other five female rhinos at the Nikita Kahn Rhino Rescue Center – including Amani, also pregnant through artificial insemination and due to give birth this fall.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The U.S. Department of Justice has lost track of more than 60 boxes of documents from a 27-year-old criminal investigation into safety and environmental violations at a former nuclear weapons plant, officials said Tuesday. The files were gathered in a two-year grand jury probe of the Rocky Flats plant outside Denver, which manufactured plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads and had a history of fires, leaks and spills. The files have remained secret since the investigation ended with criminal charges in 1992. Seven groups representing environmentalists, ex-nuclear workers, area residents and public health advocates filed a motion in federal court in January asking that the files be made public. Government attorneys are fighting the request. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Denver told the activists in a July 24 email that it cannot find the files but now say the search is ongoing.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection is seeking scenic Connecticut photos. For the second year, DEEP is holding the Discover Outdoor Connecticut Photo Contest. Photographers from any state may participate, but all submissions must have been taken in Connecticut. Photographers may enter one photo in each of three categories: wildlife; people enjoying the natural world; and scenic landscapes and flora. Judges will select first-, second- and third-place winners in each category. There’s a separate youth category. Entries must be postmarked by Aug. 16. Entry forms can be found on DEEP’s website. First-place winners will have their photograph published in DEEP’s Connecticut Wildlife magazine. Winners will also receive gift cards.\n\nDelaware\n\nBowers: The Murderkill River has claimed a nearby bait shop that stood as an icon to the surrounding town’s history as a commercial fishing hotspot. News outlets report Frenchie’s Bait & Tackle partially slid into the river late Monday. The shop’s front end still sits on the shores of Bower Beach, where it was rebuilt after it burned down in the 1990s. Owner and commercial fisherman William “Frenchie” Poulin says it appears the shop’s eroded pilings gave out. The Bowers Beach Maritime Museum says responding authorities turned off the shop’s power and worked to contain any hazardous materials, such as oil. It says a cat that lived at the shop is now homeless. Councilman Bob McDevitt says no one was injured. Poulin previously served as Bower’s mayor and as a councilman.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The city’s Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is asking Maryland to release over $50 million the state has withheld for a month amid ongoing funding disputes. The Washington Post reports Metro General Manager Paul Wiedefeld recently sent a letter to Maryland officials requesting funds be released immediately, warning Metro’s credit rating could take a hit. Maryland was supposed to release $56 million July 1, which was set to go toward new trains and buses. But Transportation Secretary Pete Rahn says Metro has delayed audits and hasn’t provided adequate information about its spending. The newspaper says the dispute may relate to Gov. Larry Hogan’s view that Maryland spends too much on transit rather than roads.\n\nFlorida\n\nRedington Beach: Authorities and beachgoers came together to protect and transport five pilot whales trapped in shallow water along the state’s western shore. News outlets report the whales were first spotted Monday morning, and biologists and beachgoers swung into action, covering the whales from the climbing sun as the tide pulled away from shore. Biologists determined the whales were healthy enough for transport, and volunteers teamed up to move the heavy creatures. Three whales were returned to the sea, while two others were taken to a Clearwater Marine Aquarium facility in Tarpon Springs for medical treatment and testing. Aquarium spokeswoman Carlee Wendell says pilot whale mass strandings have happened about a dozen times since 1990. Just this month, dozens of disoriented pilot whales were saved from a mass stranding near a Georgia shore.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Georgia’s seaports are celebrating another year of record growth, though their chief executive warns business will suffer if the U.S. doesn’t resolve its trade war with China. The Georgia Ports Authority reported Tuesday that its ports at Savannah and Brunswick handled a record 37.5 million tons of cargo in the 2019 fiscal year that ended June 30. That’s a 4.2% increase over the previous year. A whopping 4.5 million container units of imports and exports were shipped through Savannah. Griff Lynch, the port authority’s executive director, said he’s concerned tariffs imposed in the Trump administration’s trade dispute with China, if unresolved, could slow business in the coming year. Lynch said export volumes dipped slightly in June, and “that could very well be linked to the tariffs.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The governor on Tuesday rescinded an emergency proclamation put in place to deal with Native Hawaiian protesters who are blocking a road to prevent the construction of a giant telescope at a mountain summit they consider sacred. Gov. David Ige said there were no immediate plans to move heavy equipment to Mauna Kea’s summit. He also noted two hurricanes were approaching that could affect the protest area and the rest of the state. Hurricane Erick is forecast to pass south of the Big Island this week. Following right after is Hurricane Flossie, on track to come close to the islands early next week. “For the safety of all involved, we want to deescalate activities,” Ige said. He declared an emergency July 17 to give law enforcement more authority to close areas of the mountain and to use additional National Guard troops to help deliver construction gear.\n\nIdaho\n\nJerome: The University of Idaho has bought land for a public visitor center, classrooms and other facilities supporting what officials say will be the world’s largest research dairy. Bill Loftus with the university’s College of Ag and Life Sciences told The Times-News the new property near Jerome represents a significant step for the planned Idaho Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment. Work on the CAFE began over a decade ago, and the university plans to have the dairy up and running in 2024. The project spans three sites: a food processing research and training facility at the College of Southern Idaho; the dairy, which will hold 2,000 head of cattle; and the Discovery Complex, which will be built at the newest property and include classrooms, the visitor center, faculty offices and housing.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s transportation agencies are boosting services to accommodate tens of thousands of people attending Lollapalooza. The Metra commuter train and the CTA subway agencies will expand capacity for one of the nation’s most popular music festivals, which takes place from Thursday through Sunday in Chicago’s Grant Park. The lineup at Lollapalooza this year includes Ariana Grande, Lil Wayne, The Strokes and more than 150 other performers. Over 100,000 people are expected to attend each day. Metra will add trains and adjust schedules on most lines for the four-day event. CTA will add service on rail lines and bus routes. In a statement Friday, CTA President Dorval R. Carter Jr. said there will be ample service to get attendees to the festival “easily and comfortably.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The body of notorious 1930s gangster John Dillinger is expected to be exhumed in September at a local cemetery, but it could be a tough job because his grave is encased in concrete. Digging up the remains more than 85 years after Dillinger was killed by FBI agents also could resolve conspiracy theories that the man some considered a hero during the Great Depression isn’t buried in his marked grave, said Susan Sutton, a historian with the Indiana Historical Society. Among the tales is that his family tricked the FBI into shooting the wrong man. The Indiana State Department of Health approved a permit sought by Dillinger’s nephew to have the body exhumed from Crown Hill Cemetery and reinterred there. Days after his son’s funeral, Dillinger’s father had the casket reburied under a protective cap of concrete and scrap iron topped by four reinforced-concrete slabs, Sutton said.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The ousted director of the state Department of Human Services will pursue a wrongful termination lawsuit, alleging he was let go after objecting to a pay arrangement for the governor’s deputy chief of staff, his lawyer said Wednesday. Jerry Foxhoven will file a whistleblower claim with the State Appeal Board, the first step toward pursuing a lawsuit against state government, his attorney Tom Duff said. It’s the latest development stemming from a personnel decision that has put Gov. Kim Reynolds on the defensive and prompted inquiries by state and federal watchdogs. Earlier this month, Reynolds’ spokesman wouldn’t confirm or deny whether Foxhoven’s workplace praise for rapper Tupac Shakur played a role in his being asked to resign, but the governor later said that she’d never heard of the rap icon and that “of course” that wasn’t the reason.\n\nKansas\n\nWellington: The National Glass Museum is temporarily closed after the front of the building collapsed. The front of the museum and most of the front brick facade collapsed overnight Friday. KAKE-TV reports the collapse is blamed on heavy rains during the year. The landlord hopes to rebuild and reopen the museum by the end of September. Pam Meyer, president of the National Depress Glass Association, said the building had been leaning for some time. She said the group plans to stay in Wellington. The museum displays American-made glassware from the Great Depression era. None of the museum pieces were damaged.\n\nKentucky\n\nCave City: Federal officials are investigating a report that a man fired a gunshot while camping at Mammoth Cave National Park, an incident that another camper says was prompted by an alleged sighting of Bigfoot. Mammoth Cave said law enforcement rangers responded early Sunday to a report of a person with a firearm at one of the park’s backcountry campsites. Brad Ginn told news outlets he and his girlfriend were camping nearby and were awakened about 1 a.m. by a man with his son. The man said they were going to investigate strange noises he kept hearing. Ginn said he heard a gunshot minutes later, and the man returned to say Bigfoot had emerged from the woods, so he fired. Ginn said he and his girlfriend decided to leave and report the incident. Park spokeswoman Molly Schroer said an investigation continues, and the park is safe to visit.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: More than 260 new laws are taking effect in the state as August begins. Starting Thursday, people must be at least 16 years old to marry. Medical marijuana patients can inhale cannabis. Women seeking abortions via medication are limited to Louisiana’s three abortion clinics, rather than a doctor’s office. Parents who scuffle with referees at children’s sport events face new penalties. Animal shelters can’t take in stray or unwanted animals solely to euthanize them for research facilities or sell animals for research or experimentation. Louisiana agencies can’t deny or revoke an occupational license when someone falls behind on student loan repayments. Anti-hazing laws get tougher, with new provisions aimed at forcing colleges to report allegations more quickly.\n\nMaine\n\nRockland: The Maine Lobster Festival is underway, with festivalgoers planning to eat hundreds of the state’s beloved arthropods and crown a new sea goddess. The decades-old festival takes place near the Rockland waterfront and offers fare including steamed lobster, lobster bisque, lobster mac and cheese, lobster rolls, lobster wraps and lobster Caesar salad. The festival started Wednesday and ends Sunday. Wednesday’s big event is the 72nd Maine Sea Goddess Coronation. That piece of the festival caused a stir in the community last year when the winner lost her crown a day after her coronation over social media posts showing her holding a marijuana cigarette. New leaders of the festival later apologized to the pageant winner, Taylor Hamlin.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Officials in the city are creating unique learning spaces to help students traumatized by violence and poverty. Trauma-sensitive schools offer mental-health clinicians, mindfulness exercises, and abundant “peace corners” with pillows and books where students can retreat and compose themselves. The schools come in response to a growing realization among educators that chronic childhood trauma affects brain development and creates the risk of health problems. The need to address childhood trauma and mental health was underscored in Baltimore in 2015. The death of young black man Freddie Gray in police custody brought renewed attention to poverty, inequity and crime in large swaths of Baltimore. And the city drew national attention when President Donald Trump tweeted that its congressional district is a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An archaeological dig in historic Chinatown has been cut short after it turned up a 1980s music cassette, a toy dinosaur and other bric-a-brac. The city’s Archaeology Program tweeted Tuesday that it was wrapping up its three-week excavation because researchers reached the water table, and it was unsafe to dig further. The excavation of a vacant lot near the neighborhood’s distinctive gateway had been expected to last until early autumn. In recent days, researchers have been humorously tweeting some of their “finds,” including a cassette by Boston R&B group New Edition, a dinosaur toy, linoleum flooring, and other items from the 1970s and 1980s. Researchers had hoped to turn up artifacts shedding new light on Boston’s immigrants from China, Syria, Ireland and England who sought new lives in Chinatown from 1840 to 1980.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A mission to return the Arctic grayling to state waters is nearing a milestone. Juvenile grayling are scheduled to arrive soon at the Oden State Fish Hatchery in Emmet County, where an ultraviolet water disinfection system recently was installed. Fish production manager Ed Eisch of the Department of Natural Resources says the system will prevent fish already in the area from being infected by viruses or bacteria that the newly arrived grayling might bring along. They were collected as eggs in Alaska and have been kept at Michigan State University. The juvenile fish will be reared in isolation at Oden. Once cleared by health testing, they’ll be transferred to Marquette State Fish Hatchery to continue maturing. Grayling are native to Michigan but died out because of logging and overfishing.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: About 200 people protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement policies blocked traffic near a Twin Cities federal building at Fort Snelling on Tuesday. The Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building houses an immigration court sometimes referred to as “deportation court.” Demonstrators blocked traffic late Tuesday afternoon in protest of ICE policies at the Mexican border, the separation of families and conditions in immigrant detention centers. Police cited about 25 protesters. Some held signs that read “Close the Camps” and “Abolish Ice.” The protest was part of a national movement called #NeverAgainIsNow, which links the Holocaust to America’s treatment of migrants arriving from Central America.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Wildlife Federation’s Mississippi Wildlife Extravaganza has long been considered the unofficial start of hunting season in the state and draws tens of thousands of outdoor enthusiasts, but this year may prove different. Sportsmen say they’ll boycott the event this weekend, and vendors are dropping out over the organization’s stance on floodwater pumps in the south Delta. Flooding there most of the year has led to damaged homes, loss of crops, business closings and wildlife deaths. At its peak, floodwater covered a reported 550,000 acres of prime farmland and wildlife habitat. Proponents of the pumps say much of the flooding could have been avoided if pumps were installed at the Steele Bayou Control structure to push backwater out. But MWF has publicly opposed the pumps over environmental damage concerns.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A spokesman for the University of Missouri’s flagship campus says the school has identified fewer than 10 students whose parents may have taken advantage of a financial aid loophole. At issue is a practice of wealthy parents transferring guardianship of their children to friends or relatives to make it appear they came from poorer backgrounds, making them eligible for more financial aid. The U.S. Education Department is being urged to make changes to close the loophole. University of Missouri spokesman Christian Basi says the school will pull the funding it provides based on need and notify federal authorities if the determination is made that guardianship changes were done solely to take advantage of financial aid. Basi says no one will be kicked out of school, but the university is “extremely disappointed.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The blood supplier of area hospitals says it needs more donors after its daily blood donation count has fallen by more than half. The Billings Gazette reports Vitalant of Montana aims to get between 150 and 200 units of blood each day, but the daily donation has dropped to about 70 units. St. Vincent Healthcare and the Billings Clinic said in a joint statement that the blood supply is “alarmingly low,” so they need more people to donate regularly. Vitalant donor recruitment manager Erin Baker says the supplier has had trouble attracting donors who are ages 24-40. Most of the donors are 50 and older. Baker says a person would ideally donate blood at least three times a year.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A state trooper has cited a driver after pulling over a vehicle that had registration stickers painted onto its license plates. Nebraska State Patrol spokesman Cody Thomas says the vehicle was stopped Monday morning at an Interstate 80 exit in north Lincoln. Trooper Adam Strode spotted the problem, and he ticketed the driver for having fictitious plates and not having valid registration. It’s unclear whether the driver also was the artist whose unsteady hand fashioned two rough red rectangles in the upper right-hand corner of the plates. The number 5 was in the middle, signifying a May expiration for 2020. Thomas says troopers to whom he’s talked told him it was the first time they’d heard of or “seen anything like this.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Airport officials say a 3.1% jump in the number of passengers for the first half of 2019 puts McCarran International Airport on record pace to top 50 million passengers for the year. The Clark County Department of Aviation reports the 4.5 million arriving and departing travelers at the airport in June followed an all-time-high monthly tally of 4.6 million passengers in May. The airport handled a record-high 49.7 million passengers in 2018. McCarran is one of the 10 busiest airports in the nation based on passenger count. Domestic airlines have handled more than 22.8 million McCarran passengers through June, up 2.9% from the first half of 2018. Southwest Airlines is the busiest carrier at the airport, followed by Delta, Spirit, American and United.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHenniker: An annual gathering of current and former foster youth has a rap music theme this year. Participants at Thursday’s Youth Voices Summit at New England College in Henniker will attend workshops on topics such as getting a college degree; finding a job; choosing a career; budgeting; self-advocacy; forming healthy relationships; and finding help for substance abuse. This year’s keynote speaker is Ethan Birch, also known as rapper Six 8. He’s been a vocal youth advocate at several national events, including the Future Business Leaders of America State Convention. In addition to providing the keynote address, Ethan will lead an afternoon workshop on positive rap. The event will also include a listening session led by the Office of the Child Advocate and a youth talent show.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nManasquan: The state’s senior U.S. senator wants federal officials to take more aggressive action to protect beachgoers from wind-swept beach umbrellas. Bob Menendez held a news conference to once again call on the Consumer Product Safety Commission to improve its regulations and develop an aggressive campaign to educate beachgoers on the dangers the umbrellas can pose if they’re not properly staked in the sand. But the Democrat stressed that he wasn’t calling for a ban on umbrellas. A woman was speared in the leg by a beach umbrella last summer in the Jersey Shore community of Seaside Heights. CPSC statistics show that more than 31,000 people were treated at hospitals for umbrella-related injuries from 2008-2017.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The mother of a Navajo girl who was kidnapped and killed in 2016 urged tribal officials and children’s advocates Tuesday to take advantage of tools and funding under a law that expands access to the nation’s Amber Alert system. Pamela Foster spoke during a training at Isleta Pueblo, south of Albuquerque, for tribes seeking to implement the alert system. Despite a 2007 pilot project, it was not in place on the Navajo Nation when her daughter Ashlynne Mike was abducted near Shiprock. Her disappearance was a catalyst for the state to fully implement Amber Alerts. “I want you to know there was nothing worse than finding out there were no Amber Alert systems on the reservation at the time when we needed it most. No roadway digital signs, no text alerts,” Foster said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State ethics officials are threatening to fine a woman up to $75,000 for unregistered lobbying after she rented billboards to criticize state laws on molestation and share her own story of abuse. Kat Sullivan, a nurse who says she was assaulted by a teacher at a private school upstate two decades ago, was part of the successful push that got lawmakers in Albany to relax the statute of limitations on molestation. Sullivan got the billboard idea from the film “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” about a woman who used billboards to seek justice for her daughter’s unsolved murder. Sullivan also set up a website and hired a pilot to fly a plane around Albany carrying a banner supporting the legislation. Then she received a letter saying she could be fined for violating a law requiring individuals to register as lobbyists if they spend more than $5,000 on efforts to influence the Legislature.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHillsborough: Officials are looking for an emu on the loose that was last spotted jumping on the hood of a car before running away. News outlets report that officials say the emu, nicknamed “Eno,” was sighted over the weekend. Orange County Animal Services spokesperson Tenille Fox says it’s believed to be in the Hillsborough area. An Orange County government Twitter account posted an emu’s mugshot Friday with the word “wanted” in red letters. Officials say it’s been on the run for about five weeks. They don’t know where the flightless bird escaped from. Fox says people shouldn’t try to catch it but instead should call animal services. Fox says owning emus is legal in Orange County. She says they’re often kept on farms and don’t usually run away.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A landowners group has sued the state over a new law related to compensation for the use of cavities in underground rock formations. The Bismarck Tribune reports the Northwest Landowners Association filed its lawsuit Monday challenging the law that takes effect Thursday. The group says the new law amounts to the unconstitutional taking of private property rights. Gov. Doug Burgum in April signed the legislation that sought to clarify issues surrounding the cavities known as “pore space,” which may be used to inject saltwater from oil and gas production or for enhanced oil recovery. Under the new law, some landowners cannot be compensated for their pore space. Burgum has said the law clarifies legal issues related to underground injection, which should boost the state’s energy industry.\n\nOhio\n\nGarfield Heights: A judge wants to take a second look at a 10-day jail sentence given to a 79-year-old woman for refusing to stop feeding stray cats in her suburban Cleveland neighborhood. Cleveland.com reports that Garfield Heights Municipal Court Judge Jennifer Weiler wants to hear the case herself after a jail sentence handed down to Nancy Segula by a city magistrate last week was widely criticized. Segula acknowledges repeatedly violating a city ordinance making it illegal for people to feed dogs and cats that aren’t their own. She was sentenced to jail after her fourth appearance in court for the violations. She says she lost her husband and her own cats in 2017, and she began feeding the cats because she’s lonely.\n\nOklahoma\n\nWelch: Authorities are starting a new search for two 16-year-old girls missing and presumed dead for nearly 20 years. Craig County District Attorney’s spokeswoman Michelle Lowry says the search for Ashley Freeman and Lauria Bible is being held near the Picher area, where authorities have said the girls’ bodies are believed to have been dumped. The girls disappeared Dec. 30, 1999, from Freeman’s home in nearby Welch. Freeman’s parents, Danny and Kathy Freeman, were found fatally shot in the burned home. In April 2018, authorities charged 68-year-old Ronnie Dean Busick with four counts of first-degree murder in the case and said two other suspects are dead. Busick has denied involvement in the case and is undergoing a mental competency evaluation.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A real estate investor has donated undeveloped land to Portland Audubon’s Wildlife Sanctuary. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports Marty Kehoe and his family have donated Pittock Place. The 22-acre plot borders Forest Park, a public park west of downtown. Audubon officials say the property is one of the largest, most ecologically valuable parcels on the periphery of the park. The land is worth an estimated $14 million and was slated for development of 32 multimillion-dollar homes. Officials say donors raised $200,000 to pay the property’s remaining mortgage, which was Kehoe’s only stipulation. The City of Portland contributed $350,000 to purchase a conservation easement. The city is also expected to provide $150,000 for restoration services including invasive plant removal and water quality protection.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Pennsylvanians who prefer not to be identified as male or female will soon have a gender-neutral option on their state-issued driver’s licenses. The state joins more than 10 others that have rolled out plans to give residents options. The Daily Item of Sunbury reports Pennsylvania Department of Transportation expects to have the new procedure in place by the middle of next year. It will let motorists use “X” as a third option to indicate gender. A department spokeswoman says the agency is able to make the change on its own and doesn’t need authorization from the Republican-controlled Legislature. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf said Wednesday that the department made the decision, but it’s consistent with his opinions about equity and fairness.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Providence Teachers Union has declared its commitment to work with the state to reform the city’s schools. The report from the union came less than a week after state Education Commissioner Angelica Infante-Green was given sweeping authority to turn around Providence Public Schools. The union’s document details several reform recommendations, including addressing chronic teacher absenteeism, increasing the number of educators of color and integrating community members into everyday work at schools. Infante-Green responded to the union in a statement saying she welcomes the commitment from teachers. The Department of Education sought control of Providence schools after a searing report last month from the Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy labeled it among the worst public school systems in the nation.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLexington: The state Department of Education has been granted $8million to buy new school buses thanks to a settlement involving Volkswagen. State leaders including Gov. Henry McMaster made the announcement Tuesday in Lexington. The money will be used to buy 78 school buses that run on propane. The state has been criticized as having one of the worst school bus fleets in the country. Lawmakers set aside $19 million from lottery profits this year for school buses. Charleston’s transit system received money for two electric buses and charging stations. Anderson received money for a bus fueled by compressed natural gas. South Carolina will receive nearly $34 million from the 2016 emissions settlement the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reached with Volkswagen.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The American Civil Liberties Union is creating a new position in the state focusing on indigenous issues. ACLU director of campaigns Sabrina King says the position will be modeled on the organization’s indigenous justice program in Montana. King will supervise the new South Dakota position. The ACLU has long wanted to build on its work on indigenous issues in the state. The idea took on new urgency after South Dakota this year passed laws aimed at potential Keystone XL protests. The laws allow for tougher penalties for so-called riot boosting, defined in part as encouraging violence during a riot. The ACLU is challenging the law in federal court.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state is providing access to federal grant programs to help communities and volunteer fire departments become better equipped for wildfires. The state Department of Agriculture will accept applications for Hazard Mitigation Assistance program grants from Aug. 5 through Sept. 20. Eligible communities must have crafted or be in the process of crafting a Community Wildfire Prevention Plan. The grants offer full reimbursement up to $20,000 for communities to implement wildfire prevention efforts and education projects. A program to help fire departments serving 10,000 or fewer people will open Aug. 5 and end Sept. 13. The Volunteer Fire Assistance Program offers 50% reimbursement for wildland fire equipment and supplies from $1,000 to $6,000.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Officials have approved a settlement in a federal lawsuit over the bail system in Harris County that ensures that most people accused of misdemeanor offenses don’t languish in jail. The bail system in the state’s most populous county had been deemed unconstitutional by a federal judge following a 2016 lawsuit alleging poor misdemeanor defendants remained jailed because of their poverty. Harris County commissioners approved the settlement by a 3-2 vote Tuesday, with the two Republicans on the court voting against it. The settlement ensures most people charged with misdemeanor offenses would be released within hours of arrest and would get help to ensure they attend future court appearances. The judge handling the lawsuit could give final approval at an Aug. 21 court hearing.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s decision to award a smaller number of medical marijuana grower licenses than allowed by law is being challenged by six companies that say the state granted licenses to unqualified cultivators and had inappropriate interactions with applicants, among other claims. Chris Hughes, director of the state’s Division of Purchasing, confirmed that six rejected applicants met Friday’s appeal deadline. The administrative appeal could further delay the rollout of medical marijuana for the state because state law says licenses cannot be finalized until protests are resolved. Utah’s Department of Agriculture and Food selected eight companies to grow medical marijuana for its program set to open next year. Although the new law allows Utah to award up to 10 licenses at the start of the program, state officials say they chose to only hand out eight to avoid an oversupply of cannabis.\n\nVermont\n\nCastleton: Castleton University has received accreditation from the New England Commission of Higher Learning for the newest extension of its nursing program. The school took over the registered nurse bachelor’s degree program previously offered by Southern Vermont College in Bennington, which closed after the spring semester. The Rutland Herald reports the new program will be in the Vermont Mill Building in Bennington. It used to be home to the radiology and X-ray programs and is being renovated before the fall semester. More than 30 students are enrolled; 25 are from Southern Vermont College. School officials say the nursing shortage is ongoing, and 3,800 nursing positions will be vacant in the next five years. Castleton nursing educators say there’s a plan in the works for a potential master’s program.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A video rental store that is believed to be among the last of its size on the East Coast is set to close this month. The Virginian-Pilot reports the Naro Expanded Video Archival Library in Norfolk will close by the end of August. The store has more than 42,000 video titles and outlasted a vast number of video rental businesses that have already closed across the country. But like them, it fell victim to streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Naro Video converted from a business to a nonprofit in 2016 and partially relied on fundraisers. One raised $45,000 from 440 people in less than two days. That likely kept it going for another two years. But such efforts couldn’t provide sustainability over the long term.\n\nWashington\n\nSeatac: Democrats have elected the first female speaker of the state House. With the selection of state Rep. Laurie Jinkins of Tacoma, Washington becomes the eighth state to have a woman in the top spot in the House and is now the second state to have a gay speaker of the House, joining Oregon. “I’m really proud to be the first woman, the first out lesbian serving in this position,” Jenkins said at a news conference after the vote. “I believe very, very strongly that the diversity of our caucus really more and more is representing the diversity of our state and helps us make better decisions for the people of this state. I’m proud to be a part of carrying that forward.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: People recovering from substance abuse disorder can get rides to appointments under a forthcoming project in the area. The Herald-Dispatch reports the Appalachian Regional Commission has provided more than $215,000 for the one-year pilot program. ARC federal co-chair Tim Thomas says it will start in October in the Huntington region. Thomas says those recovering from substance abuse disorder often do not have an active driver’s license or own a vehicle. Rides will be given for recovery and treatment appointments, probation meetings, mandatory court appearances, job interviews or to a new job. Other program sponsors include the Appalachian Transportation Institute, the state Department of Health and Human Resources, the Office of Drug Control Policy and the West Virginia Governor’s Council on Substance Abuse and Prevention.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers is pushing to toughen state rules to reduce nitrate contamination in ground and surface water as concerns grow about pollution across the state. Evers announced Wednesday that he is directing the state Department of Natural Resources to establish nitrate performance standards for soil most likely to be contaminated. Environmental group Clean Wisconsin praised the news, saying creating new rules for how nitrates are applied to farm fields is an important step for protecting rural drinking water across the state. Evers is directing state agencies to start the process of creating a rule that will govern the level of nitrates that will be allowable. Studies have shown that agricultural sources such as manure and commercial fertilizer are the most common sources of nitrate pollution.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Cheyenne Frontier Days officials report a slight increase in attendance at night shows this year, while rodeo attendance saw a slight drop. The annual western and rodeo event ended Sunday. KGAB-AM reports that officials say in a news release that overall attendance increased slightly this year compared to 2018. Total night show attendance this year was 120,518, compared to 115,214 last year. Rodeo attendance this year was pegged at 97,373 in 2019 compared to an official attendance of 101,462 in 2018. The official attendance for the three 2019 CFD pancake breakfasts was pegged at 22,713, while 50,998 visited the Indian Village.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/07/anti-racism-art-speedway-shot-sweetener-pharrell-vs-va-beach-news-around-states/119027036/", "title": "Anti-racism art, speedway shot sweetener: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The first capital of the Confederacy has renamed a street honoring the rebel president to recognize a Black civil rights lawyer instead, defying a state law meant to protect Confederate monuments and memorials. The Montgomery City Council voted Tuesday night to rename Jeff Davis Avenue for attorney Fred D. Gray, who grew up on the street during the Jim Crow era and went on to represent clients including Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. “When I think of heroes who exemplify the best in our city, (Gray) is certainly at the forefront of that,” said Mayor Steven Reed, Montgomery’s first Black mayor. He initially proposed the change in December. The City Council’s unanimous approval could prompt a $25,000 fine under an Alabama law passed in 2017 to prevent the removal or alteration of Confederate monuments, which have been challenged and taken down across the South, but Reed said donors already had offered to pay the penalty for the city, where delegates voted to form the Confederacy in 1861. Gray, 90, still practices law in Tuskegee, located east of Montgomery, and said the city had kept him informed. “This is a project of the mayor’s,” he said. “He expressed it to me. I was very happy about it. And I am very happy about it.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Citing an increase in rude, violent behavior in schools, the city’s superintendent wants parents to help address the problem with children. The bad behavior has included a fight at a high school that prompted a large police response, along with a TikTok challenge in which students caused thousands of dollars in damage to school bathrooms, KTUU-TV reports. Superintendent Deena Bishop said the pandemic may be behind the behavior. “We are just finding, more and more, our young people, our children, are mostly as stressed out as the rest of us,” Bishop said. “And the stress and the anxiety in the community has taken effect. And we just want to work with our parents to find solutions to this.” The state’s largest school district has recorded nearly 800 suspensions this year, most at the secondary level. Officials say while that’s not necessarily a high number, the severity of the incidents has increased, including fights, assaults, and drug and alcohol issues. Teachers also report younger children seem to have lost the coping skills they need to calm down, Bishop said. In a recent newsletter, she asked parents to intervene after students in many incidents lacked respect and patience. “If you are seeing it at home, guess what’s happening in our schools,” Bishop said of the bad behavior.\n\nArizona\n\nFountain Hills: Beaten in his last three elections, former six-term Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is attempting another comeback, this time running for mayor of the affluent Phoenix suburb where he has lived for the past two decades. The former lawman on Tuesday announced his entry in the 2022 mayor’s race in Fountain Hills, a town of about 25,000. After getting crushed by a Democratic challenger in 2016 after 24 years as sheriff, Arpaio finished third in a Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat in 2018 and second in the GOP primary in his 2020 bid to win back the sheriff’s post. In both comeback attempts, Arpaio lost the vote in Fountain Hills. In an interview, he said his last comeback bids failed because he entered those races too late in the election cycle, and his early entry in the mayor’s race is an attempt to avoid the same fate. He rejected criticism that he should walk away from public life. The 89-year-old said he remains in good health and wants to push a pro-business agenda on behalf of the town. Arpaio was voted out as sheriff in 2016 amid voter frustration over his headline-grabbing tactics and legal troubles, including his disobedience of a judge’s 2011 order to stop his large-scale traffic patrols targeting immigrants that led to his 2017 criminal contempt of court conviction, which was pardoned by then-President Donald Trump.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Elizabeth Eckford, one of the nine Black students who first integrated Central High School in 1957, celebrated her 80th birthday at the school with the help of about a dozen students. The teens, members of the Civil Rights Memory Project, lined the sidewalk in front of the high school Monday, holding handwritten signs. “It’s an honor to be here to celebrate with her because she did so much for our school,” Destiny Logan, a senior, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. The number of students participating was kept small, and they were told not to clap or make loud noises, as they gathered outside the same school where an angry mob of protesters had met Eckford and eight other Black students in 1957. After President Dwight Eisenhower ordered federal troops to protect the nine students, they began their first full day on Sept. 25, 1957. Images of the nine Black teens became among the most indelible of the civil rights movement, including one of Eckford calmly walking into school as a teen girl behind her shouts. A teacher sang “Amazing Grace,” and the students sang “Happy Birthday” to Eckford. Students and other guests took turns taking pictures with her and telling her stories. “It was the best birthday I had in a long, long time,” Eckford said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: City leaders on Wednesday approved one of the nation’s strictest vaccine mandates – a sweeping measure that requires the shots for everyone entering bars, restaurants, nail salons, gyms or even a Lakers game. The City Council voted 11-2 in favor of the ordinance that will require proof of full vaccination starting Nov. 4. The move came after the council postponed a vote last week to deal with concerns ranging from who could be fined for violations to whether employees could end up in fistfights when they have to serve as vaccine door monitors. Some critics charge that a mandate would amount to segregation of those who cannot or refuse to be vaccinated. Others call it unenforceable. Business trade groups have said the city mandate will sow confusion because Los Angeles County’s own vaccine rules – which apply both in Los Angeles and in surrounding communities – are less sweeping. However, council members who support the ordinance said it is aimed at reducing the risk of new coronavirus case surges. Mayor Eric Garcetti, who’s expected to sign the ordinance into law, said last week: “I don’t want to bury another city employee, police officer, firefighter.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A health system fired 119 employees for not adhering to its vaccine requirement without a religious or medical exemption. That accounts for less than 0.5% of the company’s 26,500 employees around the state, said UCHealth spokesperson Dan Weaver. UCHealth employees had until Oct. 1 to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or apply for and receive an exemption. Among those fired, 54 employees were from the Denver region, 33 from northern Colorado and 32 from the southern part of the state. Nearly 1,170 medical and religious exemptions were approved, for about 4% of the workforce, Weaver said. “Despite the loss of these employees, UCHealth’s COVID-19 vaccination requirement has helped to improve staffing. With broad vaccination rates, fewer employees are testing positive for COVID-19 and needing to be out of work while they recover,” he said in an email. The employees who were terminated are welcome and encouraged to reapply if they receive one of the three approved COVID-19 vaccinations, Weaver said. UCHealth is a nonprofit health care system with 12 hospitals and hundreds of medical clinics in the Rocky Mountain region.\n\nConnecticut\n\nManchester: A private high school’s president apologized Tuesday after cheerleaders from another school reported being subjected to racist taunts after a football game there. Sean Brennan, president of East Catholic High School, said an investigation has not been able to determine who was involved in the Sept. 24 incident, but the school has “no tolerance for derisive and unkind words or behavior directed at our own students or students from other schools.” In an open letter to the Montville High School community, he wrote: “I am deeply sorry this happened, and I promise you that we can and will do better.” A 16-year-old Black cheerleader from Montville reported two East Catholic football players used a racial epithet in telling her to go home after East Catholic won. Another cheerleader reported she also was subjected to racial slurs, and the cheerleaders had water thrown at them. Brennan had earlier issued a statement saying the school took the reports seriously but did not believe “anything inappropriate was said.” There have been daily protests outside East Catholic since the interaction was reported, and leaders from both schools met Sept. 29 to discuss it with Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference officials. The CIAC said both schools will send student representatives to a training session on sportsmanship.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Dover International Speedway is offering the chance to drive around its “Monster Mile” to people who get vaccinated against COVID-19 at the racetrack later this month. Up to 800 drivers and their passengers will be able to take two laps around the track in their own vehicles behind a pace car, according to a news release. Events will be held Oct. 16 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Oct. 17 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines will be offered. Participants will be able to get their first, second or booster shots. Free coronavirus testing will also be available, and people can get vaccinated at the events without driving the track. The first 250 people to sign up for vaccinations will receive two tickets to the NASCAR Xfinity Series race at the speedway April 30, 2022. Registration opened Wednesday at racetoendcovid.org. Appointments are encouraged, but walk-ups for testing and shots without driving the track will be accepted. Driving the track without signing up will only be available if the slots aren’t filled in advance. Drivers going around the track alone must be at least 18 and have a valid driver’s license, car registration in their name and vehicle insurance. Those who are 16 and 17 must have a license and a parent or guardian in the vehicle to sign a release form.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mourners and members of the public gathered on the Washington National Cathedral’s grounds Tuesday evening as its massive funeral bell tolled for America’s more than 700,000 COVID-19 victims, WUSA-TV reports. It was an astounding number – 700 plangent peals of the funeral bell, which was used before the pandemic to mourn the loss of presidents, senators, and luminaries of American life. Now, the bell tolls largely for those who chose to remain unvaccinated, six months after most Americans gained access to the lifesaving shots. “They don’t seem to realize the import of it until they themselves suffer a loss in their family,” said Zenaida Samaniego, who drove from Maryland to hear the hourlong ceremony. “The bells will toll again because of this hard-headedness about getting something that protects people.” With each bell symbolizing 1,000 American deaths from the coronavirus, disruptions and nonchalance were not lost on the mourners. A woman watching a YouTube video on her phone, at full volume, received glares until she got the message. “This must be moving us in a way I didn’t think it would,” said a woman who gave her name as Bess, describing the somber sense of hearing the bells from her Adams Morgan home. “I wish I could say this would be the end. But I don’t think it will be.”\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: The mansion that gangster Al Capone owned for nearly two decades – once fated to be demolished – just sold for $15.5 million. The Miami Herald reports the home was sold to 93 Palm Residence LLC, managed by Coral Gables accountant Toni Alam. Capone, the original “Scarface,” bought the waterfront house for $40,000 in 1928. He died there in 1947 from a heart attack. Developer Todd Michael Glaser and partner Nelson Gonzalez, senior vice president of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM, bought the nine-bedroom residence in August for $10.75 million with plans to demolish it and replace it with a more modern project. But preservationists in Miami Beach balked at their plans. Glaser compared the out-of-the-blue offer to a winning lottery ticket. “If someone tells you they want to give you a $5 million lotto ticket, of course you’d take it,” he said. Glaser had previously told the Herald the home, which is about 3 feet below sea level, had flood damage and standing water underneath it. “The house is a piece of crap,” he said at the time. “It’s a disgrace to Miami Beach.” The home is believed to be where Capone and his associates plotted the notorious St. Valentine’s Day massacre in which seven members of an opposing gang were gunned down in a Chicago parking garage in 1929.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State inspectors and an investigation found that a state agency unlawfully held onto millions of dollars in seized funds, spending money on Fitbits, exercise equipment and other items. A division of the Department of Revenue also spent funds on engraved firearms and stress balls shaped like beer mugs, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. The report released last month by the Office of the Inspector General confirmed reporting last year by the newspaper and WSB-TV detailing how money seized in tax investigations was spent by the Department of Revenue’s Office of Special Investigations. Spending by that investigative division was “clearly wasteful” and “gave the appearance of extravagance,” the report found. The department has since changed its policies and returned money to the state treasury, where it should have gone in the first place, the newspaper reports. Revenue Commissioner Robyn Crittenden, who took over the department in July, vowed to make more reforms. “The department is actively moving forward to ensure the findings highlighted in this report are remedied,” she said. “We are committed to consistently doing the right thing and serving the taxpayers of Georgia with integrity and accountability.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. Geological Survey officials have lowered the alert level for the Kilauea volcano, saying they expect its latest eruption to remain confined to the summit. The eruption began last week in the Halemaumau crater at the volcano’s summit on the Big Island. Officials with the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory had raised Kilauea’s alert level to “warning” and its aviation code to red as they assessed the intensity of lava fountains covering the floor of the crater and billowing clouds of volcanic smoke. But over the past several days, a thick layer of molten lava has accumulated at the base of the crater, lessening fears it could spread. Observatory officials lowered the alert level to “watch” and the aviation code to orange Monday afternoon. The eruption remains confined to the crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. It’s not in an area where there are any homes. Ron Hanatani, who has a pottery studio in Volcano Village near the park’s entrance, said residents and tourists have been flocking for a glimpse, though as a former geologist at the observatory, he has seen more spectacular eruptions. Village businesses are grateful for the attention during a normally slower time of year for tourists, said Ira Ono, owner of Volcano Garden Arts and Cafe Ono. Even though he has lived in the area for decades, he’s still mesmerized by Kilauea. “We see the glow at night,” he said. “It’s pretty dramatic and beautiful.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: With Gov. Brad Little out of the state Tuesday, Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin issued an executive order involving COVID-19 vaccines. Oh no you don’t, said Little, who promised to rescind it in quick order and was expected to be back in the state Wednesday evening. The maneuvering of Idaho’s top leaders came while Little was in Texas meeting with nine other Republican governors about concerns with how President Joe Biden is handling border issues. McGeachin, a far-right Republican, is running for governor, and the governor and lieutenant governor don’t run on the same ticket in Idaho. Her executive order seeks, among other things, to prevent employers from requiring their employees be vaccinated against COVID-19. Most mainstream Republicans prefer to give private businesses latitude to make their own decisions. McGeachin was also rebuffed Tuesday by Maj. Gen. Michael J. Garshak in a query about activating Idaho National Guard troops and sending them to the U.S.-Mexico border. “I am unaware of any request for Idaho National Guard assistance under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) from Texas or Arizona,” Garshak wrote, in part, to McGeachin. “As you are aware, the Idaho National Guard is not a law enforcement agency.” It’s not the first time McGeachin has ruffled feathers in her capacity as acting governor with Little out of state. In May, she issued an order banning mask mandates that Little eliminated on his return, saying such decisions were best left to local officials.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: State and federal officials on Monday unveiled a mobile unit that they say will add speed and efficiency to digital investigations of child pornography and exploitation at a time when young people are using the internet more than ever before. The gray van is assigned to the Internet Crimes Against Children task force, said Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, whose office oversees the group and its increasing caseload. Tips about alleged exploitation received by the task force increased by 118% from 2017 to 2020 and are on pace to jump another 23% this year. “Child predators are actively trolling the internet, trading, selling and collecting images of the most vile sexual acts involving children,” Raoul said. Other predators log on to appear to innocently befriend young people, he said, then lure them to meet-ups for sex. The mobile unit is funded by a $174,000 federal grant and outfitted with advanced technology. When authorities target a suspect, the unit will be key in an environment where timing is critical, and evidence integrity can make or break a case, said Zeus Flores, a digital forensic examiner for the task force. Instead of having to work in what could be squalid conditions – “some of the homes we’re going into are frankly biohazards,” Flores said – the mobile unit will offer privacy and safety.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Mourners gathered at a small chapel Tuesday evening to remember the dozens of Hoosiers lost last year to domestic violence. The Indianapolis-based Domestic Violence Network, which seeks to raise awareness of and end domestic violence across the state, hosts the annual memorial. The number of people honored Tuesday was the highest in recent memory, advocates said. Among the 74 Hoosiers known to have been killed in domestic violence incidents between June 1, 2020, and May 31, 2021, 34 were from Marion County, with the oldest 77 and the youngest just 7. The names of those 34 from the capital area were read aloud at Tuesday’s service. Domestic Violence Network Executive Director Kelly McBride said the increase in deaths was “staggering.” Eleven people were honored at 2020’s service and 16 in 2019. Ash Rathwell, training services manager for the network, said local service providers have seen a sharp increase in calls for help regarding domestic violence since the pandemic began. But a report released by the group this year examined the overwhelming need domestic violence service providers experienced long before COVID-19. On any given day, there were more than 1,800 victims and survivors served by direct service providers, but at least 182 requests for services go unmet, it found.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Legislature on Tuesday rejected the first set of redistricting maps drawn by a state agency, raising concerns that majority Republicans may opt to insert politics into the state’s nonpartisan process. The Legislative Services Agency drew the maps, which proposed revising Iowa’s four congressional districts to include two that lean heavily toward Republicans, one that favors Democrats and one that both parties would have a chance at winning. After a committee moved the first set of maps to the Senate floor without debate, the full Senate rejected the first plan on a party-line vote, with all 32 Republicans voting “no” and the 18 Democrats voting “yes.” By state law, the LSA is responsible for following detailed guidelines to ensure population balance among Iowa’s congressional districts and to prevent political influence in the initial drafting of changes. By law, the Legislature can only accept or reject the maps without amendment. The LSA now has 35 days to draw a second set of maps, which again must be voted up or down by lawmakers with no amendments. If that is rejected, the LSA would have another 35 days to draw a third set, which could be amended with majority Republicans leading that process – something that hasn’t happened in 40 years, since the first time the state’s current redistricting procedure was in place.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Legislators are setting up a new anti-mandate committee targeting COVID-19 vaccines and masking in schools. “I’m absolutely not sure it’s safe,” Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, said of the vaccines. Thompson is one of 11 legislators on the Special Joint Committee on Government Overreach and the Impact of COVID-19 Mandates. Republican leadership announced their eight appointees Monday. Democrats haven’t appointed their three allotted members. “It would be one thing if we knew this thing absolutely worked, and there was no adverse reaction,” Thompson told reporters Tuesday. “But that’s not the case right now.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. But Thompson said that “this is not a true vaccine ... an attenuated or weakened version of the virus itself. This is a a genetically engineered vaccine that some doctors I’ve talked to have told me that this is introducing basically an autoimmune disease into your body.” Republicans have balked at President Joe Biden’s proposed vaccine-or-testing mandates. Brushing aside concerns about immunocompromised people and children who aren’t yet eligible for vaccination, Thompson asked why Biden and others who’ve been inoculated would care whether others have gotten their shots.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s bourbon industry is signaling it’s increasingly bullish on its future after reaching new production heights despite the COVID-19 pandemic and trade disputes in key overseas markets. Bluegrass State bourbon producers filled nearly 2.5 million barrels in 2020, setting a new production record, the Kentucky Distillers’ Association said Monday. It marked the third straight year Kentucky distilleries filled more than 2 million barrels of bourbon. And for the first time in the modern era of American whiskey, Kentucky has 10 million barrels of bourbon aging in distillery warehouses, it said. The state of 4.5 million people has more than 10.3 million barrels of maturing bourbon, according to the latest figures. “Kentucky’s signature bourbon industry continues to invest in our commonwealth at unprecedented levels, despite global pandemic disruptions, exorbitant taxes and ongoing trade wars,” said Eric Gregory, president of the distillers’ group. “This is truly a historic and landmark record.” Massive inventories are a bet on the future because most bourbons typically age four to eight years before reaching their market. Bourbon gets its flavor and golden brown color during aging.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A 2017 lawsuit challenging former prosecutors for hardball tactics, including the issuance of fake subpoenas and the jailing of crime victims who wouldn’t cooperate with investigators, was settled Tuesday in federal court. The suit centered on the practices of staff under former District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro, who did not seek reelection last year after two six-year terms. Cannizzaro’s successor, Jason Williams, agreed to the appointment of a special monitor to ensure his office complies with terms of the settlement, including detailed policies written to ensure prosecutors don’t use “coercive or unlawful means to secure cooperation from crime victims or witnesses.” Cannizzaro ended his staff’s use of phony subpoenas soon after the practice was exposed by an online news outlet, The Lens. He defended the jailing of witnesses, including victims, as a rarely used but sometimes necessary practice. Civil rights and criminal justice advocates were harshly critical of the practices. Among the harshest critics was Williams, a defense attorney and City Council member. He won election to succeed Cannizzarro late last year while running as a reformer who vowed to end what he called a “win at all cost” mentality in the district attorney’s office. The settlement calls for a $120,000 payout to three remaining plaintiffs.\n\nMaine\n\nYork: A high school student staged a schoolwide walkout after her anti-racism art display sparked complaints, forcing school officials to remove it. York High School senior Claudia Corcoran’s display was part of a school project that tasked students with creating a topic inspired by a book, Principal Karl Francis said. Corcoran’s project included a two-panel painting that describes racism as an issue that continues to plague American society. She donated the piece to the school’s librarian, who displayed it in the library. The York School Department administration ordered that the school should remove the display after complaints from parents, students and faculty. But more complaints on social media followed after its removal. The administration said the artwork was removed because the librarian did not get approval to display it. But in the past, librarians have been allowed to hang student art without permission from school officials. In a statement, YSD Superintendent Lou Goscinski said the student’s art isn’t an issue, “but once we display it, it becomes the speech of the school.” Following that statement, Corcoran staged a walkout Sept. 29, demanding that the school return her artwork to the library. Two days later, Francis announced the art would be put back on display.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan’s former chief of staff has been indicted on charges that he defrauded a state agency he led by inducing it to pay him nearly $280,000 in mostly severance pay before he moved to his post in the governor’s office, the Maryland U.S. attorney announced Tuesday. Roy McGrath also used funds from the Maryland Environmental Service to pay a personal pledge to a museum and got the agency to pay tuition expenses for a class after he left his job as executive director, according to the indictment. He also recorded conversations with senior state officials without their consent and faces state charges, it said. McGrath, of Naples, Florida, fraudulently obtained $276,731 from the environmental service, according to the indictment. The Baltimore Sun, which first reported the story, said McGrath characterized the case as “political persecution.” His attorney, Bruce Marcus, wrote in an email to the Associated Press that his client “vigorously and categorically denies the allegations.” McGrath resigned in August 2020 when he was just 11 weeks into the job as Hogan’s top aide, after the payments became public. Michael Ricci, Hogan’s spokesman, described the charges Tuesday as “very serious and deeply troubling.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Acting Mayor Kim Janey on Tuesday signed an ordinance intended to address climate change by requiring large buildings in the city to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The measure “is a monumental achievement that will have positive impacts on our residents for generations to come,” Janey said in a statement. “We know that the negative effects of climate change bear a disproportionate burden on our most socially vulnerable communities.” Last month the City Council unanimously approved the ordinance, which applies to about 3,500 commercial and residential buildings of 20,000 square feet or more, or about 4% of structures in Boston, according to city officials. They account for 60% of Boston’s building emissions. To reach the goals, building owners can perform energy efficiency improvements; switch to clean, efficient and electric heating systems or fossil fuel-free systems; and purchase clean energy. The measure is an amendment to a 2013 ordinance that required all commercial and residential buildings of at least 35,000 square feet or with at least 35 units to report their energy and water use to the city every year. Buildings covered were also required to show concerted efforts to reduce their energy use or emissions every five years through energy actions or audits.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Canada invoked a treaty with the United States and asked a judge Monday to suspend litigation over Michigan’s effort to shut down a Great Lakes oil pipeline. Canadian Foreign Minister Marc Garneau made clear that his government is backing Enbridge, the Calgary-based company that operates Line 5. Canada said it requested negotiations with the U.S. about the pipeline. It cited a provision in a 1977 treaty that says no public authority in either country can take steps to interfere with the flow of hydrocarbons. Line 5 moves about 23 million gallons of oil and natural gas liquids daily between Wisconsin and Ontario, traversing parts of northern Michigan. A section of the pipeline runs on the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac, which connects lakes Huron and Michigan at the top of the Lower Peninsula. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel, both Democrats, have said Line 5 is a grave threat to the Great Lakes and should be closed to prevent spills. Whitmer said she was disappointed by Canada invoking the treaty. “Rather than taking steps to diversify energy supply and ensure resilience, Canada has channeled its efforts into defending an oil company with an abysmal environmental track record,” she said, noting an Enbridge pipeline rupture into a southwestern Michigan river in 2010.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz called on lawmakers Tuesday to approve a series of new moves to respond to the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, including vaccine and testing requirements for teachers, school staff and long-term care workers, plus measures to relieve strained hospital capacity. The Democratic governor detailed his proposal in a letter to lawmakers after meeting privately with legislative leaders. He urged lawmakers to approve the measures in a special session that was originally envisioned for last month to approve a $250 million bonus package for front-line workers who have risked their lives during the pandemic. Negotiations on that plan have yet to produce an agreement and missed a Labor Day target for completion. Since then, Walz has proposed that the session also include drought relief for farmers. But he has also insisted that Senate Republicans agree not to use the special session to fire Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm, as some have threatened. Walz urged lawmakers to approve a series of waivers and enact other relief to allow hospitals, nursing homes and child care centers to respond more effectively to the surge. He noted that more Minnesotans are hospitalized for COVID-19 than last spring and that at the end of last week only two pediatric intensive care beds were available in the entire state.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state on Wednesday followed through on its promise to appeal a federal judge’s ruling that it come up with a plan to prevent unnecessary institutionalization of people with mental illness. Lawyers for the state filed a notice of appeal to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. On Sept. 7, U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ordered that the state’s initial plan be submitted to the U.S. Justice Department and a mental health expert for feedback within 120 days. The judge said then that the final plan must be completed in 180 days. State lawyers asked last week that the deadline be postponed because Mississippi intended to appeal Reeves’ ruling. James Shelson, the state’s lawyer, wrote Sept. 27 that if the Department of Mental Health were required to complete its plan and other requirements of Reeves’ order in the allocated time frame, “Mississippi will suffer irreparable injuries from undue interference with its mental health system and a fundamental alteration of that system both in costs and structure.” Under Reeves’ order, the state is responsible for tracking a wide array of data, fund new vouchers to help people with mental illness pay rent and utilities, and start a clinical review process sampling 100 to 200 patients a year “to assure that services are working as intended to address the needs of people with serious mental illness.”\n\nMissouri\n\nBonne Terre: A man was put to death Tuesday for killing three workers while robbing a convenience store nearly three decades ago – an execution performed over objections from racial justice activists, lawmakers and even the pope. Ernest Johnson died from an injection of pentobarbital at the state prison in Bonne Terre. He silently mouthed words to relatives as the process began. His breathing became labored, and he puffed out his cheeks, then swallowed hard. Within seconds, all movement stopped. In his written last statement, Johnson said he was sorry “and have remorse for what I do.” He said he loved his family and friends and thanked those who prayed for him. Johnson was pronounced dead at 6:11 p.m., nine minutes after the dose was administered. A corrections department spokeswoman said four relatives representing all three victims were present. Johnson’s witnesses included relatives and his lawyer. No relatives spoke after the execution. Corrections spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said 59 demonstrators gathered on the edge of the prison grounds. Johnson had a history of scoring extremely low on IQ tests, dating back to childhood. His attorney, Jeremy Weis, said Johnson also was born with fetal alcohol syndrome and lost about one-fifth of his brain tissue when a benign tumor was removed in 2008.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: The University of Montana law school is launching an independent review following a walkout and rally over alleged mistreatment of sexual harassment and assault victims. About 100 university students and community members gathered Tuesday morning to demand change and accountability in the Alexander Blewett III School of Law, the Missoulian reports. Speakers and students called on law school Dean Paul Kirgis and Associate Dean Sally Weaver to resign, saying they had failed students and created a toxic environment. As first reported by the Daily Montanan, women from the law school say the two administrators discouraged them from reporting allegations of sexual harassment and assault to the university’s Office of Equal Opportunity and Title IX. Following students’ demands, university officials are launching an “independent, outside review to assess the learning and working environment in the Law School and the mechanisms in place to best support students,” according to a statement to the Missoulian on Tuesday from university spokesman Dave Kuntz. The institution has invested significant resources into investigating the allegations against the law school, Kuntz said in the statement. Those initial investigations found law school leaders did not violate university policy.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A man who fled to Nicaragua after being charged with dozens of felony counts of child pornography and enticement has pleaded no contest to seven of the counts. Adam Hawhee, 29, faces up to 88 years in prison when he’s sentenced in December, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Hawhee was originally charged last year with two counts of child enticement and 26 counts of child pornography possession. He was accused of trying to entice two 7-year-old girls at an Omaha park in March 2020, leading police to search his home, where they reported finding more than 100 child pornography images – some involving toddlers. Hawhee was freed after posting bond. He was jailed again four months later after allegedly exposing himself to a young boy and trying to coax the boy into his vehicle. Hawhee was freed again after posting bond and fled to Nicaragua, missing a December court appearance. When Omaha police found him and had him returned to Nebraska, a judge set his bond at a whopping $50 million – believed to the highest in Douglas County history.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Tribal lawyers are asking a U.S. judge to reconsider her earlier refusal to block digging at a proposed lithium mine where they say newly uncovered evidence proves it was the sacred site of a massacre of dozens of Native Americans in 1865. The new motion filed in federal court in Reno includes an 1865 newspaper report and two eyewitness accounts of how at least 31 Paiute men, women and children were “murdered by federal soldiers” at Thacker Pass. The accounts were in an autobiography published in 1929 by well-known American labor organizer Bill Haywood. One was from a cavalry volunteer who participated in the slaughter and the other a tribal member who survived it. Nevada Lithium Corp.’s construction is slated to begin next year at what would be the largest lithium mine in the nation and biggest open-pit lithium mine in the world. Demand for the mineral, a key component in electric vehicle batteries, is expected to triple in the next five years. The only significant lithium mine now operating in the U.S. is in Nevada. Another planned halfway between Reno and Las Vegas by Ioneer Ltd. also faces legal challenges from environmentalists fighting to protect Tiehm’s buckwheat, a rare desert wildflower that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service formally proposed last week to be listed as an endangered species.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: As a drug recovery program comes to an end at fire stations in the city, a local center that’s part of a state-founded network can offer immediate screening and other services, Gov. Chris Sununu said Monday. The Doorway of Greater Manchester is now available 24 hours a day by calling 2-1-1 and is offering recovery services to coincide with the closing of the Manchester Safe Station program. “I would like to thank the Manchester Fire Department for their tireless service these last few years,” Sununu said in a statement. “Our Doorways have served a tremendous purpose and have provided an excellent service, and we are building out a system that goes beyond the scope of Safe Station.” Safe Station was founded by Manchester firefighters in 2016 in response to the community’s opioid epidemic. People could go to any Manchester fire station for screening and handoff to services. The department will continue to provide mobile, field-based substance use disorder outreach services. The Doorway program is a network of nine locations across the state that provide one-stop access to substance use services.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: A man who used dating apps to lure and kill three women five years ago was sentenced Wednesday to 160 years in prison after a trial in which it was revealed that friends of one victim did their own detective work on social media to ferret out the suspect. Khalil Wheeler-Weaver, 25, sat motionless as the judge gave the sentence in state court in Newark. The sentencing was preceded by emotional statements by family members of victims Robin West and Sarah Butler. In a brief statement before they spoke, Wheeler-Weaver denied responsibility, telling Superior Court Judge Mark S. Ali that he was framed. Wheeler-Weaver’s mother, aunt and brother sat in the gallery but didn’t address the court. The sentences covered three murders, one attempted murder, and other counts including kidnapping, aggravated arson and desecration of human remains. The Essex County prosecutor’s office had credited friends of Butler, a college student from Montclair, with using social media to help police find Wheeler-Weaver. They gained access to her social media accounts, set up a fake account, lured Wheeler-Weaver to a meeting in Montclair and notified police, according to prosecutors. A fourth woman who survived an attack and testified at Wheeler-Weaver’s trial also provided crucial information that helped investigators.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The City Council has adopted a resolution that acknowledges ongoing generational trauma caused by U.S. Indigenous boarding school policies and formalizes a commitment to work with Indigenous communities toward reconciliation and healing. Councilors voted in favor of the measure during a meeting Monday. Mayor Tim Keller is expected to sign the resolution next week on Indigenous Peoples Day. The city has been researching the history of a public park where students of the former Albuquerque Indian School were believed to have been buried more than a century ago. Ground-penetrating radar will be used to study the site, and another meeting was planned later this week to talk about how to keep moving forward. “It really is kind of a first step for us as a city to move forward toward healing and also to be inclusive of all of our communities in Albuquerque and to understand some of the pain that people have lived with over the years of not knowing,” Council President Cynthia Borrego said during the virtual meeting. Indigenous activists became concerned earlier this year when a plaque memorializing the students from the former school vanished. They established a makeshift memorial of flowers and other offerings and demanded an investigation.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Federal agents raided the offices Tuesday of a New York City police union, the Sergeants Benevolent Association, and the Long Island home of its bombastic leader, who has clashed with city officials over his incendiary tweets and hard-line tactics. FBI spokesperson Martin Feely said agents were “carrying out a law enforcement action in connection with an ongoing investigation.” Agents were seen carrying boxes out of the union’s Manhattan headquarters and loading them into a van. The FBI also searched union President Ed Mullins’ home in Port Washington, Feely said. Mullins resigned as the union’s president Tuesday night, according to a message the union’s board sent to members, saying he did so at the board’s urging. The union represents about 13,000 active and retired NYPD sergeants and controls a $264 million retirement fund. “The nature and scope of this criminal investigation has yet to be determined. However, it is clear that President Mullins is apparently the target of the federal investigation,” the board’s message said. “We have no reason to believe that any other member of the SBA is involved or targeted in this matter.” The union’s board said that while Mullins is presumed innocent, it asked him to step aside to ensure the union’s day-to-day operations continue unimpeded.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Some supporters of Republican former Gov. Pat McCrory’s efforts to contest the 2016 gubernatorial election results can be sued for allegedly defaming four residents who were falsely accused of voting twice, an appeals court ruled Tuesday. The complaint the Southern Coalition for Social Justice brought forward in 2017 could pave the way for lawmakers and their supporters to be penalized for making inaccurate voter fraud claims in future elections. The unanimous ruling from the three appeals court judges allows a trial court to hear the case against the Pat McCrory Committee Legal Defense Fund and the Virginia-based Holtzman Vogel Josefiak Torchinsky law firm named in the complaint. The judges also decided that William Clark Porter, a GOP official in Greensboro whose signature was on one of the election protests that was filed, is entitled to a legal defense that would likely clear him of defamation claims because he participated in a “quasi-judicial election protest proceeding.” “Mr. Porter was not the puppet master. He was the puppet, and obviously, he did make serious allegations against our clients, but this is a good ruling for us,” said Allison Riggs, who leads the voting rights program at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. “We believe that we now can proceed against the masterminds of this concerted effort to defame North Carolina voters.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFort Yates: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has elected a woman to be its next leader, according to results released Tuesday. Janet Alkire would be the first woman to head the tribal council in more than half a century. Gates Kelley was elected Standing Rock chairwoman in 1946 and was the first woman to preside over a tribe in the United States, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Alkire received 829 votes to defeat current tribal Vice Chairman Ira Taken Alive, who came in with 762 votes. Taken Alive, who said he is contesting the results, edged Alkire in the July primary that advanced the top two vote-getters. A 15-year Air Force veteran, Alkire has served as Standing Rock’s executive director twice. Her platform included prioritizing youth and elderly wellness initiatives, homelessness, economic development and government transparency. She favors mental health, addiction treatment and rehabilitation for all members and is an advocate for child welfare. The Standing Rock Reservation straddles the North Dakota and South Dakota border and is home to about 8,000 people.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium has lost its most important accreditation, a major blow to an institution once widely admired in its industry and by the general public. The zoo said it plans to appeal the decision announced Wednesday by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, considered the nation’s top zoo-accrediting body, one day after the institution announced its new leader. The accrediting group cited concerns about the zoo’s animal programs department and inappropriate businesses practices by its former leaders. Tom Stalf, the zoo’s former president and chief executive, and Greg Bells, its former chief financial officer, resigned in March after an investigation by the Columbus Dispatch found they allowed relatives to live in houses owned or controlled by the zoo and sought tickets for family members to zoo entertainment events. Subsequent audits initiated by the zoo’s board found that improper spending and questionable business practices by the pair resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars in zoo losses. Investigations and reviews by the Ohio attorney general’s office and the state auditor are pending. Besides the financial issues, the accrediting group voiced concerns about the zoo’s acquisition of ambassador animals in its animal programs department.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A prosecutor is again asking the state Supreme Court to remove two members of the Pardon and Parole Board from the case of a high-profile death row inmate. Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater filed the motion Monday to remove Kelly Doyle and Andrew Luck from the clemency hearing for Julius Jones. Prater alleges the two are biased because of their work with inmates on criminal justice reform. “Both Adam Luck and Kelly Doyle engage in political activities that work to release inmates from prison, all of which makes their Board decisions, at the very least, have an appearance of impropriety,” Prater wrote. The court previously rejected Prater’s request to remove the two from Jones’ commutation hearing on the same grounds. The same five-member board narrowly rejected clemency Tuesday for another death row inmate convicted of killing a prison cafeteria worker in 1998, paving the way for the state’s first execution in more than six years. John Marion Grant, 60, is scheduled for lethal injection Oct. 28. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to death for killing 58-year-old Gay Carter at the Dick Conner Correctional Center in Hominy. Grant’s attorneys said he received ineffective trial counsel because his lawyers never properly presented mitigating evidence, such as his difficult childhood.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: After receiving positive reviews, experts say a nonpolice first-response unit has the potential to be a “citywide solution” for an alternative to nonemergency calls regarding people experiencing a mental health crisis or homelessness. During a City Council work session Tuesday, researchers suggested the Portland Street Response team pilot program should be expanded, following a Portland State University study that evaluated the program’s first six months. “Our first recommendation is to commit the necessary resources toward the expansion of Portland Street Response to eventually make its services available throughout the city and during all hours of the day,” researchers wrote in the report. The unarmed Portland Street Response team is composed of a mental health crisis therapist, a firefighter paramedic and two community health workers who are dispatched to 911 calls related to mental health crises or the homeless population. The team currently works Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. From February to mid-August, the team responded to 383 incidents, with two-thirds involving people experiencing homelessness and roughly half involving someone who needed mental health care. Less than 4% resulted in a trip to the hospital, and none led to arrests, the report found.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nSomerset: Officials in a rural western Pennsylvania county say the elected prosecutor’s access to his office and the courthouse has been restricted after he was charged last month with violently raping a woman he knew through work. Somerset County District Attorney Jeffrey Lynn Thomas, 36, was accused last month of having attacked the woman in her Windber home. He was charged with rape, indecent and simple assault, strangulation and criminal trespassing. County Solicitor Michael Barbera told The (Johnstown) Tribune Democrat that Thomas can no longer use a remote “key fob” to enter the building through side doors or after hours. Instead, he must use the main public entrance with metal detectors and scanners and staffed by sheriff’s deputies, he said. Barbera said that because Thomas is charged with felonies, he no longer has access to a law enforcement database. The Republican said he is planning to plead not guilty and fight the charges in court. He told reporters Friday through his attorney that he’s taking a leave of absence to focus on his case. His lawyer also told reporters Friday that “there’s much more to this story than meets the eye.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nSmithfield: Veterinarians are trying to save a bald eagle that was found injured, with infected eyes and elevated lead levels. An environmental police officer and wildlife control specialist from the state Department of Environmental Management rescued the young bird from the shore of Stump Pond on Saturday and brought it to the Wildlife Clinic of Rhode Island in Saunderstown, where it’s being treated. The national bird since 1782, bald eagles were once an endangered species, and their recovery is considered “a spectacular conservation success” story, according to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Still, there are only “a small handful of bald eagle pairs breeding in Rhode Island,” said John Herbert, a biologist for the DEM’s Division of Fish and Wildlife. Veterinarians believe the bird rescued Saturday is a young adult, and he’s almost totally blind, said Kristin Fletcher, executive director of the Wildlife Clinic of Rhode Island. It has a lesion on one eye and an apparent problem in the other eye and is being treated with eye drops. Fletcher said the bird might have neurological damage and is being tube-fed. A low level of lead was also detected in the bird, she said. The clinic has treated about a half-dozen bald eagles through the years, and “pretty much every eagle we’ve had has lead issues,” she noted, saying the metal likely gets into the birds through shotgun pellets and sinkers used in fishing.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The executive director of the South Carolina Election Commission has left her position several months earlier than planned, with the agency saying she’s taking a new job at a nonprofit that provides cybersecurity resources to election-related entities. Marci Andino had planned to step away from her role Dec. 31 but left office Friday to take over as director of the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center, part of the nonprofit Center for Internet Security, commission spokesman Chris Whitmire told The State newspaper. Until a permanent replacement is found, Voter Services Director Howard Knabb is taking the helm in an interim role, Whitmire said. Leading the agency since 2003, Andino implemented a new statewide voter registration system, voter ID law and candidate filing process. Her departure follows tension with state Republican leaders in the run-up to the 2020 election. She recommended stricter safety measures amid the COVID-19 pandemic, including expanding absentee voting. One of Andino’s suggestions was challenged in court and made it all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court: the removal of a witness signature requirement for absentee ballots. But the court ruled unanimously that the rule should stay.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A panel of judges will review allegations that Gov. Kristi Noem abused her office to help a family member obtain a state appraiser license. The Attorney General’s Office on Wednesday announced it was referring the complaint to the South Dakota Government Accountability, which will investigate the matter and determine if any misconduct occurred. The allegations center on a meeting Noem had with officials with the Department of Labor and Regulation after the agency had recommended denying Noem’s daughter, Kassidy Peters, a real estate appraiser license. Peters ultimately was granted the license in late 2020, four months after the meeting, and shortly after, the state employee who’d recommended denial was no longer employed in the labor office. The Associated Press reported Peters began working as a state-registered appraiser – an entry-level job – in 2016. And in September 2019, Peters applied to become a certified residential appraiser. The appraiser certification program moved to deny the license in summer 2020. Noem initially refused comment on the story but used social media last week to deny any wrongdoing. “I never once asked for special treatment for Kassidy,” the Republican governor wrote. “She is my daughter and I’m proud of her. I raised her to accomplish things on her own.”\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The University of Tennessee Health Science Center has landed $3.2 million in federal money to upgrade a laboratory used for research on infectious diseases. In a news release, the Memphis campus said the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases awarded the money for equipment and infrastructure improvements at the Regional Biocontainment Laboratory. The school said the lab is one of about a dozen nationwide commissioned by the institute after the 9/11 attacks to study very contagious pathogens as a safeguard against bioterrorism. The laboratory opened in 2009. It has played a role in research related to COVID-19.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Opponents of a new state ban on most abortions filed a lawsuit in Illinois on Tuesday after weeks of being thwarted by courts elsewhere in their efforts to block the nation’s most restrictive abortion law. The latest legal challenge came as the Biden administration waited for a federal judge in Austin to rule on a request to halt the law known as Senate Bill 8, which bans abortions in Texas once cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks after conception. A hearing was held Friday, but there was no timetable on a decision. Although courts have blocked similar measures elsewhere in U.S., the Texas law has remained in place since early September because it uniquely leaves enforcement solely up to private citizens, who are entitled to at least $10,000 in damages if they prevail in a lawsuit against abortion providers. A San Antonio doctor who admitted defying the law last month was quickly sued – not by anti-abortion advocates but by former attorneys in Illinois and Arkansas who oppose the law and are trying to force a court to weigh in. The Center for Reproductive Rights is now asking a federal court in Chicago to consolidate the lawsuits against Dr. Alan Braid and declare the law unconstitutional. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed it to remain in place through inaction.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program Clinic from the St. George Regional Hospital is offering five informational meetings this month for those affected by radiation from nuclear testing in Utah, Nevada and Colorado. The clinic is focusing on more than 60,000 people, known as Downwinders, who were exposed to radiation at testing sites during the 1950s and ’60s. A law known as the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act will expire in July 2022, according to a press release from Intermountain Healthcare. Those who qualify for RECA will be able to learn more about the compensation for which they can qualify and about starting the process through these public meetings. Qualifying cancers are leukemia; multiple myeloma; non-Hodgkin lymphomas; and primary cancers of the pharynx, small intestine, salivary gland, brain, stomach, urinary bladder, colon, thyroid, pancreas, breast, esophagus, bile ducts, liver, gallbladder, lung and ovary.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state plans to halt legislation that would change the way its criminal justice system handles 18- and 19-year-old criminal offenders because officials said some young offenders are too dangerous to be treated as juveniles. The state became the first in the U.S. last year when it passed the law known as Raise the Age, which treats 18-year-olds as juvenile offenders instead of adults. The reform would also include 19-year-old offenders, Vermont Public Radio reports. But Gov. Phil Scott’s administration said it has concerns with the law including 19-year-olds. “There was a level of dangerousness there that we do not have the expertise to manage as a juvenile system,” said Sean Brown, commissioner of the Department for Children and Families. The administration also said it wants to reform the youth offender program, which allows for people as old as 22 to go through confidential proceedings in family court, instead of the adult court system. Brown said the reform would allow an assessment to decide who is eligible for youth offender status, instead of prosecutors and judges. Washington County State’s Attorney Rory Thibault said a potential new path through the criminal justice system would allow those ages 19 to 25 to process as adults but give them the same confidentiality as in the juvenile system.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: City leaders want Pharrell Williams to bring his popular Something in the Water festival back next year, but the musician is reluctant, saying a “toxic energy” has run the city for too long, and he wishes Virginia Beach had taken a more proactive stance after a police officer fatally shot his cousin. City leaders appealed to the Grammy-winning producer to restore the festival in 2022. In 2019, the event brought $24 million to the local Hampton Roads economy. But Williams, who lived there as a child, wrote that he held the festival to ease racial tension, and he feels the city isn’t valuing his ideas for promoting “human rights for all.” “I wish the same energy I’ve felt from Virginia Beach leadership upon losing the festival would have been similarly channeled following the loss of my relative’s life,” Williams wrote in response. “I love my city, but for far too long it has been run by and with toxic energy.” Williams’ 25-year-old cousin, Donovon Lynch, was killed in March on a chaotic night during which 10 people were shot in separate incidents. Lynch’s father filed a $50 million wrongful death lawsuit in June. In its response, the city said Lynch, who was Black, pointed a gun at the officer who shot him. The officer, who also is Black, “feared for his life and the lives of other officers and citizens in the vicinity,” the city said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Northwest Carpenters Union said it reached a new contract agreement with the Associated General Contractors that would put several thousand striking carpenters in the Seattle area back on the job Wednesday pending a vote on the deal. Union members have been on strike since Sept. 16, with rotating pickets at some major projects. Leading up to the strike, union members rejected four previous contract proposals put forward by union leadership, the Seattle Times reports. Carpenters who voted “no” on previous deals said the agreements did not do enough to boost pay and benefits as the cost of living in the Seattle area skyrockets. Current carpenter wages range from $46.92 to $48.42 an hour. The last rejected offer would have increased pay by about $9.40 per hour over the course of four years, along with increases in benefits. In a statement on its website Tuesday, the union said the new deal includes a $10.02 “total package” increase over three years, retroactive pay dating back to June 1, and a 50-cent increase in the parking reimbursement in some areas of Seattle. Although a majority of union members voted to authorize the strike last month, many of 12,000 members have not walked off the job because they work at high-profile job sites governed by no-strike agreements.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPrinceton: A southern West Virginia health department stopped its needle exchange program due to strict requirements under a new state law, officials said. The Mercer County Health Department voted last month to discontinue its program, saying the new regulations are so strict that compliance is not possible, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. “Under the new law, we can’t comply,” Health Department Administrator Roger Topping told board members. He noted almost 50 requirements that had to be approved for a license to offer a harm-reduction program that includes a needle exchange. Local health officials had begun the needle exchange in 2019 in order to prevent the spread of diseases such as hepatitis C and HIV, as outbreaks have exploded in West Virginia.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A conservative legal group has threatened legal action against the University of Wisconsin-Madison, claiming it hired three mental health providers to serve only students of color. UW-Madison spokeswoman Meredith McGlone said Wednesday that the original announcement of the hires cited in the complaint – which said the new hires would “exclusively serve students of color” – was inaccurate and had been updated. “Mental health providers at University Health Services are not assigned based on a student’s race nor are they limited in which students they serve based on race,” she said. The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty raised the issue in a Wednesday letter sent to leaders at both UW-Madison and UW System, saying the jobs as originally described violate state and federal laws against racial discrimination. WILL attorney Dan Lennington cited a Sept. 9 announcement that said University Health Services had hired nine new mental health providers, three of whom “will exclusively serve students of color, joining eight providers already in this role.” The school said the new providers would bring cultural awareness to help support students of color. McGlone said students have the option to choose one of the providers with expertise in serving students of color if they wish.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state’s toll from COVID-19 has surpassed 1,000 with the addition of 45 deaths to the official tally Tuesday, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Most of the newly reported deaths occurred last month, according to the paper, which noted that the death count now exceeds the number of residents in almost half of incorporated communities across the sparsely populated state.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/19/animal-rescue-flesh-eating-bacteria-child-marriage-news-around-states/50853381/", "title": "Animal rescue, flesh-eating bacteria: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: A judicial panel convicted a judge of violating ethics rules by failing to return to work and serve without pay following her conviction in an earlier ethics case, court documents show. Jefferson County Circuit Judge Tracie Todd was given a 120-day suspension without pay in an order filed Monday following a trial that lasted five days over three months before the Alabama Court of the Judiciary. Todd was convicted last year of violating orders of an appellate court and, as punishment, ordered to work for 90 days without pay beginning last Dec. 6, news outlets reported. Rather than reporting for duty at the courthouse in Birmingham, Todd remained for most of the period in Chicago, where her husband and children live, evidence showed. Todd, who testified in her own defense, claimed she worked remotely while in Chicago and couldn’t return to Alabama because of illness and COVID-19 quarantines that restricted her from travel. The court could have permanently removed Todd, and one of her lawyers, Edward J. Ungvarsky, said the decision to only suspend her for four months represented a vindication. “Judges, lawyers, and court personnel consistently testified that Judge Todd displays the greatest of integrity, honesty, and compassion,” Ungvarsky said. The Court of the Judiciary convicted Todd in December 2021 of violating judicial ethics by disregarding decisions by higher courts and inserting her own opinions into rulings, including one that declared Alabama’s death penalty statute was unconstitutional. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and the Alabama Supreme Court overturned the decision.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Anchorage Assembly leadership is condemning remarks made by a member of the public during last week’s Assembly meeting, Alaska Public Media reports. When testifying on an ordinance about designating a former hotel as a temporary emergency shelter, a man made racist and derogatory comments about Alaska Native people, according to the news outlet. East Anchorage Assembly member Forrest Dunbar swiftly rebuked the comments. In a statement Tuesday, Assembly chair Suzanne LaFrance and vice-chair Chris Constant said they wanted to “speak out against the racist and offensive statements made by the member of the public. Unfortunately, this is not the first time racist views have been expressed in the Assembly Chambers.”\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A man convicted last month in the first of two murder cases is seeking a new trial, according to authorities. Christopher Clements was convicted Sept. 30 of first-degree murder and kidnapping in the death of 13-year-old Maribel Gonzalez. He was scheduled to be sentenced Wednesday in Pima County Superior Court, but the date has been moved to Nov. 14. Court officials also said Clements’ attorneys have filed a motion for a new trial and a motion for judgment of acquittal not withstanding the verdict. A Nov. 7 hearing is set for both motions. A judge also will hear testimony Nov. 14 for a possible change of venue for Clements’ other murder trial, scheduled for Feb. 2 involving the death of 6-year-old Isabel Celis. Clements, a 40-year-old convicted sex offender with a long criminal record, is facing life in prison when he’s sentenced in the Gonzalez case. Clements was arrested in 2018 and indicted on 22 felony counts including two counts each of first-degree murder and kidnapping in the girls’ deaths.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid that is often mixed with illegal drugs such as methamphetamine or heroin, is continuing to cause more overdoses and deaths in Fort Smith and the state. Fort Smith emergency responders have saved the lives of 66 people who overdosed on fentanyl this year with the life-saving Narcan drug that can counter the deadly effects of fentanyl and opiates. Fort Smith police report that paramedics, firefighters and others have given 194 doses of Narcan that could have resulted in deadly overdoses. Of those lives that have have been saved, 66 people were confirmed to have fentanyl in their system with an additional 31 people overdosing on unconfirmed substances and pills possibly with fentanyl.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A motorcyclist and Navy veteran who lost a leg in a 2019 chain-reaction crash started by a Navy sailor driving a military van near San Diego has won a $10.8 million settlement against the United States. Attorneys for the motorcyclist, Peter Arthur, said the settlement is one of the largest against the federal government in the San Diego area for a suit involving a vehicle collision, the San Diego Union Tribune reported. Arthur, a 49-year-old who served 20 years in the U.S. Navy, underwent multiple surgeries following the Sept. 13, 2019, crash. Arthur was thrown from his motorcycle, causing the femur, tibia and fibula in his right leg to shatter, according to his civil lawsuit. Doctors eventually had to amputate the leg above the knee. Navy sailor Michael Stanley Reynolds was driving a large passenger van on Interstate 5 when he “suddenly and without warning” swerved into the next lane to his left, causing several vehicles to crash, according to the lawsuit. Reynolds did not face criminal charges in connection with the crash. A Navy spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment by the Union-Tribune. Arthur’s civil lawsuit against the federal government alleges his injuries were “permanent, disfiguring, and disabling” and “will require extensive future medical care, life care, and vocational rehabilitation.”\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Colorado State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences recently announced a $278million upgrade and expansion of its current vet school facilities on the university’s south campus. The new veterinary health complex, which is scheduled to break ground in early 2023 and be completed in 2028, will include an expansion of more than 300,000 square feet. The complex will have a veterinary education center and primary care clinic, and there will be renovations or expansions of current facilities, including a livestock teaching hospital and an animal specialty hospital. The school’s current teaching hospital off of Drake Road and College Avenue will be remodeled to become the animal specialty hospital. All work will be done in phases, so some elements will be completed prior to 2028. “Our college ranks among the world’s top institutions in veterinary and biomedical education and research,” said Sue VandeWoude, dean of the college, in the university’s release. “Our expansion plan for the south campus … will help us continue our tradition of excellence in the academic mission of teaching; the assessment of novel methods for training clinical students; and our research and service to the community.” With the new buildings come curricula changes, too. The new facilities will give CSU what it needs to implement a new curriculum focused on educating “day one-ready” veterinarians using medical training along with training in “problem-solving, conflict resolution, decision-making and mental, physical and financial wellbeing,” according to a release from the university.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Less than a week after two police officers were killed in an ambush, U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes called for a national ban on assault weapons, while her Republican challenger, George Logan, stressed that more needs to be done to support law enforcement. The two are locked in a closely watched race for the state’s 5th Congressional District that has attracted more than $5 million in outside money. Appearing in their first televised debate, the pair was asked about a shooting that left two officers dead in Bristol, about 20 minutes away from where the debate was held. Hayes said officers like her husband, a 25-year-veteran of the Waterbury Police Department, can be outgunned. Noting that the state already has an assault weapons ban, Logan criticized Hayes for voting in favor of what he called an “anti-police bill.” He was referring to the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021, which banned chokeholds and “qualified immunity” for law enforcement while creating national standards for policing in a bid to bolster accountability. The bill was later blocked in the Senate.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: A state trooper indicted last year for a fraudulent traffic warning scheme pleaded guilty to falsifying business records and official misconduct in New Castle County Superior Court on Monday, the Delaware Department of Justice said. Cpl. Edwin Ramirez, who was stationed at Troop 9 before his suspension in May 2021, was sentenced to a year of probation and 33 hours of community service – one hour for every false e-warning he filed. He also had to surrender his Council on Police Training certifications. Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings called Ramirez’s traffic warning scheme an “abuse of power” and said it “victimized innocent motorists,” some of whom did not even know they had received an e-warning. Others weren’t even driving when the fraudulent traffic stop supposedly occurred. Ramirez was officially sentenced to two concurrent yearlong prison sentences. It was suspended for a year of probation. Delaware State Police Superintendent Colonel Melissa Zebley noted in a written statement that Ramirez is no longer employed by the statewide police department.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Metro Transit Police investigators are looking into an incident captured on video in which a woman was attacked and thrown off a bus, WUSA-TV reports. The woman said she was on the bus, which was headed to Deanwood on Monday afternoon, with her two children when a group of kids got on the bus and started cursing and acting rowdy, according to the news outlet. Things escalated and eventually turned physical when the woman asked the kids to stop cursing, according to the person who filmed the footage. At least three people can be seen grabbing the woman and pushing her out the door when the bus came to a stop, the news outlet reports.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: The state has seen an increase in cases of flesh-eating bacteria this year driven largely by a surge in the county hit hardest by Hurricane Ian. The state Department of Health reports that as of Friday there have been 65 cases of vibrio vulnificus infections and 11 deaths in Florida this year. That compares with 34 cases and 10 deaths reported during all of 2021. In Lee County, where Ian stormed ashore last month, the health department reports 29 cases this year and four deaths. Health officials didn’t give a breakdown of how many of the cases were before or after Ian struck. Lee County health officials earlier this month warned people that the post-hurricane environment – including warm, standing water – could pose a danger from the potentially deadly bacteria. “Flood waters and standing waters following a hurricane pose many risks, including infectious diseases such as vibrio vulnificus,” the county health department said in a news release Oct. 3 that urged the public to take precautions. The advisory said that people with open wounds, cuts, or scratches can be exposed to the bacteria through contact with sea water or brackish water. People with open wounds should avoid such water and seek medical care immediately if an infection is apparent.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Two former jail detainees testified that deputies of a sheriff charged with violating their civil rights kept them in restraint chairs for hours, causing them to urinate on themselves while they were bound. Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill is standing trial on federal charges that he violated the rights of seven detainees. Prosecutors say their placement in restraint chairs was unnecessary, was improperly used as punishment and caused pain and bodily injury. Hill is widely known as one of metro Atlanta’s most flamboyant lawmen. He calls himself “The Crime Fighter” and uses Batman imagery to promote himself on social media and in campaign ads. This is his second trial on criminal charges. Clayton County voters reelected Hill in 2012 while he was under indictment the first time, accused of using his office for personal gain. He beat those charges. Hill has pleaded not guilty to the civil rights charges, which his attorneys say are politically motivated. Drew Findling, one of Hill’s lawyers, cross-examined both men Tuesday about what he said where inconsistencies between their trial testimony and what they had previously told investigators.\n\nHawaii\n\nPearl Harbor: The Navy said Tuesday it was still fixing an underground water pipe that ruptured last week and interrupted the supply of water to about 93,000 people at Pearl Harbor. The bursting of the 36-inch water main has also forced the Navy to postpone plans to remove 1 gallon of fuel from three pipelines at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, the tank farm that leaked petroleum into Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year. Navy Capt. Mark Sohaney, the commander of Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, said crews were on schedule to finish fixing the broken water main in about one week. When the water main burst last Friday, officials had to divert water to the west side of the base. That increased pressure in smaller water lines there, leading to additional pipe breaks in Pearl City Peninsula and West Loch. These two smaller breaks have since been repaired. The Navy issued a boil water advisory for affected areas last Friday, and gyms and child care centers have been closed.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A legal loophole in the state that allows parents of teens to nullify child custody agreements by arranging child marriages will remain in effect, under a ruling from the state Supreme Court on Tuesday. In a split decision, the high court declined to decide whether Idaho’s child marriage law – which allows 16- and 17-year-olds to marry if one parent agrees to the union – is unconstitutional. Instead, the justices said that once a child is emancipated by marriage, the family court loses jurisdiction over custody matters. The case arose from a custody battle between a Boise woman and her ex-husband, who planned to move to Florida and wanted to take their 16-year-old daughter along. The ex-husband was accused of setting up a “sham marriage” between his daughter and another teen as a way to end the custody fight.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Democrat Gov. JB Pritzker and Republican challenger Darren Bailey traded barbs at the final gubernatorial debate Tuesday. The debate held at the WGN-TV studios featured many of the same topics as the prior debate at Illinois State University including crime, abortion and the SAFE-T Act. However, new wrinkles were added in the hourlong back and forth such as school curriculum and the possibility of a new stadium for the Chicago Bears. While questions primarily focused on the issues, both candidates landed punches with Pritzker calling Bailey a “threat to democracy” and Bailey labeling Chicago “Pritzkerville” because of crime in the city. It was the last scheduled televised debate between the candidates and possibly the last time they shared venues, giving Bailey perhaps his last chance to cut into Pritzker’s lead in the polls. Recent polling conducted by The Chicago Sun-Times/WBEZ found the Democrat with 49% of voters supporting him compared to 34% for Bailey.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A man has been convicted of reckless homicide in the fatal 2020 shooting of a young Black man during unrest sparked by outrage over George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police. Prosecutors had charged Tyler Newby, 32, with murder, but after a one-day bench trial a Marion County judge found Newby, who is white, guilty Monday of the lesser crime of reckless homicide in Dorian Murrell’s death. His sentencing was set for Nov. 10. Murrell, 18, died from a single gunshot wound to the heart after being shot in downtown Indianapolis on May 31, 2020, during violence that followed protests over the death of Floyd, a Black man. Newby’s first trial in Murrell’s killing ended in a mistrial last year after jurors failed to reach a unanimous verdict following several hours of deliberation. Newby turned himself in shortly after the shooting. He claimed self defense, saying the shooting took place after he was approached by a group of people and shoved to the ground. Newby said he saw someone standing over him and fired. Prosecutors argued that being shoved to the ground wasn’t justification to take someone’s life. Three people who had been with Murrell when he was shot have been charged in connection with the robbery and killing of Chris Beaty, a businessman and a former Indiana University football player. Beaty, 38, was fatally shot in downtown Indianapolis hours before Murrell was slain.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds now has the support of a majority of likely Iowa voters – and a sizable lead over her competitors with just over three weeks until Election Day. A Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll finds Reynolds at 52% support, holding a 17-percentage point advantage over Democrat Deidre DeJear, who has 35%. Libertarian Rick Stewart trails at 4%. Another 4% of likely voters say they are not sure for whom they would vote, 3% say they would vote for “someone else,” and 1% say they would not vote. Reynolds is holding her large lead even as more Iowans solidify their support behind one of the two major-party candidates. Reynolds also enjoyed a 17-point margin in the previous Iowa Poll in July, even though her overall support was lower in that poll, at 48%, versus 31% for DeJear. Fewer Iowans now say they’re undecided or would vote for “someone else,” but support for both Reynolds and DeJear increased equally – by 4 percentage points – since the July poll. And Reynolds maintains a significant advantage over DeJear in name recognition: Among all Iowans, more than half, 51%, still don’t know enough about DeJear to form an opinion about her, versus only 3% for Reynolds, the poll found. Reynolds also enjoys her highest approval rating since fall of 2021, at 53%.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The University of Kansas has begun the process of returning Native American remains and other sacred objects that were recently discovered in its museum collections, the university said. University officials said in a statement posted online that “culturally unidentified individual remains,” funeral objects and other sacred objects were found in Spooner Hall and Lippincott Hall Annex on the Lawrence campus. The university is verifying its inventory of Indigenous artifacts it holds across campus. A spokesperson did not respond Tuesday to questions about the number of artifacts, specifically how and when they were found, or to which tribes they belong. The announcement comes 32 years after the passage of the federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, which sets out criteria for tribal nations to reclaim human remains and other objects related to burials. Kansas Chancellor Douglas Girod initially announced the discovery in a message to the campus Sept. 20. The university had begun efforts to repatriate some items in the past, but the process was not completed, he said. The university said its repatriation efforts will include forming an advisory committee, consulting with tribal nations, auditing all university collections, securing space for the Indigenous Studies Program, supporting gathering opportunities for the university’s Native American community, and instituting repatriation policies and procedures. “The intent in sharing this announcement is to publicly apologize to Native communities and peoples, past, present, and future, and to apologize to the tribal nations across North America,” the university’s statement said.\n\nKentucky\n\nBurkesville: The state’s 26th Trail Town has been certified, and it is in Cumberland County, the Department of Parks said. “Trail Towns are ideal destinations for outdoor recreation lovers,” Parks Commissioner Russ Meyer said in a news release Tuesday. “The program helps drive local and state economies and is an ever-increasing component of the nation’s economic impact. It also brings about more healthy activities and vibrant communities and parks.” The program is designed to provide a strategic plan that communities can use to capitalize on travel opportunities, the agency said. It also works to create healthy physical activities with access to trails and recreational areas. The Burkesville Trail Town offerings feature the Cumberland River and the connection to the downtown area. The river offers boating, fishing, and paddling. Burkesville is also home to Dale Hollow Lake State Resort Park.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: An outage involving a Coast Guard marine warning system and “data gaps” in radar systems were factors in last year’s deadly capsize of an oil industry vessel during severe storms off of Louisiana’s coast, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a report issued Tuesday. Thirteen of the 19 people aboard the Seacor Power died after the offshore vessel capsized in the Gulf after leaving Port Fourchon. Known as a lift boat, the vessel had three legs that could be lowered to the sea floor, converting the ship to an offshore platform for servicing oil and gas facilities. It had been chartered by Talos Energy LLC for work on a Gulf platform when it was hit by high winds in rough seas and capsized on April 13, 2021. An NTSB preliminary report had said the Seacor Power had begun to lower its stabilizing legs and was trying to turn to face heavy winds when it flipped in the Gulf of Mexico. Six people were rescued. The NTSB said in Tuesday’s report that the captain of the Seacor Power made a “reasonable” decision to get underway the day of the disaster. But he didn’t have sufficient weather information from the lift boat company. “Additionally, due to a Coast Guard broadcasting station outage, the SEACOR Power crew did not receive a National Weather Service Special Marine Warning notifying mariners of a severe thunderstorm that was approaching,” the report said.\n\nMaine\n\nMachias: A longtime law enforcement officer and former candidate for sheriff in Washington County has been sentenced to four years in prison for drug- and gun-related charges. The case against Jeffrey Bishop, 55, unfolded with his arrest for providing opioid pills to a teenage girl last year in a high school parking lot. Prosecutors said the drugs were meant for the girl’s mother. He told the judge Monday that he was “very humble” and a “very broken man” but said he wasn’t fully satisfied with the plea agreement, the Bangor Daily News reported. He also said he was “baffled” that his police background was considered an aggravating factor when it came to his sentencing. He was arrested less than a week after he retired from the Calais Police Department last year. In his resignation letter, Bishop said he “decided to go out on top,” after a long career in law enforcement.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: Gov. Larry Hogan and other political and business leaders Tuesday toured the Hitachi Rail factory being built in Washington County. “The job creation potential and associated economic benefits are an absolute game-changer for this region and for the entire state,” the Republican governor said in remarks before the tour. “This project is further proof that the Hagerstown region is a major logistical center for transportation with unparalleled connections to the northeastern United States.” Hitachi also unveiled the final design of the $70 million factory, which will employ about 460 people and help sustain a total of 1,300 jobs in the region. The 307,000-square-foot facility is being build at the west end of Halfway Boulevard, which the county plans to extend to Greencastle Pike (Md. 63). The 41-acre site also will include an 800-foot test track. Hogan called it a “transformative project.” Construction is slated to be finished in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: A Hindu rights activist is calling on a museum to stop selling children’s plush toys representing three Hindu deities. Toys depicting Lord Krishna, Lord Ganesh and Lord Hanuman were available on the Peabody Essex Museum’s online shop last week but had been removed by Tuesday, Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, said in a statement. The deities are “greatly revered in Hinduism and were meant to be worshipped in temples or home shrines and not to be thrown around loosely on the floor, bathrooms, cars, etc.” Zed said. He also called for a formal apology from the museum. The Peabody Essex Museum halted sales of the toys while it reviewed the complaint, spokesperson Whitney Van Dyke said in an email. “These items will be back on sale shortly,” she said. The museum pointed out that the toys are widely available and are manufactured by New Jersey-based Modi Toys, founded by an Indian American family. They are intended to spark curiosity in Hindu culture and heritage, company co-founder Avani Modi Sarkar said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nMount Pleasant: A man who got out of his car after striking a deer was killed by another vehicle, authorities said. The 33-year-old Shepherd man was hit Monday when the driver of the second car swerved to avoid a crash on U.S. 127, near Mount Pleasant, investigators said. Conditions were dark and misty. The lights on Joshua Davis’ Ford Focus “had been disabled from the deer accident and were not working,” the Isabella County sheriff’s office said. The driver of the other vehicle, a 77-year-old woman from Lansing, was taken to an emergency room for an evaluation, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBloomington: The Mall of America is testing metal detectors at one entrance following two incidents of gunfire and an armed robbery within the last year. Mall spokeswoman Laura Utecht said Tuesday the trial is taking place over the next month at the mall’s north doors, although that could change as testing continues. She declined to say what shoppers should avoid trying to carry through the metal detectors, the Star Tribune reported. “With Mall of America being such a unique property, it is important to thoroughly evaluate this technology onsite to ensure its accuracy, effectiveness and efficiency,” Utecht said in a statement, adding that the mall is testing a variety of security options. The Mall of America bans guns, according to its website, but the shopping center has never had metal detectors or searched bags. The mall, which opened in 1992, is the largest in the U.S. and is a tourist destination and community gathering spot. Two gun incidents took place in August. In one, a man robbed two stores and was apprehended with a loaded rifle. About three weeks earlier, a man fired shots in the midst of a fight among four other people. There were no injuries in either case. A shooting last New Year’s Eve left two people wounded following a dispute on the mall’s third floor.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An employee of a wastewater hauling company pleaded guilty in federal court Tuesday for his part in illegally discharging industrial waste into the capital city’s sewer system. William Roberts, an employee of Partridge-Sibley Industrial Services, admitted to supervising the improper disposal of industrial waste at a commercial entity in Jackson. As a result of Roberts’s negligence, the waste was trucked and hauled to a facility that was not a legal discharge point designated to receive the waste, federal prosecutors said. “The defendant’s negligent conduct contributed to the discharge of millions of gallons of untreated industrial waste into the Jackson water system,” said Chuck Carfagno, a special agent for the Environmental Protection Agency’s criminal investigations division. Jackson’s water and sewer system has been beset by troubles dating back years. The water system was recently engulfed in a crisis that forced people in the city of 150,000 to go days without running water in late August and early September. An attorney for Roberts did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He will be sentenced on December 14, 2022.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Six students and two adults were taken to a hospital for evaluation after a carbon monoxide leak was detected Wednesday at an elementary school, officials said. The eight people taken to hospitals from Longfellow Elementary School suffered nausea and dizziness but none suffered life-threatening issues, Assistant Fire Chief Jimmy Walker said. Emergency responders went to the school after several students reporting feeling ill. Firefighters found “extremely high” levels of the lethal gas inside the building, Walker said. The level of carbon monoxide reached 2,000 parts per million, which was the maximum for monitors used by firefighters at the scene, Walker said. The cause of the leak is under investigation. Firefighters were ventilating the building but it was unclear when students could return to Longfellow. School district spokesperson Elle Moxley said the district had contractors check its heating systems last week, including at Longfellow, in anticipation of colder weather. No problems were detected, she said. Moxley said every child was checked and the district will work with the fire department before determining where Longfellow students will attend school this week.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: A suspect who is accused of leading law enforcement on a vehicle chase through two counties on Monday has been charged with five felonies in Cascade County District Court. He is being held on a $500,000 bond. Santana Ledeau is charged with two counts of robbery, two counts of assault on a peace officer and one count of criminal endangerment. Cascade County Attorney Josh Racki said on Monday that Ledeau will likely face more charges as the investigation continues. That investigation, Cascade County Sheriff Jesse Slaughter said, will be conducted by the Montana Department of Justice’s Division of Criminal Investigation due to the many agencies involved.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Officials say improperly discarded cigarettes led to a fire in a home’s garage and caused $75,000 worth of damage, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. Lincoln Fire and Rescue Capt. Nancy Crist said the fire started after the resident emptied an ashtray into a garbage can. The blaze was contained to the garage and no one was injured, according to the news outlet.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Republican Secretary of State candidate Jim Marchant is the only statewide candidate who has yet to file his campaign finance report, having missed Monday’s deadline. A central duty of the secretary of state’s office is administering elections, handling campaign finance reports and enforcing reporting deadlines for contribution and expenditure reports. The secretary of state also registers corporations and limited liability companies and represents the third highest ranking state official behind the governor and lieutenant governor. Marchant’s campaign did not immediately respond to an email request for comment Tuesday. The secretary of state’s office declined to comment. Campaign reporting deadlines normally fall on the 15th of the month for April, July, October and January. But since it fell on a Saturday this month, the deadline was moved to Monday at 5 p.m. Marchant had not filed by late afternoon Tuesday. If the report is filed one to seven days late, the candidate must pay a $25 daily fee. For eight to 15 days late, the penalty is $50 a day. And if the report is filed more than 15 days late, it is $100 a day the up to a maximum of $10,000. Marchant is among the America First Secretary of State Coalition candidates who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 election and vow to scrap early voting and vote-counting tabulators.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLondonderry: The publisher of a weekly newspaper has waived her arraignment, pleading not guilty to charges that she published advertisements for local races without properly marking them as political advertising, the state attorney general’s office said. The six misdemeanor charges allege that Debra Paul, publisher of The Londonderry Times, failed to identify the ads with “appropriate language” indicating that they were ads and saying who paid for them as required by state law, the attorney general’s office said in August after reviewing cases that go back to 2019. Paul, who’s also a member of the town council in Londonderry, said in a statement at the time, “This is clearly a case of a small business needing to defend itself against overreaching government.” A police affidavit said altogether, nearly 60 violations in the Times and a related publication were counted between 2020 and this year. Paul, who along with her husband are the only two employees at the paper, said she originally believed the state’s complaint involved advertising rates, the affidavit said. Her attorney did not return a message seeking comment.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMadison: A former federal prosecutor-turned-producer and a media production company who used Drew University as their backdrop to film a movie about a prestigious college littered with hazing and prejudice is being sued by the school, who claims they filmed and dashed without paying their bill. Executive producer Traci Bransford and her production company Meadowcrest Films and Think Global Media, a company with studios across the nation, used the Morris County private school earlier this year to film “The Choices We Make.” But when it was time to remit payment of over $130,000, Bransford apparently had plenty of excuses why the money was being delayed, according to the lawsuit filed in state Superior Court in Morris County earlier this month. The university names Think Global Media owner Nathan Scinto in the suit due to his partnership with Bransford, but Scinto’s attorney Richard Roth said Tuesday it was “aggressive lawyering” and that there is “absolutely no basis” to go after his client or his company. The facilities and services agreement, which Roth said he obtained, was with Meadowcrest Films. Roth said he plans to file a motion to remove his client from the suit if the university’s attorney does not agree to remove him prior. He also noted that he does not believe there is jurisdiction in New Jersey since his client’s company is not connected to the state. A number listed for Bransford was disconnected and there was no response to an email request for comment. No attorney is listed for her.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nWinston: Environmentalists are pushing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to do more to protect Mexican gray wolves after one of the endangered predators was found dead in southwestern New Mexico. The Western Watersheds Project is among the groups that have been critical of the agency’s management of wolves in New Mexico and Arizona, saying illegal killings continue to hamper the population. However, the Fish and Wildlife Service says there have been fewer wolves found dead this year than in previous years. The agency also pointed to a revised recovery plan for the wolf that was released in early October. The agency was under a court order to revamp the plan to address the threat of human-caused mortality as one of the ways to increase survivability for wolves in the wild. Federal officials said they could not provide any details about the circumstances of the latest death since it was an ongoing investigation. It’s rare that such investigations are ever closed. Environmentalists described the male wolf recently found dead near Winston as one of the most genetically-valuable Mexican wolves in the wild. It had been released in 2018 after being born in captivity and then cross-fostered into a wild wolf den as part of an effort to increase genetic diversity.\n\nNew York\n\nMiller Place: Authorities rescued nearly 300 rabbits, birds and other animals from a filthy home and charged a self-help book author with cruel confinement of animals, prosecutors announced. “Operation Open Cage” started Oct. 1 when investigators were contacted by animal control officers who reported a hoarding situation in the hamlet of Miller Place on Long Island, the Suffolk County district attorney’s office said. Officers wearing hazardous material suits found a total of 118 rabbits, 150 birds, 15 cats, seven tortoises, three snakes and several mice living among filth, many surrounded by their own feces and urine and covered with cockroaches, the district attorney said. The owner of the home, Karin Keyes, 51, was charged with multiple counts of cruel confinement of animals. She’s a social worker and the author of a self-published book titled “Journey Into Awareness: Reclaiming Your Life.” Information on Keyes’ attorney wasn’t available. A phone message was left at a number listed for her. Teams from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals helped the district attorney’s Biological, Environmental and Animal Safety Team and local officers in removing and transporting the animals to animal welfare organizations around New York for medical care.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Democratic legislators pleaded with the General Assembly’s Republican majority on Tuesday to consider gun safety and mental health measures, citing last week’s shootings in Raleigh that left five people dead. Democratic lawmakers, one a resident of the east Raleigh subdivision where the shooting rampage began last Thursday, said the public expects elected officials to work together to pass laws designed to make them safer. “This is an issue that transcends party. It’s an issue about our safety, the safety of our children, the safety of our state,” Senate Minority Leader Dan Blue said at a news conference. Blue has lived in the Hedingham community where the shootings occurred for over 30 years “and never felt that I would be unsafe in the community where we raised our kids until last week.” Previous Democratic requests for Republicans to permit debate and votes on gun-control measures and others to keep weapons out of the hands of people at extreme risk of becoming violent have been unsuccessful. “My question today is now the time for a discussion of gun reform, or do we have to wait yet for another mass shooting?” said Sen. Jay Chaudhuri, a Wake County Democrat. House Speaker Tim Moore, a Cleveland County Republican, said in a statement later Tuesday that lawmakers for now “should remain focused on praying for the victims’ families and supporting law enforcement rather than seizing the moment for a political debate.” “We need to allow law enforcement to complete their investigation before jumping to any conclusions about policy changes,” Moore added.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state health department stored thousands of COVID-19 vaccine doses at incorrect temperatures or without temperature data over the past two years, according to a state audit Tuesday that said some of the vaccine was administered to patients. The health department disputed the findings. Tim Wiedrich, who heads the agency’s virus response, said “no non-viable vaccine” was given to patients. In responses that accompanied the audit, the department said clerical errors or other errors of documentation erroneously suggested that expired or bad doses were given. “DoH uses redundant systems to ensure proper monitoring and distribution of vaccines prior to end of shelf life,” the agency said. A spokeswoman for the auditor’s office said it wasn’t recommending revaccinations. “We simply report on what we found,” auditor’s office spokeswoman Emily Dalzell said. “It would be up to the individual and their doctor to decide if revaccination is needed.” The state analysis said nearly 2,000 Moderna doses were stored at incorrect temperatures and were administered to patients. The audit also found that nearly 13,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccines were issued from storage with missing temperature data. The audit covered a two-year span that ended June 30. An inventory of the vaccines was conducted on Aug. 8, 2021, the audit said.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: The state Supreme Court on Tuesday removed from the bench a Cleveland municipal judge for misconduct and conducting court business “in a manner befitting a game show host,” investigators said. Judge Pinkey S. Carr was indefinitely suspended, and she agreed to undergo evaluations for her mental and physical health. The court said that Carr’s bench was littered with junk, dolls, cups and novelty items - her own attorney described it as “resembling a flea market.” She wore tank tops, T-shirts, spandex shorts and sneakers to court. And she discussed with staff and defendants a television show called “P-Valley” about a fictional Mississippi strip club. Carr joked about accepting kickbacks for lenient sentences if defendants gave her food, beverages, carpeting or storage space. She referred to her bailiff as “Miss Puddin from P-Valley.” In addition to a lack of decorum, Carr was found to have violated a long list of other rules.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt on Tuesday set a statewide election for March 7 for voters to decide whether to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, a question Democrats had hoped would be on the November ballot to help energize liberal voters. Oklahomans for Sensible Marijuana Laws gathered enough signatures to qualify the question for a statewide vote and thought the proposal would be on the ballot in November. But because it took longer than usual to count the signatures and for courts to consider legal challenges, there wasn’t enough time to print the ballots ahead of the November election. If approved by voters, the question would legalize the use of marijuana for any adult over the age of 21. Marijuana sales would be subjected to a 15% excise tax on top of the standard sales tax, and the revenue it generates would be used to help fund local municipalities, the court system, public schools, substance abuse treatment and the state’s general revenue fund. The proposal also outlines a judicial process for people to seek expungement or dismissal of prior marijuana-related convictions. Oklahoma already has one of the most robust medical marijuana programs in the country, with roughly 10% of the state’s residents having state-issued medical cards that allow them to purchase, grow and consume marijuana. Stitt said that while he supports the federal legalization of marijuana, he opposes the state question, saying the country’s patchwork of state laws on marijuana has become problematic.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: State Supreme Court Chief Justice Martha Walters said she’ll retire at the end of the year. Walters, who became the first woman to serve as chief justice of the Supreme Court in 2018, is the second justice this month to announce a retirement, giving Democrat Gov. Kate Brown two appointments to the state’s high court before she leaves office, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. “I have loved the job of advocating for our courts and the critical need for access to the services we provide,” Walters said during remarks at a judicial conference where she made the announcement. Walters’ plan to retire comes amid an uncertain political future for the state because of the November gubernatorial election. With unaffiliated candidate Betsy Johnson likely to draw votes, polls have indicated that Republican candidate Christine Drazan and Democratic Tina Kotek are locked in a tight race. By retiring, Walters has ensured Brown will name a replacement who is likely to be aligned with Walters’ jurisprudence.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Newsroom workers at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette have gone on strike demanding that the company reinstate the terms of its previous contract and return to the bargaining table. The Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh said its members began picketing Tuesday outside the newsroom on the city’s North Shore and planned to continue the action Wednesday. Guild members have been working without a contract since 2017 and Monday voted to authorize an unfair labor practice strike against the company. On Oct. 6, workers from unions that are responsible for production, distribution and advertising at the Post-Gazette walked off the job. The Post-Gazette said in a statement that it would “continue to serve the Pittsburgh community, our readers and advertisers, despite any work stoppage.” Officials said they were confident the company would prevail when the National Labor Relations Board rules on the unfair labor practice accusation. The walkout is the first major newspaper strike in the city in three decades. In 1992, WESA reports, about 600 members of a Teamsters local representing truck drivers and circulation route managers went on strike against the Pittsburgh Press, which ended up being sold and merged with the Post-Gazette.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNorth Kingstown: An orphaned bobcat found in the kitchen of a Glocester camp will soon return to the wild, said Arianna Mouradjian, director of operations at the Wildlife Clinic of Rhode Island, in North Kingstown. With an increase in the bobcat population in the state over the last two decades, the Saunderstown clinic has in recent years received several bobcats in need of its rehabilitative services, Mouradjian said. Still, she said, “Bobcats are one of those species we don’t see a lot of.” The most recent guest was rescued July 23 from Aldersgate Camp and Retreat Center in Glocester at about six weeks old. Bobcat kittens typically stay with their mothers 9 to 12 months. Through the end of summer and beginning of fall, she has lived in her own outdoor pen as the clinic staff give her time to grow big enough to fend for herself in the wild.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreer: BMW will invest $1 billion in its sprawling factory near Spartanburg, South Carolina, to start building electric vehicles and an additional $700 million to build a electric-battery plant nearby. The German automaker’s announcement Wednesday reflects its commitment to transitioning to electric-vehicle production in North America, in line with similarly ambitious plans by other major automakers. The investment in the 7-million-square-foot vehicle factory in Greer, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, would add an unspecified number of jobs to the more than 11,000 workers there. The battery plant, to be built in nearby Woodruff, will employ 300, the company said, with hiring to begin within a few years. In addition, BMW said it has signed a deal with Envision AESC of Japan to supply battery cells for a new class of at least six electric SUVs that will be built at BMW’s plant in Greer by 2030. Envision will build its new factory at an unspecified site in South Carolina. The companies wouldn’t say how many people will be hired. But the number of jobs could be significant: Battery cell plants being built by other companies will employ between 1,100 and 2,200 workers.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A monkey with the Great Plains Zoo is recovering after facing recent surgery because of an injury sustained after the animal picked up a bottle cap someone threw in its enclosure. Kai, the Japanese macaque, had surgery Tuesday, according to a social media post by the zoo. He picked up a bottle top that had been tossed into the snow monkey exhibit, and tucked it into his cheek pouch. Eventually, the bottle cap wore its way through the cheek and needed to be removed. Despite the carefulness of the zoo’s veterinary team, he will have a scar, according to the post. The zoo posted details’s about Kai’s experience as a PSA for visitors to avoid future incidents. Objects the animal care team place in exhibits as enrichment are chosen with species-specific requirements in mind, according to the post. The zoo asked visitors if they drop something in by mistake, tell a zoo employee immediately.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Early voting kicked off Wednesday for the November midterm general election. The 14-day period of voting ahead of the Nov. 8 Election Day runs Mondays through Saturdays until Thursday, Nov. 3. The ballot features Republican Gov. Bill Lee’s reelection bid against Democrat Jason Martin, four constitutional amendments, U.S. House contests and state legislative races. Additionally, Tennessee’s deadline to request an absentee ballot to vote by mail is Nov. 1. Those ballots must be returned by mail in time for the county election commission to receive it no later than the close of polls on Election Day. The deadline to register to vote in the general election has passed. Voters can get more info at GoVoteTN.gov. Tennessee heads into the election with 4.55 million registered voters, an increase of about 127,800 since December 2021, according to the Tennessee secretary of state’s office.\n\nTexas\n\nRobstown: Former President Donald Trump plans a rally in what is shaping up as competitive South Texas on Saturday, just two days before the start of early voting ahead of the Nov. 8 elections. Trump, who in May was in Houston for a gathering of the National Rifle Association and two weeks earlier was in Austin as part of his “Save America Tour,” will be at the Richard M. Borchard Regional Fairgrounds in Robstown, about 20 miles west of Corpus Christi. In an advisory, Trump said he wants to “energize voters” by reminding them of the number of Republican candidates he has endorsed who have gone on to win elections, or at least their GOP primaries. During the March primaries, Trump endorsed Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton, all of whom face competitive races from Democrats this cycle.\n\nUtah\n\nZion National Park: Thirty-three immigrants gathered beneath Zion’s iconic 1,000-foot sandstone cliffs for the park’s first-ever naturalization ceremony on Tuesday. It was an unusual setting for a ceremony typically confined to courtrooms or office space run by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service in Salt Lake City. For residents of southwestern Utah, the locale meant they could avoid the four-hour trip north. “I’m so grateful for this moment, for my family,” said St. George resident Brenda Corsi, originally from Huacho, Peru. “I know that we have an amazing future.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Supreme Court has rejected a request for bail from a man considered a person of interest in the shooting deaths of a couple in Concord, New Hampshire. In its Tuesday decision, the court unanimously rejected an appeal filed by attorneys for Logan Clegg, who was arrested last week in Vermont as a fugitive from justice from Utah. Clegg’s attorneys had argued he could not be held without bail prior to trial because the charge he is facing does not carry a potential sentence of life in prison. But the Vermont Supreme Court rejected that argument, saying that under Vermont law Clegg is not being held prior to trial, but as a fugitive from justice. When Clegg, 26, and homeless, was arrested by local police after being spotted detectives from Concord, South Burlington described him as a person of interest in an unsolved April homicide in Concord. The New Hampshire Attorney General’s office said police made contact in Vermont with a person of interest the April killings of Stephen and Djeswende Reid, but they didn’t name the person. No arrests have been made or charges filed in the killings. Clegg’s arrest on a fugitive from justice charge included a probation violation.\n\nVirginia\n\nWaynesboro: Police arrested a man over the weekend, charging him with attempted murder in Waynesboro, a press release said. Gage W. Mayne, 26, no fixed address, is facing charges of attempted second-degree murder, use of a firearm while attempting to commit murder, aggravated malicious wounding and four counts of obstruction of justice, the Waynesboro Police Department said. On Sunday morning shortly after midnight, Waynesboro officers responded to an address in the 2500 block of Village Drive. When police arrived, they encountered a 27-year-old man with what appeared to be a gunshot wound, the release said. During a preliminary investigation, officers identified Mayne as a suspect. He had already fled the scene in a vehicle. The vehicle Mayne was reportedly driving was found on the northeast side of Waynesboro. Police said Mayne was inside. He was placed into police custody without incident. Mayne is being held without bond at Middle River Regional Jail.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The air quality west of the Cascades has deteriorated again as wildfires continue to burn. The Puget Sound Clean Air Agency sent out an alert Tuesday afternoon saying the smoke around Seattle was causing unhealthy air and that people should close windows and limit time outdoors. Other areas around Puget Sound were experiencing air considered unhealthy for sensitive groups or worse, the agency said. The smoke-laden air gave the Pacific Northwest the designation of worst air quality in the U.S. on Tuesday, KGW Meteorologist Joe Raineri said. Nine fires were burning in Washington and Oregon before a red flag warning for critical fire conditions was issued over the weekend. Some new fires started while the Nakia Creek Fire in southwest Washington took off, causing much of the smoky air seen around southwest Washington and Portland, officials said. In the Pacific Northwest, relief should come Friday. “Friday through Saturday will be cooler and more seasonable and we’ll finally get that rain. I think everyone’s excited about that,” National Weather Service meteorologist Kayla Mazurkiewicz told The Seattle Times. “We should have had a couple of inches by now.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: A man has been charged in a woman’s 1993 slaying in the state, police said. Ricky Louie Woody, 59, of Billings, Montana, was charged earlier this month in the March 1993 death of Melissa Martinez in Huntington. She had a gunshot wound to the torso, lacerations to the head and died at a hospital, police said in a news release Tuesday. Witnesses initially provided information that led detectives to Woody, but there was insufficient evidence to charge him. Woody moved from Huntington to Billings within a year of Martinez’s death, the statement said. Billings detectives contacted Huntington police in May 2021 and indicated Woody told them he knew the person responsible for killing a woman known to him as “Lisa” in the early 1990s. Woody ultimately admitted he participated in her death, the statement said. Huntington detectives determined Woody was referring to the death of Martinez and interviewed him in September 2021 at a Billings jail, leading to the charges. Woody has waived extradition and will be returned to Huntington upon the resolution of the case in Montana, police said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nAshland County: A man whose 5-year-old daughter and her mother were killed in a car crash involving the state Senate’s minority leader has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the lawmaker. Brandon Fink, whose daughter Khaleesi Fink and the girl’s mother, Alyssa Ortman, were killed in the July crash, filed the lawsuit Friday in Ashland County (Wisconsin) Circuit Court, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Court documents show that the family lived in Clearfield, Pennsylvania. The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, names Democratic state Senate Minority Leader Janet Bewley, another driver and three insurance companies as defendants. Bewley, who represents a state Senate district that covers northwestern Wisconsin, pulled out of a Lake Superior beach entrance in Ashland on July 22 and into the path of a car driven by Ortman, according to police. When Ortman’s car collided with Bewley’s, it spun across Highway 2 and was hit by a vehicle driven by Jodi Munson, 45, of Washburn. Ortman’s 5-year-old daughter was pronounced dead at the crash scene. Ortman later died at a hospital, according to police. The Ashland police report, obtained by The Associated Press, says Bewley was distracted by her hands-free mobile phone at the time of the crash. The lawsuit alleges that all three drivers acted negligently. Bewley’s spokesperson, Joey Huey, said the state senator would have no comment.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: A college wrestler helped his teammate survive a grizzly mauling over the weekend by trying to wrestle the massive bear off his friend, eventually drawing a more brutal attack to himself. The men are crediting their bonds as wrestling teammates at Northwest College in Cody, Wyoming, with helping them survive the attack Saturday evening southeast of Yellowstone National Park. Brady Lowry of Cedar City, Utah, suffered a broken arm and puncture wounds in the initial attack after they surprised the bear while searching for antlers shed by elk and deer in the Shoshone National Forest. “It shook me around and I didn’t know what to do,” Lowry told KSL-TV Monday in an interview from a hospital in Billings, Montana. “I curled up in a ball and it got me a few more times.” His teammate – Kendell Cummings of Evanston, Wyoming – tried to stop the attack on Lowry by yelling, kicking and hitting the bear and pulling on its fur. Wyoming wildlife officials said they will not try to capture and relocate or kill the bear because it was a surprise attack and because there are many other bears in the area, making it difficult for them to determine which bear was involved.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/15/surfboard-proposal-duke-dorm-opossum-sky-bars-back-news-around-states/40617883/", "title": "Surfboard proposal, Duke dorm opossum: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nGadsden: Hundreds of fish have been added to a creek as part of an ongoing effort to boost tourism. The Gadsden Times reports Black Creek was restocked Tuesday with about 1,100 pounds of trout above Noccalula Falls by the Rainbow Fly Fishing Club. The group also stocked 1,000 coppernose bluegill into the watershed in late March. Republican Rep. Craig Lipscomb, of Rainbow City, is a member of the fishing club and says its members are working with the city to fill a gap for activities at the falls in the winter months. Lipscomb says trout fishing in Georgia brings in tens of millions of dollars for the state, and Gadsden would benefit even from a fraction of that.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A new FBI report says the state has the nation’s highest rate of sexual assault, and violent crime has increased. Alaska Public Media reports that the 2018 statistical analysis from the agency’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program says Alaska does not conform to a general national decline in violent crime. The annual report uses statistics from law enforcement agencies to provide an analysis of crime at the national, state and municipal levels. The report says violent crime in Alaska increased by 3% from 2017 to 2018 while falling 3% nationally. It says Alaska saw an 11% increase in the number of sexual assaults reported to law enforcement, while nationally there were 2.7% more assaults. The FBI says Alaskans reported four times more sexual assaults than the national rate.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An increase of bald eagle breeding areas this year didn’t result in more nestlings in the state. Game and Fish Department officials say there were 71 eagle nestlings during the 2019 breeding season, down from 87 hatched last year. During the department’s annual bald eagle survey, raptor biologists counted a minimum of 74 occupied breeding areas statewide – up from the 69 counted last year. But the number of eggs laid dipped from 102 last year to 97 this year. The number of birds that made their first flight fell to 63 from the 70 recorded in 2018. Arizona’s bald eagle population has flourished since 1978, when 11 pairs were counted within the state and the species was listed as endangered. There currently are an estimated 74 adult breeding pairs.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: Court records show a former lobbyist who pleaded guilty to bribing three former state lawmakers will be sentenced this month. Rusty Cranford could face up to 10 years in federal prison for bribing Sen. Jon Woods, Rep. Hank Wilkins and Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson, the nephew of Gov. Asa Hutchinson and son of former U.S. Sen. Tim Hutchinson. Cranford had hoped to increase revenue for the Missouri-based nonprofit Preferred Family HealthCare. Cranford also confessed to embezzling from the nonprofit where he worked. His attorney declined to comment. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports court records posted Tuesday show he’ll be sentenced Nov. 25. A federal grand jury in Missouri indicted Cranford on one count of conspiracy and eight counts of accepting bribes.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Rosa: A Northern California brewery owner upset with devastating fires sparked by Pacific Gas & Electric power lines is producing a beer he named “F--- PG&E,” and the brew has sparked a backlash. Steve Doty, owner of Shady Oak brewery in Santa Rosa, announced the new beer last week on a Facebook post. Doty tells SFGate he meant to draw attention to the negligence of PG&E executives and was stunned by the onslaught of critical comments by people who said they are related to utility employees. Others have attacked Shady Oak by giving it one-star reviews on Yelp and Google or calling the taproom with violent threats. Doty posted an apology to those upset by the beer name but says he is still standing by the name.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A Muslim civil rights group is protesting after an arena security guard told a woman to remove her hijab before she could enter to see her 8-year-old daughter sing the national anthem with her school choir at a Denver Nuggets basketball game. Gazella Bensreiti said Wednesday that the guard told her to “take that thing off of my head” at the Pepsi Center box office Nov. 5. Bensreiti said she explained the scarf was for religious purposes. She said the guard replied that she didn’t care. After speaking with a supervisor, the guard ushered her inside. The Council on American-Islamic Relations protested the incident. Arena owner Kroenke Sports & Entertainment called the encounter a misunderstanding and said the guard didn’t recognize that Bensreiti was wearing a hijab.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Republicans in the state Senate are unveiling an alternative transportation plan they say doesn’t rely on tolls or tax increases. Thursday’s plan from the minority party in Connecticut’s Senate comes a day after Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont pitched his 10-year, $21.3 billion initiative to Senate Democrats. While the Democrats liked projects in Lamont’s proposal, they didn’t like how it includes 14 tolls on bridges across the state. It’s unclear whether the GOP’s plan will ultimately lay the groundwork for a compromise on an issue that has vexed the state for years. Like Lamont’s plan, the 10-year, nearly $18 billion Senate Republican plan also relies on low-cost borrowing from the federal government. Instead of using toll money to pay off the loans, it banks on money from the state’s dedicated transportation fund.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state’s birding community is mourning the loss of Wilmington resident William “Bill” Stewart Jr., who died Tuesday after battling cancer, while celebrating his legacy of conservation and determination. Stewart, 67, was a well-known birder, conservationist, educator and former gymnastics coach who helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to permanently preserve nearly 2,000 acres of land for future generations of birders and Delawareans through the Delaware Bird-A-Thon program he started in 2006. He helped put the First State on the birding map by showing visitors and locals the state’s beauty and international role in shorebird migrations. The Bird-A-Thon effort has raised more than $400,000, which has helped protect properties and start a hawk watch program in northern Delaware, as well as a science education grant for researchers. A celebration of life for Stewart will be held from 1 to 4 p.m. Friday at the Delaware Nature Society’s Ashland Nature Center in Hockessin.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A landlord in the district is being forced to pay $1.1 million in rent payments to former residents who homes were plagued by pests, mold and raw sewage and violated housing and fire codes. The Washington Post reports D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine announced Wednesday that Sanford Capital LLC will pay the settlement to 155 former residents “forced to live in squalor.” Racine’s office had sued the Bethesda, Maryland-based company for violating consumer protection laws. For years, tenants struggled with unsanitary and poor conditions that left many without heat in winter months. Prosecutors said some residents also lacked working toilets, stoves or refrigerators. They say Sanford refused to fix some broken locks and didn’t maintain fire extinguishers, a move made even more dangerous by missing or broken smoke detectors.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: It’s light and bright in all the merriest of ways at Walt Disney World’s Animal Kingdom this holiday season. For the first time since the park opened in 1998, there’ll be holiday-themed entertainment and decor throughout the 500-acre park, with twinklers lining rooftops and other new seasonal touches at the park, now Central Florida’s second most popular theme park, behind Magic Kingdom. At DinoLand, Donald’s Dino-Bash, the dance party is complemented by holiday decorations chosen by Donald Duck’s pals, with all kinds of holiday merch available for sale at the gift shop. Diwali, India’s festival of lights, is celebrated over in Asia, while in Africa, African celebrations blend with Western traditions, making a stroll through Harame for food and shopping a colorful mix of tastes and treats.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A nonpartisan organization has placed a national debt clock downtown ahead of a Democratic presidential debate coming to the city. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports New York-based Peter G. Peterson Foundation placed the billboard on Ted Turner Drive between Walton and Marietta streets, near Centennial Olympic Park. The clock displays the nation’s nearly $23 trillion debt and pegs each American’s share of the number at about $68,000. CEO Michael A. Peterson says the debt issue affects everyone, not just lawmakers. He says he hopes the billboard sparks conversation on the enormous debt and ways to manage it. The foundation says the clock will remain in the city indefinitely. The Democratic debate will be Wednesday at Tyler Perry Studios in southwest Atlanta.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man was surfing with his girlfriend when – instead of hanging 10 – he knelt down on one knee on his board and proposed. Hawaii News Now reports Lauren Oiye said yes just before Chris Garth dropped the ring in the ocean. Multiple photographers nearby captured the Sunday moment. Luckily, he had a spare. Garth said he knew it could go wrong, so he used a stand-in while they were out in the water. The real ring was on shore at Queen’s Beach in Waikiki, where the two met years before.\n\nIdaho\n\nRexburg: Brigham Young University-Idaho has stopped accepting Medicaid as health insurance coverage, forcing full-time students to buy a university-backed plan. University officials say health plans could be purchased for at least $81 a month for single students and up to $678 a month for a family. Officials say a student form used to opt out of the school health plan was updated this month reflecting the change in policy. Open enrollment for Medicaid expansion began Nov. 1. State health officials say Madison County has the highest concentration of potential Medicaid expansion enrollees in the state. Students say a reason for the change has not been disclosed. Some students argue the plan is expensive and has limited coverage. The university declined multiple requests for comment.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A copy of Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address that was handwritten by the 16th president himself is going on display at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum for two weeks. In a news release, the museum says it will display the copy – one of only five surviving copies written by Lincoln – from Thursday through Dec. 2. The display coincides with the anniversary of Lincoln’s delivery of the brief speech Nov. 19, 1863, at the height of the Civil War. The document that stays in a climate-controlled space most of the time to protect it from light and humidity will be housed in the museum’s Treasures Gallery. The address that begins famously with the words: “Four score and seven years ago … ” is handwritten on plain white paper.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb isn’t promising any quick action on the call for further boosting teacher pay that thousands of educators will be making at the Statehouse next week. Teacher unions say at least 107 school districts with more than 40% of Indiana’s students will be closed Tuesday while their teachers attend the rally. Holcomb didn’t criticize school districts for closing the day of the union-organized rally, saying it was a local decision. The Republican governor said Thursday that he applauds teachers for expressing their concerns, but he’s waiting for a teacher pay commission he appointed to make recommendations by the end of next year. The rally dubbed “Red for Ed Action Day” will happen on the day legislators are gathering for organization meetings ahead of their 2020 session.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Slaughterhouse has a new home downtown. The haunted attraction, which has become a staple in Iowa, has begun moving to the old Bank of America building. To break in the new digs, set to open fully next September, Slaughterhouse will host a Krampus Krawl. The event will begin Dec. 7 with an all-age photo op before the crawl to four Full Court Press establishments. Krampus is a horned, anthropomorphic figure described as “half-goat, half-demon” in Austro-Bavarian Alpine folklore. During the Christmas season, Krampus punishes children who have misbehaved, as opposed to Santa Claus or Saint Nicholas, who rewards well-behaved children with gifts. Tickets are available online. General admission tickets include a Glow Stein for one free pour at each of the four Full Court Press stops.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The City Council has approved a public financing package worth about $35.5 million to subsidize the creation of a medical school. The Wichita Eagle reports the package approved Tuesday will help create a campus for training osteopathic physicians. Called the Kansas Health Science Center, the new school will be built in the former Finney State Office Building. Once the center of state government in Wichita, the building was abandoned in favor of leasing privately owned office space across the city. Plans also call for three other buildings to be transformed – one into student housing, another into a dining hall and culinary center, and the third into a boutique hotel. The bulk of the money for the development will come from tax abatements.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A federal court is allowing a man to personalize a license plate with the phrase “IM GOD” after a three-year legal battle over the custom engraving. Court documents show Ben Hart, a self-identified atheist, set out to get the Kentucky plate in 2016. But Hart’s request was denied by the state transportation department on the basis it violated antidiscrimination guidelines. News outlets report similar plates had been approved before, including “TRYGOD” and “NOGOD.” Kentucky’s American Civil Liberties Union and the Freedom From Religion Foundation got involved to help Hart challenge the decision. In an opinion Wednesday by a U.S. District Court in Frankfort, the judge ruled that “vanity plates” are private speech protected by the First Amendment and that the state had violated Hart’s rights by denying him the plate.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A legislative auditor says 18 cities, towns and villages may be close to reaching bankruptcy or may have the inability to provide basic services to residents in the future based on the municipalities’ most recent financial information. The Monroe News Star reports Legislative Auditor Daryl Purpera compiled a list of “fiscally distressed municipalities” and added it the auditor’s website. The municipalities range from small villages like Epps in northeastern Louisiana to larger towns like Winnsboro in central Louisiana. Purpera says the list is a way to alert the public and officials of the problems so they can be easily addressed. The list includes concerns for each municipality, including incomplete or inaccurate financial information, insufficient utility rates, debt and rural water infrastructure problems.\n\nMaine\n\nHarpswell: The town wants the Navy to protect the clam flats as part of its remediation plan for the former Brunswick Naval Air Station. The Harpswell Conservation Commission has argued the stormwater system that brings water from ponds at the former Navy base to Mare Brook and Harpswell Cove should be extended. The commission told the environmental coordinator for the closure process that the Navy has an obligation to investigate the impact of the stormwater system. The Times Record reports that an investigation of the pond system had found several heavy metals including lead, arsenic and cadmium that could potentially reach nearby clam flats. Paul Plummer, Harpswell’s harbormaster, says the Harpswell side of the Harpswell Cove alone holds $100,000 worth of shellfish.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city has reached 300 homicides in a year for the fifth year in a row. Detective Donny Moses told WBAL-AM the total reached 300 Thursday morning with the shooting deaths of a man and a woman. The Baltimore Sun reports the city is on track to see one of its most violent years on record. The city recorded 309 homicides last year and 342 the year before. Democratic Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young addressed the homicide rate at a news conference Wednesday. He said the city is working to reduce the crime rate, and leaders aren’t to blame. Young took over as mayor this spring after Democrat Catherine Pugh resigned amid investigations into her business dealings. He’s running for reelection in 2020 against a dozen challengers, some of whom criticized his comments Wednesday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSudbury: The Sky Bar, the multiflavored chocolate bar divided into four sections, is back on the market after a yearlong hiatus. The Boston Globe reports that production of the confection has resumed at a suburban gourmet shop less than a year after the owner bought rights to the brand in an online auction. The Sky Bar made its debut in 1938 but was discontinued last year when the New England Confectionery Co., also known as Necco, went out of business. Louise Mawhinney, owner of Duck Soup in Sudbury, bought the rights to the Sky Bar in January. The candy bar, divided into caramel, vanilla, peanut and fudge sections, is available in the store and online for $1.98. After the holidays, Mawhinney plans to get a wholesale license and ramp up operations.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: A museum at a former southern Michigan prison is closing at the end of December. Cell Block 7 in Jackson allows visitors to step into the cells and walk the corridors of what was once the largest walled institution in the world. The museum’s website invites people to “spend some time on the inside” during a self-guided tour. The museum opened five years ago under an agreement between the state of Michigan and the Ella Sharp Museum, also in Jackson. Ella Sharp director Diane Gutenkauf says the costs are too high. Gutenkauf says some artifacts from the prison museum will be available at the Sharp museum, including oral histories of people who worked there or were inmates. The last day at the prison museum will be Dec. 29.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The battle over the name of a popular Minneapolis lake has landed before the Minnesota Supreme Court. Justices heard arguments Wednesday on whether the state Department of Natural Resources has the authority to change the name of Lake Calhoun to its original Dakota name, Bde Maka Ska. The state Court of Appeals ruled in April that the agency overstepped its authority in January 2018 when it changed the name. It said authority to change the name rested with the Legislature under statutes governing lake and other place names. KARE-TV reports Save Lake Calhoun attorney Erick Kaardal argued the legislature enacted a policy that says lake names that have been used more than 40 years cannot be changed without lawmakers granting additional authority. It could take the court months to make a decision.\n\nMississippi\n\nRolling Fork: The state is naming a stretch of land in the south Delta in honor of the two-term governor who is leaving office in January. Officials gathered Wednesday to dedicate the Phil Bryant Wildlife Management Area. The 18,000-acre site in Warren and Issaquena counties is made up of bayous, cypress sloughs and bottomland hardwoods. Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks Director Sam Polles says the area is divided into four tracts that will offer different types of hunting, including group hunts in a primitive setting. The department worked with the Nature Conservancy and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to buy the land in 2018 from Anderson-Tully Company. Republican Bryant said during the dedication ceremony that he looks forward to bringing his grandchildren hunting on the land.\n\nMissouri\n\nJackson: A rescued puppy is attracting a lot of attention because of his resemblance to a unicorn. The nearly 10-week-old puppy, named Narwhal, has a tail-like appendage growing from his forehead. Narwhal was rescued over the weekend and sent to Mac’s Mission in Jackson, which specializes in fostering animals with special needs. Mac’s Mission founder Rochelle Steffen says Narwhal doesn’t notice the extra tail and is otherwise a happy, healthy puppy. Although it looks like a tail, Narwhal cannot wag it. Steffen says the rescue group has been flooded with requests from people wanting to adopt Narwhal since his picture hit social media. But he’ll remain at Mac’s Mission so his caretakers can be sure the tail doesn’t grow out of proportion to his face and cause him problems.\n\nMontana\n\nButte: A fish hatchery will be locked at night and begin using security cameras after vandals mutilated several fish. The Montana Standard reports the perpetrators killed about 20 rainbow trout, broke windows and tossed items into water channels at the Ennis National Fish Hatchery. The Madison County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the Oct. 27 vandalism at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service facility about 88 miles southeast of Butte. Sheriff Phil Fortner says a witness saw a yellow ATV near the hatchery, but no suspects have been identified. Hatchery Manager Ron Hopper says the fish were cut with garden hoes, ice choppers or other tools. Hopper says that for the previous 80 years, the hatchery was left unlocked for after-hours visitors.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state Transportation Department is offering to produce and emplace roadside memorials as a way to keep highways free of roadside safety hazards. The new departmental policy announced Wednesday says each sign will display the name of the person being memorialized and include one of five safety messages: “Please Drive Safely,” “Seat Belts Save Lives,” “Don’t Drink and Drive,” “Don’t Text and Drive” or “Don’t Drive Impaired.” The sign will be placed as near to the accident site as possible. Family members who have placed private memorials alongside state highways are encouraged to contact their local department offices to discuss disposition of the memorials and get information on the state installing new signs. The department’s Jeni Campana says the state-produced signs would be of a familiar design and would pose less of a safety hazard than the irregular appearance of private memorials.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Elon Musk’s Boring Co. will begin drilling an underground tunnel Friday for the Las Vegas Convention Center’s forthcoming people mover. To officially kick off the tunneling phase of the company’s first commercial project, the boring machine will be turned on 40 feet below ground. The $52.5 million underground people mover will allow convention attendees to travel the expanse of the Las Vegas Convention Center’s 200-acre campus in approximately one minute, according to officials. The transportation system will include three passenger stations that connect the convention center’s 3.2 million-square-foot space with the 1.4 million-square-foot West hall that is now under construction. Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority officials say plans call for the expansion project to be completed by January 2021.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: After facing criticism over its prior annual holiday celebrations, the town is making some tweaks, planning a “Frost Fest” without a tree-lighting ceremony or grand entrance from Santa. WMUR-TV reports in past years Durham’s held a tree-lighting ceremony. But after some concerns that the event was too focused on Christmas, a working group was formed to make changes, such as not hanging wreaths on light posts. The Frost Fest is billed as a “winter celebration” with a bonfire, cookie decorating, ice sculpting, crafts and activities. Last year, town officials were under fire for denying a menorah to be displayed next to the tree decorated annually at a local park. The officials cited vandalism concerns.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: The state has drumsticked up a plan to deal with flocks of wild turkeys that are ruffling some feathers in a Jersey Shore neighborhood. And it doesn’t involve them winding up on dinner plates in two weeks. The state Department of Environmental Protection will trap scores of turkeys that have descended on a retirement community in Toms River and relocate them. The move comes as some residents say large flocks of turkeys have invaded the area, pecking at cars – and at some people who venture too close. Others say they give the birds a wide berth and haven’t experienced any problems. Toms River residents who have run a-fowl of the birds include former New York Yankees and Mets baseball player Todd Frazier, whose SUV was covered by turkeys recently.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Federal and state officials have reached an agreement they say will strengthen their relationship as they work to improve forest conditions in the state. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and U.S. Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen signed the so-called shared stewardship agreement during a gathering Thursday in Santa Fe. The agreement has been a work in progress over years and will address issues such as wildfires, drought and invasive species. Officials say the challenges faced by land managers transcend boundaries and affect people beyond the jurisdiction of any single organization, so they have to find new ways of working together and doing business at a greater pace and scale. Under the agreement, the state and national forests plan to evaluate opportunities, threats and alternatives for risk management.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Until recently, New York City police secretly kept fingerprints of children arrested as juveniles on file permanently in a department database. It’s an illegal practice that raised alarms about the lengths the nation’s largest police force has taken to keep tabs on the city’s youth. The Legal Aid Society uncovered the years­long practice. The public defender organization pressured the police department to acknowledge it and threatened legal action to make it stop, citing a state law barring local police from stockpiling juveniles’ fingerprints. Now, after years of wrangling and resistance, the NYPD said Wednesday that it has purged all juvenile fingerprints records from the database and will no longer keep them indefinitely. The Legal Aid Society said the database contained the fingerprints of tens of thousands of New York City youths.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDurham: An opossum has illegally taken up residence in the ceiling of a Duke University dorm, where students have been complaining about being bitten by fleas. The school’s assistant vice president of student affairs, Joe Gonzalez, told reporters Wednesday that the school has yet to catch the elusive opossum about which students first complained in October. He says the creature has escaped custody partly because it appears to be splitting its time between the Few Quad dorm and somewhere else. Reports of fleas also began to surface last month, prompting the school to put students up in another dorm while they fumigated the place. Gonzalez says the opossum may have brought the fleas, but that’s unconfirmed. Irritated students are questioning why they’re dealing with such conditions at a $78,608-per-year school.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials have given an estimate on how much oil was spilled from a pipeline leak in Williams County last month. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality says an estimated 12,432 gallons of oil leaked from a pipeline operated by Hiland Crude about a mile northeast of McGregor on Oct. 17. The department says the oil leaked onto cropland. Department staff have inspected the site and say they will continue to monitor remediation.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: A traveling exhibit celebrating the service and heroism of military working dogs and the sacrifices they make during battle is being displayed at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. The exhibit titled “Canine Warriors – Courage and Sacrifice, Always Beside You” features wooden sculptures of eight Wounded Warrior Dogs and four Canine War Dogs and is now on display at the museum in Dayton. Ohio craftsman James Mellick designed the exhibit to be symbolic of the wounds suffered by military dogs in battle and to raise awareness of their needs. The exhibit also features art depicting working military dogs from the Air Force Art Program. It will remain at the museum through Jan. 31.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: District attorneys are raising concerns about a proposed new ballot measure aimed at further reducing the state’s prison population. In a statement late Tuesday, Oklahoma District Attorneys Association President Jason Hicks says one problem is that crimes like child trafficking, aggravated assault and battery, and domestic abuse aren’t technically violent crimes under state law. The proposed state question filed Tuesday would prohibit prosecutors from using previous nonviolent felony convictions to enhance prison sentences. Hicks says state prosecutors are still examining the proposal, but there are already elements that would be “detrimental, if not catastrophic, for public safety.” District Attorney Angela Marsee says ignoring past convictions of repeat offenders is “detrimental to our mission.”\n\nOregon\n\nMedford: Traditional Christmas feasts featuring Dungeness crab may not be in the cards this year, as officials have delayed the commercial crabbing season due to the small size of the crustaceans. The Mail Tribune reports the season had been set to start Dec. 1 for Oregon’s most lucrative commercial fishery, but now crabbing has been postponed until at least Dec. 16. It’s the sixth straight year the season has been delayed to allow the crabs a chance to fatten up to meet industry standards. Dungeness crabs off the coasts of Washington and California also have low meat levels in their shells, prompting similar delays in those states. Tests planned for late November or early December will determine whether commercial crabbers can start plying the Pacific beginning Dec. 16.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The FBI has begun a corruption investigation into how Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration came to issue permits for construction on a multibillion-dollar pipeline project to carry highly volatile natural gas liquids across the state. FBI agents have interviewed current or former state employees in recent weeks about the Mariner East project and the construction permits, according to three people who have direct knowledge of the agents’ line of questioning. All three spoke on condition of anonymity. The focus of the agents’ questions involves the permitting of the pipeline, whether Wolf and his administration forced environmental protection staff to approve construction permits, and whether Wolf or his administration received anything in return, those people say.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A federal judge has sided with the cities of Providence and Central Falls after they challenged the conditions of U.S. Department of Justice public safety grants they said in a lawsuit would turn local police into federal immigration agents. District Court Judge John McConnell Jr. said in a ruling Thursday that “Congress has not granted the power to impose the conditions the DOJ imposed.” The federal government, among other things, wanted cities receiving public safety grants to notify federal agents when immigrants in the country illegally are about to be released. Attorneys for the cities said in a statement that they are pleased the court “found DOJ’s attempts requiring our police departments to be agents of a federal immigration system to be unlawful.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nClemson: Bars throughout downtown in this college town are now signed on to the Angel Shot program, offering patrons a way to request help when they don’t feel safe. The simple order – “one Angel Shot, please” – is meant to be a simple solution to combat sexual violence and assault in the university’s entertainment district. An “Angel Shot” is not an actual drink. It is a code word that signals to a bartender or barback that a customer feels unsafe, typically from a potential perpetrator of sexual violence. From there, the bar’s staff will find that customer safe passage out of the bar and home. The Angel Shot program was implemented in every bar downtown this fall semester by Clemson University Student Government, which partnered with Pickens County Advocacy Center, Clemson City Police Department and Clemson’s Healthy Campus for the initiative.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A man sentenced to 90 years in prison for killing his stepfather has petitioned the court in Minnehaha County to change his name because he wants a fresh start. Thirty-five-year-old Daniel Charles was 14 when he was sent to prison in 2000 for first-degree murder in Meade County. He was accused of putting a rifle to his stepfather’s head and pulling the trigger at a ranch near Opal. He told law enforcement at the time that he didn’t know the gun was loaded. Charles’ petition says he wants to change his name to Rameus Tiberius Aryada to start a new life with an adult identity. The South Dakota Department of Corrections lists Charles’ earliest parole eligibility as March 2045.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee State Museum is collecting stories of cultural identity, immigration and migration from the public. The project called Your Story, Our Story uses everyday objects as an entry point for these personal stories. Members of the public can add their own stories and read the stories of others on the Tennessee State Museum’s website. Because the museum is currently showcasing an exhibit on Tennessee food, it is especially encouraging visitors to add images and stories of recipes, cookware, dinnerware and ingredients that carry meaning in their families. Your Story, Our Story is an initiative of the Tenement Museum in New York City and partners across the U.S. that include museums, colleges, schools, libraries and community groups.\n\nTexas\n\nRobstown: With help from Nueces County Public Libraries, county Judge Barbara Canales led local students on a “bear hunt” at Oscar O. Ortiz Park on Wednesday evening. Despite the biting cold, Canales gamely led the students down a path to read from “We’re Going on a Bear Hunt” by Michael Rosen. The county unveiled StoryWalk, a new feature at the park in which pages of picture books are displayed in wooden stands along paths so residents can read while they walk. It’s an effort to promote literacy and physical activity, and the county plans to implement StoryWalk at more parks. Canales and the kids read aloud together as the characters braved tall grass, a deep river, a forest and mud along their search for a bear. Canales called out to the students to stomp in big strides, run and tip-toe like the characters to bring the story to life.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Former Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. on Thursday announced his 2020 candidacy for the Republican nomination for the office that he held from 2005 to 2009 before leaving to serve as a U.S. ambassador. Huntsman announced his candidacy in a statement before a scheduled kickoff swing Thursday and Friday to Cedar City and St. George in southern Utah. Incumbent Republican Gov. Gary Herbert is not running for reelection, and Huntsman has said he was considering a run for governor. Huntsman served as U.S. ambassador to China in the Obama administration and as U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Trump administration. Other Republicans in the 2020 race include Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, Utah County businessman Jeff Burningham and Salt Lake County Councilwoman Aimee Winder Newton.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Five groups are sharing more than $1 million to use phosphorus recovery technologies as the state works to reduce algae-causing phosphorus runoff into Lake Champlain and other waterways. It’s part of the Vermont Phosphorus Innovation Challenge announced last year to generate creative solutions to the phosphorus pollution in the state. Officials estimate about 38% of the phosphorus load in the lake comes from agricultural land. Gov. Phil Scott said Thursday that the state received 21 applicants for the funds. The finalists include Agrilab Technologies of Enosburg Falls. The governor’s office says the group will use existing phosphorus recovery technologies, composting and drying equipment to create a series of sites for phosphorus processing in Franklin, Addison, Lamoille and Caledonia counties.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A task force has been created to come up with ways to help mitigate and prevent evictions in the city. The group will include affordable housing and social justice advocates, youth and family homelessness specialists, public housing residents and property management professionals. Mayor Levar Stoney said in a news release that the group will work with the city’s Eviction Diversion Program, which began last month to provide rental assistance, free legal help, financial counseling and supportive service referrals to residents who are facing eviction. Stoney said the task force will explore steps the city can take to better understand the root causes of evictions. A research group at Princeton University found that Richmond and four other Virginia cities have some of the highest eviction rates in the country.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A weeklong hearing will help determine whether a small American Indian tribe from the northwest corner of Washington state can once again hunt whales. The Makah Tribe conducted its last legal hunt in 1999, when its crew harpooned a gray whale from a cedar canoe. A U.S. appeals court later revoked permission for the hunts, saying the tribe needed to obtain a waiver under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The tribe has been trying to obtain the waiver since 2005, a process that has been repeatedly stalled by scientific reviews. The hearing beginning Thursday will focus on whether the tribe meets the requirements for the waiver. Animal rights groups oppose the effort. Whatever the outcome, the matter is likely to end up in federal court.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The West Virginia Board of Education will give the public 60 days to comment on a proposal on charter schools, double the normal allotted time. The board put the policy proposal up for comment Thursday. Legislation signed by Gov. Jim Justice authorizes a staggered implementation of public charter schools, limiting the state to three charters until 2023, then three more every three years after that. The legislation was part of a broader education bill that included teacher pay raises. The West Virginia Education Association and the West Virginia chapter of the American Federation of Teachers have lambasted the bill, saying it shut out teachers’ voices and violates the state Constitution.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers is asking the Republican leaders of the Legislature’s budget committee to release $3.7 million a year in funding to pay for programs designed to help homeless people. Evers sent a letter Thursday to the committee cochairs, urging them to make available the funding that has been pending for four months. Evers is seeking action now before winter sets in. He says with cold temperatures and snow across the state already, “my concern has only grown.” The funding would go toward such things as grants to help low-income people with housing costs, help fund emergency shelters and pay for support to help homeless people get into permanent housing. The Assembly passed bills to approve the funding, but they’ve stalled in the Senate.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: The National Park Service says snowy weather last month likely cut down on visitors to Yellowstone during October. The agency recorded just over 170,000 visitors during the month, a 22% decrease from October 2018. So far in 2019, the park has hosted over 3.9 million visitors, which is down 2.5% from the same period last year. Yellowstone is entering its winter season, when visits to the park are typically the lowest of the year.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/09/george-jones-mower-mural-one-bold-eagle-news-around-states/39462909/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Lawmakers have voted to place statues of Rosa Parks and Helen Keller on the grounds of the state Capitol. State senators on Tuesday voted 29-0 for the bill. The legislation now goes to Gov. Kay Ivey for her signature. The bill by Rep. Laura Hall creates a Women’s Tribute Statue Commission to fund, commission and place statues of Parks and Keller on the Capitol grounds. Parks was arrested Dec. 1, 1955, for refusing to give up her seat on a segregated Montgomery city bus to a white passenger. Her arrest helped spark the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the civil rights movement. Keller, who was both deaf and blind, became a world-famous author and activist.\n\nAlaska\n\nKodiak: Many are familiar with uninvited guests unexpectedly crashing at the house, but an eagle took such a scenario to new heights. An eagle grabbed a piece of freezer-burned halibut that someone had thrown out and apparently misjudged its climb up a cliff with the 4-pound piece of fish while likely being chased by another eagle, the Kodiak Daily Mirror reports. The wrong trajectory led the eagle to smash through a front window of Stacy Studebaker’s home Saturday. “It was so unbelievably loud. My first thought was I thought an atomic bomb had dropped and the windows were blowing out,” says Studebaker, who founded the local chapter of the Audubon Society. She and a neighbor struggled to get the raptor out of her home as it dealt mayhem. Except for some blood around the beak, the eagle didn’t appear to be injured.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Tonto National Monument, a desert park northeast of Phoenix, has been designated an International Dark Sky Park by the International Dark-Sky Association. That honor is bestowed on areas worldwide that take steps to make it easier for people to enjoy the night sky without the distractions of light pollution. Achieving this designation involves retrofitting light fixtures and bulbs, acquiring data for darkness analysis, and monitoring and interpreting the importance of preserving darkness. The state is awash in dark-sky sites, including the communities of Camp Verde, Flagstaff, Fountain Hills, Oak Creek and Sedona; Grand Canyon National Park; Kartchner Caverns State Park; Oracle State Park; Petrified Forest National Park; Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument; Parashant National Monument; Tumacacori National Historical Park; Walnut Canyon National Monument; and Wupatki National Monument.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: Local leaders are considering a measure that would prevent the city from using public money to buy disposable products made with Styrofoam. The Fayetteville City Council discussed the proposal Tuesday night but took no action. The measure would also prohibit vendors, concession stands or food trucks operating on city property from using polystyrene foam, better known as Styrofoam. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that the proposal is set to be considered again later this month. Cities and states across the nation have been busy banning or imposing fees for single-use foam and plastic products, while a wave in the opposite direction has led some states to seek prohibitions against such bans at the local level.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBeverly Hills: A fiery debate is breaking out as people at tony hair salons, gas stations and stores weigh in on whether the city of the rich and famous should become the first in the U.S. to outlaw the sale of tobacco products everywhere except a few cigar lounges. The City Council decided Tuesday night to make some changes to the proposal, such as allowing guests in Beverly Hills’ luxury hotels to acquire cigarettes through their concierge or room service. Members indicated they plan to pass the amended measure May 21. Abstainers have said yes to the idea, and the sooner the better, while smokers protested. California already outlaws smoking in workplaces, restaurants and bars. It also has one of the highest cigarette taxes in the country – nearly $3 a pack. The proposed ordinance would ban all tobacco products from grocery stores, pharmacies, hotels and gas stations.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Voters narrowly made the city the first in the nation to decriminalize psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in “magic mushrooms.” Decriminalization led by a slim 51%, according to preliminary figures on Tuesday’s election released by Denver’s Election Division. As many as 1,300 votes still remain to be counted, but that figure was not enough to swing the vote the other way, division spokesman Alton Dillard said. Final results will be released May 16, he said. Organizers say their only goal in the mushroom measure is to keep people out of jail for using or possessing the drug to cope with depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and other conditions. The initiative effectively decriminalizes use or possession of psilocybin by people 21 and older, making it the lowest enforcement priority for police and prosecutors. It does not legalize psilocybin or permit its sale by cannabis businesses.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: An effort to better market the state as a good place to live, visit and do business has cleared a key legislative hurdle. The House of Representatives on Tuesday voted 113-28 for a bill requiring the Department of Economic and Community Development to come up with a marketing strategy that includes outreach to startup businesses and entrepreneurs, a new social media photo competition highlighting Connecticut’s beauty, and a campaign highlighting successful businesses. The bill, which awaits Senate action, also suggests DECD consider updating the state’s “Still Revolutionary” logo or design a new one with the help of a middle-school design competition. Other suggestions include targeting former residents between ages 30-45 and improving print marketing in airport lounges. Some Republicans opposed the bill, arguing lawmakers should simply cut taxes to attract business.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: In an effort to better identify victims of human trafficking, hospitals across the state will start to use the same techniques, making the First State likely the first in the country to adopt a coordinated approach, health officials say. Delaware has become an attractive place for traffickers because of its place along the I-95 corridor – and critics say state officials have been slow to address the growing problem. The Delaware Healthcare Association, which represents all the hospitals in the state, announced five recommendations Wednesday that will be implemented at all hospitals within the next year: educating the entire staff about human trafficking, using a specific assessment to identify red flags, following a step-by-step process to respond to suspected trafficking, using a hospital code for trafficking victims to collect statewide data and following a memo on how best to address minors who are being trafficked.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Comedian Dave Chappelle has been chosen to receive this year’s Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. The 45-year-old Chappelle shot to international stardom through his Comedy Central program, “Chappelle’s Show,” which gleefully skewered racial stereotypes and hot-button societal issues. He later made headlines for walking away from a lucrative contract over creative differences. Chappelle attended Washington’s Duke Ellington School of the Arts, and his first hourlong comedy special was filmed in the nation’s capital. Kennedy Center President Deborah Rutter called Chappelle “a hometown hero” and said his social commentary and body of work embody Twain’s statement that “against the assault of humor, nothing can stand.” Chappelle will be presented with the award in a star-studded ceremony Oct. 29 that will be broadcast on television Jan. 6, 2020.\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville: The lovebugs that are driving Floridians crazy right now may not be good for the finish on cars, but they are good for the environment, particularly the soil, according to the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. The pesky, slow-flying insects lay their eggs in places with dying vegetation, such as thatch, which is the cut grass spit out by lawn mowers. That’s where immature lovebugs, which actually are a type of fly known scientifically as plecia nearctica, live and eat. Feeding on the dead vegetation redistributes essential nutrients back into the ground, and that benefits plants and the environment. Also known as honeymoon flies, double-headed bugs and kissing bugs, the adult insects feed on plant nectar, especially sweet clover, goldenrod and Brazilian pepper.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is seeking proposals to develop a Medicaid waiver that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp says will make health care more affordable and accessible. If approved by the federal government, the waiver would allow Georgia to expand Medicaid more conservatively than federal rules typically allow. The Department of Community Health asked six consulting firms Monday to submit proposals for waivers addressing Georgia’s Medicaid program and private health insurance. Officials are aiming to submit them to the federal government by the end of 2019. A bill that Kemp signed in March gave his office wide leeway to seek a waiver that reshapes the state’s health care system. Georgia is one of 14 states that haven’t fully expanded Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The State Department of Health has launched a new website that provides near real-time data on the air quality following last summer’s Kilauea eruption. The site is expected to serve as an online resource, particularly in the event of future volcanic eruptions, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “We listened to the concerns of residents, took action to improve our air quality monitoring system, and created a one-stop, user-friendly website. We’re much more volcano-ready than we have ever been,” says Health Director Bruce Anderson. Data for the website is pulled from air quality monitoring stations at strategic locations throughout the state. Most are on the Big Island. The state upgraded and expanded its air quality monitoring system with more than $1.5 million in federal and state funds. People can access the data via an interactive air quality map.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A planned hiking-and-biking trail connecting the popular central Idaho tourist destinations of Redfish Lake and Stanley is being challenged in federal court by the owners of Sawtooth Mountain Ranch. David Boren and Lynn Arnone filed the lawsuit last month seeking to stop a U.S. Forest Service plan to build a 4.4-mile trail for pedestrians, cyclists and horseback riders. The trail cuts across the Sawtooth Mountain Ranch. But the Sawtooth National Forest has a conservation easement deed dating to 2005 that it says allows the trail to cross the private property. The lawsuit contends the planned trail deviates from the easement and has “numerous flaws and illegalities.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Community and environmental activists are pushing for the opening of Lake Calumet on the city’s South Side to public access for recreation. Currently, a chain-link fence topped with razor wire surrounds the lake, blocking public access to hundreds of acres of natural habit. Ders Anderson of Chicago-based Openlands told the Daily Southtown in Tinley Park that Lake Calumet has long been recognized for the waterfowl, bald eagles and other bird species that roost nearby. Anderson says in addition to bird-watching, walking or bicycling on trails near the water, canoeing on the shallow lake or simply relaxing would benefit residents of Chicago and nearby suburbs. About 1,500 acres around Lake Calumet are part of the Port of Chicago, controlled by the Illinois International Port District.\n\nIndiana\n\nFranklin: Researchers at Franklin College have received a record-breaking research grant to study the behavior and management of Canada geese in the state, where the migratory bird’s population is growing along with complaints. The four-year grant from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act includes a $250,000 award that will fund Franklin College’s contribution to the study, on which the college is partnering with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and Ball State University. It is the largest research grant ever awarded to the small college about 20 miles south of Indianapolis. Indiana’s Canada goose population is estimated around 130,000, according to the DNR, but the rise in complaints involving geese in urban areas suggests that figure may actually be higher.\n\nIowa\n\nOnawa: A new report has named this small town, known for its wide main street and its claim to the invention of the Eskimo Pie, the poorest in the state. According to 24/7 Wall Street, Onawa is the only town in Iowa where more than 1 in 4 residents lives below the poverty line. The town’s 24.9% SNAP benefit recipiency rate is more than double the 11.2% rate statewide, the report says. The town with a population of 2,849 has a median household income of $31,089 (state: $56,570), a poverty rate of 25.3% (state: 12%) and a median home value of $93,500 (state: $137,200). The population is 90% white and 8% American Indian. Onawa is most widely known for staking a claim as the town with the “widest main street in America” at 150 feet wide. It’s also known as the birthplace of the Eskimo pie, a frozen treat made of ice cream encased in a chocolate coating, reportedly invented by Chris K. Nelsen in the summer of 1919.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A water park where a 10-year-old boy was decapitated isn’t hiring lifeguards, advertising or selling tickets with just weeks left before its typical Memorial Day weekend opening date, underlining speculation that it could be put up for sale. Schlitterbahn remains mum on its plans but has largely removed reference from its website about the park where Caleb Schwab was killed in 2016 when the raft he was riding on the 17-story Verruckt slide went airborne and hit a metal pole. Verruckt – German for “crazy” – never reopened and was torn down last year. Season tickets have been on sale for months for Schlitterbahn’s four Texas locations, but not the Kansas park. Speculation about a potential sale was fueled by mortgage lender EPR Properties announcing last week that Schlitterbahn is expected to pay off its approximately $190 million loan on the property soon.\n\nKentucky\n\nWalton: The high school senior who went to court over a restriction tied to chickenpox at his school has come down with the illness, his lawyer says. Christopher Wiest says Jerome Kunkel, 18, got sick last week, nearly two months after the Northern Kentucky Health Department issued its order to control an outbreak at two small parochial schools in Boone County. “He’s fine,” Wiest said. “He’s a little itchy.” In January, chickenpox broke out at Our Lady of the Sacred Heart School and Assumption Academy, its high school. The schools and church in Walton are affiliated with the Society of St. Pius X, a conservative branch of Roman Catholicism that rejects Vatican II reforms. Nearly 90% of the schools’ students have religious exemptions against vaccinations. Kunkel and his classmates did not receive the vaccine because its production involves laboratory-generated cells taken from a fetus aborted in 1966.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: A display of “magic, luck and friendship” will brighten up downtown’s Shreveport Common neighborhood this fall. The FriendsWithYou artist group will install a vivid, colorful public park called Rainbow City, including more than 35 larger-than-life, vinyl, multicolored inflatable sculptures standing up to 50 feet high. Rainbow City will be unveiled in late October in the Common Park. Various interactive and entertaining experiences are programmed at the inflatable park from Oct. 26 through Dec. 7, including a Dia de los Muertos celebratory dance party, a PJs and Pancakes breakfast, a romantic movie screening under the stars, a yoga session and more. On Oct. 26, FriendsWithYou will lead a Rainbow City Parade, featuring a new inflatable character named “Gumball,” designed by Caddo Parish student Isaiah Roberts. The fourth grader’s drawing was selected from hundreds of submissions.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s baby eel fishermen are enjoying a steady harvest and strong prices during the first season in which regulators are using new controls to stop poaching. Baby eels, called elvers, are one of the most lucrative marine resources in the U.S. on a per-pound basis, but the fishery has had problems with poaching. This year, packing and shipping of the fish is subject to more scrutiny by the Maine Marine Patrol. Fishermen are more than 90% of the way through their quota for the year, which is slightly less than 10,000 pounds. The average price is more than $2,000 per pound, which would be the third highest average on record if holds, state officials said. “For the guys who want to do the right thing and grow this fishery, they’re happy to comply,” says Jeffrey Pierce, a former state legislator who is an adviser to the Maine Elver Fishermen Association.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Police arrested seven people Wednesday as they ended a monthlong sit-in in the lobby of an administrative building at Johns Hopkins University, where a group of protesters have demonstrated against the creation of a campus police force and the institution’s contracts with the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency. City police officers and firefighters “provided assistance” shortly before 5 a.m. to reopen Garland Hall, the primary administrative building, the university announced. Protesters had chained the doors shut and blocked stairwells, defying a city fire marshal’s orders to keep the entrances and exits clear. Firefighters used an electric saw to get inside. The city’s top prosecutor swiftly dismissed the idea of prosecuting them. “No one arrested, student or community member, will be prosecuted,” said Melba Saunders, spokeswoman for State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: America’s oldest performing arts group is looking for a child who was literally wowed by a recent classical music concert. The Handel & Haydn Society had just finished its rendition of Mozart’s “Masonic Funeral” at Symphony Hall on Sunday when a youngster blurted out loudly: “WOW!” Boston classical music station WCRB-FM captured the exuberance on audio. The crowd can be heard bursting first into laughter and then into rousing applause for the child. Now the organization founded in 1815 has mounted a search for the kid it’s calling the “Wow Child” – not to reprimand him or her but to offer a chance to meet the conductor and hear the orchestra again as a guest of honor. “It was one of the most wonderful moments I’ve experienced in the concert hall,” Handel & Haydn president and CEO David Snead wrote in a letter to concertgoers asking them to share the child’s name.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A 17-foot bronze sculpture that arrived downtown last year got people talking, taking selfies and wondering what exactly it means. This week, the conversation sparked by “Waiting,” a work of art by internationally acclaimed artist Kaws, will get some fresh context, thanks to the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit. “Kaws: Alone Again,” which opens Friday and runs through Aug. 4, is a solo exhibition of work by Brooklyn-based artist Brian Donnelly, who goes by the alias Kaws. The show was organized by MOCAD’s executive director Elysia Borowy-Reeder in collaboration with the contemporary art superstar. “Riffing on specific genres of pop art, figuration, deconstruction, collage and fashion, the exhibition represents an underlying irreverence and affection for our turbulent times, as well as Kaws’ agility as an artist to appropriate and transform,” MOCAD says about the exhibition.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Mississippi River flooding in the capital this spring swamped the record for the longest period of flooding ever measured in the city. The St. Paul Pioneer Press reports that the river was above flood stage for 42 straight days, easily surpassing the 2001 record of 33 days. The National Weather Service says the river fell below flood stage last weekend. The city is continuing to assess and clean up riverside streets that were submerged before reopening them. All of the city’s flood plain parks, including boat launches, remain closed.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: The mayor is apologizing about confusion over parking meters. Oxford Mayor Robyn Tannehill says drivers will not be ticketed for parking at a malfunctioning meter. The Oxford Eagle reports the city put stickers on meters a couple of weeks ago warning people not to park at broken ones. The city’s parking director, Matt Davis, had also told the newspaper that citations would be issued. Parking meters are still fairly new on the town square in Oxford. Tannehill says the mayor and aldermen never voted to allow ticketing for vehicles parked at broken meters. She said Saturday on social media that if someone finds a broken meter, the city should tell that driver: “ ‘It’s your lucky day.’ ”\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: An Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has upheld a previous ruling on a city ordinance that prohibits women from showing their nipples and areolas in public, despite protests from local activists who argue the policy is discriminatory. The decision Monday is the latest in a four-year controversy that started when some women walked shirtless through downtown Springfield to protest the differing rules for men and women. Members of the City Council, who feared the scandalizing of children and moral degradation of the community, later passed an ordinance prohibiting women from showing their nipples in public. But the ACLU and local “Free the Nipple” activists sued, and a federal judge upheld the city’s ordinance in 2017. On Monday, a three-judge panel for the appeals court agreed with the lower court, citing at least eight cases during which courts upheld similar laws.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Law enforcement officials say they’ve managed to slow an increase in violent crime rates in the state’s most populous county that’s being driven largely by methamphetamine trafficking and abuse. U.S. Attorney Kurt Alme and Montana Attorney General Tim Fox on Wednesday announced results from the first year of an initiative targeting violent criminals in Yellowstone County. They say the number of murders, robberies and aggravated assaults increased just over 1% over the past year, after surging 26% in the prior 12-month period. Alme credited the government’s Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative for helping bring federal charges against 170 defendants in Yellowstone County for drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offenses. Alme says a similar effort in Missoula County is also showing positive results.\n\nNebraska\n\nNiobrara: People who suffered losses when the Spencer Dam failed have gotten more bad news: State law limits the liability of the dam’s owner. That owner, Nebraska Public Power District, has said the March 14 collapse was due to a combination of high Niobrara River flows and massive chunks of ice. The home of a man who lived below the dam, Kenny Angel, was swept away. His body still has not been found. The Norfolk Daily News reports that attorney David Domina addressed a gathering of homeowners, farmers and businesspeople Monday in Niobrara. He told them state law limits the district liability to $1 million per claim per occurrence and $5 million per occurrence for all claimants. He says Knox County already is listing more than $17 million in damages.\n\nNevada\n\nSparks: The Forest Service’s rejection of a proposal to drill for oil or gas in the Ruby Mountains has become official after no one complained during the 45-day objection period. Forest Supervisor Bill Dunkelberger says the agency’s decision became final Tuesday. He says the service didn’t receive a single objection after it determined the drilling wasn’t suitable for the area and selected the “no leasing” alternative in mid-March. He says that reaffirms his belief he made the right decision for future management of more than 82 square miles of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest along the mountain range in northern Nevada’s Elko County. Dunkelberger concluded any economic benefits from the drilling would be limited compared to money the natural resources contribute to the area economy through tourism, recreation and livestock grazing.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: University of New Hampshire researchers say they’ve discovered a new strain of canine distemper virus in wild animals in New Hampshire and Vermont. Over one year, pathologists diagnosed canine distemper virus infection in eight mammals: fishers, gray foxes, a skunk, a raccoon and a mink. Pathologists found all of the animals were infected with a distinct strain of the virus that had been identified only in a single raccoon in Rhode Island in 2004. They said the identification of this strain fills a gap in the general knowledge of canine distemper virus strains circulating in North America. The strain was identified by UNH pathologists in collaboration with colleagues at Cornell University, University of Georgia, Northeast Wildlife Disease Cooperative, and state Fish and Game departments.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Gov. Phil Murphy has signed four bills into law aimed at improving maternal health care, particularly for residents using Medicaid. The Democrat signed the measures Wednesday at University Hospital in Newark. The new laws were enacted just a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a study showing that pregnancy-related deaths are rising and that being black is a main risk factor. One measure provides for Medicaid to cover doulas. Another sets up a pilot program for perinatal care for those on Medicaid. The third bill bars early, elective deliveries that are not medically necessary for those on Medicaid and on the state’s health benefits plans. The final measure codifies a current practice by requiring perinatal risk assessment forms be filled out by Medicaid providers.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Vegas: A group of college students is helping redesign the Jemez Historic Site visitor center using multimedia tools. New Mexico Highlands University announced this week that 15 of its media arts students are creating floor-to-ceiling video projections of historic images and oral histories at the Native American site. The students also are adding interactive touch-screen computer tablets that focus on artifacts and an event called “Light Among the Ruins.” Supervisory archaeologist Ethan Ortega says the students used oral histories and texts written by Jemez tribal members to create the new components. The Jemez Historic Site includes the stone remains of a 500-year-old village and the San Jose church, which dates to 1622. It’s located at Jemez Springs, about 50 miles north of Albuquerque.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A new exhibit chronicling the end of one of the most turbulent decades in American history has opened to the public at the Empire State Plaza. The exhibit titled “1969” opened Wednesday at the Vietnam Memorial Gallery in the Robert Abrams Justice Building in downtown Albany. Events such as the first moon landing and Woodstock music concert occurred 50 years ago this year, while the Vietnam War raged in Southeast Asia. The exhibit includes photographs, archival footage and artifacts from the era, along with audio recordings of veterans from New York telling stories about their Vietnam experience in ’69. Nicholas Valenti, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Vietnam and is now a leader of the Vietnam Veteran chapters of New York, joined state officials at the official opening.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDurham: Duke University has received a $5 million grant to improve the 55-acre Sarah P. Duke Gardens site on campus, which attracts about 400,000 visitors each year. University President Vincent Price said in a news release that The Duke Endowment is providing the grant for the Garden Gateway Project, a fundraising campaign. The grant brings the total raised to $16 million of the $30 million goal for the project, which will revitalize the gardens’ front entrance and fund new and improved facilities and classrooms. The plan also calls for a new performance lawn and expanded indoor event hall. The Duke Endowment is a private foundation based in Charlotte. The university, the foundation and Duke Energy are separate organizations despite sharing a name.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMedora: Part of the scenic drive and some trails are being temporarily closed at Theodore Roosevelt National Park’s North Unit while prescribed fire projects are completed. Planned burns are used as a resource management tool. The National Park Service says one fire Thursday is to encompass about 4,300 acres, or nearly 7 square miles. There also will be a smaller fire covering 700 acres, or about a square mile. The scenic drive will be closed at the Caprock Coulee trailhead to the end of the road. Portions of the Achenbach and Caprock Coulee trails will be closed for visitor safety. Burning is expected be completed by the end of the day.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden is expecting two new babies this year. “Two of our giraffes are pregnant. One, Tessa, is due in June, and the other, Cece, is due in the fall,” spokeswoman Michelle Curley says. Both Tessa and Cece have given birth at the zoo before, but these will be the first giraffe calves in three years. Cece’s daughter Cora and Zoey, who was born to Jambo, made their debut in 2016. In 2014, Tessa gave birth to Nasha. Way back in 2011, Tessa gave birth to the zoo’s first baby giraffe in 26 years. According to the zoo, giraffe calves typically weigh about 125 pounds at birth and are approximately 6 feet tall.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: Fines, dues and court expenses assessed to defendants in the state have spiked since fiscal year 2007, and some criminal justice reform advocates say state and local government agencies are increasingly relying on them as an income source. Tulsa World reports that citations, fees and costs have risen 27% since 2007. State lawmakers have also imposed two administrative charges that collectively require defendants to pay an additional 25% of all fees amassed by the courts for the executive branch. Court collections have contributed to about 66% to 90% of yearly district court subsidies over that same period. Oklahomans for Criminal Justice Reform director Kris Steele says an impoverished person’s inability to pay either puts them in jail or leads to their return to crime in order to satisfy the debts.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The Legislature is considering a bill that would let farmers sue companies, such as Bayer and Syngenta, that hold patents on genetically engineered seeds if crops grown from those seeds contaminate other crops. Contamination from genetically engineered crops can make organic and conventional crops unable to be sold. GE crops also can escape their fields and become a nuisance for other farmers that is hard to eradicate. House Bill 2882 would allow landowners or tenants to seek three times actual economic damages if GE organisms, also called GMOs, are present on their land without permission. It also would allow residents to sue the corporations if GE organisms are found on land owned or occupied by a public body in the area where they live.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Three Mile Island, site of the United States’ worst nuclear power accident, will begin a planned shutdown starting June 1 now that it is clear that it will not get a financial rescue from the state, its owner said Wednesday. Exelon Corp.’s statement comes two years after the energy giant threatened to close the money-losing plant without what critics have called a bailout. The fight over Three Mile Island and Pennsylvania’s four other nuclear power plants invigorated a debate over the “zero carbon emissions” characteristics of nuclear power in the age of global warming and in one of the nation’s largest fossil fuel-producing states. Three Mile Island’s Unit 1 is licensed to operate through 2034, and shutting it down will cut its life short by 15 years. It will go offline by Sept. 30, Exelon said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: A school district has changed its policy after facing criticism for a plan to serve students who owe lunch money sun butter and jelly sandwiches instead of a hot meal. Warwick Public Schools, which serves students in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade, said Wednesday that a school subcommittee recommended students get the lunch of their choice regardless of their account balance. Chairwoman Karen Bachus clarified that under the current policy students would’ve been provided the sandwich, which is also a daily choice on the school lunch menu, vegetables, fruit and milk. The district faced pushback after announcing in a Facebook post Sunday that students who owed money on paid, free or reduced lunch accounts would be served cold sandwiches until the balance is paid starting May 13.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The state’s largest detention center is facing a serious staffing shortage, and officials are hoping to hire those looking for work. WCIV-TV reports there are about 90 vacancies currently out of nearly 400 jobs at the Al Cannon Detention Center. Deputy PJ Skipper says the job isn’t for everyone, but it’s one that has kept her coming back every day for 23 years. She says she initially planned a short two-year stint but realized working there is a calling. She says if she can make a difference with just one inmate, she’s done her job. The sheriff’s office is holding a Career Day on Saturday. Those interested should bring a driver’s license or other ID and be ready to take tests to see if they qualify for the posts.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nKeystone: Fireworks will return to Mount Rushmore National Memorial for the Fourth of July celebration in 2020. Mount Rushmore’s fireworks were discontinued after 2009 due to concerns related to the pine beetle infestation that increased fire concerns in the Black Hills National Forest. The forest has since rebounded, and advances have been made in pyrotechnic safety. Gov. Kristi Noem, federal Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and National Park Service Deputy Director P. Daniel Smith on Tuesday announced the resumption of fireworks. Noem said the agreement came after several months of meetings and discussions.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Along with classic country songs like “He Stopped Loving Her Today,” there’s a legendary tale that millions associate with George Jones – the lawn mower story. Once, during a terrible bout of binge drinking, Jones says he was left alone in his house with no booze. To stop him from driving to the liquor store, his wife had hidden all his car keys. “But she forgot about the lawn mower,” Jones wrote in his autobiography, “I Lived to Tell It All.” Jones cleaned up his act for good in 1999, living a sober life until his death in 2013, but the lawn mower legend lives on. Now, it’s been immortalized in a new mural on the side of Nashville’s Colonial Liquors, where Jones was once a frequent customer. The mural was painted by Nashville artist Shawn Catz, along with a crew of musician friends. But the cartoon design actually comes from an episode of “Tales From the Tour Bus,” an animated TV series by Mike Judge (“Beavis & Butthead,” “King of the Hill”).\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Removal of Confederate and other historical markers would need approval from voters or state lawmakers under a bill that won initial approval from the state Senate on Tuesday. The measure would take removal powers away from local governments and other public entities who have grappled with calls to remove Confederate markers that are now facing protests over the era’s racist history. The Dallas City Council voted last year to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee from a park, and the University of Texas in 2017 removed several statues of Lee and other Confederate figures. Earlier this year, Gov. Greg Abbott and other top state Republicans agreed to remove a Capitol plaque that said slavery was not the underlying cause of the Civil War.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Southern Utah University has secured funding for a new child development center, which officials say could fill a previously unmet need of on-campus child care. But city residents as a whole may also be struggling to find quality, affordable child care. Data suggests care in Cedar City isn’t just hard to come by but also expensive. Though finding affordable, quality child care is an issue many families and individuals face, SUU is focusing its services on students who are single mothers. Construction on the Sorenson Legacy Child and Family Development Center will begin in July, and it will be open for student use by August 2020. Kathy Wyatt, steering committee chair of the child care center and SUU’s first lady, says the center will double as a preschool, taking in children who are infants up to age 5.\n\nVermont\n\nDerby Line: U.S. officials have marked the completion of a new U.S.-Canada border crossing facility that is designed to smooth the flow of people and trade between the two countries while keeping the U.S. safe from terrorism and criminal organizations. The new $33 million facility at the northern end of Interstate 91 in the Vermont town of Derby Line replaces another facility that was built in 1965. High-tech improvements make the new facility more energy efficient, and it includes technological upgrades and larger spaces where officers from U.S. Customs and Border Protection can process both people and cargo. Construction began in fall 2016. The port of entry processes about 1.1 million people a year, says Christopher Averill, the regional administrator of the General Services Administration.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A police officer who cursed at a group of black middle schoolers and later promised to publicly apologize has rescinded the offer. Richmond police Chief William Smith tells The Richmond Times-Dispatch that the officer, whose name hasn’t been released, no longer feels he can handle the large setting. A March video shows the officer telling the Albert Hill students to “wait until your asses turn 18, then you’re mine.” Student Cameron Hilliard filmed the video and says someone outside her group yelled an obscenity directed at officers, launching the confrontation. The officer apologized to the students and their guardians last week and signed an agreement to publicly apologize at a school assembly. The chief says the officer is sorry for not being able to meet with the school.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee, who is seeking a path to the White House on the message of climate change, signed a measure Tuesday that makes the state the fourth in the nation to establish a mandate to provide carbon-free electricity by a targeted date. The measure was among several environmental bills that Inslee signed at a park in Seattle, surrounded by climate advocates and others. The signing of the new law comes less than a week after Inslee unveiled his first major policy proposal of his presidential campaign, in which he called for the nation’s entire electrical grid and all new vehicles and buildings to be free of carbon pollution by 2030. “We are determined to build a solar and wind and electrical system where people can access clean energy and cleaner air to breathe for our kids as long as Washington state is here,” he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The U.S. government sued nearly two dozen of Gov. Jim Justice’s coal companies Tuesday to get them to pay about $4.8 million in unpaid mine safety fines. The civil lawsuit was filed by federal prosecutors on behalf of the U.S. Department of Labor and the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Justice’s companies committed more than 2,000 federal Mine Health and Safety Act violations since May 2014 but have refused to pay the penalties despite multiple attempts by federal agencies to get the money, according to the lawsuit. “This is unacceptable, and, as indicated by this suit, we will hold them accountable,” said U.S. Attorney Thomas T. Cullen.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Assembly Republicans with prisons in their districts are complaining about Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ decision to grant temporary raises at only six institutions. Nineteen Republicans sent a letter Wednesday to Evers saying that the raises aren’t fair and that compensation should be addressed through the state budget. A state audit released last week found entry-level guard pay in Wisconsin was second-lowest among seven Midwestern states. Evers’ budget calls for spending an additional $23.8 million to create a pay progression system for prison workers. Days before the audit was released, Evers’ administration gave temporary raises of up to $5 an hour to workers at Columbia, Dodge, Green Bay, Taycheedah and Waupun correctional institutions as well as the Lincoln Hills youth prison. Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff says Evers is trying to fix problems Republicans have ignored.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: If Thomas Foulke has his way, some of the oldest domesticated crops in the world will help grow a new industry in the state. Foulke, a senior research scientist at the University of Wyoming in the Department of Agriculture and Applied Economics, is leading an effort called the Wyoming First-Grains Project, which aims to develop a niche industry around growing “first grains.” He describes those as the earliest domesticated cereal crops, among them Emmer wheat, spelt, barley and einkorn. “People were making bread from wild grains before they even domesticated it,” he said. “There was something about bread and something about wheat that was really important to early humans.” In conjunction with UW research farms in Lingle, Powell and Sheridan, the First-Grains Project produced about 20 acres of spelt and Emmer wheat last year.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/25/guitar-hotel-creepy-dolls-slime-museum-news-around-states/40414979/", "title": "Guitar hotel, creepy dolls, slime museum: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nParrish: Alabama Power Company has agreed to pay about $222,000 to settle a chemical spill and fish kill. News outlets reported the amount includes a civil penalty and compensation. The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources said more than 500 fish were found dead in March, days after about 700 gallons of flame retardant spilled into Baker Creek near the company’s coal-fired plant in Parrish. The state agency said its investigators were ordered by Alabama Power personnel to leave the plant on March 29 because they weren’t carrying official state identification. The investigators said many fish had been removed from the water when they returned a few hours later. AL.com reported Alabama Power spokesman Michael Sznajderman said the company removed some dead fish after the spill.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: A rule change will allow electronically assisted bikes anywhere that traditional bicycles are permitted in Denali National Park and Reserve. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported that the National Park Service issued the e-bike directive at the end of August. The park service said the policy aimed at expanding recreational opportunities and accessibility allows the motorized vehicles on the entire length of the Denali Park Road. An official said that beyond the 92 miles of the road, e-bikes can travel on a single trail of Denali’s front country and into the backcountry via a limited number of access points. The park service maintains a strict definition of an e-bike as a \"low-speed electric bicycle” with a motor under 750 watts, which is 1 horsepower.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale:White Castle is open for business in Arizona. The 98-year-old family run business opened Wednesday near Scottsdale, the first franchise in the state and the largest free-standing one in the world. The excitement among residents was so great that a company official estimated the wait to get the famous mini-burgers and a variety of other menu items was running about 31/ 2 hours just after 8 p.m. The 4,589-square-foot restaurant, which can accommodate more than 200 guests, has televisions, free WiFi, and a kitchen that’s entirely visible from the dining room. It also pays homage to rock musician Alice Cooper, a longtime White Castle fan and a member of its “Cravers Hall of Fame,” with a large photo of Cooper in a corner of the restaurant. The Scottsdale-area resident attended the groundbreaking of the restaurant in April and was the first to dine with his family in his namesake booth at a preopening event Sunday night. The restaurant will serve alcohol every day from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. There will be beers and wines available on tap, plus White Claw hard seltzer in mango and black cherry flavors.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home:Underage vaping took center stage at a roundtable discussion held by state Attorney General Leslie Rutledge on Monday at the Donald W. Reynolds Library. Rutledge, who is holding roundtable discussions with local leaders in all 75 counties, spent several hours in Mountain Home after holding a similar meeting earlier Monday for Marion County officials in Yellville. The attorney general also held an afternoon roundtable in Melbourne with Izard County leaders later that day. The Baxter County roundtable touched on the potential impacts of medical marijuana and the state’s involvement in several pending lawsuits filed against opioid manufacturers and distributors, but all avenues of conversation seemed to lead back to underage vaping. Vaping’s low-key nature and whimsical flavors have made the devices a popular target of abuse among children. Forty percent of Mountain Home students in grades 8 through 12 are either vaping or have tried it, Mountain Home Superintendent Dr. Jake Long said. The Attorney General’s Office has sued three online vaping retailers, Rutledge said. Her office has also mailed hundreds of warnings to other online retailers warning that it is illegal to ship tobacco into the state for sale. Parents need as much education about the devices as their children do, Rutledge said. Some devices are manufactured to resemble a more innocuous item in passing, she said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nEl Centro: The Imperial County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted unanimously to declare a local state of emergency at the Salton Sea. The measure, which will be sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom, will help officials break through 14 years of bureaucratic wrangling and red tape to get dust suppression and habitat projects underway. if the state recognizes the emergency, Newsom can appeal to the Trump administration, and work could begin immediately, rather than waiting until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other entities complete lengthy environmental permitting reviews. Federal and state disaster relief funds could also be freed up. Newsom did not respond to requests for comment. In addition to the action on the state's largest lake, supervisors said they will likely seek another emergency declaration on the badly polluted New River, which flows into the Salton Sea, in two weeks.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A giraffe has died unexpectedly at the Denver Zoo because of complications following a routine medical procedure. KCNC-TV reported the zoo announced on social media that the giraffe named “Kazi” died Tuesday. Zoo officials said the 2-year-old male arrived in Denver from the Milwaukee Zoo in September to become a companion to a female giraffe in its herd. Officials said a castration procedure was successful, but the giraffe experienced trouble breathing while recovering from anesthesia and then stopped breathing completely. The zoo said staff members tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate the animal by intubating it and performing CPR. Officials said the castration performed by the zoo’s medical staff is a common procedure used to decrease the competitive, aggressive nature of male giraffes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMiddletown: The president of Wesleyan University said the school has decided not to pursue the proposed idea of opening a college in China. President Michael Roth wrote in a campuswide email Thursday that he met with those involved in the potential venture during a trip to Asia and it became clear that their “respective goals could not be sufficiently aligned.” Roth said there also were unresolved questions around issues of academic freedom. A Chinese corporation, the Hengdian Group, had invited the private liberal arts school to consider teaming up to open a campus in China. Meetings that had been planned for next week with Wesleyan faculty and students to discuss the proposal have been canceled.\n\nDelaware\n\nTownsend:A crash Wednesday night on Del. 1 near the U.S. 13 overpass near Townsend shut down the highway during the overnight hours, an official said. The crash happened just before 9:40 p.m. and involved two tractor-trailers, said an official with the Delaware State Police. One driver sustained nonlife threatening injuries in the crash, the official said. Del. 1 was closed at exit 119 and at exit 114, according to DelDOT's website. Traffic was diverted onto U.S. 13 north, which also was closed for a time, leading to backups. Some of the debris from the wreck ended up on U.S. 13 north, affecting traffic on that road, said an official with DelDOT's Traffic Management Center. All north Del. 1 lanes were reopened at about 6:45 a.m. By 8 a.m., DelDOT tweeted that U.S. 13 was cleared.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A judge has denied an injunction request that would have blocked the District of Columbia from moving forward on its $215 million no-bid sports gambling contract. News outlets reported Judge John Campbell denied the request Friday, stating the D.C. Council didn’t act illegally in issuing the single-source contract to Intralot. Sports-betting technology developer Dylan Carragher filed an injunction last month claiming the contract violated the procurement laws. D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said through a spokesperson that his office is pleased with the decision. Carragher’s attorney, Donald Temple, said he plans to appeal. Carragher also filed a lawsuit against the District claiming the contract illegally bars him and other vendors from participating in the “potentially lucrative enterprise.” The lawsuit is pending.\n\nFlorida\n\nHollywood: It looks like a rock ‘n’ roll guitar. But this one is 450 feet tall and is a light-beam hotel that the Seminole Tribe wants to become South Florida’s latest tourist destination. The Guitar Hotel’s grand opening was Thursday on the tribe’s land in Hollywood. It’s the latest step in the Seminole Hard Rock empire, which includes naming rights on the Miami-area stadium where the 2020 Super Bowl will be played. It’s a unique addition to South Florida’s tourist landscape and no hotel is like it in the world. It has more than 600 rooms and at night, beams of light will mimic the strings of the guitar. The $1.5 billion project also has a refurbished venue for concerts and other events, starting with Maroon 5 on Friday.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCordele: A Canadian company said it will lay off 45 workers at a south Georgia wood panel mill as it cuts production. Toronto-based Norbord said it will stop making oriented strand board on one of its two lines at its Cordele plant. The company announced Monday that the cutback will take place in mid-November. Norbord said it’s cutting back because demand is poor, especially in the southeast. The line that’s being closed had been running on a reduced schedule. It will be closed indefinitely, while a second line continues to run a full schedule. The cutback represents 6% of Norbord’s North American capacity. Norbord said it will write down the value of the Cordele mill by $10 million before taxes as part of its third-quarter earnings.\n\nHawaii\n\nLahaina: Roads and an airport have reopened as firefighters continue to fight a west Maui brush fire. Maui officials said the fire above Kahana ridge was 45% contained Wednesday. About 1.5-square miles burned, threatening some homes, prompting evacuations, and forcing the closure of the Kapalua Airport. The Hawaii Department of Transportation said the small airport reopened Wednesday morning for normal operations. Maui County spokesman Brian Perry said officials are checking to assess damage and looking into unconfirmed reports of burned or singed roofs. County officials said about six people checked into a shelter at the Lahaina Civic Center on Tuesday, but no one stayed overnight. The shelter was closed Wednesday. There are no reports of injuries.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A black bear cub that was illegally taken from the wild by a Boise man is heading to a rehabilitation sanctuary. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game said a “well-meaning” Boise hunter took the cub last Saturday. The department confiscated the bear two days later, and State Veterinarian Dr. Mark Drew has treated the animal for an abscess, infection, abrasions and dehydration. Fish and Game regional supervisor Brad Compton said the bear was not habituated to humans, and it will likely continue to try to avoid humans in the wild. The bear will spend the winter at the Snowdon Wildlife Sanctuary near McCall and will likely be released to the wild next spring, when it is 1, Compton said. Fish and Game spokesperson Evin Oneale said the man who took the bear from the wild thought it was sick and wanted to help it but had no veterinarian training and no authorization from the state. The man kept the bear in a dog kennel in his garage until it was confiscated. Oneale said people who see an injured wild animal can take note of where the animal was seen and then report that location to the state.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s police oversight agency has recommended only a 30-day suspension for an officer who fatally shot a fleeing teenager in 2011, concluding it missed the five-year deadline for firing him under state law. The Civilian Office of Police Accountability also recommended Macario Chavez be put on desk duty indefinitely. A police spokesman said Tuesday that Chavez already has served the suspension. The office found Chavez showed a “reckless disregard for human life” as he fired 31 times at Calvin Cross with a high-powered rifle. Two other officers fired 14 times at the 19-year-old. The officers reported Cross shot at them. However, records show the only gun found at the scene was so clogged with grime it could not fire. Chavez and the others were initially cleared of wrongdoing in 2013.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Authorities said the man and woman who died when their SUV plunged from the fourth floor of a downtown parking garage came from Illinois. The Marion County Coroner’s Office on Thursday identified the couple as 70-year-old Iristeen Hunt and 73-year-old Charles Hunt of University Park, Illinois. The car plowed through the wall of the Market Square Center Garage just before 10 a.m. Wednesday, tumbling four floors before landing on its roof in an alley behind the City Market. The couple died at the scene and a man who witnessed the plunge was treated for shock. Fire Department Battalion Chief Rita Reith has said the woman was driving.\n\nIowa\n\nMason City: Members of a veterans group will dedicate monuments depicting male and female soldiers. The Globe Gazette reported the monuments will be dedicated Saturday at the All Vets Center. They have been added to a display that includes a Howitzer and flagpole. The monuments were obtained and repaired after a fundraising effort that included rummage sales and dances. One statue shows a female soldier who carries her helmet and has an M-4 rifle slung over her shoulder. The other shows an infantryman from the Vietnam War.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A wayward squirrel is being blamed for a power outage in Topeka. KSNT-TV reported that about 3,000 Evergy customers were without electricity when the power went out around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday. Crews had the lights back on within about a half-hour. The electric company said a squirrel made contact with equipment, causing the outage. Among those impacted were businesses, Topeka West High School and several traffic lights.\n\nKentucky\n\nPaducah: The McCracken County Humane Society is struggling after taking in 65 dogs in two days. The Paducah Sun reported it started on Sunday with the report of a pit bull puppy in bad shape. The puppy later died, and on Monday 10 dogs, most of them pit bulls, were removed from the residence. One of them immediately gave birth to a litter of 11. Then on Tuesday, McCracken deputies learned that jail inmate Jennifer Campbell had dogs in her home that had not been taken care of since her arrest the previous Friday. Campbell would not consent to an animal welfare check, so they had to obtain a search warrant. Animal Control found more than 40 Chihuahuas in the home in extremely poor conditions, including some that had died. Forty-four Chihuahuas made it to the shelter on Tuesday. Because all 65 dogs are part of court cases, the shelter cannot immediately put them up for adoption. Vannerson said the situation is difficult. Before this week, the largest number of animals the shelter had taken in at once was 27 cats a few years ago. Despite the difficulty of suddenly caring for so many animals, Vannerson has been heartened by the public’s support. The phones are constantly ringing with people wanting to know when the dogs can be adopted. Donations of food and money have come in, too. Vannerson said she was moved to tears when one man showed up with a $1,000 donation Wednesday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Louisiana’s farmers could start growing industrial hemp by the spring if federal and state agriculture agencies keep their regulatory work on track, Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain said. Strain outlined to state lawmakers Monday the regulations his department has drafted for industrial hemp production, rules that will be submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval. Lawmakers earlier this year agreed to legalize hemp production in Louisiana, saying that would help farmers diversify their crops. The law is in line with what’s allowed under the 2018 federal Farm Bill, which removed hemp from the list of federally controlled substances. Hemp is a member of the cannabis plant family but contains only traces of the THC chemical compound that causes a high for marijuana users. Hemp is used for textiles, fuels, rope and chemical absorbents, among other products. The state law required a hemp growing and production regulatory plan to be submitted to the USDA by Nov. 1. Strain estimated 100 to 200 farmers will plant hemp across as many as 80,000 acres of Louisiana soil in 2020. He warned that the expense from cultivating the plant and the strict regulations could keep some smaller farming operations from producing the plant. Growing hemp for individual use is prohibited.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The University of Maine is getting more federal funding for a floating platform to support up to a 12-megawatt wind turbine. The grant, announced Wednesday, is expected to be worth about $5 million for UMaine’s Advanced Structures and Composites Center. The center already has developed smaller floating hulls to support 6-megawatt turbines to be placed off the coast of Monhegan Island. That pilot project, dubbed Aqua Ventus, is viewed as a major test for floating wind turbine technology. The new funding announcement was made Wednesday during the American Wind Energy Association Offshore WINDPOWER Conference in Boston. Offshore wind power projects stalled under former Republican Gov. Paul LePage. But Democratic Gov. Janet Mills directed the Maine Public Utilities Commission to approve a contract to get the project back on track.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: After a 10-month investigation, Cameron Coke of Towson, Maryland, has been charged with theft and fourth-degree burglary in connection with the taking of a baby Jesus statue from an Ocean City church's outdoor nativity, according to police. The theft occurred just after 6 a.m. on Dec. 31, 2018, according to a January Facebook post from the police department. In that post, police also released images of the suspects and their vehicle, which had been captured on surveillance cameras. Charging documents show the break in the case came when a tip was called into the police department after a local news station aired a story about the theft featuring those surveillance images. The police department posted an update on the investigation to Facebook on Wednesday announcing that Coke, the main suspect in the theft, had been identified and charged.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nFramingham: The North Hall dormitory at Framingham State University will soon be renamed in honor of abolitionist and journalist Mary Miles Bibb, the school’s first African American woman to graduate. In 1843, Bibb graduated from the Lexington Normal School, which later became Framingham State University. She then became one of the first African American female teachers in the country. The university’s board of trustees agreed to the plan after receiving a petition from students in 2018. Details of the official renaming ceremony have not been confirmed.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:A 100-year-old World War II veteran from Michigan has been honored for guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Jack Eaton is the oldest living sentinel of the monument, which he protected from January 1938 to December 1939. Eaton viewed his plaque for the first time at the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia on Wednesday. The Detroit Free Press reports that Eaton said he has wanted the plaque for a while. His stepdaughter, Brenda Warburton, said Eaton got a little choked up on seeing the plaque, noting that’s unusual for him. The Burton resident realized he didn’t have a plaque after touring the guard barracks of the tomb in 2017, where plaques of every living guard are displayed. A plaque was erected after he inquired about it.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRochester: The History Center of Olmsted County has posted photos and videos of its miniature dolls on social media, taking votes for the most nightmarish one. Curator Dan Nowakowski told Minnesota Public Radio that for a lot of the dolls, the freakiness is all in the eyes. Some have movable eyelids that snap open when you lift the dolls up. The paint has chipped off the face of another contender, leaving it looking like a mummy. Nowakowski said the dolls weren’t intended to be frightening when they were made, but damage from play and the passage of time have turned them creepy. The winner and runner-up will be displayed over Halloween.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: A retired police chief appointed to act as the temporary city manager of Pascagoula has announced he’s leaving the role after less than a month. The Sun Herald reported Kenny Johnson announced his Oct. 31 retirement less than two weeks after city leaders appointed him to the role. The former Pascagoula police chief said he notified officials about his impending retirement Monday after meeting with the state public employee’s retirement system. Councilwoman-at-large Jennifer Colmer said the city planned to hire a new manager by Oct. 30, so Johnson’s announcement wasn’t surprising. Johnson was appointed after the city’s attorney and manager, Ryan Frederic, abruptly announced he was going on medical leave. Officials have since separated the roles, so Johnson would only serve as the attorney upon his return.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The St. Louis Zoo said that Rani, a 23-year-old Asian elephant, is pregnant and due to give birth next summer. The zoo’s bull elephant, 26-year-old Raja, is the father. Raja is among the most popular animals at the zoo. He was the first Asian elephant born there, in 1992. The calf will be his fifth offspring. The zoo said elephant pregnancy lasts about 22 months. A newborn calf weighs up to 350 pounds. The gender of the calf is unknown.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down a Missoula city ordinance requiring background checks on all gun sales in the city, ruling that it goes against a state law prohibiting restrictions on gun sales. The five-justice panel ruled unanimously that the ordinance, the first of its kind in Montana, is barred by a law that says local governments are not allowed to exercise any power that “affects the right to keep or bear arms.” The decision overturns a ruling by a district judge who said the ordinance complies with another section of state law that allows local governments to enact rules to keep felons, the mentally ill, minors and people illegally in the U.S. from possessing weapons. The high court ruled the Missoula ordinance went too far by subjecting every private gun sale to a background check. Federal law requires background checks on gun purchases from licensed sellers, such as gun stores, but not on private sales. The ruling upholds a previous opinion by Attorney General Tim Fox, who said in a statement that he was confident his position would be vindicated.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The name of the top candidate for the University of Nebraska system presidency could be publicly disclosed at the Board of Regents’ meeting Friday. The Board of Regents agenda was amended Tuesday to include what the notice said is the “potential designation of a priority candidate” for the position. Hank Bounds announced in March that he was leaving the post and state and has since become a professor at the University of South Alabama. The system president is its overall administrative leader, and the chancellors oversee the operations of the campuses in Kearney, Lincoln and Omaha. A 23-member committee worked with a search firm to identify candidates and forward the names of some to the regents. If regents were to vote for a priority candidate Friday, he or she would then undergo 30 days of vetting by students, faculty, staff and others before the regents could make a final decision.\n\nNevada\n\nBoulder City: State wildlife officials have ordered a quarantine on a Boulder City horse facility after multiple horses contracted a contagious virus before being euthanized. The state Department of Agriculture said lab results confirmed animals at the Horseman’s Association Property tested positive for horse herpes. Department officials said the quarantine is a precautionary measure to avoid the spread of Equine Herpesvirus-1 among the 500 horses on the southwest Nevada property. Officials said the virus is a highly transferrable disease between horses, or between horses and humans. Horse owners said signs of the disease appear to be fever, cough or runny nose.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLandaff: A group of friends, family and fellow soldiers recently gathered at the Landaff Cemetery to mark the 15th anniversary of the death of Army Spc. Alan Burgess. Serving with the New Hampshire National Guard in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, Burgess was killed when a car bomb detonated near his vehicle on Oct. 15, 2004. He was 24. More than two dozen showed up, many of them soldiers who served alongside Burgess. They spent hours recalling his humor and his humanity, trading stories that often ended with laughter. Serving in the 2nd Battalion, 197th Field Artillery Forward, Burgess’ unit was often used for transport assignments, and as a joke, he bought and mounted a taxi light for the top of his Humvee. The fare for his ‘taxi’ was a bottle of nonalcoholic beer.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic Highlands: A man said he and his hiking companion were rescued after they fell off a cliff because the impact spurred his smartwatch to call 911. James Prudenciano and Paige Paruso were hiking in Hartshorne Woods Park last week when they got lost in the woods. They eventually tumbled down a steep cliff as darkness set in. Prudenciano had bought the watch two days earlier and chose to activate the “fall detection” feature, which alerts the owner’s emergency contacts and calls 911 when it detects that its user has fallen. Rescuers were able to reach the couple, who were taken ashore by a boat. They were treated at a hospital for undisclosed injuries.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRoswell: City officials have announced plans to sell a $150,000 property the city acquired from the federal government. The Roswell Daily Record reported Wednesday that the U.S. Department of Interior built the industrial site in 1962 or 1963 and used it as a saline water testing plant before its 1984 closure. Roswell Mayor Dennis Kintigh said the city decided to sell because of maintenance issues and intentions to subject the land to property tax. Officials said the site is leased by Wisconsin-based international manufacturer A.O. Smith for about $9,000 a year. The City Council approved a request to search for bidders Oct. 10. Bids are due by Nov. 26. Officials said a completed sale is expected by March if a bidder comes forward and city and state officials approve the contract.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: An immersive, 8,000-square-foot museum dedicated to all things slime opens Friday for a nearly six-month celebration complete with a sticky barefoot lake walk and DIY bar. There’s also the opportunity to don goggles and a poncho and get doused in the stuff that has a big following but a questionable impact when it comes to disposal and the environment. The brainchild of Karen Robinovitz, Sara Schiller and Toni Ko, the so-called Sloomoo Institute is the latest in Instagram-friendly pop-ups to hit New York and then travel to other locales. The idea, the co-founders said during a preopening tour, is simple: To spread slime’s powers of rejuvenation and relaxation. Technically speaking, slime is a cross-linked polymer scientifically known as a “non-Newtonian fluid.” Its history stretches back to the 1830s, when polymer science originated and Nathaniel Hayward and Friedrich Ludersdorf concluded that adding sulfur to raw, natural rubber prevented it from getting sticky.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A state House panel supports a $660 million fix for cash-flow problems at the Department of Transportation attributed to disaster recovery spending and litigation losses. But the chamber’s top budget-writers aren’t expected to support it. WRAL-TV reported the measure approved on Wednesday by a transportation spending subcommittee would give $360 million to DOT to cover legal awards after courts struck down a law that previously kept land costs for highways low. The state government also would loan $300 million to DOT, with full repayment by 2025 through federal disaster reimbursements. Low cash levels forced DOT this year to suspend hundreds of projects. House budget chairman Rep. Chuck McGrady opposes the measure – especially the cash advance – and expects colleagues will, too. McGrady said a separate proposal is being assembled.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum has announced his plans to seek reelection in 2020. In a video announcement posted on YouTube on Thursday, Burgum highlights accomplishments since he and Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford took office three years ago. Burgum said they are “reinventing government with modern business efficiencies” and have “turned a budget shortfall into a budget surplus and cut government spending without raising taxes.” The 63-year-old Republican said North Dakota is headed in the right direction with increased employment and higher wages. Burgum defeated Democrat Marvin Nelson and Libertarian Marty Riske in the November 2016 gubernatorial election.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Legislation dubbed Tyler’s Law would place a professional engineer on the Ohio Advisory Council on Amusement Ride Safety. The panel makes recommendations to the state’s agriculture director about safety matters, including monitoring and inspecting rides. The measure is named for Tyler Jarrell, an 18-year-old Marine recruit killed when the “Fireball” ride malfunctioned and broke apart on the opening day of the 2017 Ohio State Fair. Seven others were injured in the accident later blamed on excessive corrosion in a steel support beam. The bill heads to Republican Gov. Mike DeWine after receiving unanimous approval Wednesday in the Senate. It cleared the House in June.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: One of the nation’s top rating agencies is upgrading the state’s economic outlook from “stable” to “positive” in large part because of the 2018 passage of tax hikes that have resulted in budget surpluses and increased reserves. Moody’s Investors Service announced Wednesday it was also affirming the state’s Aa2 rating, the agency’s third-highest rating. The agency’s positive outlook indicates it expects strong fiscal management and a commitment to increasing reserves. The agency also cited the state’s relatively low state debt and pension burden. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt has said he wants the state to set aside $2 billion in reserves to help better prepare the state for its next economic downturn.\n\nOregon\n\nNewport: An invasion of purple sea urchins that destroyed underwater kelp forests off the California coast is now hitting Oregon. Numbers released by Oregon’s wildlife agency show 350 million of the urchins on one reef in southern Oregon alone – a 10,450% increase since 2014. The purple urchins have devoured all the kelp, killing off important fisheries for red abalone and red sea urchins in California and Oregon. A coalition of scientists, ecologists and private business interests is trying to harvest the unwanted urchins and transfer them to sea urchin “ranches.” The urchins are fattened up at the ranches for sale to a global seafood market.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nJonestown: The Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said it rescued 83 cats and 10 dogs from unsafe conditions at a self-proclaimed rescue facility. WHTM-TV reported that the animals were removed from the Jonestown property on Wednesday. Authorities say many of the cats were suffering from respiratory infections and eye conditions and several dogs were very thin. Most of the animals were living in enclosures with feces and urine that had accumulated over several days. Five dead cats were found in one enclosure. One cat’s remains could not be removed because it had decomposed so much. All the rescued animals were given to the SPCA. They are expected to be up for adoption once they receive medical treatment. An investigation is ongoing and charges are pending.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: Construction of an artificial reef off the coast of East Providence is expected to take place this week. The Providence Journal reported that the reef will be installed off Sabin Point. The reef is intended to become a habitat for fish that live in Narragansett Bay, including tautog, black sea bass and scup. It will be made of precast concrete balls with holes in them. The $47,000 project is being funded through the federal Sports Fish Restoration Program and a grant from the Rhode Island Saltwater Anglers Association. The Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council approved the project in June.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: An Atlanta-based timber company is ending production at two rural South Carolina wood product plants that employ 240 workers. The Post and Courier reported Tuesday that Georgia-Pacific said declining conditions in the U.S. home building industry are forcing it to idle its McCormick and Allendale sites by the year’s end. The company said all employees will be let go, except for crews needed to manage inventory and maintain the properties. In a written statement obtained by the newspaper, the company said it will continue production for up to 60 days, after which the sites will be closed but maintained in case market conditions improve enough to resume production. The company said it will hold employment fairs to help workers find new jobs. The displaced workers will be eligible for unemployment benefits.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nHot Springs: Some bison cows at Wind Cave National Park are being monitored with collars that communicate with satellites. The Rapid City Journal reported the collars will be affixed on 10 bison during roundups, which occurs every other year. Greg Schoreder, the park’s chief of Resource Management, said the collars will allow park officials to see how the bison use the park’s resources, specifically water resources. It could help officials determine if more watering areas are needed to prevent overuse and damage of existing water supply. Schroeder said collars will transmit daily from four locations and will be sent to park officials’ emails. The nonprofit organization Black Hills Parks & Forests Association raised money for the collars. The park hopes to show the bison’s movements to guests in the visitor center.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:Nashville’s sheriff said there’s proof that Johnny Cash was granted law enforcement authority four decades ago. At the Johnny Cash Museum this week, Sheriff Daron Hall unveiled a blown-up image of the late musician’s September 1979 deputy sheriff commission card, issued by then-Davidson County Sheriff Fate Thomas, featuring Cash’s headshot, fingerprint and signature. Hall said one of his photographers discovered the card in a box. The card authorized Cash to “execute any and all processes that may come into his hands and to maintain the peace and dignity of the State, and arrest any and all persons violating the Criminal laws of the State of Tennessee.” Hall said he doesn’t have evidence of what the deputy work entailed, but Cash believed in prison reform and criminal justice reform\n\nTexas\n\nDoma: Work crews in South Texas are laying steel along the U.S.-Mexico border in preparation for the installation of new segments of border wall. The U.S. Border Patrol said workers were installing steel rebar at a site south of Donna, a small city in the Rio Grande Valley. The rebar will reinforce concrete panels that will, in turn, be topped with 18-foot steel bollards. Crews will also clear vegetation 150 feet in front of the wall. Environmental advocates and opponents of the wall have warned that construction will destroy critical habitat and require the seizure of land from potentially hundreds of people in South Texas. The Border Patrol said a wall will deter drug and human smuggling. The ongoing construction was funded by Congress last year.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Zions Bancorporation, a Utah-based bank, has announced plans to lay off hundreds of employees and close branches across multiple states in the coming months. Zions Bancorporation started notifying employees Tuesday of a 5% workforce reduction. The company employs about 10,000 people in 11 western states. Executives said about 30% of the layoffs would be employees dealing directly with the public, and the remaining would be in enterprise activities and behind the scenes. Company executives said the cuts are necessary after declining revenue. Executives said banks across the country are losing money because of lower interest rates. Executives said the company would close or relocate a small number of branches, but only one in Utah previously announced would shut down. Some executives said they took a pay cut to trim expenses.\n\nVermont\n\nEssex Junction: A haunted house in Chittenden County garnered attention for a plotline that some Vermonters considered offensive. Nightmare Vermont changed programming that referenced a school shooting after community members spoke out in protest. The attraction is set to put on performances until Saturday at the Champlain Valley Exposition. The haunted house, in operation since 2004, issued a Facebook apology on Tuesday to the community. The post indicated “any reference to current events or plotlines involving students and weapons” will not factor into the production. The post received a few comments from Facebook users who felt the haunted house’s response was an unnecessary adjustment. The backlash to the storyline came largely from the Slate Valley Unified Union School District, as Superintendent Brooke Olsen-Farrell said many felt the opening plot referenced a firearm in a school setting, according to reporting by the Rutland Herald. The performance mentioned Parkland, Florida and included a reference to Fair Haven Union High School, which had a school shooting scare in 2018. The group’s director, Jana Beagley, clarified that the intention of the plot “was against school violence” and assured that the program “cut all references and plotlines entirely out of respect for the feedback we received,” according to the Herald.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: Roanoke County has reversed a ban on sleeping in cars overnight. The Roanoke Times reported the Wednesday reversal comes after months of backlash over the February ordinance. The newspaper said the ordinance was decried by people who said it infringed on personal liberties and created additional hardships for those without stable housing. Officials have said the ordinance was meant to allow the county to intervene in unsafe situations. Hollins District Supervisor Phil North echoed that Wednesday, adding that authorities never planned to punish offenders with the fine specified in the ordinance. No one was charged under the ordinance. North said there’s no point in defending an ordinance the county didn’t intend to apply. County Attorney Peter Lubeck said the public’s opinion influenced the reversal.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A divided state Supreme Court ruled Thursday that birthdates of state employees are public records that are subject to disclosure. In a 5-4 ruling , the court said there was no statutory or constitutional allowance that would preclude the release of such information. The decision reversed a Court of Appeals ruling and reinstated a lower court ruling that denied a motion to permanently enjoin the release of state employee names, birthdates, and email addresses. The case stems from a 2016 request from the Freedom Foundation, a conservative group that had been seeking disclosure of records of union-represented employees, so it could contact them as part of its effort to reduce the size and influence of public-sector unions. Several unions sought to stop the release of the records.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice wants to expand the state’s winemaking industry. The Republican governor on Wednesday said he’s asking officials in the state’s commerce and agricultural agencies to look into growing the wine business in the eastern panhandle. Justice said having more vineyards and wineries in West Virginia will boost tourism and local economies. He noted that Virginia has benefited from promoting its winemaking industry where the state borders West Virginia’s eastern panhandle. Justice said he wants agriculture officials to evaluate winemaking conditions in the eastern panhandle. He wants commerce officials to investigate the market for vineyards.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A group from Wisconsin is in South Burlington, Vermont, to learn more about how the area is dealing with the arrival of the F-35 fighter planes being flown by the Vermont Air National Guard. State Rep. Chris Taylor, a Democrat, told MyChamplainValley.com that people in the Madison area are “really struggling to know what this means.” Last month, the first two of what are to be 20 F-35s arrived at the Burlington International Airport. The arrival of the jets, which are louder than their F-16 predecessors, followed years of concern, and opposition from some, about the noise. The Air Force has named Truax Field in Madison a preferred alternative to receive 20 of the jets. Earlier this month, the Wisconsin Assembly passed a resolution supporting the F-35s.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A pizzeria in Gillette is stocking up ahead of a jump in the cost of Parmesan cheese from Italy. Pizza Carrello usually orders one big wheel of Parmesan at a time but recently bought five. Restaurant co-owner Ariane Jimison told the Gillette News-Record she expects the price of Parmesan to go up because of a 25% tariff on European Union products including wine, olive oil and cheese. President Donald Trump’s administration imposed the tariffs in response to EU subsidies for European aircraft manufacturer Airbus. Each Parmesan wheel Jimison orders sells for $900. Jimison said she would have bought more but only five were available. Parmesan cheese comes from northern Italy, where it is aged for two years at room temperature.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/01/chicago-cows-bras-turtles-gold-rush-news-around-states/39642759/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state Department of Corrections is moving along with a plan to build three new prisons. The prison system last week posted a “request for qualifications” from companies interested in building the facilities. The department wrote that it intends to gather qualified companies and then take proposals later this year. The department wrote that its goal is to break ground in mid-2020. The prisons would each house more than 3,000 male inmates. Gov. Kay Ivey in February announced a plan to build three new prisons. She said the state will first gather proposals from companies and then decide how to proceed. Ivey has presented new facilities as part of the solution to prisons beset with violence and overcrowding. Critics have said staffing levels are a more pressing concern.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: U.S. Attorney General William Barr has declared a law enforcement emergency in Alaska, clearing the way for the Justice Department to award more than $10 million to combat crime in rural Alaskan communities. Friday’s announcement follows a trip Barr made in May to meet with Native leaders in the state, who described disproportionately high rates of violence and sexual assault in Native communities. It’s the first time Barr has personally declared a law enforcement emergency since he assumed his role in February. The Justice Department has previously declared similar emergencies after mass shootings and to combat spikes in violent crime. The funding would be available immediately and is meant to help hire additional village and tribal officers and to pay for equipment and training.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale: There’s an influx of new animals this season at the Southwest Wildlife Conservation Center, a nonprofit rescue organization that rehabilitates the injured, displaced and orphaned. The center releases animals to the wild and gives shelter to those that can’t be released – and right now, it’s up to its ears in wildlife to care for, according to spokeswoman Kim Carr. Some of the animals cared for include bobcats, foxes, skunks, rabbits, black bear cubs, coyotes, bobcats, raccoons, javelinas and porcupines. Center director Lisa Searles says workers currently have at least 100 animals going through rehabilitation – double the amount they had this time last year. Carr said raccoons in particular are coming in such huge numbers that the center is building new enclosures just to accommodate them. One raccoon arrived covered in cement, according to the center’s Facebook page.\n\nArkansas\n\nDermott: A youth detention center has been closed as part of Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s plan to streamline and improve the state’s juvenile system. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the Dermott Juvenile Treatment Center closed Thursday. A Youth Services Division spokeswoman says the last 10 inmates have been sent home or to other facilities. The most recent closure leaves just five state juvenile lockups in operation. Hutchinson says he wants the state to provide “better quality, individualized treatment” for juvenile offenders. The nonprofit Disability Rights Arkansas, which monitors the treatment of children in state lockups, says the closure represents progress, but more is needed. It wants Arkansas to use diversion tactics to keep youths out of detention and provide effective treatment for those who must be imprisoned.\n\nCalifornia\n\nRancho Mirage: The Betty Ford drug and alcohol treatment center has agreed to make sure its facilities are accessible to the disabled. The U.S. attorney’s office says the agreement was finalized Friday with the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation. The foundation agreed to remove barriers for easier access to patient rooms, bathrooms and other areas at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage. The center also will make sure new buildings are accessible. The center was investigated for allegedly violating the Americans with Disabilities Act that bars discrimination against the disabled. Federal authorities say the foundation cooperated with the investigation. The Betty Ford Center was co-founded in 1982 by former First Lady Betty Ford, who underwent treatment for alcohol and prescription drug abuse.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A bison herd in northern Colorado is growing much faster than expected. The herd at Soapstone Prairie Natural Area, north of Fort Collins, began three years ago as 10 genetically pure descendants of bison in Yellowstone National Park. The Laramie Foothills Bison Conservation Herd now numbers 76 animals, including a dozen calves born just this year. The natural area doesn’t have enough room for more than 100 bison. Herd managers expect to reach that number soon. Colorado State University, the city of Fort Collins and Larimer County hope to raise enough genetically pure, disease-free bison to give or trade to American Indian tribes and conservation organizations. Herd managers recently sent two bison bulls to a zoo in Oakland, California.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State agriculture officials say time is quickly running out to purchase a locally grown, sweet treat: cherries. Department of Agriculture Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt says Connecticut is fortunate to have farmers who grow the fruit in both sweet and tart varieties, but there is only a short window to purchase them. Available for just two to three weeks, cherries are expected to peak over the Fourth of July weekend. They are considered one of the more challenging fruits to grow in the state. South Glastonbury farmer Don Preli, who owns Belltown Hill Orchards, says despite some issues with pollination and wet weather, the cherry crop has “fared well” this season. Consumers can find local farms on the Connecticut Grown website.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A group of Muslim students have returned to a public pool in the city a year after they were asked to leave because of their cotton garments. Darul-Amaanah Academy principal Tahsiyn Ismaa’eel says the place “felt like home again” when the group returned Thursday. The city earlier this year settled with the school and families for $50,000. It didn’t admit wrongdoing but agreed to revise regulations to “expressly accommodate clothing worn for religious reasons or financial hardship.” The school argued city staff discriminated against seven children because of their religion. The then-pool manager said policy prohibited cotton in the pool, but Mayor Mike Purczycki said no such restriction existed. After Purczycki apologized, the school said staffers closed the pool before students could go in.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Interior Department says a Fourth of July celebration featuring President Donald Trump will include a flight demonstration by the U.S. Navy Blue Angels. The “Salute to America” event will honor the nation’s five service branches with music, military demonstrations and a fireworks display, as well as a speech by Trump at the Lincoln Memorial. Participants include the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, U.S. Army Band, Armed Forces Chorus, U.S. Marine Corps Silent Drill Team and others. Democrats have voiced concern that Trump could alter the tone of what traditionally is a nonpartisan celebration of America’s founding by delivering an overtly political speech. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt says Trump will use the speech to honor the military.\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville: An almost 14-foot jawbone believed to be from a right whale is now in a museum after a boater spotted it on a barrier island off Florida’s Atlantic Coast. The Tampa Bay Times reports the bone was taken to the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville in May. The jawbone was discovered near Jacksonville. Museum officials say it appears to be a left mandible, which is part of the jawbone. DNA tests are underway to determine if the bone is indeed from a right whale. There are only about 450 right whales left in the world. The museum currently has a right mandible from a right whale, which was found in 1907. Florida Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman Michelle Kerr says it was a “rare, unique discovery.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Two dogs, part of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s “beagle brigade,” sniffed out two giant African snails in the luggage of a passenger arriving at the airport from Nigeria. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the beagles, named Candie and Chipper, were alerted to the passenger’s checked bags at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport on Friday. A Customs agriculture specialist found the snails in a suitcase, along with prohibited fruits and vegetables. The snails were turned over to the U.S. Department of Agriculture; the food was destroyed. The USDA’s website says such snails are illegally imported for classroom exhibits, as pets or for food. They’re also described as “one of the most damaging” in the world because they consume at least 500 types of plants, reproduce quickly and can cause meningitis.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state will soon provide drivers the option to select “X” as their gender on licenses. Hawaii News Now reports Democratic Gov. David Ige on Wednesday signed the bill intended to reduce discrimination against transgender and gender-fluid people. The gender X option is for drivers who prefer not to identify as male or female. Hawaii will be the ninth state to offer the gender X option on driver’s licenses. Officials say the bill also protects residents from being forced to provide documentation such as a birth certificate or other means of proof when selecting gender X. Supporters say the measure is a major victory for the LGBTQ community.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little says a salmon and steelhead recovery workgroup he formed should focus on achievable goals that can bolster the state’s struggling fish populations. Little on Friday also told the nearly two dozen panel members comprised of environmentalists, ranchers, recreationists, power companies and state officials at their first meeting that the workgroup will help define Idaho’s position for federal efforts to save salmon and steelhead in the Columbia Basin. Billions of dollars have been spent in Idaho, Oregon and Washington to save 13 species of Columbia Basin salmon and steelhead protected under the Endangered Species Act. Four of those species are in Idaho. Little, a Republican, says he’s not convinced that breaching four dams on the Snake River in Washington will help the fish rebound, and he advised the group not to get bogged down on that topic.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A herd of fiberglass cows is returning to the city to mark the 20-year anniversary of a popular display of brightly painted faux bovines that inspired other cities to line their streets with their own statues of everything from lobsters to pigs. The Chicago Tribune reports that for the month of July, the city is commemorating the 1999 “Cows on Parade” exhibit with what it’s calling “Cows Come Home.” Some 20 cows will be on display. They include some of the original exhibit’s most popular cows, a colorful reminder of the original public art exhibit in which well over 300 fiberglass could be spotted downtown. The cows sported baseball caps, Hawaii shirts, sunglasses, ladybug wings and more.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: All emergency dispatchers in the state will have a year to complete training in telephone CPR under a new law taking effect Monday. Indiana officials say at least 10% of the nearly 2,400 people working in 911 call centers around the state lack such training. Officials say it’s particularly vital in rural areas where emergency crews face longer trips to arrive. Statewide 911 Board official Ed Reuter says most staff members may know hands-on CPR, but what telephone CPR requires is different. City of Lawrence emergency dispatcher Michael Clark says dispatchers have a set of cards they can read from on such calls, but they often veer off script to calm callers.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Iowans will be hard-pressed to find local sweet corn for their backyard barbecues in time for the Fourth of July holiday. Due to the cool, wet spring, harvests will be later, and ears will be smaller. But sweet corn farmers are confident that when things finally get rolling, the sweet corn will be plentiful. The recent spike in temperature will help things along quickly. “We’re not going to have sweet corn ready by July 4 weekend. Maybe the weekend after,” said Ron Deardorff of Deardorff Sweet Corn. “The weather has not been conducive.” Deardorff said once the corn is finally ready, there will be plenty to go around, as he and his crew were able to do later plantings between the rain showers.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A dispute is escalating between top Republicans and Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration over looser rules for people who receive food assistance. The state Department for Children and Families on Friday released an internal analysis defending the legality of a new policy that makes it easier for adults who are not working to keep receiving food assistance. DCF made the change in May. Republican leaders in the GOP-controlled Legislature contend that the policy violates a 2015 law setting stricter requirements for food and cash assistance. They have promised that a committee will review the issue later this year. GOP Attorney General Derek Schmidt sent DCF Secretary Laura Howard a letter last week saying the policy appeared to violate state law. Howard released the legal analysis in response.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: KentuckyWired has overcome its squirrel problem – at least for now. Construction on the first ring of the state’s troubled internet project is now complete, Gov. Matt Bevin and U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers announced at a joint news conference Friday. That section, initially expected in April but delayed by squirrel damage, circles a region that includes Louisville, Lexington and Northern Kentucky, Bevin said. Also complete is a branch of the network that bridges Lexington and Somerset in Eastern Kentucky, which Rogers represents. By stringing more than 3,000 miles of fiber-optic cable across the state, the project is designed to improve high-speed internet access in Kentucky. But the project, pushed through at the end of Gov. Steve Beshear’s administration, has been plagued by two years of delays.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: An invasive species of swamp eel has been found in the city, and a state biologist says it’s the first time this species has been found in the United States. Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries biologist Robert Bourgeois says the Asian swamp eels in Bayou St. John may have been released for food or from an aquarium. Bourgeois said in a news release Thursday that they eat the same things native fish and animals do, but their effect on native species is not known. He says other Asian swamp eel species have been found over the years in New Jersey, Hawaii, Georgia and Florida. The department is asking the public to help it learn how widespread these are by freezing and reporting any they find.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Environmentalists say the removal of a dam on the Kennebec River remains a pivotal moment in the state’s conservation movement 20 years later. The Natural Resources Council of Maine says supporters will gather in Augusta on Monday to celebrate the removal of the Edwards Dam. The group credits the dam removal with allowing fish to return to the river and improving habitat for birds such as bald eagles and ospreys. The Natural Resources Council of Maine says the removal of the dam was also the beginning of a movement toward river restoration around the country. It says 1,200 dams have been removed since. The former dam site is now a park that includes a boat launch. The anniversary event Monday will be held at the park.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Journalists honored the five Capital Gazette employees who were shot to death in their newsroom last year by unveiling a plaque Friday with the names of the dead in a garden next to five rose bushes. The plaque in the waterside park acknowledges Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen, John McNamara, Wendi Winters and Rebecca Smith as “our cherished colleagues.” “This community is very lucky,” said Rick Hutzell, the newspaper’s editor. “It has what a lot of communities have lost, and that is a newsroom. A newsroom is a room full of people who turn up every day to celebrate our successes, to point out what is wrong, and to ask what could be better. That is what journalism is about, so it is extremely fitting that this is where this garden is … it’s a place where people come for a quiet moment to think about things.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The 38th annual Boston Harborfest will kick off Tuesday with patriotic music and a ceremonial cake cutting. The opening ceremony for the multiday festival will be held at Faneuil Hall Marketplace. The festival that began in 1982 features hundreds of activities to celebrate American independence, honor Boston’s colonial roots and showcase the city’s harbor. Harborfest will also include historical reenactments, Freedom Trail tours, live entertainment and other activities. The festival runs through Sunday. Tuesday night is the Parade of Lights, when boaters show off festive lights on their vessels in Boston Harbor. The parade will be followed by fireworks.\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: Emmy and Tony award-winning actress Lily Tomlin will receive a lifetime achievement award at the 15th annual Traverse City Film Festival in northern Michigan. Oscar winner and festival founder Michael Moore is expected to present the honor to Tomlin on Aug. 3. The festival runs July 30 to Aug. 4 and will feature more than 200 films and events. Actress and political activist Jane Fonda was last year’s recipient. Tomlin and Fonda star in the comedy “Grace and Frankie,” which airs on Netflix. Tomlin was born in Detroit. Her film credits include “Nashville,” “9 to 5” and “The Incredible Shrinking Woman.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nByron: About 40 cattle were swept away from their pasture in southern Minnesota as heavy rainfall caused the Zumbro River to swell. Olmsted County Sheriff Kevin Torgerson says some of the cattle have been located, but it’s going to take some time for authorities to access them due to flooding. Some cattle were still unaccounted for as of noon Friday. Torgerson says the incident happened near Byron. Video posted online shows several cows being swiftly pushed downriver in the current. National Weather Service records show the Rochester International Airport saw about 5 inches of rain during a six-hour period early Friday. Dodge County, to the west, also saw overnight thunderstorms, contributing to flooding of the Zumbro River. Several roads in the area were covered with water Friday morning and were closed.\n\nMississippi\n\nOcean Springs: It was built as a hideout for mobster Al Capone and was a hangout for Elvis in the 1950s as he became a star. Now Gulf Hills Hotel is in danger of losing that history and heritage. An investor who wants to buy the 92-year-old resort met last month with the residents of the community that adjoins the 10-acre property, the Sun-Herald reports. Walt Reinhaus shared his vision for a “luxury” RV park near the water to help make the resort profitable, along with restoring the hotel, installing gardens, reopening a restaurant, renewing the swimming pool and adding a fitness center. “There are a lot of good things in your proposal that we really like,” one resident said, but the sticking point was the RV park. Residents said they are most concerned about the traffic on narrow roads and their property values.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Two years after a state park employee died from complications from the Bourbon virus, researchers are using a strain of the virus taken from her to try to figure out how to treat the tick-borne disease. Meramec State Park Assistant Superintendent Tamela Wilson died in June 2017 after being bitten by an infected tick near her home outside Sullivan. The Washington Missourian reports Dr. Jacco Boon of Washington University is using lab mice infected with the Bourbon virus to research a possible cure. He is working with Barnes-Jewish Hospital doctors who diagnosed and treated Wilson before her death. Because the disease is rare, researchers are using a strain of Bourbon virus taken from Wilson to create cultures and conduct the testing.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The U.S. Supreme Court will consider reviving a program in the state that gives tax credits to people who donate to private-school scholarships. The state’s highest court had struck down the program because it violated the Montana constitution’s ban on state aid to religious organizations. The justices said Friday that they will review the state court ruling, which Montana parents are challenging as a violation of their religious freedom under the U.S. Constitution. The Montana Supreme Court ruled that the program giving tax credits of up to $150 for donations to organizations that give scholarships to private-school students amounts to indirect aid to schools controlled by churches.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The University of Nebraska Board of Regents has approved the creation of a new heart and vascular disease research center at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The board voted Friday to approve the Center for Heart and Vascular Research, which will bring together scientists from colleges across the University of Nebraska, including medicine, public health, nursing, pharmacy, engineering, arts and sciences, and the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources. In a news release, UNMC says cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and hospitalization in Nebraska, accounting for 1 in 3 deaths. The UNMC College of Medicine and extramural research grants have committed $8 million in startup funding for five years.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The SLS hotel on the Las Vegas Strip is going back to the Sahara name. The iconic hotel that dates to 1952 and over the years hosted the Rat Pack, the Jerry Lewis Telethon and the Beatles came full circle with a Thursday night announcement by new owner Alex Meruelo. SLS General Manager Paul Hobson tells the Las Vegas Sun the idea of changing the name back to Sahara was one of the first things Meruelo began considering when he acquired the property in April 2018. Hotel officials say the change is part of a $150 million renovation expected to take up to three years. The hotel-casino at the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip closed as the Sahara in 2011 and reopened as the SLS in 2014.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s environmental agency is proposing drinking water standards that would be among the nation’s strictest when it comes to certain industrial compounds. The Department of Environmental Services on Friday proposed standards for four compounds called per- and polyfluoroalykyl substances, or PFAS. The compounds, used in firefighting foam, nonstick cookware and other products, increasingly have turned up in public water supplies and private wells around the country. The federal government has a nonbinding health threshold of 70 parts per trillion for two forms of the contaminant. New Hampshire is proposing 12 parts per trillion for PFOA and 15 parts per trillion for PFOS. The New Hampshire proposal will be considered by a legislative rules committee this month.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPoint Pleasant Beach: A Jersey shore community has moved its weekly beach fireworks show to accommodate endangered birds nesting and hatching there. More than 150 pairs of American oystercatchers, least terns and black skimmers have successively laid eggs near Jenkinson’s Aquarium in Point Pleasant Beach. So officials have moved the weekly summer fireworks shows, which started Thursday, to an area south of where the birds are located. The nesting and hatching area has been roped off, and aquarium employees are monitoring the birds at least twice a day. Some birds have already nested and hatched, while others have just started to nest. Officials estimate the birds will be around for at least another six weeks. Aquarium officials say visitors are encouraged to observe the birds.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is launching a new effort to craft legislation that could legalize recreational marijuana sales next year. The first-year Democratic governor announced Friday her recruitment of health, legal and fiscal policy experts to serve in a new discussion group that provides recommendations on state legalization. Members of the group include Democratic and Republican legislators who sponsored unsuccessful legislation this year to authorize and tax recreational marijuana sales at state-run stores. That proposal passed a House vote but stalled in the state Senate. Albuquerque City Councilor Pat Davis is leading the cannabis legalization task force. Other participants represent a labor union, sheriff’s department, health care business, Native American tribe, medical cannabis business, county government association, commercial bank and hospital company.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Daughters of the American Revolution is having a milestone moment. On Sunday, the lineage-based group officially installed the first African American woman on its national governing board. Wilhelmena Rhodes Kelly, from Queens, and others in the historically white organization have been encouraging women of color to research their family roots to see if they can find a tie to the country’s founding. That’s after a past that’s included Eleanor Roosevelt quitting the Daughters of the American Revolution after it refused to allow black singer Marian Anderson to perform at its Constitution Hall in 1939. Kelly joined in 2004 after discovering she was related to a white Virginian who donated supplies to war efforts.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nIndian Trail: An animal rescue group recently asked women not to throw out their old bras but instead to send the clasps to the agency to help turtles with broken shells, but the response was so overwhelming that it’s now suggesting people instead donate what they planned to spend for shipping. News outlets report Carolina Waterfowl Rescue was asking women through social media to remove the eye closures from the fasteners and mail them in. Rescue group worker Keenan Freitas says the eye closures basically help wire the turtle shell back together. The nonprofit has been seeing as many as 40 turtles a week during the past month. It says many of them have been run over by cars, lawnmowers and boats. An animal rehabilitation group in Iowa originally had the idea, saying it uses the fasteners along with small zip ties to help the turtles heal their broken shells.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The National Park Service says the fungus that causes a deadly disease in bats has been discovered in the state. The Bismarck Tribune reports the fungus was discovered after swab testing of a bat captured May 6 at Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site near Stanton. The fungus causes white-nose syndrome, which can lead to dehydration or other conditions that kill bats. Thirty-three states have confirmed the disease since it was found in 2006 in New York. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wildlife refuge specialist Catherine Hibbard says four states, including North Dakota, have discovered only the fungus. South Dakota identified the fungus and disease for the first time last year. Humans can transmit the fungus but aren’t affected by it. It is spread easily among bats.\n\nOhio\n\nWarren: A region of the state steeped in Italian culture is showing off its local cuisine with a new culinary passport. The Italian Food Trail is designed to draw tourists and residents to 15 participating restaurants, markets, pizza shops and wineries throughout Trumbull County, to appreciate the Italian food offerings. Some of the county’s most memorable dishes are rooted in the traditions of Italian families that began arriving in the area in the late 19th century. The Vindicator of Youngstown reports the free passport is available at the county tourism office, the food sites or through the trail’s website while supplies last. Participants purchasing an appetizer, entree or dessert at a participating site get their passport stamped. A completed booklet can be exchanged for 15 chances to win a $50 gift certificate.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of working oil rigs in the state is down more than a quarter from this time last year, amid a nationwide decrease. Oil-field services firm Baker Hughes reported 102 rigs operating in the state Friday. The Journal Record reports this is down 27% from a year ago following a sharp drop in January and gradual decreases through June. The lower count comes as energy companies across the country have prioritized cash flow over increased production amid low oil prices. Houston-based Baker Hughes reports 967 oil and gas rigs operating nationally, 80 fewer than a year ago. The rig count is down even as the U.S. Energy Information Administration reports that national refinery capacity rose more than 1% since the beginning of 2018 to hit a record high.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Undocumented immigrants will legally be able to obtain driver’s licenses under a measure sent to the governor’s desk. Senators voted 17-10 Saturday to expand driving privileges to all Oregon residents regardless of their immigration status. Gov. Kate Brown is expected to sign the bill into law. The move will make Oregon the 14th state to allow undocumented immigrants to drive. The bill has been a priority for pro-immigration groups who say that undocumented immigrants often live in rural areas, which requires having a car. Those without proof of residence say they live in fear that they could be deported over a traffic stop. Opponents say that the measure should be sent to the ballot considering that voters shot down a similar proposal in 2016.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Works by one of the world’s best known video artists are on display at the Barnes Foundation. “I Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like: The Art of Bill Viola” opened Sunday and runs through Sept. 15. The Barnes’ first exhibition devoted to video art brings together a selection of Viola’s major pieces dating from 1976 to 2009, including the rarely seen large-scale installations “He Weeps for You,” created in 1976, and “Ascension,” from 2000. During the 1970s, Viola was a vanguard leader experimenting with the relatively new medium of video. His works are included in major museum collections around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and London’s Tate Modern.\n\nRhode Island\n\nLincoln: The most diverse class of troopers in state history has graduated from the Rhode Island State Police Training Academy. The class of 2019 graduated Friday in Lincoln. According to state police, seven women graduated – a record in the agency’s nearly century­long history. Of the 37 new troopers, 23 are white, eight are black, and six are Hispanic. Seven of them served in the military, and 10 troopers speak a second language. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo says graduating such a diverse class ensures the department better reflects the communities it serves. The troopers were selected from about 1,500 applicants and began intensive paramilitary training in January.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nKershaw: Potentially rich deposits of gold in the state are fueling a proposed expansion of a huge mine that has some excited about the prospect of 250 new jobs in a tiny community halfway between Columbia and Charlotte. OceanaGold’s expansion plan says the Australia-based company would increase its existing 4,552-acre Haile Gold Mine site by more than 900 acres near Kershaw. According to plans filed with the state, the company is seeking to dig an underground mine that would extend up to 1,314 feet below the surface. Haile is the largest open-pit gold mining operation in the eastern United States. The South Carolina mine cranked up about three years ago. The State reports the proposed project still needs approval from federal and state environmental regulators.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: An assessment of the conditions of the state’s highways and byways following spring storms has pegged damage at $7.5 million. South Dakota Department of Transportation engineer Tammy Williams told the state Transportation Commission on Thursday that damage to county roads has reached more than $6 million and $1.5 million to state highways. KELO-TV reports county governments haven’t yet figured out how much work is waiting from snow and ice in May. Crews are still waiting for the water to go down in many places. Williams says counties want special inspections of 261 bridges across South Dakota. Twelve bridges have been closed, and three have traffic confined to single lanes because officials don’t know how much weight the structures can bear.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Vanderbilt University is pledging $2 million for the National Museum of African American Music, which is scheduled to open a 56,000-square-foot facility downtown early next year. The university says the gift includes in-kind contributions and direct financial support, and it will help expand the museum’s archives, contribute to innovative programming, support the completion of the facility and more. Vanderbilt Chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos says the partnership will help build global awareness of the impact of African American composers, performers and supporters. The partnership will include collaboration with the university’s Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries to offer their collection of books, scores, recordings and other materials for loan, display and study at the museum. Vanderbilt and the museum will also team up for a speaker series after the facility opens.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A recent collaboration involving the Texas A&M Forest Service and NASA scientists could help urban planners in the state more quickly coordinate recovery efforts following a natural disaster. The project, which also included the U.S. Forest Service and other groups, used satellite imagery and other remote sensing information to authenticate the number of urban trees killed by drought in 2011 and 2012. The study used aerial imagery and other models to measure urban canopies in two cities, Austin and Houston, from 2010 to 2018 to reveal both the effects of the drought and trends in recovery. Researchers confirmed earlier findings that 5.6 million urban trees were killed statewide. Those are in addition to the more than 300 million trees that died across the rest of Texas.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The state’s skin cancer rates have skyrocketed in recent years, and local health officials are urging the public to take preventative measures. Utah has the highest rate of skin cancer in the country, with 41.2 new cases per 100,000 people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most recent data, compiled by the CDC in 2016, revealed that melanoma was the third most common type of cancer in Utah, trailing only breast cancer and prostate cancer. A recent study by QuoteWizard Insurance News claims residents in Southern states are typically more likely to protect themselves from sun damage – and therefore report lower rates – than residents states with colder climates.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is expanding a program that hopes to help tourists who enjoy visiting move to the Green Mountain State full time. It’s part of an effort to reverse the declining workforce and boost state revenue. Since the “Stay-to-Stay Weekends” were launched last year, more than a dozen people have moved to the state. The weekends include a reception hosted by a local chamber of commerce or young professional’s network, as well as opportunities to explore the region. The governor’s office says guests also meet with employers who are hiring, tour the area with a real estate agent, or visit an incubator or co-working space to meet with entrepreneurs. This year new communities offering the long weekends include Newport at the end of July and in December and St. Johnsbury in September and October.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Hundreds of new state laws are going into effect Monday. One of the biggest items that passed during the legislative session earlier this year was a measure that ends the suspension of driver’s licenses of people with unpaid court debt. The Department of Motor Vehicles said it sent 500,000 letters to Virginia residents with suspended licenses advising them how to get their license back starting July 1. Other notable new laws going into effect include an increase in the age limit to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21, looser restrictions on happy hour advertising, and a $4 increase on mandatory car-safety inspections.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state Department of Ecology says the amount of sewage overflow that forced a beach in the city to close is 10 times more than original estimates. KCPQ-TV reports officials said last week that 16,000 gallons had spilled into Puget Sound at Golden Gardens Park. Officials said Friday that additional samples now show about 165,000 gallons of sewage overflow. Seattle Public Utilities says the overflow was caused by a blockage of tree roots and materials such as wipes in the sewer system north of the park. Signs have been posted, and the public is advised to avoid contact with the water in the affected area until further notice. Heath officials say swimming in the contaminated water can cause gastroenteritis, skin rashes, upper respiratory infections and other illnesses.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University is eyeing a fall 2021 start date for new aviation programs. According to The Herald-Dispatch, Marshall’s board of governors voted Friday on an intent to plan two new degrees in aviation sciences to train commercial airplane and helicopter pilots. Marshall plans to partner with Southern Utah University and Yeager Airport to create its new School of Aviation. Southern Utah’s program is already accredited by the Federal Aviation Administration. The courses will be held at Marshall’s South Charleston campus, where a new residential hall is also planned. Yeager Airport will also host classes and will include a new hangar for Marshall’s aircraft, classrooms and a flight simulator. Marshall will initially buy two $500,000 planes and plans to purchase up to seven by 2023.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: An expert on poverty says the state should raise its minimum wage and provide more help for families who are struggling despite record-low unemployment. University of Wisconsin-Madison professor Timothy Smeeding co-wrote a report that found Wisconsin’s poverty rate has remained stagnant for nearly a decade, fluctuating between 10% and 11% from 2008 to 2017. The federal government considers the poverty level for a family of four to be $25,750. The report’s methodology determined Wisconsin’s poverty threshold for a two-adult, two-child household to be $27,241 because of the state’s low cost of living. Smeeding says work alone isn’t enough to lift some families out of poverty. He suggests raising the minimum wage and boosting state support.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: For the first time in seven years, peregrine falcons at Devils Tower did not have a successful nesting season. The Casper Star-Tribune reports a pair of falcons showed behavior consistent with courtship, but the weather might have put a damper on breeding. Rene Ohms, chief of resource management for the National Park Service, says this year’s late-season snow, colder-than-normal temperatures and frequently heavy rain have made it “very difficult for them.” The species was listed as endangered in 1970 but had a remarkable recovery and was removed from the list in 1999. Falcons returned to Devils Tower in 2013 and successfully nested for the past six years. Ohms says nests sometimes fail, but the population as a whole won’t be affected.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/24/us/five-things-july-24-cec/index.html", "title": "5 things to know on July 24, 2022: Start your week smart ...", "text": "Air travel this summer has been challenging to say the least.

It naturally builds self-esteem,” says Mac “Dukie” Hopkins, an artist manager and event promoter. That’s why he’s hosting his fourth Christmas shoe drive, hoping to give at least 100 new pairs of shoes to children in need through the Brantwood Children’s Home. A fixture in Montgomery’s rap scene since the early 2000s, Hopkins has used those connections in years past to bring in donations. In 2015, the event’s first year, he called on local artists to compete against local producers in a basketball game. Those who came to watch brought shoes as their ticket payment. That first year brought in nearly 100 pairs, and Hopkins says it’s grown each year since. This year’s drive runs through Dec. 20.\n\nAlaska\n\nNapakiak: This town is quickly losing land to the Kuskokwim River because of erosion that’s forcing everyone to move farther inland – this year alone, it’s lost more than 100 feet of shoreline. But for one day this month, the Alaska National Guard gave folks a reason to smile, thanks to its “Operation Santa Claus” program. Now in its 63rd year, Operation Santa Claus has become a rarity among National Guard units. Defense officials have shut down the program everywhere but Alaska, where the mission survives because the state is so large and some communities so remote. The program started in 1956 when the residents of St. Mary’s, Alaska, had no money to buy children Christmas presents after flooding severely impacted hunting and fishing. Since then, Guard members try to visit at least two rural communities a year, delivering Christmas gifts and other needed supplies.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A state commission unanimously approved a partnership Tuesday between the University of Arizona and Tucson Electric Power to run the campus primarily on renewable energy. The five members of the Arizona Corporation Commission, which regulates public utilities, voted for the project at a public meeting in Phoenix. The proposal would make the school the largest research university nationwide with an initiative to offset greenhouse gas emissions, according to the UA. Tucson Electric Power will provide clean energy to the school for the next 20 years via a wind farm in New Mexico and a solar-power storage system just outside Tucson. Construction on the facilities has not begun, but both are expected to be operational sometime next year.\n\nArkansas\n\nConway: A police officer who is on military leave inadvertently shot an 18-year-old man when his gun accidentally discharged, authorities said. The officer was preparing to clean a gun when it discharged Friday, striking the teenager, Conway Police Department spokeswoman LaTresha Woodruff said. Authorities said the teen’s injuries aren’t life-threatening. The officer’s name has not been released. Arkansas State Police spokesman Bill Sadler told the Log Cabin Democrat that the 18-year-old was struck once by gunfire. An investigative file will be forwarded to prosecutors to determine whether any charges will be filed, Sadler said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: A white rhino born last month at San Diego Zoo Safari Park has been named Future for what the calf represents to rhino conservation worldwide, officials say. The baby is bonding with her mother and frolicking in a maternity yard left wet by recent storms. “Future’s new favorite thing is mud,” zookeeper Marco Zeno says. “She sees a puddle, and she wants to roll in it!” Future is the 100th southern white rhino to be born at the park and the second conceived through artificial insemination. The first, Edward, was born to a different mother in July. The zoo births using frozen sperm are part of efforts to develop knowledge needed to save a subspecies called the northern white rhino, officials say. Only two remain, and both are female. Several other rhino species also are being pushed toward extinction. Future was born Nov. 21 to an 11-year-old mother named Amani.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: The city is anticipating the arrival of the new U.S. Space Force under a defense policy bill making its way through Congress. The Gazette reports the bill also earmarks $322 million for construction at military bases in the city. The Space Force will take over from the existing Air Force Space Command as the newest armed forces branch charged with defending satellites and conducting other military initiatives in space. The Space Force is a longtime priority of President Donald Trump. Republican Congressman Doug Lamborn of Colorado Springs told the Gazette that the National Defense Authorization Act will make the city “the center of military space.” The Space Force, the first new U.S. military branch since the Air Force was created in 1947, will consist of troops attached to Air Force Space Command. The command, in turn, supervises space-related operations of all service branches.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont and Democratic legislative leaders are planning to vote early next month on a proposal to upgrade the state’s infrastructure. The Democratic governor and the lawmakers announced Tuesday that they have agreed to convene a special session of the General Assembly to vote on the transportation plan and a major state bonding bill. There had been expectations of a possible vote next week on the transportation proposal, which will likely include a dozen bridge tolls for just trucks. Lawmakers are still expected to return to the state Capitol next week. Both the House and Senate have been advised there will be another special session Dec. 18. The General Assembly is expected to vote on a settlement Lamont’s administration recently reached with the Connecticut Hospital Association over a state tax and legislation that would settle a dispute over how certain restaurant workers are paid.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: The director of a state agency that oversees food stamp benefits and determines Medicaid eligibility has been placed on administrative leave with pay, an official says. Delaware Department of Human Resources spokeswoman Karen Smith confirmed the information about Ray Fitzgerald, director of the Division of Social Services, but did not give a reason for the placement, citing the department’s policy not to discuss personnel matters. Fitzgerald has been with the state Department of Health and Social Services since 2006, according to his LinkedIn profile. He became director of the social services division in 2015. Fitzgerald could not be immediately reached for comment about being placed on leave.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A man attacked two guards at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception on Tuesday morning, authorities said. A domestic dispute was apparently behind the attack at what’s believed to be the largest Roman Catholic church in North America, assistant police Chief Jeffery Carroll told news outlets. Police said Dorsey Lee Mack III, 48, first struck a female guard with a car, pinning her against another vehicle, before crashing into her again. A male guard then tried to intervene and was chased by the man through the Basilica and into the church’s crypt, where the guard was stabbed several times, church rector Monsignor Walter Rossi told The Washington Post. He said there appears to be no other relation to the shrine other than that the guards worked there. The man fled to an area home, where he barricaded himself inside for about two hours.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The University of Central Florida on Tuesday said it was partnering with the Florida state parks system to open a research facility in a first-of-its-kind agreement. UCF officials said they plan to take over a former restaurant building in Econfina River State Park in rural Taylor County and convert it into a research facility. The site will be about an hour’s drive southeast of Tallahassee. UCF’s National Center for Integrated Coastal Research will lead the new center. The partnership with the Florida Park Service will allow anthropology students to dig up precolonial sites. Civil engineering students will be able to study storm surge, and biology students can examine the park’s habitats, UCF officials said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and its parent corporation aren’t happy with how one of their late reporters is portrayed in the upcoming film “Richard Jewell,” which depicts Kathy Scruggs as using sex to get information from sources. A law firm sent a letter Monday on behalf of the companies to film leadership, including director Clint Eastwood, screenwriter Bill Ray, Warner Bros. and others, the newspaper reports. It requests that they issue a public statement acknowledging characters and events were dramatized. They also want the disclaimer prominently featured in the film, which hits theaters Friday. The film tells the story of the late Richard Jewell, a security guard who saved countless people from the 1996 bombing at the Atlanta Olympics. The newspaper and Scruggs were the first to report that the FBI considered Jewell a suspect, it says. Jewell was cleared months later.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Visitor entrance fees at Haleakala National Park on Maui will increase on New Year’s Day, the National Park Service says. Park officials say the rate increase will begin Jan. 1, The Maui News reports. A $5 increase will raise the entrance fee to $30 per vehicle and $25 per motorcycle, officials say. There will also be a $3 increase for bicycle riders and pedestrians to $15 per person. The cost of a Tri-Park Pass will increase from $50 to $55. The annual pass allows visitors unlimited entry to the state’s fee-collecting parks including Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Haleakala National Park and Puuhonua o Hanaunau National Historical Park. Haleakala receives more than a million visitors each year, and its fees are increasing along with those at other U.S. national parks to conduct infrastructure improvements, the park service says.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Prison officials have changed their administrative rules to ensure secrecy surrounding the source of the state’s lethal injection drugs. Like previous versions, the rule updated earlier this year forbids the Idaho Department of Correction from disclosing “under any circumstance” information that department director Josh Tewalt determines could jeopardize the department’s ability to carry out an execution. But this version also specifically forbids the release of information that could potentially identify both past and future suppliers of lethal injection drugs. The rule doesn’t include allowances for court orders. That could complicate an appeal in a lawsuit against the department from a University of Idaho professor who is seeking access to lethal injection records. A state judge has ordered the state to turn over the documents, but prison officials have appealed, and the state Supreme Court is expected to hear the case next year.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city’s interim police superintendent is discontinuing a so-called merit promotion system that rank-and-file cops have long complained rewards officers for who they know and not what skills they have to do the job. In a letter to the 13,400-member department obtained by the Chicago Tribune, Interim Superintendent Charlie Beck said Tuesday that he’s heard many officers have been “dissatisfied and discouraged” by the process that allows promotions to the ranks of detective, sergeant and lieutenant regardless of exam scores. Beck wrote that he made the decision after consulting with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Fraternal Order of Police President Kevin Graham. Beck said he will recommend to whomever Lightfoot selects as the next permanent superintendent in 2020 that the merit promotion system be discontinued and that promotional exams be given every two years.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Up to 20 low- and middle-income homes in the city could be running on solar power free of charge by the end of next year with the help of a new city initiative, the first of its kind in the Midwest. Just months after Indianapolis and Hamilton County formed solar power co-ops to make solar energy more available to homeowners, the city of Indianapolis announced another co-op plan – this one aimed specifically at providing solar power to financially burdened residents. Like the co-ops announced this year, the plan is the result of a partnership with Solar United Neighbors, a national nonprofit that establishes similar co-ops and promotes solar power. Installing solar panels for a home can $5,000 to $20,000, depending on the home, pushing it out of reach of most low- and middle-income homeowners who already spend a higher proportion of their income on energy.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A state-run family planning program that excludes Planned Parenthood from accessing funds has seen a nearly 75% drop in the number of people using its services since 2017, according to a new agency report. The 11-page report shows 5,857 people utilized services through the program in the calendar year 2017. The number using services under the program as of December 2018 was 1,502. The program is supposed to help poor and moderate-income Iowans obtain reproductive services like contraception and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. The state-run family planning program was launched in July 2017, so the data from that year includes services provided under a federally funded program that allowed Planned Parenthood to seek reimbursement for providing services.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The state Department of Agriculture is offering stressed farmers a place to find support and resources. A new website, kansasagstress.org, comes at a time when the number of farmer suicides is rising across the nation. The website is a collaboration among the state and several other agriculture partners. Kansas Ag Stress Resources includes a “Family Support” tab that provides resources to different family members. The main page lists the Kansas Suicide Prevention Line and the Crisis Text Line. Agriculture Secretary Mike Beam said in a news release that the website is intended to support those involved in Kansas agriculture through times of emotional of financial stress. Gov. Laura Kelly said the increase in suicide rates for farmer and ranchers is alarming, and the state wants to provide them and their loved ones with support and alternatives to suicide.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A national group that focuses on issues common to Muslims and Jews in the U.S. has launched a chapter in Louisville. The Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council held an event at the Muhammed Ali Center over the weekend in Louisville to launch its new chapter. The group says its national board is composed of 45 civil, religious and business leaders who “advocate for domestic policy issues of common concern.” Among the issues is combating discrimination against religious minorities. Lonnie Ali, widow of Muhammad Ali, says she is looking forward to being an active member of the Louisville-based council. “This is the work my husband would want me to do,” she said. The group has regional chapters in 10 other cities.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: As the state broadens its efforts to combat hepatitis C in hopes of largely eliminating the deadly viral infection, the health department announced Tuesday that 10 Walmart locations around the state will offer free screenings for the infectious, liver-damaging disease. Walmart will offer the no-cost hepatitis C screenings every Wednesday from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. until Feb. 1 at the pharmacies in stores in Vivian, Ville Platte, New Iberia, Raceland, Oak Grove, Amite, Monroe, Denham Springs, Opelousas and Morgan City. “We are trying to make it as easy as possible for people to get screened for this virus and then get treated,” Health Secretary Rebekah Gee says. The screenings involve a finger-stick test. If the testing detects the presence of hepatitis C virus antibodies, patients will be referred to their primary care doctors or a local health care provider.\n\nMaine\n\nJonesport: Fishing regulators are implementing emergency closures in the state’s scallop harvesting industry for the first time this season. Maine scallop fishing takes place every winter, and the state uses emergency closures to protect the valuable shellfish against overfishing. The Maine Department of Marine Resources says it has closed Moosabec Reach, an area off Jonesport in Down East Maine. The closure went into effect Sunday. Scallops are among the most profitable marine resources in Maine. However, the fishery dipped in both volume and value last year. Fishermen harvested a little more than 560,000 pounds of scallop meat in 2018 after collecting more than 800,000 pounds in 2017. The price per pound to fishermen also fell $1.20, to $10.54.\n\nMaryland\n\nUpper Marlboro: Racist memes poisoned the mind of a white man who fatally stabbed a black college student at a bus stop on the University of Maryland’s campus after a night of drinking, a prosecutor told jurors Wednesday. Sean Urbanski doesn’t deny he stabbed Richard Collins III that night in May 2017, but one of his lawyers says there is no evidence race was a motive for the killing. “They have used race to divide this community,” defense attorney William Brennan said of prosecutors during the trial’s opening statements. Urbanski, now 24, is charged with first-degree murder and a hate crime. Urbanski had saved at least six photographs of racist memes on his cellphone and liked a Facebook group called “Alt-Reich: Nation,” according to prosecutors. “These images were in his phone, in his mind every day. It’s poison,” said deputy state’s attorney Jason Abbott.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nHolyoke: A blue wheelchair van once used to transport a judge with ALS to work and doctor’s appointments has been donated to a police chief battling the same condition. Rose Boyle, the wife of late Springfield District Court Judge William Boyle, turned over the keys to the van to Lee Police Chief Jeffrey Roosa during a meeting Tuesday of the Western Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association, according to Masslive.com. Roosa has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease, the same condition that claimed Boyle’s life in September. Roosa, 46, was diagnosed with the disease in 2017. He continues to work, drives his car some, and uses a wheelchair and a cane to get around. He knows eventually he will need the van. Roosa thanked the Boyle family and said the gift will help defray costs for his family as he continues to fight the disease.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Internet gaming and sports betting are soon expected to be legal in the state after the Legislature sent a package of bills to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Wednesday, on the last session day of the year. The bills, expected to be signed by Whitmer, will allow existing licensed casinos to offer poker, blackjack, slots and other casino-style games over the internet. The legislation also will allow those casinos to set up theaters to accept wagers on live sporting events and accept sports bets online. “It’s been a long journey to move sports betting and casino-style gaming into a regulated, safe and modern environment – but the end is in sight, and with it a great opportunity for Michigan will begin,” said state Rep. Brandt Iden, R-Oshtemo Township, a major sponsor of the package.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: A baby Jesus statue has been missing from a nativity scene downtown for a year. The manger is currently filled by a swaddled toy doll. The statue was stolen last December. The Stearns County History Museum has owned the nativity scene since 1978 and has had it on display near U.S. Bank during the holidays since 1988. “We never did recover the original baby Jesus,” museum executive director Carie Essig says. The museum is looking for a more permanent replacement for the temporary baby Jesus. Local schools raised money to buy the nativity in 1944 and donated it to the city of St. Cloud. The museum will either replace the figure with a similar piece from the era or will have something new cast, Essig says.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Legislative leaders are recommending the state spend slightly less during the coming year than the current year. Members of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee met Wednesday and adopted a broad outline for a nearly $6.3 billion budget for the year that begins July 1. That would be nearly $94 million less than the state is set to spend in the current year, about a 1.5% decrease. The plan recommends some spending hikes. The Department of Public Safety would receive an additional $4.4 million for new state troopers and another $1 million for pay raises for law enforcement officers. The state would spend an additional $18.4 million to cover the current year’s shortfall for an underfunded teacher pay raise plan. Overall spending for elementary and secondary education would be less than 1% higher. Spending for community colleges would decrease about 3.6% and about 2.6% for universities.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The Kansas City Zoo is now home for eight fluffy new macaroni penguin chicks. Eggs for the chicks were flown in from SeaWorld San Diego and hatched in incubators in Kansas City, the zoo announced Tuesday. It is the first time in the zoo’s 110-year history that it has had this species of penguin. Zookeepers are raising the chicks by hand, which includes giving each of them up to six feedings a day of a mixture of herring, krill and vitamins. The food is working, as the chicks continue to gain weight, the zoo said. They averaged only 92 grams at birth but are gaining 10% to 15% of their body weight every day. They’ll eventually grow to be about 10 pounds and 2 feet tall. The chicks are expected to go on exhibit at the zoo in the next few weeks. Macaroni penguins are listed as vulnerable to extinction. They get their name from the the bright yellow crest of feathers above their eyes.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A council at the University of Montana has recommended the removal of a swastika-like tile arrangement on the walls of a university hall. The tiles show a mirror-image swastika called an aristika designed within Corbin Hall in the 1920s, when swastikas were not yet adopted as a symbol by the Nazis, university officials say. After months of calls for the tiles to be taken down amid the image’s negative connotation, the university’s Diversity Advisory Council voted Tuesday to recommended the tiles be removed, archived and replaced. The council will send the proposal to President Seth Bodnar. The student and faculty senates passed resolutions this fall for the tiles to be removed. Some professors have expressed concerns about letting the Nazi use of a symbol overshadow its more positive connotation in other cultures and recommended installing a plaque explaining the symbol’s meaning.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The school board has scheduled a special election Feb. 11 so voters can decide whether to issue $290 million in bonds to build two more high schools, an elementary and other facilities. The board voted unanimously Tuesday for the bond resolution and authorized district officials to buy two parcels for the high schools. One will be in northwest Lincoln, the other in southeast Lincoln. If the bond issue were to pass, the northwest high school would open in 2022 and the other in 2023. The Lancaster County election commissioner will decide whether the election will be conducted solely through the mail or by traditional balloting.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A conservative advocacy group wants quick action from a judge to block a statewide red flag gun law allowing firearms to be taken from people deemed to be a threat to themselves or others. The group NevadansCAN is seeking an injunction against the law that is set to go into effect Jan. 2 amid a “Second Amendment sanctuary” drive in several rural counties where sheriffs have vowed not to enforce the law. Red flag laws are designed to prevent gun violence by allowing weapons to be confiscated after a judge reviews an application by police or family members about a person’s potentially threatening behavior. “It’s more than the Second Amendment. It’s an infringement on your right to due process of law,” said Tina Trenner, of Pahrump, a radio show host in Las Vegas and spokeswoman for the Henderson-based citizen action network.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A school board has voted to remove a Native American mascot from certain school logos after facing controversy. Merrimack Valley High School held a meeting on the fate of the school’s logo, and the board voted to remove the controversial mascot from gym banners, WMUR reports. The vote came Monday after those against the mascot’s use asked the school board to permanently remove it. “Our headdresses are very sacred to us. Each feather is earned. You have it on the floor as a mockery,” Andover resident Amy Moriarty said. The board decided the mascot will remain in the school’s hall of fame as well as outside banners for one month every school year. Board members also voted to create a history room that would include Native American school artifacts and asked curriculum to add content in the school education on local indigenous history.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nUpper Saddle River: A deer seen wandering around town with its head stuck in a plastic pumpkin has been rescued, police said. The borough of Upper Saddle River posted on Facebook late Tuesday morning that a deer seen wandering around with part of its head, including its mouth, stuck inside a plastic pumpkin had been found, and the pumpkin had been removed. The pumpkin is the kind typically used for trick-or-treating at Halloween. A short time before, Upper Saddle River published a post asking for tips after people reported seeing the deer. The borough thanked animal control and the New Jersey Division of Fish & Wildlife.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A public hearing has been delayed on a petition to open up the state’s medical marijuana program to ailing pets. New Mexico’s medical cannabis advisory board declined to hear the proposal Tuesday because a quorum of board members was not in attendance or available by phone. Chairwoman Laura Brown was the only board member to attend the meeting in person and apologized when several agenda items were postponed for at least 30 days. An anonymous petition would allow marijuana prescriptions for dogs with epilepsy. The petitioner contends that authorizing cannabis for animals would minimize the danger of animal abuse by regulating the use of medical marijuana with pets and provide new treatment tools to veterinarians. No state has expressly authorized medical pot for pets.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The governor says he’s put state police in charge of park police at a time of soaring attendance at state parks. Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo says the change will make it easier to deploy state resources to parks visited by 74 million people a year. Cuomo’s memorandum waives age restrictions. About 270 park police officers can become troopers if they apply and meet training requirements including a background investigation. Officers who qualify to become troopers would then attend a shortened academy. Such park officers can also remain in their current titles. The governor says executive staff members will oversee the transition over the next six months. The Albany Times Union reports the park police officers’ union hopes the change will result in better disability and retirement benefits.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nShelby: Barrels of raw pork shoulder were riding fat in a tractor-trailer pulled over by deputies. Approximately $3 million in cash was recovered from the barrels Saturday, the Cleveland County Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post Tuesday. The driver of the tractor-trailer was accused of failing to maintain his lane and impeding the flow of traffic on Interstate 85. Deputies became suspicious of the truck when a K-9 alerted them to the trailer, the post says. Deputies searched ut and discovered the cash wrapped in plastic in the barrels. The money is believed to have been obtained from drug sales throughout the region and was headed to Mexico, Sheriff Alan Norman said. “It’s one of the largest U.S. currency seizures in Cleveland County history,” Norman told The Shelby Star.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An anti-abortion group has filed a brief in defense of a state law that requires doctors to inform women they can reverse the procedure when it is carried out with medication, even though the science behind that claim is disputed. Heartbeat International Inc. and its attorneys from Alliance Defending Freedom filed the brief in federal court Tuesday. “We want to make sure women are able to know all the facts before they abort a child,” said Kevin Theriot, an attorney for the group. North Dakota is among eight states that have passed or amended laws to require doctors to tell women undergoing medication-induced abortions that they can still have a live birth after the procedure. The law that was passed this year by the state’s Republican-led Legislature and signed by GOP Gov. Doug Burgum is on hold pending a federal lawsuit.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Voting-rights advocates have urged both the state’s top lawyer and the elections chief to do more to assure that immigrants understand the voting process, after more than 350 apparent noncitizens were referred for investigation last week. A coalition of 11 groups raised their concerns in a letter to Attorney General Dave Yost and Secretary of State Frank LaRose, both Republicans, on Tuesday. Groups including the A. Philip Randolph Institute, the Ohio arms of the League of Women Voters, ACLU and Common Cause, and CAIR-Columbus said that publicly announcing investigations into potential voter irregularities involving immigrant communities is harmful. They said the probes rarely turn up serious offenses or intentional fraud, but those results are hardly ever shared with the public.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A civil rights group has filed a federal class-action lawsuit against court officials in central Oklahoma, alleging a county’s bail system unconstitutionally discriminates against poor and disabled people. The American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma filed the suit late Tuesday in federal court in Oklahoma City on behalf of six inmates currently being held in the Canadian County jail. The lawsuit alleges that the county’s bail system routinely keeps poor people in jail before a trial, not because they are a flight risk or a danger to society but only because they can’t afford to pay bail. The suit also alleges that inmates aren’t provided access to counsel when bail is set, that hearings are taking place in private, and that the system unconstitutionally discriminates against people with disabilities.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The City Council has agreed to spend up to $213,000 to open 140 warming shelter beds at two local churches. Warming shelter openings currently are driven by freezing temperatures. But under a proposed deal between the city, nonprofit and church representatives, the two shelters would remain open every night from Jan. 1 to March 31. Representatives from Church at the Park and Salem First Presbyterian Church still need to OK the deal. Salem First Presbyterian Church’s Pastor Del Burnett called the idea “marvelous” and the deadline “ridiculous.” Burnett said to his knowledge, his church was not consulted on the proposal ahead of time. The warming-shelter idea marks the latest twist as city leaders try to figure out where people experiencing homelessness should go after a public camping ban goes into effect Dec. 16.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Faculty at state universities will go without a pay raise this year but see their salaries climb at least 12% over the next three years. The four-year contract approved Wednesday covers about 5,000 professors and instructors at 14 schools. Spokesman David Pidgeon of the state System of Higher Education says the raises are expected to cost about $22 million. A similar deal has been reached with about 700 other employees who work in student services. The agreement comes three years after prolonged contract talks between the educators’ association and the state led to a three-day faculty strike.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state is offering $5 million in grants for projects that protect publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities from storm surge, winds and other natural hazards. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management and Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank announced the availability of matching grants for resilience projects last week. DEM Director Janet Coit says strengthening the facilities’ resilience is critically important, due to the changing climate that will continue to bring more intense storms and increased rainfall. Rhode Island has 19 major facilities that treat about 120 million gallons of wastewater daily. The department says many are at risk of inundation because they’re at low elevations to take advantage of gravity. Voters approved a green economy and clean water bond last year, which will fund the grants. The deadline is Jan. 30.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Mobs of kangaroos can roam largely unrestricted in the state, where laws don’t regulate ownership of the creatures. Most other states have taken a harder stance on the chaotic marsupials and either require permits or ban ownership outright, The Post and Courier reports. South Carolina has regulations on many native wildlife but little when it comes to out-of-state animals. Several laws tightening restrictions have passed over the years, including one that went into effect last year that bans the ownership of large wild cats, non-native bears and great apes. The Department of Natural Resources doesn’t even keep a list of private individuals who own wild or exotic animals, though it did track black bear ownership as recently as 2006, when about 30 owners were listed.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A Minnehaha County disaster recovery center has opened in the city to assist survivors of severe storms, flooding and tornadoes in September, according to a news release. State officials and Federal Emergency Management Agency representatives have opened the center at Southeast Technical Institute in the Ed Wood Trade and Industry Center. Hours of operation are Monday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Representatives from the state, FEMA, U.S. Small Business Administration and other organizations will staff the centers to explain available assistance programs and help connect survivors with resources that best match their recovery needs. FEMA hazard mitigation specialists will also be available to provide advice on rebuilding to avoid damage from future disasters. Homeowners, renters and businesses can register for disaster assistance before visiting a recovery center.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Singer Bettye LaVette, piano man Eddie Boyd and 1920s star Victoria Spivey are among the performers named to the Blues Hall of Fame this year. Based in Memphis, the hall honors singers, musicians, producers, songwriters, educators and pieces of music that have made significant contributions to the genre. The hall is also inducting two harmonica players this year – Billy Branch and Georgie “Harmonica” Smith, The Blues Foundation said in a news release Tuesday. Also on the list are singer and musician Syl Johnson and producer Ralph Peer, who recorded both country and blues musicians. The Howlin Wolf compilation “The Chess Box” is the only album inducted this year. Blues singles that made the cut include “3 O’Clock Blues,” by B.B. King, “Trouble in Mind,” by Bertha “Chippie” Hill, and Arthur “Big Boy” Crudup’s “That’s All Right (Mama),” Elvis Presley’s first recording at Sun Studio in Memphis in 1954.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A new judge will consider if a hospital can take a 10-month-old girl off life support despite her family’s opposition after the impartiality of the previous judge was questioned. A temporary restraining order stopping Cook Children’s Medical Center in Fort Worth from removing life-sustaining treatment for Tinslee Lewis was set to expire Tuesday. But after the removal last week of Tarrant County Juvenile Court Judge Alex Kim, a new hearing on the family’s request for a temporary injunction will now be held Thursday in Fort Worth. Cook Children’s spokeswoman Wini King said the situation is “hard all the way around.” “We would love nothing more than to be able to make her better and walk her out of here. … But there comes a point, there comes a time when we have to say: We can’t do any more. It’s not making it any better.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A legislative task force has voted to recommend a tax reform plan to the Legislature that would reduce state taxes by $160 million, double the amount in a previous proposal, officials said. The Tax Restructuring and Equalization Task Force met Monday ahead of a possible special session this week where lawmakers could address a sweeping change to the state tax code, task force members said. The latest version of the plan would decrease state income taxes by $635.5 million, while elimination of certain exemptions, new taxes and tax hikes would generate $475.5 million in new revenue, officials said. The proposal includes a food tax hike from 1.75% to the full 4.85% state sales tax rate generating $250 million by itself, officials said.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: About 470 miles of snowmobile trails in the Green Mountain National Forest are going to be ready for the opening of the 2019-2020 snowmobile season, National Forest officials said. Weather and snow conditions permitting, nearly 5,000 miles of trails in the national forest and throughout Vermont will be opening Monday and running through April 15. “We are concerned about user safety,” said John Sinclair, Forest Supervisor for the Green Mountain and Finger Lakes National Forests. “Patrols which are aimed at enforcing rules and regulations, monitoring trail conditions and providing visitor information will occur throughout the Forest.” Due to heavy snow last month in parts of southern Vermont, forest service employees and snowmobile clubs have been working to clear trees and other debris from the trails.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: A private Christian university founded by Pat Robertson will remain accredited for another 10 years. Regent University said in a statement Wednesday that its accreditation was reaffirmed by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. The commission oversees 11 states. Regent is based in Virginia Beach and has nearly doubled its student population to more than 10,000 in the past five years. The school was founded in 1978 and first received accreditation in 1984. Robertson is well-known as a religious broadcaster who founded the Christian Broadcasting Network and for hosting the television show The 700 Club. Gerson Moreno-Riano, executive vice president for academic affairs, said in a statement that Regent will serve for years to come as a destination for “students preparing to become Christian leaders to change the world.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan says the city will invest a record $110 million into affordable housing this year. The Seattle Times reports the funding will go toward the construction and redevelopment of 1,944 new units across the city. Durkan stressed the urgent need for affordable housing in a time of great economic growth and displacement. “Look, we know that our city has grown so rapidly, and so many people have been pushed out of the community instantly, that I think it really threatens who we are as a city,” Durkan said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The House of Delegates will reconvene this month to continue the second special legislative session, officials say. Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw issued a call for the chamber to meet Monday at noon. A spokesman for the House said lawmakers will take up a bill to extend a tourism tax credit to 2025. The Senate has already passed the measure. Lawmakers returned to the Capitol last month for their second special session of the year to take up the tax credit bill, a proposal to stop expunging DUI convictions and a measure to allow the state to pay off a road bond. The DUI bill and the road bond bill quickly passed and were signed into law by Republican Gov. Jim Justice.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state will no longer categorically deny Medicaid coverage for medically necessary gender-confirming surgery, a practice a federal judge found violated patients’ civil rights and federal health care law. Lawyers for transgender residents who sued last year announced a settlement Tuesday after the deadline had passed for the state to appeal last month’s final judgment in the class-action case. U.S. District Judge William Conley, of Madison, noted the “consensus within the medical profession (is) that gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition, which if left untreated or inadequately treated can cause adverse symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, serious mental distress, self-harm, and suicidal ideation.” Four named plaintiffs will share about $840,000 in damages, and the state will pay about $1.35 million in legal fees to three law firms who handled their case.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state faces more tough times ahead but isn’t headed off a fiscal cliff, offering time for a thoughtful approach to delivering government services to citizens without running up deficits, Gov. Mark Gordon told lawmakers in outlining his first state budget this week. Gordon cautioned, however, that an upcoming revenue forecast in January may be less optimistic than one in October, shortly before he released his $3.1 billion biennial budget proposal for 2021-2022. “Navigating for these challenging times will require sacrifice, care and thought,” Gordon, who took office in January, told the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee. The powerful committee met in its traditional conference room on the third floor of the Capitol for the first time after four years of renovations to the over 130-year-old sandstone structure.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/12"}]}

There’s something about the rustic venue in the middle of the desert that enhances the musical experience.\n\nFor three of the five bands who listed The Beatles as a musical influence, it was fitting for them to perform where McCartney entertained in October in between his two Desert Trip performances.\n\n\"It's insane. So many great bands have performed here,\" said singer-guitarist Brent Simpson of Daytime Moon, who counts himself as a Beatles fan.\n\nREAD MORE: Tachevah artists at Pappy's represent growth of desert music scene\n\nREAD MORE: Tachevah talent range best-ever for video showcase starting Friday\n\nThe showcase was hosted by Teddy Quinn, the former host of the weekly open mic night at Pappy and Harriet’s.\n\nThe judges included Spike Edney, keyboard player and music director of Queen, Jessica von Rabbit, a solo artist and co-leader of Gram Rabbit, and Bruce Fessier, music writer for The Desert Sun.\n\nThe second semi-final showcase is March 30 at Palm Canyon Roadhouse in Palm Springs.

He also started his show with a person on stage dressed in a cow costume and passed out light sticks so people could wave them in the air during his performance.\n\n\"It's not just a performance for the crowd it's also a performance for myself because I enjoy music,\" said Isaac, joined on stage by friend G-Walk.\n\nIsaac grew up in the desert where he attended Palm Desert High School and has also appeared on a couple reality shows including MTVs “True Life” when he was 18 and ABC Family’s “Startup U” series in 2015.\n\nREAD MORE: Entrepreneur Shawn Isaac of Rancho Mirage on 'Startup U'\n\nHe has recorded with John Legend, Snoop Dogg, DJ Mustard and Kurupt and played the local venues, including opening up for Aubrey O’Day’s Dumblonde during the Sinner & Saints Halloween Ball in 2015.\n\nA product of the desert, Isaac performed the anthemic song he submitted for the competition called \"Coachella\" that captures the vibe in the desert and kept the crowd moving.\n\nKayves\n\nNext on stage was Kayves, an electro-rock band from Cathedral City influenced by Joy Division, Bloc Party, Interpol and The Cure.\n\nThe band is made up of Nick Hernandez on vocals, Edgar Limon on bass, Adrian Romero on drums, and Oscar Rico and Danny Gonzalez on guitar.\n\n\"We've all wanted to play here for the longest time ever. We're still a new band so this is gonna be a boost definitely,\" said Hernandez of their performance.\n\nThough new, they created quite a fan base with the crowd chanting their name and demanding more after their allotted time was up. So they played one more for the appreciative crowd.\n\nBrosQuitos\n\nLast to hit the stage was The BrosQuitos of Desert Hot Springs – a high-energy crowd pleaser featuring James Johnson on vocals and guitar, Max Powell on bass, John Clark on lead guitarist and Hugo Chavez on drums.\n\nTheir performance Thursday marked their third trip to the semifinals. They finished second last year in the finals.\n\nThey keep coming back year after year because they think it's a great way to get their sound out there.\n\n\"It's a good way to push ourselves. We see the talent coming out here, you always see something new and it motivates us, \" said Clark.\n\nDesert Sun reporter Bruce Fessier contributed to this report.\n\nIf you go:\n\nThe next Tachevah semifinal showcase is March 30 at Palm Canyon Roadhouse in Palm Springs. Five bands will compete for two spots in the final on May 18 at The Date Shed in Indio.\n\nFor more Tachevah coverage go to Tachevahmusic.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/04/21/girl-named-tom-won-the-voice-south-bend-ties-tours/7304542001/", "title": "Girl Named Tom won 'The Voice.' Now, trio with South Bend ties tours", "text": "Jack Walton\n\nTribune Correspondent\n\nWhen siblings Caleb, Joshua and Bekah Liechty formed their acoustic vocal trio, Girl Named Tom, they could never have imagined the changes that awaited them.\n\nThe Liechtys had always been precociously talented singers and musicians, but the group was merely supposed to be a way to have fun in the years prior to all three siblings entering the medical field.\n\nThen came the pandemic, a move to South Bend from their hometown in Ohio and, most important of all to their professional aspirations, an audition for NBC's \"The Voice.\"\n\nGirl Named Tom on 'The Voice':South Bend band Girl Named Tom nails 'The Voice' audition. Work with Kelly Clarkson next.\n\nSuccess came in a rush throughout the fall of 2021.\n\nGirl Named Tom garnered the rare four-chair turn from the celebrity judges, and the Liechtys found themselves under the tutelage of coach Kelly Clarkson.\n\nWeek after week, they survived elimination rounds and emerged as frontrunners. They also became the first act on the show to have four songs on the iTunes Top 10 list at the same time.\n\nBut a private grief tempered their enthusiasm. Their father, Chris Liechty, had been diagnosed with cancer in 2017, and his treatments were not going well.\n\nOn Dec. 14, Girl Named Tom won Season 21 of \"The Voice,\" the first time a group had done so.\n\nWinners:Girl Named Tom wins 'The Voice' and makes history despite worries about dad's health\n\nThat night, however, the trio posted a message to Twitter in which they announced their father was \"in horrific pain\" after a surgery and that they would be flying to Ohio \"as soon as possible\" to be with family.\n\nOn Jan. 27, Chris Liechty died. He was only 56.\n\nPsalm 23 and local ties\n\nCurrently, Girl Named Tom is writing songs, playing gigs and making plans for future recording sessions. On April 23, the trio performs two concerts (both already sold out) at the Blue Gate Theater in Shipshewana.\n\nChris made his children promise not to derail their newfound careers by spending too much time in mourning.\n\nHe asked them not to cancel any concerts. For the most part, they obeyed, canceling only one show that they just couldn't bring themselves to do.\n\nThey also honor him by playing his music at their concerts. Chris was a prolific songwriter, and his musical setting of Psalm 23 (\"The Lord Is My Shepherd\") is now a Girl Named Tom concert staple.\n\n\"It's one of our favorite songs to sing,\" Joshua said by telephone during a car ride from Nashville, Tenn., to visit their hometown of Pettisville, Ohio. \"It already has those beautiful, beautiful words, and he gave it such a great melody. Now, of course, it has taken on a new meaning for us.\"\n\nIt's long been part of their repertoire and was one of the first songs the siblings ever arranged as a trio.\n\n\"When we were just starting as a band, he said that he wondered what we might do with Psalm 23,\" Bekah said. \"It was one of the earliest songs to make our setlist. We've played it in a room for 12 people and we just played it at a festival with 2,700 people. It touches a lot of hearts.\"\n\nLocal support:Goshen College rallies around Girl Named Tom as the trio shines on 'The Voice'\n\nBoth brothers are graduates of Goshen College, and Bekah was to follow in their footsteps until she deferred acceptance in order to focus on Girl Named Tom.\n\nThe siblings moved to South Bend in order to be closer to Joshua's then-girlfriend who was studying at Indiana University South Bend. Although they have now decamped for Nashville as their headquarters, South Bend will always be important to them.\n\nThey hunkered down to wait out the COVID-19 pandemic and write songs together in their South Bend house, and South Bend was their official city when they started on \"The Voice.\"\n\n\"Being in Nashville will make our lives a lot easier. We'll launch our tours from there, and that's where our management is,\" Joshua said. \"We love being part of the music scene there.\"\n\nWriting and performing\n\nBy the end of their run on \"The Voice,\" the Liechtys were singing songs that were chosen for them by Clarkson and the network's team. Now, they are fully in control of those decisions again.\n\n\"For these shows, we're doing most of the favorites that we sang on 'The Voice,' as well as a lot of our own original music,\" Bekah said. \"It's a blend of the familiar and a lot of things our audience has never heard before. Most of our new songs haven't even been recorded yet.\"\n\nCaleb is now 27, Joshua turned 25 on Easter and Bekah is 21. All three are maturing as songwriters. Caleb described their writing process.\n\n'The world is craving harmony right now':'We're all so proud': Goshen College cheers as Girl Named Tom wins 'The Voice'\n\n\"Typically, one sibling will flesh out an idea as much as possible and then bring it to the other two siblings, and together we take it to a new level,\" Caleb said. \"Recently, though, we've been experimenting with building songs together from scratch. We all have our different strengths as writers.\"\n\nAll three play multiple instruments at a high level, skills that were de-emphasized on \"The Voice\" in order to focus more on the vocals. The instrumental prowess — such as Bekah's high facility with the flute — still comes as a surprise to many fans who know the siblings only as singers.\n\n\"We've been trying our songs in different ways, figuring out which arrangement serves the songs the best,\" Caleb said. \"Usually, that means me on guitar while Bekah and Joshua decide how to add their own instruments and voices.\"\n\n\"It comes down to what the song is asking for,\" Joshua said. \"Is it asking for a harmonica? A piano solo? A flute solo?\"\n\n\"I'm always pulling for a flute solo,\" Bekah said with a laugh.\n\nThe trio's sweet spot has always been close harmony in a mellow, acoustic setting. They have been working on a further dimension: rocking out.\n\n\"We're touring with a bassist and a drummer now, and with them on board, we can tap into a higher level of energy,\" Joshua said. \"It's been so much fun to have this higher ceiling in terms of how much sound we can generate.\"\n\nIn concert\n\n• Who: Girl Named Tom\n\n• Where: Blue Gate Theatre, 105 E.

In the three years since her previous release, the singer went through a divorce, quit drinking, become a death doula, started the observational podcast “What I’m Looking At” and toured and recorded with Loma, the trio she formed with Dan Duszynski and Jonathan Meiburg. After setting the tone with an experimental mood piece that finds her repeating the line \"What is your wish?\" she settles into an album that favors more song-oriented fare without abandoning the eccentricities that make that first track what it is.

The album follows 2017's “Moh Lhean,” which found him adopting a more reflective world view in the wake of a health scare while at the same time drifting into haunted psychedelic folk. As PopMatters noted, “It’s as if he has suddenly come to terms with his place in the world and that has translated into music which is warmer, looser, and more liberated.”\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Sept. 6.

Q magazine calls it \"a stunning, stealthy, faintly malevolent collection of songs that serve as a reminder of this songwriter's power and innovation.\" It's kind of amazing how much of her edge she's managed to retain more than 30 years after grabbing our attention by the throat.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 8.

They're fronted by singer-guitarists Devon Allman (Gregg's son) and Duane Betts (Dickey's son, whose first name is a tip of the hat to the late Duane Allman).

They're playing Mesa on a tour celebrating their 20th anniversary. \"The Wilderness,\" their latest album, earned a perfect score from the reviewer at the Austin Chronicle, who called it \"textured, ornate, and somehow seeping into the deepest parts of you.\" The Line of Best Fit also loved \"The Wilderness,\" calling is \"thrillingly foreign yet familiar in its finest moments.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 11.

But despite the introspective nature of the lyrics and the way the first song sounds like it was captured in the middle of a dream, it doesn’t feel like the work of a bedroom-pop auteur. Too many of the album’s highlights rock too much to warrant that description, from the richly orchestrated pop charms of “The Bus Song” to the post-punk grinding of “1 Billion Dogs.” And the followup will be here by the time she gets to Phoenix.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 11.

We’re a new band. We just came out.\" They've actually been doing this since 1991, and it shows. In a good way.

Our reporter Kellie Hwang is posting highlights and updates from the festival all weekend. Check back for insider details now through Sunday.\n\nMONDAY\n\nSunday night recap\n\nAfter three days of listening, dancing, sharing, creating and experiencing at FORM Arcosanti, the carefree festival in the high desert has come to the end. Perfume Genius performed a set on Sunday night that many festival goers are calling one of the best of the weekend, and Julianna Barwick and Tortoise followed. DJ Mija performed the final late night show down in the canyon for festival goers powering through until the end. The last sleep-deprived participants packed up their belongings to catch the shuttles to the ParkCosanti lot for their drive or flights home. While there was a lost and found on site, several participants have been posting about lost items on the private Facebook page, and commenting to make sure Arcosanti is left as beautiful as it was found. Many shared their favorite photos and stories for the weekend, and some offering feedback for next year.\n\nSUNDAY\n\n7:20 p.m. Shuttle trouble?\n\nPatrons leaving FORM tonight were told there would be shuttles running from 5 to midnight. Apparently the large charter buses were not ordered ahead of time, so the smaller shuttles used to give rides to artists and others involved in the event are being utilized. While the buses hold considerably less people and luggage, so far the runs seem to be going smoothly, and luckily the parking lot is only a few minutes away. But this could prove to be more difficult later in the evening when perhaps more people want to leave after certain acts. Let's hope everyone makes it out on time.\n\nProgramming runs through midnight tonight with Tyondai Braxton, Perfume Genius, Julianna Barwick and Tortoise still to perform. A late night show with Mija and Friends happens at 1 a.m. Many festival goers are staying until Monday. This reporter is signing off and will head home shortly,and w ill post a Sunday night recap tomorrow morning.\n\n5:33 p.m. Bill Callahan\n\nThe singer-songwriter from Maryland performed a set that was perfect for an early evening unwind. Callahan played acoustic guitar and harmonica, soothing the crowd with his signature baritone voice. A guitarist, bassist and drummer joined him, all seated, for Callahan's musical storytelling.\n\n3 p.m. LNZNDRF\n\nIn January, brothers Scott and Bryan Devendorf of the The National and Ben Lanz of Beirut announced their new album as joint project LNZNDRF (an acronym for their last lames). The band showed up on the main stage dressed in matching blue and white tie-dye jumpsuits, with mostly chillwave songs and powerful instrumentals. Singer Scott switched gears for one track, jamming on his electric guitar, hopping across the stage and taking out some microphones and other equipment.\n\n2:05 p.m. Stay hydrated!\n\nCheck-in volunteers encouraged festival goers to drink three times as much water as they normally would since the event is in the high desert. They were also asked to bring their own water bottles to refill a the fountains, and ethically sourced water company, Just, provided boxed spring water that have been placed out in various spots for anyone to grab.\n\n11:22 a.m. Live polka music\n\nFestival goers were treated to polka music show cliffside late this morning, with some stopping to hang out and watch, and many passerby enjoying the unexpected treat.\n\n11 a.m. Arcosanti tour\n\nWhile the urban laboratory is closed to outside visitors this weekend, residents still offered some tours to festival goers, showcasing Paolo Soleri's vision for a self-sustaining city that utilizes arcology. Arcosanti is built on a 4,000-acre land preserve in the high desert, allowing the town to operate without further civilization encroaching. Tall cypress trees surround Arcosanti proper, reminiscent of Soleri's birthplace in Italy. Visitors visited the Foundry Apse where Arcosanti's famous bronze bells are created, requiring five artisans to pour the bronze. Demonstrations weren't happening over the weekend but the group learned that the bells can only be made at Arcosanti and in Cosanti, a studio in Paradise Valley.\n\nSaturday night recap\n\nCreators of the FORM music festival, Hundred Waters, closed out the main stage with a resounding set complete with a mesmerizing light show. Lead singer Nicole Miglis played a number of songs on piano, and the band even brought out two back-up singers in glittering gowns. Miglis acknowledged the hard working staff and the band took a bow at the end of their gorgeous set.\n\nDown at the Elestial Stage, the weekend's surprise guests were ready to perform on the colorful stage. Festival goers made their way down in droves, their flashlights and headlamps dotting the multiple paths down to the canyon. Local Natives kept the momentum of the weekend going, firing through favorites including \"Airplanes\" and \"Breakers,\" along with new single \"Past Lives\" and a slew of other to-be-released tracks. They closed out with a fervent rendition of \"Sun Hands,\" lead singer Taylor Rice leaping into the audience and igniting a mosh pit. The night closed out with a set by DJ Mija performing all Prince songs.\n\nSATURDAY\n\n10 p.m. Dan Deacon brings childhood fun into set\n\nIf you've never experienced a Dan Deacon set, you're missing out. The boisterous Baltimore-based DJ is known for his wild and interactive sets, bringing crowds of all sizes together to play human tunnel, have dance contests and participate in follow-the-leader interpretive dancing. While most of the upbeat set was fun and games, Deacon also got a bit serious with a final joint activity. He asked the audience to think of someone they lost, someone they love, and someone of color who lost their life to authority figures. He drove home the point that all humans should respect each other, which resulted in a resounding cheer.\n\n8:15 p.m. Moses Sumney plays intimate set to big crowd\n\nMoses Sumney was actually listed as performing on the much smaller APSE stage, which must have been a misprint because he is well-known to FORM. Sumney's dreamy vocals floating through an almost silent, packed amphitheater was a perfect representation of what FORM is all about: creating beautiful melodies in an personable and respectful environment. Sumney performed a daytime set last year, and audiences loved his stunning vocals. He layered his melodies by looping his voice and creating other sounds by clapping and beating on his microphone. The San Bernardino-based singer even joked to the crowd, yelling: \"Coachella 2016!\" in reference to the popular music festival, and the audienes responded with laughter. He played a new track, and revealed he is working on his first full-length album.\n\n7:21 p.m. Sunset\n\nThe ceramics building is already a popular place for festival goers to snap photos atop. During dinner time, a lot of people realized it was also the perfect place to watch the sunset.\n\n6:17 p.m. Braids plays an impressive set\n\nThe powerful set by the Montreal-based band showcased the versatile range of lead singer Raphaelle Standell-Preston and the talented instrumentation from her band. Many in the crowd said it was the best set so far of the weekend.\n\n5:36 p.m. Empress Of gets a standing ovation\n\nThe New York-based singer of Spanish-Honduran descent put on an energetic set that prompted many to get up and dance. Lorely Rodriguez, better known as Empress Of, had a genuine sweetness about her, graciously thanking the crowd many times, leading to a standing ovation after her set.\n\n4 p.m. Rival Consoles at APSE\n\nThe APSE stage is small but unique, right underneath the unique architecture of the ceramics building. Rival Consoles performed under the arch while festival goers watched on the grass, on the hills and under the trees. Some climbed atop the arch to get photos from above.\n\n3:17 p.m. Massages with a view\n\nGot an ache? Sore muscles? Or just want to relax? There's a full-on masseuse at FORM Arcosanti offering massage work and other treatments such as cupping. Not to mention the awesome location under the shady trees, overlooking the canyon.\n\n1:43 p.m. OWSLA Beats 1 Radio Show\n\nFestival goers lined up to get into the pool, situated overlooking the canyon. Capacity was only 100, so the policy was one in, one out. The pool water was quite frigid, so only a few brave souls were actually swimming. OWSLA hosted their Beats 1 Radio Show, taking some time to set up because the weather was so windy, they couldn't get the canopy to stay put. The pool quickly transformed from a chill area to a full on pool party.\n\n1:04 p.m. Wait, is that guy buried in the ground?\n\nFor any festival-goers heading to the pool, it was surprising to see the head of a man sticking out of the ground. Los Angeles-based artist Bert Rodriguez \"planted\" himself into the ground for his piece \"What a Tree Feels Like,\" a project he previously showcased at the entrance to Miami's Bass Museum of Art. Curious passerby stopped to snap photos and chat with the artist.\n\n12:11 p.m. Cliffside concert from Bing & Ruth\n\nThe cliffside views at Arcosanti are a prime area for FORM attendees to snap photos, relax on the edge and just soak up the beauty of the desert. The inspirational nature of Arcosanti's landscape led musician David Moore of Bing & Ruth to set up a piano right on the edge of a scenic spot, and perform a graceful and beautiful set. Patrons tip-toed their way through the area, quietly taking in the show and filming video.\n\n10:48 a.m. Rooftop yoga, anyone?\n\nArcosanti resident yogi Tabitha Marks led a morning yoga session on the rooftop to anyone who needed a good stretch after dancing and sleeping on the dirt ground. The desert views from the roof are sweeping and inspiring.\n\n9:12 a.m. Long lines for breakfast, showers\n\nWith the sun blaring down on the campground in the early hours, bleary-eyed festival goers were up early starting their day. With only four makeshift outdoor shower stalls for a majority of the people, the lines were long. Some threw on their swimsuits and went for a dip in the pool instead. Saffron Jak and Chicken and Waffles for the People were the only food trucks operating, so there were lots of hungry people waiting. Luckily the staffs in both trucks were working swiftly to feed everyone, and no one seemed to mind the wait. Dishes included breakfast pizza with hollandaise and a poached egg, yogurt parfaits and waffles topped with fresh berries. In the Vaults, the only coffee option was cold brew, so again, there were long lines. But it moved quickly and the caffeine was satisfying.\n\nFriday night recap\n\nSkrillex took the stage immediately after Four Tet, powering through his hour set with nonstop energy and a stage full of people adding to the club-like vibe. He thanked Hundred Waters on multiple occasions, telling the audience they are special and to go make friends with everyone. He finished after 12:30 a.m., more than a half hour late according to the schedule, and was whisked away to the Elestial Stage down in the canyon. Festival goers with enough energy to continue the partying trekked down the rocky dirt path to the unique and awe-inspiring stage built by the Florida-based artist collective. Skrillex and Four Tet already started into their B2B set (as in they shared the stage) with exuberance, with no slowing down in sight. In fact, while this reporter was already back at her tent, the music continued until 6:30 a.m.\n\nFRIDAY\n\n10:36 p.m. Sound issues during Four Tet\n\nKieran Hebden, a.k.a. Four Tet, took the stage after 10 p.m. on Saturday night and almost immediately encountered sound issues. One of the speakers sounded blown out, prompting the English DJ to stop his set to investigate. For the next 20 minutes or so, Hebden kept playing on and off, unphased, and the crowd cheered him on regardless. Technicians scurried around the stage trying to figure out the source of the issue. Hebden tried moving the speakers closest to him, and also transferred the sound just to one side. Finally the techs rerouted the wires and the sound was back to normal. Hebden's creative and powerful set after was impressive, and worth the technical issues.\n\n9:38 p.m. Bonobo and booze\n\nThe last few festival goers are trickling in and finding any available space in the packed campground. Don Julio tequila brought out an Airstream trailer that features four specialty cocktails, including a Monsoon Paloma made with blanco tequila, lime juice, grapefruit, creosote and CO2. Bonobo has taken the stage, showcasing a mesmerizing light show with his signature chillwave beats. Next up is Four Tet at 10 p.m., followed by Skrillex at 11 p.m. on the AMP stage.\n\n6:22 p.m. Festival Fashion Day 1\n\nBring together a group of creative people to a music festival, and you're bound to get some imaginative and stylish outfits. Day one say some fun bright colors, bohemian prints and vintage looks.\n\n6:11 p.m. DAWN\n\nDawn Richard, better known as DAWN, is best known for her career in Danity Kane (ie. from \"Making the Band 3\" on MTV). Her set was definitely embraced by festival goers looking to dance, with her impressive vocals and backup dancers getting audience members on their feet.\n\n4:38 p.m. Autre Ne Veut set\n\nArthur Ashin, better known as Autre Ne Veut, is the first act on the main AMP stage at FORM. He's already wowing the crowd with his passionate vocals and his back up band's intense melodies.\n\n3:12 p.m. The Vaults\n\nThe Vaults at Arcosanti are one of the congregating areas at FORM. Festival goers can visit the bar, stocked with pre-mixed cocktails including Don Julio spicy margaritas and Old Fashioned drinks, pick up any toiletries at the general store or take a nap on the outdoor beds.\n\n1:02 p.m. Minds Garden Campground\n\nAfter volunteers helped unload the buses, festival-goers rushed to grab a spot at the Minds Garden campground. Staff and volunteers snagged the coveted spots overlooking the canyon or under trees. Quarter are close with tents only a few feet from each other, offering a feeling of community right off the bat. Already campers were lending each other mattress pumps and rubber hammers for stakes, sharing beers and stories of arriving to the dusty high desert of Arcosanti.\n\n11:32 a.m. FORM Arcosanti Check-In\n\nWelcome to the third annual FORM Arcosanti music festival, hosted by indie rock back Hundred Waters. This year, all festival goers check in offsite, just down the road at \"ParkCosanti\" near the Cordes Junction Motel. Early birds arrived right at 11 a.m., and check in ran smoothly. Volunteers loaded up two shuttle buses with necessities such as tents, sleeping bags, suitcases and coolers, and not-so-necessary but fun items including cases of beer, hula hoops and even a big bag of colorful plastic balls (not quite sure what that will be used for). Patrons have come from all over the world, and received FORM wristbands and three drink tickets for the weekend. Check in runs until midnight.\n\nKeep reading below for all the details about FORM Arcosanti and why it's an awesome event for Arizona.\n\nAn unorthodox music festival held in the tiny experimental community of Arcosanti in the Verde Valley is attracting national attention.\n\nFrom May 13-15, 1,200 musicians, artists and other creative types will take over Arcosanti to perform, collaborate and inspire one another.\n\nIn just its third year, FORM Arcosanti has grown from 350 participants and attracted the attention of publications including the New York Times, Billboard and Spin magazine.\n\nWhen FORM co-founder Zach Tetreault first visited Arcosanti in 2013 with his band, Hundred Waters, he immediately knew it was a special place.\n\nThe futuristic architecture, welcoming residents and artistic creativity made it the perfect place to nurture an idea the band was mulling over. The Los Angeles-based indie rockers had been touring extensively, playing more than 200 shows, and were burned out.\n\n\"The process really kind of wore us down creatively in terms of what we started doing live shows for,\" Tetreault said. \"We wanted to do a show or series for free somewhere, in an inspiring location, but we didn't know where.\n\n\"We set up a road trip moving from Florida to LA. My friend Paul, who studied architecture in college, took us to a bunch of places. We got to Arcosanti, and it really clicked for me. I knew this was a great place to kick this concept off.\"\n\nGET SOCIAL WITH AZCENTRAL: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest\n\nSeeking a way to recharge\n\nArcosanti is an experiment in communal living built by famed architect Paolo Soleri, who envisioned a city that revolves around radical designs and environmental accountability. The band happened to be there the night of a community council meeting. Tetreault was encouraged to pitch his idea of a laid-back show, mostly for friends and family, that would be a way for the band to recharge and get its creative juices flowing again. Over the next six months, the idea evolved into a three-day event where patrons would camp out and mingle with musicians and Arcosanti residents.\n\nThus, FORM Arcosanti was born.\n\n\"We're trying to explore architecture that allows people to connect with each other at Arcosanti, that leads us to a common ground,\" said Jeff Stein, co-president of the Cosanti Foundation, the Arcosanti support organization.\n\n\"When Zach and his friends from Hundred Waters showed up here, they really got Arcosanti and its values right away. The event that they proposed to us is right in keeping with Arcosanti's experimental nature, understanding of collaboration and wholeness.\"\n\nFORM is such a departure from the many corporate-sponsored music festivals held every year that it caught the attention of national publications including the New York Times, Billboard, Pitchfork, Vice and Spin magazine. A Vice writer called it the \"festival of the future.\"\n\nThe Times wrote a piece about choosing not to cover Coachella and Bonnaroo this year because the festivals have strayed from their founding principles and offer predictable lineups. In April 2015, Grammy-winning producer Diplo tweeted: \"Skipping Coachella is the new Coachella.\"\n\nWANT MORE ARTS? Neil deGrasse Tyson discusses science, movies | Top 15 Phoenix arts events in May | See 'Bill Maher' writer Scott Carter's 'Discord' at Herberger 5/7-29\n\nA big deal for Arizona\n\nPhoenix resident Anna Warble is production manager for Walter Productions, known for its whimsical, larger-than-life art cars including Kalliope and Walter the Bus. She attended FORM last year and said the event is a big deal for Arizona.\n\n\"We don’t have any festivals that get national recognition, and we're kind off the map when it comes to emerging culture,\" Warble said. \"There’s so many festivals nowadays. Throw a dart on the map and you'll hit a festival somewhere. It's amazing for us to not only have one, but one that is so unique.\"\n\nFORM began in 2014 with 350 guests. Last year, 750 attended. This year there will be 1,200 participants: a mix of carefully chosen artists, musicians, writers, educators, architects and other creative types. More than 5,000 applicants were asked what roles creativity and collaboration play in their lives, and what they would gain from attending.\n\n\"We've curated a well-rounded group of people to come,\" Tetreault said. \"We chose thoughtful, exciting and interesting people to spend the weekend together. They're people from all over the world, from all walks of life.\"\n\nEveryone in the lineup has touched Tetreault or Hundred Waters in some way. This year's performers include Skrillex, Bonobo, Four Tet, Tortoise, Perfume Genius, Bill Callahan, Hundred Waters, Moses Sumney and Julianna Barwick, who performed last year.\n\nRELATED: FORM Arcosanti returns May 13-15 with Skrillex\n\n\"Last year's experience was a completely magical, utopian one with many wonders for the eyes and the ears, and many new friends made,\" Barwick said. \"FORM is a treat for the artist and the festival goer. It's totally unforgettable and possibly my most favorite festival I've ever been a part of.\"\n\nSkrillex and Bonobo will share the stage for a late-night set on Friday, and Saturday's late-night slot teases \"very special guests.\" Last year, the special guest was Skrillex.\n\n\"Skrillex is a good friend of mine and he's such a huge component in what we are doing,\" Tetreault said. \"He's a great ambassador, and he knows how to and likes to talk about (FORM). It's about bringing artists and creators together. It's not about the money. It's about being inspired, and it's a creative recharge for a lot of people.\"\n\nMusic and art overlap\n\nElestial Sound, a Florida-based artist cooperative, will showcase a new unique performance stage. The Boiler Room underground music site will live stream and do podcasts with artists. Beats 1 Radio will produce a show by the pool. And Walter Productions' Peace Train will be back this year.\n\n\"It's a lesser-known vehicle in our fleet,\" Warble said. \"It consists of three trailers, all former World War II radio communications trailers. We wanted to make them vehicles of peace instead of war. Each trailer has a theme: love, gratitude and forgiveness, in order of the easiest to the most difficult. These are the three ingredients that help us find peace.\"\n\nLast year, the Peace Train was set up in a canyon as an after-party location, offering a place where artists and staff could decompress and connect with one other. This year, it will be in the middle of the main campground as a chill space, Warble said.\n\nIn addition to scheduled concerts, spur-of-the-moment performances pop up throughout the weekend. A new cultural series will present speakers including Zach Anner, a comedian and actor who starred in a show on the OWN network called \"Rollin' With Zach.\" Meditation and yoga sessions will be offered first thing in the morning, and there will be food trucks and other dining options.\n\nThe 1,200 participants, who attend for free, will camp rustic-style. Patrons, who paid $1,223-$2,233 to attend, will sleep in weatherproof shelters with beds, lighting and charging stations, and have access to hot showers, flush toilets and other perks.\n\nThings To Do app: Get the best in events, dining and travel right on your device\n\nAn experiment in collaborative living\n\nArcosanti is a project from the Cosanti Foundation, founded by Soleri. He and his team of designers, students and architects set out to build an experimental community for 5,000 residents that seamlessly blends architecture and ecology. Soleri died in 2013, and his Cosanti Foundation and the Arcosanti residents continue that vision.\n\nStein and 80 other people live there year-round, working for the foundation as architects, builders, planners, educators, archivists and tour guides. Some residents also manage the performing arts center, which hosts a number of concerts and performances each year. Other residents are part of the Cosanti Originals craft business, making the famed bronze and clay windbells.\n\n\"A lot of people have considered Arcosanti a lot of things, where we've built a series of buildings meant to connect people to each other and to their surroundings,\" Stein said. \"We're out here in the middle of central Arizona at the end of a two-mile unpaved road, and yet it's not really that isolated. We have nearly 50,000 people coming throughout a year to see the place.\"\n\nArcosanti calls itself an \"urban laboratory\" and is open for tours daily.

And it ended on a high note with Huffington Post premiering their new video for “One Time,” which the critic hailed as “premium!”\n\nThe article goes on to say, “Two factors make ‘One Time’ wickedly powerful and evocative: first, the song’s Spartan melody, which is totally bereft of harmonic layering and digital enhancement, just a single acoustic guitar. And second, the spine-chilling, devouring potency of (Jordan) White’s highly charged vocals.”\n\nIt's a striking video, shot by Brian Dellis, who complements the understated, acoustic-guitar-and-voice recording by keeping the camera trained on White, a captivating presence, as she walks the streets singing the bittersweet lyrics (in a really nice coat).\n\nThe song was recorded at Switchblade Studios in Tempe as a demo while working on pre-production for the upcoming Jane N' The Jungle project. As White says, the \"raw demo recording captured something uniquely beautiful and pure with having no added effects, overdubs, vocal correction, and very little production.\"\n\nThey also felt it didn't really fit the album they plan to release in 2018, so they decided to share it as a single and release it as \"an end-of-the-year reflective song.\"\n\nThe video was directed by Dellis with the same intention as the demo, to keep it simple hoping to capture raw authentic moments.\n\nRolling Stone names Phoenix native Tommy Ash a country artist you need to know\n\nPhoenix native Tommy Ash, a veteran of the local scene who now resides in Nashville, was named to a Rolling Stone magazine's list of 10 New Country Artists You Need to Know.\n\nThe magazine described her sound as \"country shuffles, train beats and honky-tonk heartbreak, all delivered by a magnetic entertainer who's been serenading barflies since the age of 13.\" The writer cited Dwight Yoakam, Waylon Jennings and Margo Price as fairly spot-on frames of reference.\n\nAnd Ash is quoted in the article as saying, \"I make revved-up honky-tonk bar-room music. It's not mellow. It really moves.\"\n\nThe story talks about the singer growing up \"a bar-room baby,\" hanging out at country gigs in Arizona with her mom and dad before taking the stage in her early teens, where she sang country covers every Friday and Saturday night at a Phoenix roadhouse.\n\nAsh, who moved to Nashville in 2016, shared a link to Rolling Stone on Facebook, where she wrote, \"Umm Holy S--t guys!!!!!! I am so BEYOND EXCITED to share this with you! ROLLING STONE included me in The Top 10 New Country Artists You Need to Know!!!! I can't thank you all enough for your support and love you have all given me throughout the years. Xoxo.\"\n\nReached for further comment, she told acentral, \"It is such an honor to be mentioned as one of the 10 New Country Artists You Need to Know by Rolling Stone. I've been doing this for so long, it feels good to get a little recognition for the hard work and to know that people are paying attention to true country music.\"\n\nDoc Jones looking to make 2018 biggest year yet for International Jazz Day in Arizona\n\nDoc Jones is a man on a mission.\n\nNo sooner had International Jazz Day ended in late April than Jones, a music educator who plays saxophone and keyboards, was making plans for 2018, which he hopes will be the biggest year yet for the annual event here in the Valley.\n\n“My wife says, ‘You don’t ever stop,’” Jones says. “But it’s all one thing. It’s all about International Jazz Day. I done got caught up in this for the last seven years. And I think it’s wonderful, man.”\n\nInternational Jazz Day was founded in 2011 by Herbie Hancock, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz \"to highlight jazz and its diplomatic role of uniting people in all corners of the globe.\"\n\nJones held the first International Jazz Day celebration in the Valley in 2013, a year after attending Jazz Day in New Orleans.\n\n“They had 7,000 people out there at about 8 o’clock in the morning,” he recalls. “It was a phenomenal site. And after the concert, which was simulcast around the world, I had an opportunity to talk to Herbie Hancock for 5 or 10 minutes. I showed him my jazz magazine that I published in New Orleans. And Herbie said, “Doc man, you’ve got a platform. You need to be marketing this day. It’s gonna be big one year.”\n\nAfter getting City Council member Michael Johnson on board, Jones arranged an introduction with George Benson, who as Jones says, “allowed me to use his personality and his image for the first two years as my guest speaker and we were off and running.”\n\nThis past April, Governor Doug Ducey declared April 30th International Jazz Day, a proclamation he presented at the day’s events at Cityscape.\n\nIn the proclamation, Ducey called jazz “the universal language of freedom spoken eloquently by people in the United States and abroad” and “an international language that bridges differences and brings people together regardless of race, age, gender or socio-economic class.”\n\nNext year’s Jazz Day Celebrations will begin on April 7 at the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts followed by the 2nd Annual Jazz at Lunchtime event at the State Capitol on April 18 and an event on April 28 in Surprise before concluding a month-long celebration of the music April 29 at Mesa Arts Center.\n\nJones is currently looking for sponsors and partners to underwrite his efforts.\n\n“To do it correctly, we need to raise $150,000 to $200,000, to do what I’ve been trying to do,” he says. “The biggest cost is the talent. Eventually, when we have the budget, we’ll be able to put super talent on. I’ve been talking with Kenny Garrett, Jonathan Butler, Stephanie Jordan, Azar Lawrence. I’ve got artists ready to go. And then the model I believe in, some people have been mentoring me out of New Orleans, they said, “Doc, man, always have 80 percent local talent.” That’s what they do in New Orleans.”\n\nEventually, Jones says, he’d like to do a Jazz Day celebration that felt a little more Viva PHX but for jazz, held on multiple stages, with artists playing different kinds of jazz in different locations.\n\nTo learn more about Jazz Day here in Arizona, you can visit Jones’ site at http://www.jazzdayaz.com/.\n\nAvondale's Halocene win YouTube's 'Best.Cover.Ever'\n\nThe members of Halocene have been “rockifying” pop songs, as they call it, for at least four years now, uploading the finished products on their YouTube channel at an average of one clip a week to satisfy the more than 57,000 fans who subscribe to the channel.\n\nThat made the Avondale rockers a natural fit for \"Best.Cover.Ever,\" a YouTube music competition that premiered in late November and featured Halocene as finalists, thanks to their spirited cover of Flo Rida's \"My House.\"\n\nAnd now, they've won their round, performing a track called \"Dancer\" with the multi-platinum rapper.\n\nAfter performing the song on YouTube, Halocene's singer Addie Nicole Amick said, \"I think we've waited our entire lives just to be in this moment right here.\"\n\nAnd things got even better when Ludacris shared a surprise, bringing Amick to tears.\n\n\"Flo Rida was so impressed with your cover,\" he said. \"We know that you guys live together. Flo Rida wants to give you guys $10,000 towards your own home studio.\"\n\nAmick says she and her bandmates chose to do \"My House\" because \"it’s a super-fun song and it was really easy to turn into a rock song.\"\n\nThey entered their take on the song in the contest and didn't think anything of it, Amick says. Until they heard from YouTube.\n\n\"I mean, we make covers every week so why would this be anything special?,\" she says, with a laugh. \" The next thing you know, we’re being flown out to L.A. and performing in front of Flo Rida and Ludacris, who’s the host for the show. The whole crazy ride has just been absolutely insane.\"\n\nThe series is executive produced by Ryan Seacrest, with Demi Lovato, Katy Perry, Keith Urban, Jason Derulo, Charlie Puth, Backstreet Boys, Flo Rida, Nicky Jam, DNCE and Bebe Rexha as musical guests who challenge competing musicians to perform a cover of one of their original songs.\n\nThe musicians can perform the song in their own style as they battle for the opportunity to perform a duet with the visiting artist. Viewers will witness every part of the planning and behind-the-scenes process as the collaboration comes together before premiering on YouTube.\n\nIt's been a long road to \"My House\" for Halocene, who started doing YouTube covers in their own house as a way to reach a bigger audience.\n\nAs guitarist Brad Amick (Addie's husband) says, \"Our band has been together for about 10 years total. We used to do the whole touring thing and that grind and about five years ago we started finding success online. As the climate started to change, people started consuming music and entertainment differently. So we uploaded a couple of videos and they did really well and the next thing you know the gap between the videos we were uploading was getting smaller and smaller. Now we do it every single week. We try to do it every Friday. Sometimes it’s hard to stick to that schedule. Sometimes we do even more.\"\n\nThey've been distracted lately, though, by the prospect of putting the finishing touches on their latest album of original material, \"Refraction,\" which arrives on Jan. 1.\n\n\"That kind of slows things down,\" Addie says. \" But we’re trying to keep up on it as much as we can.\"\n\nAsked if doing a cover a week has had an impact on their own sound, Addie says, \"We’ve done the most growing that we’ve ever done between the last album and now. We’ve experimented with new genres. We’ve learned things from playing songs that we might not have normally played. And we took all that and wanted to move forward in a new direction. Our new album is called Refraction, which means when light passes through an object and appears different on the other side. So we are basically the light or sound waves passing through something and ending up different on the other side. This new album was the most challenging thing we’ve ever done and the covers have really helped us grow and expand our horizons a lot.\"\n\nBrad says, \"This has a more modern sound, the way that pop music is kind of evolving. But at the same time, this is the first time we’ve had trumpets on an album. We invited Danny from the band Captain Squeegee to play on it. So it’s really all over the place. It’s kind of a fusion of funk and pop. And there’s rock, of course, because we’re a rock band. But we even have a little bit of EDM influences on some of the tracks. It’s kind of our identity crisis.\"\n\nAddie says after their last album, it was decided was decided that they had \"kind of mastered the rock sound\" and wanted to move on and do something different.\n\nIt helps that the recording studio is in their home, where they also do jingles for commercials and custom songs for people. \"That’s kind of our quote-unquote day job if you want to call it that,\" Addie says.\n\n\"It was really awesome getting to meet him, especially in the way we did,\" says drummer Joe Polizzi. \"On the show, you’re supposed to be performing for the artist’s producers and the artist ends up coming in in a unique way and surprising the two people that are gonna be performing for them. So we didn’t even know that he was in the building. But he was a really cool guy. And it was definitely a great experience meeting him.\n\nThey also met Ludacris, who hosts the series. \"They both have just a rock star presence that you really can’t describe, says Addie. \"We had no idea that they were going to be there. We thought we were just going out there to perform for the producers and they surprised us and said we were the final two and we would be performing directly in front of them.\"\n\nThe singer laughs then says, \"So that was a challenge.\"\n\nKWSS-FM Fall Fundraiser brings night of guilty pleasures to Last Exit Live\n\nKWSS-FM, an independent station widely known for its support of local music, teams with 80/20 Records to combine their annual fall fundraiser with 80/20's Guilty Pleasures show this weekend at Last Exit Live.\n\nAnd it's a killer lineup: Captain Squeegee, the Glides, Ben Anderson Music, Vintage Wednesday, People Who Could Fly, Bear Ghost, Daisy, Panic Baby, Good Boy Daisy, Nothing on the Moon and DJ sets by MRCH.\n\nAs to what constitutes a guilty pleasure, they're promising songs by Madonna, NSYNC, Foo Fighters, Smash Mouth, TLC, Celine Dion, Limp Bikit, Carrie Underwood and more.\n\nYou could even show up just to argue against the concept of Madonna or the Stray Cats as a guilty pleasure.\n\nAs Dani Cutler, host of Dani's Diner, which airs from 10 a.m.- 2 p.m., at 93.9 FM, says, \"One person's guilty pleasure is another person's all-time greatest artist ever.\"\n\nCutler was talking to Michael Zimmerlich of 80/20 Records about his Guilty Pleasures show when it occurred to her that it would make more sense for everyone involved to just join forces.\n\n\"I was like 'Why don't we just combine them and make it one show, that way we're helping each other and we won't be fighting for the same people to come to both of our shows. Just have everybody come to one.\"\n\nFor the past few years, the fall fundraiser has been the station's main fundraising drive.\n\n\"Beef Vegan started it with his Tequila Sunrise shows and when he left to go to Tucson, I kind of took it over,\" Cutler says. \"But we also didn't have a morning show and I didn't want to get up at 6 in the morning to do a big fundraiser.\"\n\nCutler laughs, then says, \"So I kind of made it my own. Or our own, I should say. It's not my fundraiser.\"\n\nAdmission to the show is free if you purchase a $20 KWSS T-shirt by Nov. 8. All proceeds go towards the station, which is non-profit and 100 percent independently owned and operated.\n\nLike NPR and PBS, KWSS relies on listener support for operational costs, including music licensing, promotional materials, broadband connectivity, studio and transmitter facilities, insurance, power, web hosting and phones.\n\n\"We're non-profit and independently own here in Phoenix,\" Cutler says. \"And we don't make our money the way other radio stations do. It's along the lines of NPR and PBS. We have to do pledge drives and fundraising so that listeners will donate to the station. The reason we are a non-profit is because we are supporting not just local music but also arts, entertainment and small business in the Phoenix area through promoting on the radio.\"\n\nUnlike NPR and PBS, KWSS is not a part of a larger network of stations. FCC regulations requires the station to remain fully independent and locally operated.\n\nThere may be another fundraiser in the spring. \"I tried it out this past spring,\" Cutler says, \"with my 10-year anniversary show. I made it a fundraiser for the station and it was pretty successful, so we might do it again, but the fall is the big one.\"\n\nDetails: 6 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 18. Last Exit Live, 717 S.

The entertainment and travel website went ahead and chose one band from each state.\n\nIts pick for Arizona? The underground legends who found themselves suddenly thrust into the zeitgeist of the post-Nirvana '90s after being hand-selected by the late great Kurt Cobain to join Nirvana on the set of \"MTV Unplugged,\" where they performed their own songs. That's good work if you can get it.\n\nNow, a few months after taking their well-deserved place in the The Arizona Music & Entertainment Hall of Fame, they've been selected as the best band in the history of Arizona music.\n\nAs the Thrillist editors explain it, \"While 'Hey Jealousy' by the Gin Blossoms might be the most immediately recognizable song by a band with Arizona origins — unless you grew up yelping along to Jimmy Eat World's pop-punk anthem \"The Middle\" — the Meat Puppets are the quintessential Arizona band.\n\n\"They might not have the hits of an act like Alice Cooper or the chops of a group like Calexico, but their combination of punk ideals, eclectic taste and untamed spirit speaks to the mysterious character of the Southwest.\n\n\"While blending country, hardcore and psychedelic rock, the Meat Puppets have endured longer than many of their SST Records peers of the 1980s, crafting a quirky legacy — and a lengthy discography — that's difficult to pin down but impossible to deny.\"\n\nSo what exactly constitutes an Arizona band? Thrillist laid out criteria as follows:\n\n\"The band must have been formed in or primarily based in the state in question. Lots of groups move to Los Angeles or Nashville or New York City after scoring a record deal, but they're not from those cities.\n\n\"Only groups, not individual artists, are considered. This admittedly skews the list away from hip-hop and country, but it also skews toward not driving us totally insane trying to wade through every musician from every state.\n\n\"We limited ourselves to bands who rose to prominence after World War II.\n\n\"These are not simply our favorite bands from every state; we considered a secret recipe of historical significance, influence, popularity and the nebulous 'quality' factor.\"\n\nGiven all that? I'd have gone with Alice Cooper, but the Kirkwood brothers are a solid and perhaps a more intriguing choice\n\nPhoenix's Christopher Shayne Band give impromptu a cappella concert at Southwest Airlines gate\n\nChristopher Shayne and his bandmates treated Southwest Airlines passengers to an impromptu a cappella concert at the Louis Armstrong Airport in New Orleans as they waited at the gate.\n\nThe local rockers had just wrapped a weekend in New Orleans, playing the St. Charles Rockin River Fest with Molly Hatchet, Shooter Jennings and Blackfoot, and an acoustic set on The Musicians, Mentors and Bar Room Heroes show on Whivfm.\n\nThe Southwest attendant was calling for people to come up and sing and when no one stepped up, she called out Shayne, who harmonized with lead guitarist Dave Lansing and keyboard player Zach Hughes on an Allman Brothers classic and a Shayne original, \"When I Come Down\" from the \"Turning Stones\" album.\n\n\"It was a weirdly intimidating task,\" says Shayne. \"She came over the speaker and stated 'I'm not sure you're familiar with what gate you are at, but at this gate we like to have fun. Anyone who comes up has to sing and we're all going to tell them to do it!'\"\n\nThen she noticed Shayne.\n\n\"When we travel,\" he says, \"we like to keep our instruments close, and gate-check them. She had one look at our long hair and beards and asked us to approach the podium – 'You look like musicians!' – and then proceeded to ask they crowd what they wanted us to do. So after some quick boot-strap pulling, we just went into the songs we sing in our set.\"\n\nLocal filmmaker Matty Steinkamp's 'Play the Documentary' headed to Amazon\n\n\"Play the Documentary,\" an independent film by Phoenix-based director Matty Steinkamp, will be available at Amazon beginning Sunday, Oct. 15, for download, rental and/or streaming on Amazon Prime worldwide.\n\nSteinkamp's goal for the film is to raise awareness regarding the struggle to keep music in schools when faced with dwindling education budgets for the arts. Proceeds from every download, rental and stream will help benefit music non-profits all over the country, working hard to give children the chance to play music.\n\n\"Play\" explores alternative solutions to getting instruments in the hands of students and relevant music curriculum in the hands of teachers. The doc was an official selection at Phoenix International Film Festival, the Boost Film Festival in Palm Springs and Cobargo Docos in Australia. It also had four sold-out world premiere screenings in the U.S., in addition to special engagements at the Herberger Theatre, Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, and Alice Cooper’s Rock Teen Center.\n\nSteinkamp says, \"Music is at the root of everything in my life. I can't imagine a world without music. By watching this film on Amazon either by Prime Free Streaming or by download, you are joining us in helping to keep music in schools. Thank you for being a champion for the future of music\"\n\nBlack Moods rock San Tan Valley students on Career Day at Jack Harmon Elementary School\n\nThe Black Moods rocked Jack Harmon Elementary School in San Tan Valley for 500 kindergarten through sixth grade students as part of Career Day. In addition to performing three songs from their latest album, “Medicine,” they spoke to the students about their experience working as professional musicians.\n\nDrummer Danny “Chico” Diaz told the students, “If you believe in something, never give up. Be prepared for hard work. And if you put your mind to something, you can achieve anything.”\n\nSinger-guitarist Josh Kennedy says, “If we did it right, some kids will go home tonight and ask for a guitar, or want to take lessons.”\n\n“Also, I take the blame for that,” he jokes.\n\n\"It was a lot of fun,\" says Diaz. \"I couldn’t believe how responsive the kids were. When we got in there, they were so happy. We were blown away. It’s just something we like to do, give back to the community.\n\nPerformers from South Mountain High School’s performing arts magnet program, where Diaz’s father was principal, once showed up at Diaz’s grade school in Tolleson.\n\n\"I remember them coming to my school,\" he says. \"That was the first time I ever performed in front of people. It was something that stuck with me. If we can inspire one child to become a musician? Right on.\"\n\nThe Black Moods intend to perform and speak at other schools throughout the Valley about their experience working in the industry.\n\nHaving recently welcomed bassist Jordan Hoffman to the lineup, the Tempe rockers have been working the local circuit in addition to frequently touring in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\nTheir local shows regularly sell out, and they have opened for national acts including Heart, Doors’ guitarist Robby Krieger, Lil Jon, Adelita’s Way and Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers.\n\nLater this month, they headlining two Oktoberfest events, Rocktoberfest at Rockbar on Oct. 7, and Four Peaks Oktoberfest at Tempe Town Lake on Oct. 14.

Then he ran on stage and held up our new LP and said 'The Darts! they rock! Everyone go to the merch booth over there and buy this record!!'\"\n\nWith a laugh, she adds, \"We were stoked.\"\n\nCarey was there to MC the event, which was sponsored by Little Steven's Underground Garage, a Sirius XM station on which Carey does an occasional show.\n\n\"Lots of the Underground DJs were there,\" says Laurenne, naming Michael Des Barres and John Carlucci.\n\nAs for Carey, she says, \"We were taking Polaroids for our pre-orders up in the green room before the show and he jumped into one of them. Someone is going to get that Polaroid in their pre-order package this week!\"\n\nCarey introduced their set as well. \"He just said 'Please welcome a band that's gonna knock your socks off. Here are the darts!\"\n\nThe show was at the Echo with the Woggles, whose singer, the Mighty Manfred, is also a DJ on the Underground Garage and invited the Darts to perform.\n\n\"He called us while we were on tour in Seattle,\" Laurenne says, \"and we quickly shuffled our tour dates around to make it happen. Anything for Underground Garage. They are so good to us.\n\nCavalera Conspiracy share video from 'Psychosis'\n\nRevolver magazine has premiered a suitably insane lyric video for Cavalera Conspiracy’s “Insane” from their forthcoming album, “Psychosis,” due Nov. 17 on Napalm Records.\n\nThe conspiracy began when brothers Max and Iggor Cavalera formed Sepultura as teenagers in 1983 while living in Brazil.\n\nA decade after Max left Sepultura, moving to the Valley and releasing seven albums at the helm of Soulfly, the brothers reunited in 2006, forming the Cavalera Conspiracy.\n\n\"Insane\" is the opening track on \"Psychosis,\" the fourth Cavalera Conspiracy album, following 2014's \"Pandemonium.\"\n\nAnd Max Cavalera has a message for the fans: \"Let's open the mosh pit and go insane!!!!!!\"\n\nIn a recent interview with Revolver, the singer talked about the album, which they recently finished recording at Platinum Underground Studio in Mesa.\n\n\"It's got everything, man,\" he said. \"We have songs that sound like [the first Sepultura full-length, 1986's] 'Morbid Visions' and [1989's] 'Beneath the Remains.' There's the thrash element of [1991's] 'Arise.' And then there's new stuff on there that sounds like the stuff we enjoy right now, like Full of Hell, Nails and Godflesh.\"\n\nU.K.'s Dirty Water Records launches U.S. sister label in Phoenix\n\nDirty Water Records, the U.K. label that signed local rockers the Darts and Playboy Manbaby, has expanded its global operations with a new U.S. label based in Phoenix.\n\nIn addition to distributing releases from the U.K. catalog, the local imprint will release and promote its own product and retain independent creative and financial control.\n\nThe two labels are \"jointly committed to giving both rosters the best platform to release and perform their music overseas, and to give all our fans the least expensive option to harass their neighbours with their loud rock’n’roll records,” a press release said.\n\nThe London-based label was founded in 2004 by club DJ and promoter PJ Crittenden (who ran the now infamous Dirty Water Club). At first, it was limited runs of releases for friends’ bands, but it quickly developed into a full-on record label, riding the wave of the near legendary North London club night known for celebrity regulars and wild DJ stomp parties that continue to rage on after more than 20 years.\n\nThe club and label’s name is a tribute to The Standells' 1966 hit “Dirty Water,” a song whose chorus is, “I love that dirty water / Boston, you’re my home.”\n\nThe original, long-term home of the Dirty Water Club was a North London pub called the Boston Arms, but US ex-pat Paul Manchester (aka Boston Paul) engineered the label’s first big title: a reissue of Boston garage-rock group the Lyres’ 1979 classic, “Don’t Give It Up Now” backed with “How Do You Know.”\n\nSince then, the label has released a world-class selection of American acts, from Boston’s Muck and the Mires to L.A.’s Mr. Airplane Man, Detroit's The Hentchmen, Cleveland's Archie and the Bunkers, New York City’s Dirty Fences and a supergroup, of sorts, called Magic Christian (featuring the talents of Blondie’s Clem Burke and Cyril Jordan of the Flamin’ Groovies).\n\nSo why Phoenix, not Boston?\n\nLast summer, while on sabbatical in Phoenix, the label’s publicity and A&R man Matt Hunter met Nicole Laurenne, who in addition to fronting the Love Me Nots, Zero Zero and Motobunny, ran her own label, Atomic A Go Go Records. Laurenne had just started The Darts at that point and Hunter was intent on signing them after randomly finding them on Facebook before they’d even played their first show.\n\nThe two met up one evening at Valley Bar, where they started mapping out a strategy for world domination with an eyeliner pen and upside-down beer mats. And thus Atomic A Go Go Records was replaced by Dirty Water Records USA, with Laurenne assuming the role of proprietor.\n\n“I always envisioned the label having some kind of U.S.-based operation; I just never imagined it would be located in the middle of a desert,” says Hunter. “After that first meeting with Nicole, who was already a big fan of Dirty Water, I knew this just had to happen by any means necessary, and signing The Darts was the ultimate cherry on top of this whole beautifully amazing endeavor taking shape.”\n\nLaurenne says, “I'd been trying to get the attention of Dirty Water for years with the Love Me Nots but they never seemed to take notice. When Matt wrote to me out of the blue that he was interested in The Darts and my little DIY label, I almost fell off my chair.\n\n\"After five minutes together, we knew we had a lot in common in musical tastes, mutual friends, business ideas and more. We were both so psyched, we couldn't get this off the ground fast enough.”\n\nAfter several weeks of long-distance discussions and planning, Hunter flew back to London with two Phoenix bands on the roster, The Darts and Playboy Manbaby.\n\nA licensing deal has been struck between Dirty Water Records Ltd. and Laurenne to effectively spin off a separate label to her, with full creative and financial control that will in turn carry the Dirty Water Records brand name to help promote and distribute the London roster while creating a whole new label.\n\n“The tastemakers involved with DWR USA have kind of eclectic taste — but with a common theme of loving music that tears your face off in its awesomeness and power and leaves you on the floor. That's our goal,\" Laurenne says.\n\nCrittenden says, “This is the next logical move for us. From a very young age I was completely into American music — rock and roll, blues, soul, proper old rhythm and blues, ’60s garage, psych and so on, the kind of music that I see as the real deal. In that context, a U.S. branch of Dirty Water in my eyes is exactly what we should be doing. Giving some rock and roll back to the place where it started.”\n\nThe Phoenix label already has five new artists: Mean Motor Scooter, Escobar, Baronen & Satan, Bee Bee Sea and the Callas. It will also offer a full-service agency for booking, promotion, publishing and artist representation in addition to distributing music on vinyl, cassette, digital and CDs.\n\nLinkin Park plan Chester Bennington memorial concert at Hollywood Bowl\n\nThe surviving members of Linkin Park have announced a special show in honor of their bandmate and friend, Chester Bennington. The one-night-only celebration will be held at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles on Friday, Oct. 27.\n\nThis marks the first time the members have performed on stage together since Bennington’s death in July. They’ll be joined by a number of artists for a night of music honoring the Phoenix native.\n\nThe individual band members will contribute their fees from the event to Music For Relief's One More Light Fund in memory of Bennington.\n\nTickets go on sale Friday, Sept. 22 at https://linkinpark.com.\n\nThe official video for the album title track, \"One More Light\" premiered this week on Linkin Park’s social pages. Initially, the song had not been scheduled as a single, but the strong connection with fans in the weeks following Bennington's passing brought the track to the forefront.\n\n\"One More Light was written with the intention of sending love to those who lost someone. We now find ourselves on the receiving end,\" says Mike Shinoda. \"In memorial events, art, videos, and images, fans all over the world have gravitated towards this song as their declaration of love and support for the band and the memory of our dear friend, Chester. We are so very grateful and can't wait to see you again.\"\n\nThe video was directed by Linkin Park's Joe Hahn and longtime videographer Mark Fiore.\n\n\"It has been incredibly emotional to work on this, and especially to watch it,\" says Hahn. \"I feel that by doing it, we not only faced some of our biggest fears, but it enabled us to use our talents to bring some light to people who need it. As we move forward to the Hollywood Bowl show and beyond, I think about the people who connect with the band, outside and inside our circle. This video is a gesture of good will to the people who want that connection.\"\n\nThe Nash turns 5 with anniversary celebration starring Lewis Nash\n\nThe Nash will celebrate its fifth year as the undisputed hub of Phoenix jazz with a month-long celebration in October.\n\n\"It's hard to wrap my head around the fact that it's already been five years,\" says Phoenix native Lewis Nash, the celebrated drummer for whom the venue on Roosevelt Row was named.\n\n\"There's been a lot accomplished,\" Nash says, \"and a lot still left to do. A lot of great musicians have been through the place and given it their blessing, talked about how much they like the atmosphere and playing there.\"\n\nFounded with the hope of engaging young musicians to perform while offering educational opportunities, the Nash has welcomed some big names in jazz, been named a national \"jazz hub,\" served as home for hundreds of aspiring musicians and been a vibrant part of downtown's economic rebirth.\n\nDownbeat magazine has named the Nash one of the nation's top jazz venues for four consecutive years.\n\nAmong the goals going forward, Nash says, are \"continuing to deepen ties with the community and continuing to involve young people in the process of everything that goes on there, so that we're building future audiences, honing future artists and creating an appreciation for the art form here in Phoenix.\"\n\nHe feels the Nash has \"definitely, without question\" enjoyed significant success reaching out to that young demographic.\n\n\"And I know that because I have a chance to interact with a lot of the young musicians and ask them their impressions of what the place means to them and to the community and what they've gotten out of it. I've gotten a whole lot of positive feedback from young people, so that's encouraging for me. And when I say young people, I mean high school students as well as college students, recent grads and young professionals.\"\n\nTaking the gospel of jazz to a new generation is important, Nash says, because \"it's an original American art form. So when people begin to study the great artists of this music, going back to Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, people like that, all the way up to now, there's a parallel historical component to it.\n\n\"If you study the music of Louis Armstrong from the 1920s and '30s, you can also see simultaneously what was going on in American history during the time of these recordings and the heyday of these icons. These are human beings who were Americans, many of them African-Americans, living in a country which was denying them quite a bit during these years that we're talking about. And they persevered with this art form in spite of these hardships they were facing.\"\n\nThe Nash will host a jam-packed anniversary weekend Saturday and Sunday, Oct. 7-8, with tributes to Dizzy Gillespie and Ella Fitzgerald, featuring world-renowned artists Roberta Gambarini, Roy Hargrove, Sharel Cassity, Cyrus Chestnut and John Lee, as well as Lewis Nash.\n\n\"It's focused on honoring two icons who this year would be celebrating their 100th birthdays,\" Nash says. \"I had the pleasure and privilege of working with Dizzy Gillespie. I made a couple recordings with him, played live with him, and some of the musicians who are coming for the anniversary also played with Dizzy. The bassist, John Lee, was his musical director toward the end of his life. So we're just going to have a big celebration of the legacy of Dizzy Gillespie, which includes a lot of innovative things he did over the course of his career.\"\n\nFitzgerald, he says, is a \"one-of-a-kind\" artist.\n\n\"She and Dizzy were people who had a lot of fun when they performed,\" he says. \"And so the joy of the music, too, is something that we're celebrating.\"\n\nOther anniversary events include a Big Band Show with Darcy James Argue and for Nash members only, a special event with Canadian saxophonist Cory Weeds.\n\nTickets for The Nash fifth anniversary events are on sale. Patron badges include all anniversary weekend concerts; VIP Jazz Lovers Patron badges also include reserved seats and meet-and-greets with musicians at two celebratory shows at MIM Theater: Danilo Perez \"PanaMonk\" (in honor of Thelonious Monk's 100th birthday) and Regina Carter’s \"Simply Ella.\"\n\nHere's a look at the events.\n\n10/7: The Dizzy Gillespie All-Stars\n\nThe Dizzy Gillespie All-Stars, under the direction of Gillespie alumnus/executive director/producer/bassist John Lee, have delighted audiences around the world.

He was out walking around at 1 in the morning and got hit by a drunk driver. The driver wasn’t cited for manslaughter or anything. He was just cited for too much alcohol, I guess. But he wasn’t driving erratically. Neither one of them saw each other. Apparently, he was out wandering around on the street. It was kind of shocking that he got hit by a drunk driver and he couldn’t quit drinking himself.”\n\nPaul Bruce also was a talented musician and songwriter, although he never experienced the success Michael Bruce enjoyed as a member of the Cooper group, with whom he was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. And that didn’t always sit well with Paul.\n\n“He said to me one time that he couldn’t live in the shadow of his big brother,” Michael Bruce recalls. “And I said, ‘Paul, it’s all just a bunch of bulls—t.’” But he was such a sensitive kid. He wore his emotions on his sleeve. And he had a hard time. Even though he came to the gigs and hung out with us, he just couldn’t deal with it.”\n\nMichael Bruce’s group, which features his wife, Lynn Bruce, on bass, will be doing a lot of the hits he wrote while in the Cooper band. “I’ll be doing my best Alice,” he says with a laugh.\n\nThe four surviving members of the Alice Cooper group – which featured Dennis Dunaway on bass, Neal Smith on drums and the late Glen Buxton on guitar – recorded two new songs together on the latest Cooper album, “Paranormal.” And they’re doing a series of reunion gigs later this year in the U.K., where “School’s Out” topped the pop charts in the early ‘70s.\n\n“We did a couple shows in Nashville and we’re going to the U.K. on Nov. 8 to do five shows,” Bruce says. “The Tubes are opening and we do a mini-set in Alice’s set with his band. They drop a screen with Billion Dollar Babies and we appear on stage and do the hits like they were back in the day. People love it.”\n\nThe memorial concert will feature performances by Bruce’s group, Scott Rowe’s Alice Cooper tribute show, Harvest, Serious Play and Billy Cioffi and the Monte Carlos.\n\nDetails: 6-11 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 23. Pranksters Too, 7919 E. Thomas Road, Scottsdale.

I remember saying that I wanted to write an uplifting song that would remind people that love and unity will conquer all.\n\n\"There is so much hurt going on in the world right now, and it can feel hopeless at times. However, nothing stays the same forever, and that really is the message of this song. To have a voice and to stand for what is right, and that things will get better.”\n\nThe video was directly inspired by the lyrics from the song and its optimistic chorus of \"Victory is inevitable.\"\n\nAs Miss Krystle explains, “This music video is definitely a commentary and statement piece on the bigger issues going on right now. But the director and I wanted to focus on the individual struggle, to bring the narrative and responsibility back to each of us individually and remind people that positive change is always possible.\n\n\"We kicked around a few different treatment ideas, and landed on the stories: the drug addict, the dancer and the homeless person. One of the biggest challenges was trying to say a lot, but in the most minimalist way. I feel we accomplished that goal, and I love how the video turned out.”\n\nIn the opening scene, Miss Krystle is trapped in a jail cell, wearing a prison dress.\n\n“In all the treatment variations, one of the consistent elements was the jail cell,” she says. “In the final treatment (and video), the jail cell is the primary aesthetic (besides the three individuals). Whether the focus is personal, economic, political or social, we all feel trapped at times, so the jail cell is symbolic of our psychological and emotional imprisonment.\n\n\"This is why you see me stay in the jail cell, even though walls come down throughout the video, and I could certainly escape at any time. I remain trapped by my self-made prison, until I have eliminated all the things holding me back.”\n\nEach wall of the jail cell is made of a different material, representing the different characters.\n\n“As each person frees themselves from their torment, a side of my cell drops,” the singer explains. “Finally, you see me facing the brick wall, which is my own prison. You see me push that wall down, and only then do you see me walk out of the jail cell and free myself.”\n\nThe other characters were chosen, Miss Krystle explains, “because we felt each of these characters represented experiences we all know on a personal level, or at a minimum could sympathize with.\n\n\"The dancer lives for her craft, but she is injured and misses a big performance that was important for her career. The drug addict represents the dependency we all have in our lives, be it relationships, substances, alcohol or the like. The homeless person represents great loss and need.\n\n\"We see these three at ‘rock bottom,’ then again when each has made a decision to change, or change has begun, and finally when each person has triumphed through their personal tragedies for a higher purpose.”\n\nPhoenix entrepreneur sets out to 'fix the broken industry' with online streaming service\n\nPhoenix entrepreneur Damon Evans has built a music platform called Arena Music on the concept of fair pay for artists and free play for listeners.\n\nAccording to a press release, “the music streaming and merchandising platform is set to fix the broken industry\" while going up against the heavy hitters of the industry, such as Spotify and Pandora.\n\n“Through the platform we’ve created,” Evans says, “we are able to pay the highest rates in the world for music streams and merchandise sales. Artists simply cannot sustain a career in music from the low streaming royalties today's most popular subscription platforms pay per stream. If we don't act now, there will be no more music.\"\n\nArtists who work directly with Arena earn a penny per stream. As Spotify and Pandora, the world's most used services, artists earn just $0.003-$0.006 per play, and those platforms don't support other sales formats.\n\nBy paying the highest royalties for merchandise sales and music streams, Arena Music is hoping to position itself as a primary destination for artists and labels who want to maximize their earnings for both new releases and back catalog.\n\nFor musicians, Arena offers full sales support and real-time accounting, under a simple non-exclusive agreement.\n\nArena also says it offers artists more on products such as t-shirts, hoodies and caps than any other music or merchandising storefront currently online.\n\nIt's also the only streaming service to offer monthly royalty payouts through BitCoin.\n\nArena streams singles and albums from both independent and major-label artists without commercial interruptions or a monthly subscription fee. The user-friendly mobile app allows fans to purchase exclusive artist merchandise from anywhere in the world.\n\nArena also allows listeners to earn credits for using the service. The patent-pending Listen to Own (LTO) rewards program gives listeners the option of choosing between a $1 Arena credit or a free download anytime they've listened to any single song five times through the service.\n\n“Arena makes the artist and their fans happy,” says Evans. “It provides knowledge and direction for today’s creative and artistic communities through an ad free and subscription free merchandising storefront designed to build and sustain viable careers in music.”\n\nArena Music will soon launch a crowdfunding campaign through Wefunder.com to market an investment opportunity to musicians, producers, record labels and both accredited and non-accredited investors.\n\nCurrently, Arena exists as the largest commercial music platform that is neither funded by, or in any other way, associated with the three major labels.\n\nFor more information on Arena and its music and merchandise services, visit www.arena.com.\n\nThere is No Us unveil a chilling portrait of celebrity obsession\n\nThere Is No Us are premiering a chilling new video for \"Angel's Face With Devil's Hands\" that opens on a scene of singer Jim Louvau cutting a photograph of the video's striking female lead, Miss Krystle, off the cover of a magazine to add it to shrine he's built beside his bed.\n\nIf that sounds creepy, that's the point.\n\nAs Louvau explains it, \"The initial concept of the video was birthed from the idea that people in the era that we live in are obsessed with the idea of celebrity.\"\n\nThe specific event that inspired the song was Leonardo DiCaprio finally winning an Oscar and seeing people, including close friends, celebrate as though they'd won an Oscar.\n\n\"I thought to myself, this person you are praising couldn't care less about any of you,\" Louvau says. \"I actually posted something on social media when it happened as an experiment to see what sort of reaction I would get and it inspired the song. For some reason we connect with these people we look up to and think that they care about us on a level outside of collecting a paycheck.\"\n\nThis was before Louvau and guitarist Andy Gerold, a former member of Marilyn Manson who portrays a darker side of our obsession with celebrities in the video, had decided form a band to play the music they'd been working on together.\n\nThere Is No Us reached out to Scott Conditt, who directed their first video, \"In Violence We Trust,\" and told him they wanted to do something much more artistic than that first collaboration.\n\n\"We had no interest in doing another typical performance piece that had a bunch of people playing heavy music jumping around like monkeys looking tough,\" Louvau says. \"We are not looking to follow an expectation of what a band that plays heavy music is supposed to be. At the end of the day this is an art project that happens to be aggressive.\"\n\nBringing in Miss Krystle was a flawless bit of casting and the local singer effortlessly rises to the challenge.\n\n\"Initially we were looking to cast a female actress to portray a celebrity or a pop artist,\" Louvau says. \"Andy suggested that we worked with Miss Krystle since she was actually someone who had her feet in the pop world and was a close friend of ours. She turned out to be the best choice we could have made.\"\n\nMORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest\n\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.Twitter.com/EdMasley.\n\nMore music\n\nPhoenix concert announcements, updates\n\nConcerts of the week for Phoenix", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/01/21/sundance-film-festival-2023-best-movies/11091574002/", "title": "Sundance 2023: All the best films we saw at the festival", "text": "Sundance returned in a big way, for those who traveled to Park City, Utah, or – if you're like us – avoided the snow while hanging on the couch.\n\nAfter going virtual for a couple of pandemic-affected editions, Sundance Film Festival 2023 embraced both normalcy and the new with a hybrid in-person/online format. But the indie films on tap were, as usual with the fest, a pretty interesting mix, from the Jonathan Majors bodybuilding drama \"Magazine Dreams\" to Daisy Ridley's \"Sometimes I Think About Dying\" to a slate of documentaries featuring Judy Blume, Little Richard, Michael J. Fox and Brooke Shields.\n\nSundance highlights include award winners, high-profile documentaries and a bodybuilding drama\n\nHere are the best movies we saw at Sundance, ranked:\n\nJonathan Majors headlines a great bodybuilding drama.\n\n\"A Thousand and One\" and \"The Persian Version\" won top prizes at the fest.\n\nThe lives of Little Richard, Michael J. Fox and Judy Blume receive the documentary treatment.\n\n22. 'Shortcomings'\n\nRandall Park (\"Young Rock,\" Jimmy Woo from the Marvel movies) has his directorial debut with this comedy about Ben (Justin H. Min), a Bay Area arthouse theater manager suffering from arrested development. His girlfriend (Ally Maki) moves to New York, leaving him to sulk with lesbian best friend Alice (Sherry Cola) and get his life in order. The film deftly explores identity and Asian American representation, and while Ben is an intensely insufferable jerk, Min and Cola's scenes together lift the film.\n\n21. 'Run Rabbit Run'\n\nIn a creepy-kid horror film that takes a couple of pages from \"The Babadook,\" Sarah Snook (\"Succession\") stars as a divorced Australian mother forced to confront dark secrets and repressed trauma from her family's past. She's not happy when her 7-year-old daughter (Lily LaTorre) takes in a stray bunny as a pet for her birthday, but it's just the inciting incident for a series of bizarre turns and revealed truths as the girl begins to exhibit increasingly dangerous bad behavior.\n\n20. 'Sometimes I Think About Dying'\n\nIn a quiet coastal Oregon town, the shy Fran (Daisy Ridley) lives an isolated life, occasionally daydreams of her demise, and works diligently and silently as her officemates chatter on, until an extroverted newcomer (Dave Merheje) forces Fran out of her lonely shell. What superficially seems like a deadpan, socially awkward take on \"The Office\" becomes an amusing and affecting look at loneliness and the importance of human interaction, with an outstandingly droll turn from Ridley.\n\n19. 'In My Mother's Skin'\n\nWord to the wise: Don't let your mom ingest a flesh-eating fairy. Set in World War II-era Philippines, the gnarly thriller finds young Tala (Felicity Kyle Napuli) needing help when her father is accused of stealing Japanese gold and her mother (Beauty Gonzalez) has one seriously bad cough. Enter a strange forest goddess (Jasmine Curtis-Smith) with an offer that Tala should have refused and a tale that has the girl and her younger brother scrambling to avoid a possessed parent.\n\n18. 'birth/rebirth'\n\nA parental nightmare gets Frankenstein'd in this unsettling horror film. When her 6-year-old daughter dies of a sudden bacterial infection and goes missing from the morgue, nurse Celie (Judy Reyes) finds the child has become an experiment for Rose (Marin Ireland), an emotionally cold pathologist obsessed with reanimation. The pair quickly learn bringing the dead back is easier than it sounds, and Celie goes to terrifying extremes for her little girl in a sinister story full of moral quandaries.\n\n17. 'Infinity Pool'\n\nBrandon Cronenberg's sci-fi horror film is trippy, bizarre, appalling and somehow also insightful about humanity. A struggling novelist (Alexander Skarsgård) at a posh all-inclusive island getaway runs into a fan (Mia Goth), a day trip with her veers tragic when the writer runs a guy over, but thanks to the laws of this fictional country, a clone of himself is executed in his place as punishment. The bad behavior gets wilder from there with a cool premise that doesn't totally fly but has plenty of gory chutzpah.\n\n16. 'Eileen'\n\nLike \"Carol\" painted with some noir-ish shades, the 1960s-set thriller based on the Ottessa Moshfegh book casts Thomasin McKenzie as the title character, a mousy secretary at a Boston boys prison who lives at home with an abusive dad (Shea Wigham) drinking himself to death. Eileen gets a pick-me-up at work with the arrival of sophisticated psychologist Rebecca (Anne Hathaway), but the younger woman's fragile headspace goes off the rails when Rebecca pulls her into unfortunate circumstances.\n\n15. 'Polite Society'\n\nImagine a kung fu collaboration between Quentin Tarantino, Jane Austen and Edgar Wright, and that's the vibe of this energetic action comedy written and directed by Nida Manzoor (creator of the amazing \"We Are Lady Parts\"). A Pakistani London teen (Priya Kansara) is an aspiring martial artist with dreams of being a famous stuntwoman, but she first has to use her cool spin kicks – a work in progress – and youthful moxie to stop the sudden arranged marriage of her older sister (Ritu Arya).\n\n14. 'Fair Play'\n\nA psychosexual thriller with modern sensibilities, director Chloe Domont's feature debut casts Phoebe Dynevor and Alden Ehrenreich as Wall Street analysts and co-workers who hide their romance. After getting engaged, she gets a promotion he was hoping for and their personal and professional relationships veer off course. Who you root for changes often in this tense exploration of gender dynamics in and out of the workplace, with a scene-stealing turn from Eddie Marsan as their demanding boss.\n\n13. 'You Hurt My Feelings'\n\nWritten and directed by Nicole Holofcener (\"Can You Ever Forgive Me?\"), the comedy stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a novelist who overhears her usually supportive therapist husband (Tobias Menzies) tell his brother-in-law he doesn't like her new book. Insecurities and silent treatments abound as the couple as well as their loved ones wrestle with their professional futures in a relatable tale that honestly examines the white lies we tell and the truths we don't to help each other.\n\n12. 'Scrapper'\n\nIn the British coming-of-age film – and winner of the Sundance world dramatic Grand Jury Prize – 12-year-old Georgie (newcomer Lola Campbell) lives alone in a flat outside London following her mother's death. Her daily existence includes stealing bikes and avoiding social workers until the father (Harris Dickinson) she never met shows up and they clash, though they're more alike than either would care to admit. Dickinson (\"Triangle of Sadness\") is good but Campbell is the excellent find here as a feisty tween who can only hide her emotions and grief for so long.\n\n11. 'Judy Blume Forever'\n\nIconic children’s author Judy Blume is refreshingly cool and endlessly hip in this entertaining documentary, which tracks her life from adolescence to motherhood to finding success in the 1970s. Interviews with fans and celebrities, plus Blume herself, dig into the importance of her stories introducing children to sex and puberty – and the conservative feathers she ruffled. The insightful deep-drive also showcases her surprising sauciness at 84: “I was a good girl with a bad girl lurking just inside.”\n\n10. 'The Persian Version'\n\nProudly pulverizing the fourth wall and boasting a 1980s pop-music influence, the uplifting dramedy – Sundance's U.S. dramatic audience award winner – centers on a young Iranian-American woman named Leila (Layla Mohammadi) who finds herself an outsider in both cultures as well as her family. Their gathering for a wedding – and her dad's heart transplant surgery – forces Leila and her estranged mother (Niousha Noor) to discover how truly alike they are.\n\n9. 'Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie'\n\nDirector Davis Guggenheim deftly uses clips from the beloved actor's screen work alongside Fox's own insightful words to craft a humorous and moving chronicle of his life, from rocketing to superstardom as an undersized Canadian to dealing with his debilitating Parkinson's disease. Fox tells stories of filming \"Family Ties\" and \"Back to the Future,\" his dive into alcoholism and the pains of his everyday life, exhibiting the same sly sense of humor and charm that made the world fall in love with him in the '80s.\n\n8. 'Talk to Me'\n\nSundance is known for its stellar horror films (\"Get Out,\" \"Hereditary\") and this Australian ghost story is the greatest spook show of the 2023 slate. Teenage Mia (Sophie Wilde) falls in with a crowd that uses a weird embalmed hand to bring spirits into bodies and films the encounters for online viral videos. But when Sophie bends the \"rules\" of the game and is haunted by a familiar face, she and her friends' lives take a ghastly turn in a thriller that that skillfully blends old-school frights with fears for the TikTok generation.\n\n7. 'Little Richard: I Am Everything'\n\nA celebration of the rock legend's career goes hand in hand with how the music industry whitewashed Richard Penniman's considerable influence in this honest and essential documentary. Through archival footage and interviews, the film chronicles the flamboyant performer's early days as a drag act, his superstardom but also a complex life struggling with his queerness and his religion. And if you believe Elvis Presley is the King of Rock 'n' Roll, this will make you rethink who should be on that throne.\n\n6. 'L'immensita'\n\nWhile Penelope Cruz brings a gentle touch and song-and-dance moves to this Italian family drama, it’s newcomer Luana Giuliani who really dazzles. In 1970s Rome, 13-year-old Adriana (Giuliani) starts to identify as a boy, telling mother Clara (Cruz) she feels like an alien from another galaxy. From meetings with a crush to musical fantasies, Adri tries to find herself even as the dynamic with her mom, abusive dad and siblings becomes more unstable in the touching, inclusive coming-of-age tale.\n\n5. 'A Thousand and One'\n\nActress/singer Teyana Taylor proves an emotional powerhouse in A.V. Rockwell's poetic drama about motherhood and a changing New York City. Winner of the fest's U.S. dramatic Grand Jury Prize, the movie casts Taylor as an ex-con who kidnaps her son from foster care in the 1990s and they do what they can to stay together – and keep a secret that could tear them apart – as their personal lives and their increasingly gentrified city change around them.\n\n4. 'Theater Camp'\n\nLike \"Waiting for Guffman\" on an \"Abbott Elementary\" binge, the enjoyable mockumentary centers on the diva kids at an upstate New York theater summer camp. A \"Bye Bye Birdie\" accident puts the owner (Amy Sedaris) in a coma, her influencer-bro son (a hilarious Jimmy Tatro) has no idea how to run it, and two longtime teachers (Ben Platt and Molly Gordon, who also co-directs) can't get past their own egos to finish an original musical. It takes a bit but these high-maintenance theater nerds definitely grow on you.\n\n3. 'Rye Lane'\n\nDom (David Jonsson) is crying over his ex in a unisex bathroom when he meets the carefree Yas (Vivian Oparah), an awkward encounter that sparks a memorable jaunt through colorful London for the two that involves a karaoke bar, a lunch comeuppance, some breaking-and-entering, spicy snacks and revealing conversations (plus one amazing cameo). Raine Allen-Miller's fantastically endearing rom-com freshens the genre while paying tribute to its past, with delightful leads we need to see more of on these shores.\n\n2. 'Cassandro'\n\nThe rousing true-life underdog story casts a never-better Gael García Bernal as Saúl, a gay wrestler in the Mexican luchador circuit who takes off his mask and embraces a new feminine \"exótico\" character. Wearing his mom's clothing, Saúl first weathers homophobic insults, but his passion and flamboyance ultimately win crowds over in a big way. Bernal shines in a heartfelt performance alongside Raúl Castillo as his secret lover and Bad Bunny in a supporting role as a promoter and confidant.\n\n1. 'Magazine Dreams'\n\nIs it too early to start talking 2024 best actor? Jonathan Majors is phenomenal and frightening as a troubled amateur bodybuilder whose life falls apart as he obsessively tries to craft the perfect physique in writer/director Elijah Bynum's intoxicating cautionary tale. Doing for a musclebound world what \"The Wrestler\" did for the squared circle, the film follows Majors' painfully awkward gym rat as he goes down a spectacularly bad path of protein shakes, steroids, rage issues, misplaced idolatry and macho posedowns.\n\nTake a deeper dive on Sundance films:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2022/09/20/live-music-concert-in-austin-for-fall-and-winter-2022/69498047007/", "title": "Just about every live music concert in Austin for fall and winter 2022", "text": "From top-drawing performers at the arenas and amphitheaters, to established acts at theaters and concert halls, to up-and-coming talent in the clubs, our fall music guide features a bounty of live music events from September through December.

The Alabama Department of Public Health issued guidance about the new process last week. Instead of a marriage license, couples will fill out a new form, have it notarized and then take it to the probate judge within 30 days. A wedding ceremony is no longer required, but a couple can still have one if they choose. The Legislature this year voted to change marriage procedures to accommodate conservative probate judges who objected to same-sex marriage. A few probate judges had refused to issue marriage licenses to anyone so they didn’t have to give them to gay couples. Republican Sen. Greg Albritton proposed the change, saying it should allow people to get marriage documents everywhere.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Charlene Zanoria used her summer internship to give underrepresented cultures a moment in the spotlight. Zanoria, a freshman at University of Alaska Southeast and graduate of Thunder Mountain High School, interned for Juneau Public Libraries this summer. For her connected learning project – an effort that combines interests, supportive relationships and learning – she came up with a celebration of people of color that featured music, dancing and food, Capital City Weekly reports. “I wanted to make an event that would include minorities that aren’t normally represented in the library,” she said. Zanoria, who is Filipina, said she hoped P.O.C. Palooza, which was held Aug. 16, reminded people Juneau Public Libraries are for the entire community. Among featured songs and performances were some that incorporated the Maori culture of New Zealand.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state starts a first-of-its-kind experiment Tuesday. Ninety days after the legislative session ended, the state will roll out a professional licensing law that Gov. Doug Ducey has touted as a game-changing tool to make it easier to move to Arizona and work in a range of regulated fields, from cosmetology to real estate and optometry. Known as universal recognition, the policy was a central part of Ducey’s legislative agenda this year and just one of several steps to roll back the power of state boards that oversee numerous skilled professions. The governor argues that those bodies have, at times, abused their power or gotten in the way of job-seekers. Arizona is the first state to try universal recognition, but the policy’s potential for real change remains unclear.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Cheryl Maples, an attorney who successfully challenged the state’s gay marriage ban before the nation’s highest court said same-sex couples could wed, has died at age 69. Melina Maples-Granger, Maples’ daughter, said Maples died Thursday in Little Rock from complications of congestive heart failure. Maples represented same-sex couples who challenged Arkansas’ constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. A county judge struck the amendment down in 2014, which led to more than 500 same-sex couples marrying before the ruling was suspended by the state Supreme Court. Justices didn’t rule before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015. Maples also represented same-sex couples who successfully challenged Arkansas’ birth certificate law.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Someone has been killing the wild burros of the Mojave Desert, and the Bureau of Land Management is offering up to $10,000 to anyone who can help catch the culprit or culprits. Over the past three months, 42 burro carcasses containing gunshot wounds have been found scattered along a 60-mile stretch of Interstate 15, the main highway linking Los Angeles to Las Vegas. The animals, like wild horses, are protected under federal law. Anyone found guilty of harassing, branding or killing one faces a fine of up to $2,000 and a year in jail. More than that, burros are an enduring symbol of the American Southwest. With their pointy ears and distinctive “Hee-Haw” voices, they evoke a time when their sure-footedness in rocky terrain and ability to carry heavy loads long distances without complaint made them perfect pack animals for prospectors and others.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: The U.S. Air Force Academy has announced it will close its cadet chapel for extensive renovations beginning next month. KOAA-TV reports the military academy says Sept. 3 is the final day scheduled for visits prior to the chapel’s three-year closure. Officials at the academy near Colorado Springs say a $158 million restoration and preservation project is scheduled to begin Nov. 1. Officials say work crews are expected to remove furniture and conduct other preparation work between Sept. 3 and Nov. 1. The chapel was originally scheduled to close in June, but the project was delayed. The Air Force says the funds were reallocated for repairs at Florida’s Tyndall Air Force Base following Hurricane Michael in October 2018. The chapel is registered as a national historic landmark.\n\nConnecticut\n\nVoluntown: The state plans to conduct mosquito control spraying in parts of Pachaug State Forest considered to be at high risk for mosquito-borne illnesses. Spraying will be conducted Monday at Mount Misery campground, the nearby horse camp, and roads leading from the main forest entrance to Hell Hollow Road. Spraying will begin at 7 p.m., weather permitting. It will continue overnight, and roads will be closed to vehicular traffic. The state’s mosquito management program, an interagency response to mosquito-borne diseases, says there’s a high concentration of mosquitoes in the area infected with Eastern equine encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. The state is using a pesticide called Anvil. Officials say the location is not a residential area, and those living in surrounding areas do not need to take precautions during the spraying.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A high-profile case of a doctor convicted of raping and abusing more than 85 children has led to major changes in how the state investigates and disciplines doctors. Since Earl Bradley’s arrest in 2009, 178 Delaware doctors have received some form of disciplinary action from the state. In the decade before that, licensing records show only 48 doctors were disciplined by the state. Bradley’s ability to keep practicing exposed several failures in how the state’s medical community reported and disciplined doctors. The case led to the General Assembly passing a series of laws, one of which made it easier to suspend the license of a doctor who poses a “clear and immediate danger.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: As D.C. kids get ready to go back to school Monday, some have more to worry about than the grades, WUSA-TV reports. Those living and going to school in Southeast face the specter of violence every day, with some parents reporting hearing gunfire “almost every night.” One parent tweeted Saturday: “I see DC Public Schools Turner Elementary in Ward 8 still has bullet holes in glass over the front doors after months … kids left being greeted by tape & bullet holes daily, they shouldn’t come back to it.” Within a couple of hours, the D.C. Department of General Services had tweeted that it was investigating. When WUSA paid a visit to Turner Elementary to check out the damage, crews were already working on repairs.\n\nFlorida\n\nMarathon: A non-native, juvenile olive ridley sea turtle has been released off the Florida Keys. Officials say the 30-pound turtle named Harry was released Thursday with a small satellite transmitter affixed to the top of its shell. The electronic device should provide tracking data to help marine biologists gain insights into the reptile’s movements in unfamiliar territory, before it detaches in two to six months. Harry was rescued by recreational boaters in early February, entangled in a large fishing net, off the Upper Keys. Emaciated and near death, the reptile was transported to the Florida Keys-based Turtle Hospital for treatment. Hospital officials say olive ridley turtles typically live in the southern Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They say only six olive ridleys have been documented in Florida waters.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A new report says the state’s public colleges and universities had an economic impact worth $17.7 billion statewide during the 2018 fiscal year. The University System of Georgia said in a news release that the economic impact of its 26 schools increased by 5% over the previous fiscal year. It credited Georgia’s public colleges with creating 168,284 jobs – 70% of which were off-campus positions in the private and public sector. The annual study was conducted by University of Georgia economist Jeffrey Humphreys. The latest report covers the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2018. University system Chancellor Steve Wrigley says the results show that Georgia’s colleges and universities play an “important role in generating jobs and boosting businesses across the state.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Scientists in the state have started to prepare for a major coral reef bleaching event due to warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. The Star-Advertiser reports the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration analyzed ocean temperatures across the islands and found they’ve risen by 3 degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists say coral bleaching has occurred before, but they are already seeing worse signs at Kealakekua Bay on Hawaii island and at Kaneohe Bay and Hanauma Bay on Oahu. Experts say coral bleaching is a change from normal coloration of browns, yellows and greens to a nearly white color because of increased exposure to environmental stressors, including temperature increases. Scientists say coral reefs are important for marine habitats; have cultural, recreational and economic benefits; and also provide protection for coastal shorelines during storms.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state must provide gender confirmation surgery to a transgender inmate who has been living as a woman for years but has continuously been housed in a men’s prison, a federal appeals court said Friday. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with a federal judge in Idaho that the state’s denying the surgery for 31-year-old Adree Edmo amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, a violation of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Under the ruling, Edmo would become the first Idaho inmate to receive gender confirmation surgery while in Idaho Department of Correction custody. “This is a complete win for Ms. Edmo,” said her attorney, Lori Rifkin. “Our client is immensely relieved and grateful that the court recognized her basic right to medical treatment.” Republican Gov. Brad Little said he planned to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIllinois\n\nWaukegan: The Chicago-area hometown of the late, famed science fiction writer Ray Bradbury marked his birthday with the dedication of a statue in his honor. The 12-foot-tall stainless steel statue outside the Waukegan Public Library depicts Bradbury astride a rocket ship while holding a book. The (Lake County) News-Sun reports artist Zachary Oxman told those at Thursday’s ceremony that the statue tells the story of a man “beaming with unbridled imagination, curiosity and surprise.” Bradbury was born in Waukegan in 1920 and often spoke of the hours he spent at the city’s library before his family moved to Los Angeles when he was a teenager. He died in 2012. He wrote hundreds of works, including “Fahrenheit 451” and “The Martian Chronicles.” The $125,000 project was financed primarily through donations.\n\nIndiana\n\nPortage: The National Park Service has reopened beaches in northwestern Indiana, more than a week after a spill of cyanide and ammonia from a steel factory along Lake Michigan. The agency says three consecutive days of tests came out positive, including two days with no detection of cyanide. The government says samples were taken by Indiana environmental regulators and ArcelorMittal and reviewed by independent labs. The Park Service had closed the Portage Lakefront and Riverwalk beach areas at Indiana Dunes National Park. Fish were killed. ArcelorMittal says the spill occurred after its Burns Harbor mill had a failure at a blast furnace water recirculation system. Wastewater containing elevated levels of ammonia and cyanide was released in the Little Calumet River’s east branch. The company has apologized.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Google gave two local nonprofits $175,000 on Friday through the company’s Impact Challenge Iowa grant program. Five judges picked Iowa Jobs for America’s Graduates and Ethnic Minorities of Burma Advocacy and Resources as winners, along with three other nonprofits. Voters can cast ballots through Friday to pick the “People’s Choice” grant winner, which will receive another $125,000. IJAG is a mentor program that partners graduating students with employers in industries with a lot of job openings. The reward for EMBARC is for its RISE program, which helps prepare refugees for the workforce. The refugees work for other nonprofits in the state through the program, giving them job skills and helping them market themselves in the workforce.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: City police will begin using a system that places alerts on addresses where potential swatting targets could be living. Swatting involves someone making a hoax emergency call to send law enforcement officers, particularly SWAT teams, to a particular address. The program announced Friday is voluntary and open to people who think they might become victims of swatting. The alerts would be available to first responders. Officer Paul Cruz says the alerts wouldn’t slow emergency responders but would make them aware they might be responding to a hoax call. In 2017, Wichita police fatally shot Andrew Finch after a caller falsely claimed a murder and hostage situation was occurring at his home. The call was aimed at someone who lived at the home before Finch.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A print shop owner who refused to make a gay pride T-shirt argued before the state Supreme Court that he shouldn’t be compelled to promote messages that go against his religious beliefs. Blaine Adamson, owner of Hands-On Originals in Lexington, declined to print a shirt promoting an LGBT pride festival in 2012. The city’s Human Rights Commission said that refusal violated its gay-rights fairness ordinance. On Friday, the high court heard an attorney for the T-shirt maker argue that the First Amendment protects him from having to print that message. An attorney for the Human Rights Commission says the T-shirt maker cannot pick and choose who it wants to serve in the community. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments from attorneys and will issue a ruling at a later date.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAlexandria: One of the world’s northernmost sugarcane fields has been planted at a Louisiana State University research station in central Louisiana. The LSU AgCenter is looking into how well various varieties can survive chilly weather. The Dean Lee Research and Extension Center is generally considered too far north for the tall tropical grass. However, steady yields and prices have prompted some of the state’s farmers to push the limits, planting sugarcane in what has traditionally been corn and soybean country, an AgCenter news release says. One farmer is growing sugarcane a few miles south in the Lecompte area. There’s little data to indicate which varieties can best withstand central Louisiana’s deeper, more frequent freezes. So the AgCenter is working to get such information on eight varieties, some commercially available and some still experimental.\n\nMaine\n\nMillinocket: The Friends of Katahdin Woods and Waters group says it’s pleased with progress in the three years since the national monument was created in northern Maine. The group says improvements include a new bridge over Katahdin Brook, improved trails along the Loop Road at Deasey Pond and the Esker Trail built by Appalachian Mountain Club, and new trail signs put up by the National Park Service. Superintendent Tim Hudson says long-awaited road signs along I-95 and local roads should be going up by year’s end. As the Friends group hosted a celebration Saturday night to mark the third anniversary with music, dinner, awards and an auction, director Andrew Bossie thanked volunteer groups including the Baxter Youth Conservation Corps for their help.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: City fire officials say they plan to dispatch fewer firefighters to initial fire alarms, as departments see the number of medical emergency calls rise above those of fires. A Wednesday memo said three engines, one truck and one battalion chief will respond to alarms starting Sept. 1, down from the five engines, two trucks, two battalion chiefs and one medic unit that’s considered a full assignment. Seventeen personnel will respond, still higher than the National Fire Protection Association standard of 15. Chief Niles R. Ford told The Baltimore Sun the reduction will free units for medical calls. More responders can be dispatched if needed. Baltimore’s firefighters union criticized the plan, saying it’d put responders and citizens in danger, but Ford pushed back.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSherborn: A “peace park” in this Boston suburb has been forced to take down a United Nations flag after residents objected. Pacifist Memorial founder Lewis Randa recently removed the flag at the Sherborn site because residents of the condo development where it’s located argue that it violates their property agreement. The Abbey Road Condominium Trust says the 2012 land deal with Randa only allows him to maintain the memorial’s permanent installations, not to add new or temporary ones. But Randa says that while the U.N. flag was not part of the original memorial, one had flown for decades on the grounds. He suggests the dispute is rooted in long-simmering opposition to the memorial. Loretta Heuer, who heads the condo association, says the issue isn’t the flag but respecting property rights.\n\nMichigan\n\nIshpeming: An arsonist has severely hampered Santa’s toy production this fall. Mlive.com reports that Ishpeming Police on Saturday asked for the public’s help in solving the overnight arson and property damage case involving the Santa’s Workshop building used at Christmastime. Police said officers were dispatched to the site where the building is stored to find the structure destroyed. A city-owned pickup parked in the area was also damaged. Residents expressed their dismay on the police department’s Facebook page. Some offered to rebuild it for free in time for Christmas. One commenter suggested the guilty party rebuild it at no cost in addition to facing criminal charges. Another said that it’s “sad that the actions of a few people can ruin it for so many.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: The ever-present danger of rip currents in Lake Superior has some people in Duluth calling for more to be done to improve public safety. Retired police officer Dennis Hoelscher tells Minnesota Public Radio News that lifeguard services need to be improved. Lifeguards don’t work on “red flag” days that have high risk of rip currents. Hoelscher and others think guards should work on those days, work longer hours in general, work more beaches and be trained to work in big waves. The Duluth YMCA, which runs the lifeguard program on Park Point, says posting lifeguards misleads people to think it’s safe. And expanding services is difficult in what is currently mostly a break-even arrangement. MPR reports communities across the Great Lakes struggle with how to pay for lifeguards.\n\nMississippi\n\nColumbus: Officials say the city was on its way into debt but has turned its finances around, saving about $805,000 since March. The Commercial Dispatch reports Mayor Robert Smith told councilmen last week that the city saved about $329,000 while adding $476,000 to unbudgeted revenue. Accountant Mike Crowder in March told the city it’d be more than $300,000 in debt by September if spending continued. Smith says several decisions helped the city save, like freezes on hiring and wages, upping the employee health insurance deductible from $100 to $500, and opening the court clerk’s office on Fridays, which collected $26,206 in additional fees. Smith says the city had $7 million in its coffers, including about $2 million in the operating funds. It’s unclear whether the fund will finish the fiscal year at a deficit.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Authorities say a shirtless man reportedly dragging a topless, unconscious woman through downtown was actually lugging around a life-size doll. Police said in a tweet that callers reported the man looked like he wanted to throw the woman over a bridge, had dropped her and appeared to be trying to dress her. One caller said he was yelling “savior” while holding the woman. Police said that when officers learned the woman actually was a doll that the man had found in a trash bin, he was told “not to carry it around in public anymore.” Police titled the tweet: “And here is today’s episode of ‘Not What We Expected Going Into That.’ ” A traffic camera captured some of the incident.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: State officials say U.S. health officials have approved Montana’s plan to create a reinsurance pool that aims to lower individual health insurance premium costs. Gov. Steve Bullock and State Auditor Matt Rosendale say the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved a waiver that authorizes the reinsurance program. A bill passed by state lawmakers this year creates a pool to help reimburse insurers for high-cost claims from $40,000 to $1 million. It will be funded with money that otherwise would have been used as premium tax credits and through a premium tax on all major medical plans sold in the state. The three Montana companies that offer health insurance policies on the individual marketplace are proposing reduced rates in 2020, in part because of the reinsurance program.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state’s highest court lifted one of the last major hurdles for the Keystone XL pipeline in the state Friday when it rejected another attempt to derail the project by opponents who wanted to force the developer to reapply for state approval. The Nebraska Supreme Court upheld the decision of regulators who voted in November 2017 to greenlight a route through the state. The court’s decision was a victory for the $8 billion project, which has been mired in lawsuits and regulatory hearings since it was proposed in 2008. Despite the victory for Canada-based TC Energy, opponents vowed Friday that the legal fight to block construction was far from over. “The risky pipeline project’s fate is still very much in doubt, as three separate federal lawsuits continue to proceed that challenge the controversial project’s permits,” leading pipeline opposition group Bold Alliance said in a statement.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Safari Club International plans to hold its national convention in Las Vegas in 2021 instead of Reno. The sportsman’s club is ending its initial three-year agreement with the Biggest Little City a year early. The 2020 convention will continue in Reno in February. The club hasn’t officially announced the venue change, but the move has been confirmed by the Reno Sparks Convention and Visitors Authority. RSCVA Board Chairman Bob Lucy says it’s disappointing, but the board continues to have a good relationship with the club and hopes it returns someday. Safari Club returned to Reno this year following a five-year absence and declining attendance in Las Vegas. The RSCVA says this year’s convention generated an estimated $20 million in economic impact for the Reno-Tahoe area, including more than 17,000 room nights for the region’s hotels.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A year after Gov. Chris Sununu’s unsuccessful push to prolong school summer vacation until Labor Day, the vast majority of the state’s communities are sticking with their earlier start dates. Schools in 80% of districts will be starting before Labor Day this year. While four districts that started earlier last year will now start after Labor Day, two other districts went the other way. Sununu, a Republican, created a “Save Our Summers Study Commission” last August to explore a mandatory post-Labor Day start date. The group issued a report without taking sides, though it emphasized the economic benefits. Subsequent legislation to enact a mandate, however, was retained in the Senate Education Committee for reconsideration next year. Businesses tied to tourism support later start dates, while teachers oppose the idea.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Brunswick: Rutgers University’s daily student newspaper will cease print publication on Fridays and shift to reporting more news online. The Daily Targum’s student leaders say the decision to cut their printing days to Mondays to Thursdays is meant to help it stay afloat after a devastating vote last spring resulted in a loss of all student fee funding. NJ.com reports the student newspaper will save money in its $750,000 budget by cutting printing to four days a week. The organization will also save money by tapping into advertising revenue and donations raised online. Rutgers says it will hold another vote to ask students if they want to use student fees to fund the campus newspaper. The paper says it will continue to pay its student reporters, photographers, editors and three-member professional staff.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nBloomfield: The city has asked residents to help fund the remaining balance of fees resulting from a Ten Commandments monument lawsuit. Bloomfield launched an online fundraiser asking for help coming up with $467,000 it owes the American Civil Liberties Union lawyers after courts ruled against the city. Officials say the ACLU represented several residents who said the monument violated their First Amendment rights. Officials say the city owes lawyers $700,000 by June 30, 2021, and has already paid more than $200,000. Anything not raised will be paid for using the gross receipts tax and is currently budgeted. Officials say the resident-funded monument was displayed in front of city hall before being moved to a nearby church.\n\nNew York\n\nTupper Lake: Organizers of a new semi-pro baseball team in the Adirondacks are rooting around for a new nickname after some residents grunted at the proposed moniker “River Pigs.” The Adirondack Daily Enterprise reports that Tupper Lake Village Board Trustee David Maroun posted on Facebook that the name of the new Empire League team will be changed. The name River Pigs was chosen to reflect the region’s logging history. River pigs were skilled loggers who broke up logjams on rivers. But when the team was announced in late July, some Tupper Lake residents said the name “Pigs” sounded demeaning. Fire Chief Royce Cole says the village baseball committee will discuss other options over the weekend. The team is slated to arrive in Tupper Lake next summer.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: State election officials on Friday certified bar code ballots for use in elections starting next year despite an outcry that they can’t be trusted by voters uncertain their choices are accurately counted. The State Board of Elections voted 3-2 to allow a voting-machine maker to sell equipment that digitizes votes into bar code data, which is then tallied by the company’s counting machines. Almost two dozen speakers urged the elections board to reject bar code systems because voters can’t read the bar codes to check that they’re correct. But Democratic board chairman Damon Circosta sided with two Republicans on the five-member panel, citing the risk of delay after touchscreen-only equipment is disallowed in December. New voting machines in about a quarter of the state’s counties need to be replaced as primary elections loom in March.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A study finds that converting a historic railroad bridge into a pedestrian bridge can be done but would be expensive. Landscape architecture professors at North Dakota State University looked at repurposing the Bismarck-Mandan Rail Bridge as a footbridge. The Bismarck Tribune reports the study concluded that would cost almost $6.9 million. Proponents of saving the structure acknowledge they don’t yet have any funding commitments. Bridge owner BNSF Railway maintains that converting the 136-year-old bridge – rather than demolishing it – would delay a needed new bridge and also cause safety concerns. The bridge over the Missouri River connects Bismarck and Mandan. Friends of the Rail Bridge is proposing to convert the bridge into a pedestrian and bicycle path.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: Celebrities and musicians came out Sunday evening for Dave Chappelle’s Gem City Shine benefit. Earlier in the day, Kanye West brought a surprise Sunday Service gospel experience to RiverScape Metro Park. Actor and comedian Jon Stewart made a surprise appearance to help Chappelle introduce Chance the Rapper. Chapelle escorted music legend Stevie Wonder out to perform following Chance the Rapper’s set. The Gem City Shine block party kicked off at 4 p.m. to benefit the families and survivors of the Aug. 4 mass shooting that rocked the city. The sold-out event was held in the Oregon District, blocks away from where a gunman killed nine people and injured 27 others.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The city council is expected to set a citywide vote for a one-cent sales tax that would generate nearly $980 million over eight years to fund dozens of city projects, including money for social services like mental health and homelessness. The proposal outlined Friday is the fourth iteration of Metropolitan Area Projects, a comprehensive capital improvement program first approved by city voters in 1993. The council is expected to consider a resolution Tuesday that calls for a special election Dec. 10. Funding in the MAPS 4 proposal includes $40 million for mental health and addiction services and $38 million for a family justice center offering services to victims of abuse. Another $50 million would be earmarked for affordable housing for the homeless.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: After two walkouts this year by minority Republican senators in the Legislature, Democrats say they’ll ask voters to change quorum rules, allowing the Statehouse to convene with only a simple majority of lawmakers present instead of the current two-thirds requirement. The boycotts by the Republicans prevented the Senate from convening. Democrats dropped proposals on gun control and vaccines, and Democratic Gov. Kate Brown ordered state police to bring the missing lawmakers back during the second walkout. The Republicans left the state to avoid apprehension and returned only after a sweeping bill to combat global warming was moot. Senate Democrats said Majority Leader Ginny Burdick will introduce a constitutional amendment next year to lower quorum requirements. Voters would then decide on the proposed change in the 2020 election.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Hundreds of bicyclists have been caught with their pants down – and their shirts and underwear off, too. The cyclists gathered in a Philadelphia park Saturday to disrobe before saddling up and setting off on the annual Philly Naked Bike Ride. About 3,000 riders pedal a 10-mile course around the City of Brotherly Love while taking in sights including Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, organizers say. Some riders wear their birthday suits, while others flaunt their underwear or sport just a splash of body paint and glitter. The ride is intended to promote positive body image, advocate for the safety of cyclists and protest dependence on fossil fuels. It used to be held in September but was moved up to August because the nude and scantily clad participants complained about chilly weather.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A state lawmaker says he’s frustrated that mandated replacement license plates will have a design similar to the state’s distinctive “wave” plates in use since 1996. Sen. Louis DiPalma tells the Providence Journal the new design is supposed to make it easier for police to tell from a distance that a plate is old. The Department of Motor Vehicles told lawmakers last week the new plates would maintain the integrity of the current wave design with enough differences to serve the purpose of the plate reissue. Gov. Gina Raimondo’s spokesman says the new design will “closely mirror” existing plates. DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, wants to meet with Raimondo and DMV officials to get an explanation. Rhode Islanders with existing wave plates will have to get new ones starting next year.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nNorth Charleston: The city is giving $1 million to a new African American history museum and asking it to include the city’s story. The North Charleston City Council voted unanimously Thursday to give the money from the city’s taxes on hotels to the International African American Museum being built in Charleston. Mayor Keith Summey says he hopes the money helps tell the story of North Charleston’s predecessor Liberty Hill, where a black couple bought farmland during the Civil War that was later sold to other African Americans. North Charleston’s history also includes racial struggles. The city paid a $6.5 million settlement to the family of a black man, Walter Scott, who was shot in the back and killed by a white police officer in 2015.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A state board is weighing whether to raise bonding requirements for natural gas and oil drillers. The Rapid City Journal reports the Board of Minerals and Environment is considering the increase as the state pursues a $15.5 million lawsuit against a Texas-based company for abandoning gas wells in western South Dakota. Spyglass Cedar Creek drilled 40 natural gas wells near Buffalo and then abandoned them after natural gas prices plummeted. Board members called the Spyglass saga a “perfect storm.” Department of Environment and Natural Resources Minerals and Mining program administrator Mike Lees says the state has not had similar issues with other oil and gas developers in the state.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: A baby giraffe has officially been named Big Girl Two but will be called Bea. Zoo Knoxville officials announced the 2-month-old giraffe’s name at a Saturday event for zoo members. They also celebrated the fourth birthday of Bea’s mother, Frances. Frances gave birth to Bea, her first calf, on July 1. Zookeepers found mother and her healthy baby when they arrived for work that morning. Bea is the first giraffe calf born at the zoo in 17 years. She’s part of herd made up of her mother; her father, Jumbe; and female giraffe Lucille. The four live in the zoo’s Africa Grasslands natural habitat.\n\nTexas\n\nWaco: More farmers in the state are wading into the whiskey business, but their end users are far removed from the era of moonshine stills and midnight raids by ax-toting lawmen. The Waco Tribune-Herald reports the burgeoning Texas whiskey industry is doubling down on Lone Star pride by recruiting growers. An ode to this phenomenon is High Plains Texas Single Malt, a whiskey produced at Balcones Distilling in Waco using Texas-grown barley malted by Blacklands Malt in Leander. The finished product had its roots in an experiment involving Balcones, Blacklands and Texas A&M University Agrilife, which was exploring ways to develop a barley industry in Texas. Now, after more than two years of aging, High Plains Texas Single Malt has arrived. It is priced at $80 a bottle and available exclusively at Balcones.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A new U.S. government management plan unveiled Friday clears the way for coal mining and oil and gas drilling on land that used to be off limits as part of a sprawling national monument in the state before President Donald Trump downsized the protected area two years ago. The plan released by the Bureau of Land Management would also open more lands to cattle grazing and recreation and acknowledges there could be “adverse effects” on land and resources in the monument. But while allowing more activities, the plan would also add a few safeguards for the cliffs, canyons, waterfalls and arches still inside Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument that weren’t in a proposed plan issued last year. Among them are opening fewer acres to ATVs and canceling a plan that would have allowed people to collect some non-dinosaur fossils in certain areas.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: Police are investigating the theft of about $37,000 worth of equipment stolen from a music center during the Lake Champlain Chamber Music Festival. The Tuesday night or Wednesday morning burglary at the Elley Long Music Center in Colchester occurred when at least one person broke into an engineering room and stole a case of audio equipment. Rosina Cannizzaro, the executive director for the Vermont Youth Orchestra Association, calls it a “cowardly act.” She says she hopes the equipment can be returned to the owner. MyNBC5 reports the music center says it has implemented overnight security and will be removing all valuable items like sound gear and cash from the building every night.\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton: Gov. Ralph Northam and other state officials are observing the arrival of enslaved Africans to what is now Virginia 400 years ago. Northam said he signed a directive Saturday to create a commission on African American history in the state. He says it will review educational standards and instructional practices to teach black history in the state. Northam says the state must ensure that all students develop a full understanding of the African American voices that contribute to the nation’s story. He made the announcement at the 2019 African Landing Commemorative Ceremony in Hampton. The landing in August 1619 is considered a pivotal moment that presaged a system of race-based slavery.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium is celebrating the birth of its first tamandua pup, which is the size of an avocado. KING-TV reports the southern tamandua is a species of anteaters native to South America that lives in trees. The healthy pup was born Aug. 18 and weighs just more than a half-pound. The baby tamandua will make a public debut once it is stronger and more confident. Until then, it will practice riding on its mother’s back and begin eating fruit and insects in about two months. Zookeepers won’t know the baby’s gender until it is older.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nPipestem: Fans of all things horror gathered at Pipestem Event Center on Saturday to visit the first-ever FearFestWV. “It’s important to bring something like this to this area. There are fans of all ages here from age 5 to 75,” said event hostess and personality Coen Beck, also known as Coen the Butcher. Guests enjoyed vendors specializing in horror merchandise, live music of the metal genre and big-name horror actors. With VIP tickets, guests could meet and speak one-on-one with their favorite big-screen menaces. Actors present included Bill Moseley (“The Devil’s Rejects,” “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” and “House of 1000 Corpses”), Michael Berryman (“The Hills Have Eyes,” “The Devil’s Rejects”) and Tony Moran, known for his iconic role of Michael Myers in “Halloween.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A rare bee not seen in the state in more than a century has turned up in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest. U.S. Forest Service scientists found the bee in July while surveying pollinators as part of an inventory of native bees in the Great Lakes region. It’s known commonly as a cuckoo bee, but its scientific name is a mouthful: Epeoloides pilosulus. The bee was once widespread in eastern and central America but was thought to have gone extinct. It was then found in 2002 in Nova Scotia, Canada – and only two such bees have been found since, in Connecticut in 2006 and New York in 2014. Wisconsin has about 500 native bee species.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The city will begin restoring another stretch of the North Platte River in October, the next step in a long-term project expected to cost at least $23 million. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the upcoming work will cost $2.5 million and cover about half a mile of the river. It will include adjusting the channel, stabilizing the banks, removing debris, restoring native vegetation and installing a boat ramp. The river suffered from decades of pollution from industry and a landfill. The city launched the restoration project in 2015, and the upcoming work will be the fourth of seven planned phases. The city and the Two Fly Foundation, a fly-fishing group, started an annual volunteer cleanup day for the river in 2005. The next event is next month.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/26"}]}
{"question_id": "20230526_22", "search_time": "2023/05/27/00:52", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/football/qatar-2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-human-rights-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Migrant workers helped build Qatar's World Cup tournament, now ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nKamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers, having finished yet another grueling working day, when he and – he says – a few others were arrested this August. Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis Pramod Acharya Sugam Pokharel", "Aimee Lewis", "Pramod Acharya", "Sugam Pokharel"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/americas/peru-president-castillo-congress-dissolves-intl/index.html", "title": "Peru's Castillo impeached and arrested, Boluarte sworn in as new ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDina Boluarte became Peru’s first female President on Wednesday, capping off a dramatic day which saw her predecessor arrested for the alleged crime of rebellion and impeached by lawmakers.\n\nBoluarte, the country’s former vice president, was sworn into the top job at Congress to become Peru’s sixth President in under five years.\n\nThe ceremony took place hours after a majority of 101 members in the 130-person legislative body voted to impeach former leader Pedro Castillo.\n\nThe tumultuous day began when then-President Castillo announced plans to dissolve Congress and install an emergency government, ahead of a looming impeachment vote by lawmakers, which Peru’s Ombudsman described as an “attempted coup d’état.”\n\nHe also called for parliamentary elections to work on a new constitution.\n\nThe move prompted a string of cabinet resignations, fiery reactions from top officials and condemnation from regional neighbors – and ultimately failed to prevent his impeachment in Congress.\n\nPeruvian armed forces rejected Castillo’s attempt to sideline lawmakers, calling it an “infringement of the constitution.”\n\nAnd Boluarte herself criticized Castillo’s dissolution plan, describing it on Twitter as “a coup that aggravates the political and institutional crisis that Peruvian society will have to overcome with strict adherence to the law.”\n\nCastillo was detained in Lima Prefecture on Wednesday. Fuente con acceso al caso\n\nInternational officials joined the chorus of condemnations of Castillo, with the United States urging the leader to “reverse” the move and “allow Peru’s democratic institutions to function according to the Constitution,” US Ambassador in Peru Lisa Kenna said on Twitter.\n\n“We will continue to stand against and to categorically reject any acts that contradict Peru’s constitution, any act that undermines democracy in that country,” said US State Department spokesperson Ned Price in a statement.\n\nArgentina’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed “deep concern” over Peru’s political crisis in a statement on Twitter, and Brazil’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that Castillo’s actions were “incompatible with the constitutional framework of that country, [and] represent a violation of democracy and the rule of law.”\n\nIn a stunning turn of events, Castillo was detained by police in the capital city Lima after lawmakers impeached him in Congress.\n\nPeru's Dina Boluarte is sworn in as President in Lima on December 7, 2022.

The former schoolteacher and union leader rose from obscurity to be elected in July 2021 by a narrow margin in a runoff, and was seen as part of a “pink tide” of new left-wing leaders in Latin America.\n\nHe ran on a platform promising to rewrite the constitution and increase wealth redistribution by granting states greater control over markets and natural resources, pledges that he has struggled to deliver amid rising inflation in Peru, his lack of political experience and strong conservative opposition in Congress.\n\nThe government of the leftist leader had been mired in chaos since inauguration, with dozens of ministers appointed, replaced, fired or quitting their posts in little over a year – piling further pressure on him.\n\nCastillo has railed against the opposition for trying to remove him from the first day he was in office. He has accused Benavides of orchestrating what he called a new form of “coup d’état” against him through her office’s investigations.\n\nIn October, Benavides filed a constitutional complaint against Castillo based on three of the six investigations her office had opened. The complaint allows Congress to carry out its own investigation against the former President.\n\nA cascade of investigations\n\nCastillo has faced a cascade of investigations on whether he used his position to benefit himself, his family and closest allies by peddling influence to gain favor or preferential treatment, among other claims.\n\nCastillo has repeatedly denied all allegations and reiterated his willingness to cooperate with any investigation. He argues the allegations are a result of a witch-hunt against him and his family from groups that failed to accept his election victory.\n\nLawmakers stand inside Congress on the day of their planned impeachment vote on President Pedro Castillo in Lima, Peru, Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2022. Guadalupe Pardo/AP\n\nThe former President faces five preliminary criminal investigations on allegations of masterminding corruption schemes while in office. These include prosecutors’ allegation that he led a “criminal network” that interfered with public institutions such as the Ministry of Transport and Communications, Ministry of Housing and Peru’s state-run oil company to control public bidding processes and benefit specific companies and close allies.\n\nProsecutors are also investigating whether the former President led efforts to peddle influence in the process of promoting officers in both the armed forces and national police.\n\nThese investigations also look into Castillo’s family, including his wife and sister-in-law. Former first lady Lilia Paredes is being investigated on suspicion of allegedly coordinating the criminal network. Her attorney, Benji Espinoza, has stressed her innocence and argues the investigation against the former first lady includes “a number of flaws and omissions.”\n\nPolice officers stand guard as people gather outside Peru's Congress after President Pedro Castillo said he will dissolve it on December 7.

Kherson was the only Ukrainian regional capital that Russian forces had captured since February’s invasion.

Twitter\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry announced earlier on Friday that its forces have completed their partial withdrawal from the Kherson region, after Moscow ordered the retreat Wednesday,\n\n“In the Kherson direction, the move of Russian military units to the left bank of the Dnieper River was completed at 0500 [Moscow time] this morning,” the ministry said on its official Telegram channel, using the Russian spelling for the river.\n\n“Not a single piece of military equipment or weaponry was left behind on the right [west] bank,” the statement added. “All Russian servicemen have moved to the left bank of the Dnieper.”\n\nSocial media video suggests otherwise, with Russian tanks, armored vehicles and crates of ammunition displayed by Ukrainian troops.\n\nUkraine has asserted that it carried out attacks against Russian troop concentrations that were withdrawing, but the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement later on Friday that “despite the attempts of the enemy to disrupt the transfer of Russian troops, no losses among personnel, weapons, military equipment and materiel were allowed.”\n\nIt also claimed that the Ukrainian advance had been held back for several days, and that “manpower and military equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the right bank of the Dnieper are being hit by fire.”\n\nUkraine has not reported any incoming fire from the east bank Friday but said a missile attack on the city of Mykolaiv, close to the border with Kherson, killed seven people early Friday.\n\nEarlier Friday, the Ukrainian military’s southern operational command said Russian forces had been “urgently loading into boats that seem suitable for crossing and trying to escape” across the river.\n\nIt was unclear whether all Russian troops had left Kherson and the wider region; Khlan said the city was “almost under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine” but warned that some Russian troops may have remained behind in civilian clothing.\n\nHe cautioned that many Russian troops “threw away their military uniforms, and are now hiding with civilian clothes on.”\n\n“They will be plotting provocations, false-flag operations in the city,” he said. “There is a lot of work ahead on demining and clearing the city.” Residents of Kherson city with whom CNN has spoken in recent weeks confirmed that many Russian soldiers were using civilian clothing.\n\nUkraine’s military said it would proceed cautiously through Kherson region, and warned Russian troops were mining roads and destroying critical infrastructure as they retreated from the region.\n\n“The Russian invaders continue their looting of settlements from which they are retreating,” spokesman for the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces Oleksandr Shtupun said. “The enemy is also trying to damage power lines, other transport and critical infrastructure facilities of Kherson region.”\n\nImages and video on social media Friday also showed that the Antonivskyi Bridge, the main conduit over the Dnipro in the Kherson region, had been destroyed.\n\nAt least seven bridges in total, four of them crossing the River Dnipro, have been destroyed in the last 24 hours, Maxar Technologies satellite images and other photos show.\n\nTwo bridges, a vehicle and a railroad, that sit atop a dam at Nova Kakhovka were among those destroyed.\n\nWater is flowing out of three sluice gates at the critical dam, which spans the Dnipro river, according to satellite images from Maxar Technologies obtained by CNN.\n\nIt’s unclear how the latest damage, which is close to the west bank, was caused. Local Telegram channels reported Thursday night the sound of explosions around the dam. Ukrainian forces do not appear they have taken control of the dam, which could cause considerable damage in the region if breached.\n\nAlexander Kots, a reporter for the Russian pro-government tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda embedded with Russian forces, posted a video on his Telegram channel standing on the crossing, showing the entire center section of the bridge destroyed. “Behind me are the two collapsed spans of (the) bridge,” Kots said. “They were likely blown up during the withdrawal of the Russian group of forces from the right bank to the left,” or western bank to eastern bank.\n\nThe entire center section of the bridge appears to have been destroyed. Twitter\n\nSweeping losses\n\nRussian forces have ceded about 40% of the Kherson region, which straddles the Dnipro, within a few days.\n\nNow that Ukrainian forces have recaptured Kherson as far as the Dnipro river, the two sides face each other across the river over a distance of some 250 kilometers – from the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the edge of the Black Sea.\n\nAs Russian forces have fled, Ukrainian troops have pushed forward in their wake, capturing dozens of villages and settlements in Kherson region above the Dnipro.\n\nThe Ukrainian military on Friday recaptured another part of Kherson region, the village of Tyahinka near the strategic town of Nova Kakhovka, despite Russian forces destroying bridges to the village.\n\nA video circulating on social media on Friday, geolocated and authenticated by CNN, showed Ukrainian forces being greeted by residents on the main highway in Tyahinka. The village is just 14 miles (20 km) west of the hydroelectric dam and bridges that stretch across the Dnipro river at Nova Kakhovka.\n\nA number of photos, also geolocated and authenticated by CNN, show that the Ukrainian forces were able to make their way into the village despite the main highway’s bridge and a pedestrian bridge being destroyed by the Russians as they withdrew. Dozens of bridges across the Kherson region have been destroyed or disabled during the conflict.\n\nResidents of the town of Bilozerka, on the western outskirts of Kherson city, raised a Ukrainian flag and ripped down Russian propaganda billboards on Friday, according to videos on social media geolocated by CNN.\n\nOne video showed a Ukrainian flag flying over a World War II memorial, while another showed residents tearing down a propaganda billboards with a young girl holding a Russian flag, which read: “Russia is here forever.”\n\nThe scenes of people greeting Ukrainian troops across the region were in sharp contrast to claims by Russian-appointed officials in Kherson six weeks ago that 87% of voters there supported integration into the Russian Federation, in a referendum widely condemned by the international community as a sham. Kherson was one of four Ukrainian regions illegally annexed by Russia in September.\n\nKyiv officials had warned that retreating Russian troops could turn the regional capital of Kherson into a “city of death” on the way out, and an official in southern Ukraine warned residents Friday to be wary of quickly returning to recently liberated territory due to the threat of mines.\n\n“There are a lot of mines in the liberated territories and settlements,” Vitaliy Kim, head of Mykolaiv region military administration, said on Telegram. “Don’t go there for no reason. There are casualties.”\n\nPutin’s spokesperson on Friday insisted that the region remains part of Russia, despite the Russian withdrawal.\n\n“This is a subject of the Russian Federation,” Dmitry Peskov said during a regular briefing with journalists. “It has been legally fixed and defined. There can be no changes here.”\n\nRussia still controls a large portion of the Kherson region – the area east of the Dnipro River.\n\nWhen asked directly whether Russia’s retreat was “humiliating” for President Vladimir Putin, Peskov replied: “No.”", "authors": ["Mick Krever Anna Chernova Teele Rebane Gianluca Mezzofiore Tim Lister Sophie Tanno", "Mick Krever", "Anna Chernova", "Teele Rebane", "Gianluca Mezzofiore", "Tim Lister", "Sophie Tanno"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/marc-fogel-russia/index.html", "title": "Marc Fogel: Family of American teacher sentenced in Russia calls ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe family of an American sentenced to 14 years at a hard labor camp in Russia fears that he has been given what amounts to a “a death sentence” and is calling on the Biden administration to designate him as wrongfully detained, which would trigger formal diplomatic efforts to secure his release.\n\nAmerican citizen Marc Fogel worked for nearly a decade as a history teacher at the Anglo-American School in Moscow, where children of US diplomats were among his students.\n\n“He is a very, very much beloved teacher, an award-winning teacher,” one of his sisters, Anne Fogel, told CNN. “He is an incredibly enthusiastic person, has an amazing zest for life. And that has made him an outstanding teacher, and his students have loved him.”\n\nHe was arrested 11 months ago at an airport in the Russian capital, where he was returning for the school year, after traveling into the country with cannabis.\n\nHis family and lawyer said he was carrying it for medical purposes that had been recommended by a doctor to treat “severe spinal pain.”\n\nLast month, he was found guilty in a court just outside of Moscow – the same where the trial of detained WNBA player Brittney Griner is taking place – of committing “large-scale drugs smuggling” and given the 14-year sentence.\n\nThe situation around Fogel’s case has other similarities to Griner’s. Both Americans were arrested at a Russian airport for having cannabis, which they testified was for personal ailments, although Fogel was found to have been carrying much more of the substance than Griner.\n\nHowever, unlike Griner, Fogel has not been classified as wrongfully detained – a designation which would prompt the US government to actively work on negotiations to secure his release as part of the efforts by the State Department’s Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs.\n\n“The Griner case makes the case for his classification as wrongfully detained even stronger. But even leaving that aside he should still be designated as wrongfully detained. It cannot be explained unless there is a political motive, because legally it does not add up,” Thomas Firestone, a member of Fogel’s US legal team, said.\n\n‘Wildly disproportionate’\n\nThe length of Fogel’s sentence floored his family, who have filed an appeal, and Firestone, who told CNN that “14 years for that kind of offense is wildly disproportionate.”\n\n“It is also disproportionate when you consider other sentences in the Russian system. There are murderers in Russia who are sentenced to only 10 years in prison,” said Firestone, a former Department of Justice official who has served as the Resident Legal Advisor and Acting Chief of the Law Enforcement Section at the US Embassy in Moscow.\n\nAnne Fogel told CNN they “have filed an appeal. And we’re hoping that the Russian judicial system will recognize the humanity of this, that a 61-year old man, elderly at this point, is not capable of doing this kind of time. This is a death sentence for him.”\n\n“Every day is full of frustrations, frustration probably doesn’t even go far enough,” Elise Hyland, another sister of Fogel, said, telling CNN that throughout the trial the family tried to “play by the rules” – keeping a low profile, working within the Russian legal system, providing all the supporting documentation in support of his case – in the hopes of a lenient sentence, but they did not get it.\n\n“This sentence that my brother has been given is outrageous. We know that the sentence exceeds what is reasonable and it is because of his status as an American citizen,” she said.\n\nA foreign government detaining an individual “solely or substantially because he or she is a United States national” is one of the criteria under the Robert Levinson Act for the US government to determine whether someone is wrongfully detained.\n\nFirestone said that “it is hard to say if Griner’s fame played into the State Department quickly designating her as wrongfully detained, because it is hard to say what information they have about her detention and the background of that case.”\n\n“These cases are always a multifactor analysis and are often based on confidential information and intelligence,” he told CNN.\n\nState Department spokesperson Ned Price said that “each case is unique, and in determining whether a detention is wrongful, in determining if a detention is wrongful, we look at the totality of the circumstances.”\n\n“We never close the book when it comes to any particular case. We are constantly looking at the facts. We are constantly looking at the circumstances,” he said at a State Department briefing Tuesday. “As we learn more about any given case, as we learn more about the circumstances of detention, the charges, fair trial guarantees, due process or lack thereof, we are always weighing those developments against the criteria to determine whether an American is wrongfully held or not.”\n\nFogel’s family said they would like to see him designated as wrongfully detained, but they are hopeful that the US government will do everything it can to bring him home.\n\nBut time is of the essence, his family said.\n\nAnne Fogel told CNN the family has only been able to receive letters from Marc, and they haven’t spoken to him in nearly a year.\n\n“It’s incredibly worrisome because we can’t really have, there is no honest conversation. Everything goes through the censors. It’s harrowing,” she said.\n\n“I feel like we’re in a black box. And we’re trying to feel out our way,” she said. “This has been absolutely one of the most challenging periods of time for my family.”", "authors": ["Kylie Atwood Jennifer Hansler Michael Conte", "Kylie Atwood", "Jennifer Hansler", "Michael Conte"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/europe/brittney-griner-trial/index.html", "title": "Brittney Griner: WNBA star sentenced to 9 years in Russian jail for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAmerican women’s basketball star Brittney Griner was convicted of deliberately smuggling drugs into Russia and sentenced to nine years of jail time Thursday in a case that has raised concerns she is being used as a political pawn in Russia’s war against Ukraine.\n\nJudge Anna Sotnikova of the Khimki city court delivered the sentence and fined Griner 1 million rubles, or about $16,400. She said the court took into account Griner’s partial admission of guilt, remorse for the deed, state of health and charitable activities. Prosecutors had asked that she be sentenced to 9.5 years in jail.\n\nPrior to the verdict, Griner apologized to the court and asked for leniency in an emotional speech.\n\n“I never meant to hurt anybody, I never meant to put in jeopardy the Russian population, I never meant to break any laws here,” Griner said. “I made an honest mistake and I hope that in your ruling that it doesn’t end my life here. I know everybody keeps talking about political pawn and politics, but I hope that, that is far from this courtroom.\n\n“I want to say again that I had no intent on breaking any Russian laws. I had no intent. I did not conspire or plan to commit this crime,” she added.\n\nAfter the sentence, Griner told a CNN producer as she left court, “I love my family.”\n\nThe verdict comes about six months after the 31-year-old was arrested at a Moscow airport and accused by Russian prosecutors of trying to smuggle less than 1 gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. The two-time US Olympic basketball gold medalist pleaded guilty to drug charges last month and said she accidentally packed the drugs while in a hurry.\n\nGriner’s lawyers, Maria Blagovolina and Alexander Boykov, said in a written statement they will appeal the decision and criticized the court for ignoring their evidence. They have 10 days to appeal.\n\n“We are very disappointed by the verdict. As legal professionals, we believe that the court should be fair to everyone regardless of nationality. The court completely ignored all the evidence of the defense, and most importantly, the guilty plea,” they said in the statement. “This contradicts the existing legal practice. Taking into account the amount of the substance (not to mention the defects of the expertise) and the plea, the verdict is absolutely unreasonable. We will certainly file an appeal.”\n\nSpeaking outside court, Boykov said that the average time in jail for this type of crime is five years, adding that almost a third of those convicted get parole.\n\nGriner “is not doing fine today,” said Blagovolina, a partner at Rybalkin, Gortsunyan, Dyakin and Partners law firm. The defense team is hopeful that Griner will be able to talk to her family next week. Blagovolina added that Griner will return to the detention center where she is being held.\n\nSentence comes amid tense US-Russia relations\n\nBrittney Griner plays during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.

Matt York/AP In pictures: WNBA star Brittney Griner Prev Next\n\nThe harsh sentence comes amid the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the country’s saber-rattling with the US and Europe. The US State Department maintains Griner is wrongfully detained, and US officials have offered a potential prisoner swap with Russia in an attempt to bring her home safely.\n\nCharge d’Affaires of the US Embassy in Russia, Elizabeth Rood, said the sentence was a “miscarriage of justice,” and US President Joe Biden said the lengthy sentence was “unacceptable.”\n\n“Today, American citizen Brittney Griner received a prison sentence that is one more reminder of what the world already knew: Russia is wrongfully detaining Brittney. It’s unacceptable, and I call on Russia to release her immediately so she can be with her wife, loved ones, friends, and teammates,” Biden said in a statement.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken criticized the Russian legal system more broadly, saying the sentence “puts a spotlight on our significant concerns with Russia’s legal system and the Russian government’s use of wrongful detentions to advance its own agenda, using individuals as political pawns.”\n\nHe said the US is working to bring home Griner and Paul Whelan, an American citizen who has been held by Russia for alleged espionage since 2018. “This is an absolute priority of mine and the Department’s,” Blinken said.\n\nIt’s now “up to the Russian side” on whether Griner’s conviction opens new doors for negotiations of a prisoner swap, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said.\n\n“We’re still open to having our proposal seriously and positively considered, and if on the Russian side that means they feel like they’re more empowered to do that, then so be it,” Kirby told reporters in Thursday’s White House briefing.\n\nKirby reiterated the US position remains that it wants Russia to “take the deal on the table because it’s a good one, it’s a fair one, and it’ll help bring Paul and Brittney home.”\n\nCNN National Security Analyst Steve Hall said the harsh sentence was not a surprise and argued that Russia’s court proceedings are not legitimate.\n\n“This is all performance in Russia. There was never any doubt as to what was going to happen,” he said. “What Vladimir Putin is trying to do is basically drive up the bargaining price of Ms. Griner.”\n\nWNBA star's lawyers: cannabis was prescribed 02:21 - Source: CNN\n\nLast week, CNN reported that the Biden administration proposed a prisoner swap with Russia, offering to release a convicted Russian arms trafficker, Viktor Bout, in exchange for Griner and Whelan. Russian officials countered the US offer, multiple sources familiar with the discussions have said, but US officials did not accept the request as a legitimate counteroffer.\n\nThe Kremlin warned Tuesday that US “megaphone diplomacy” will not help negotiations for a prisoner exchange involving Griner. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow believes these talks should be “discrete.”\n\nGriner’s WNBA team, the Phoenix Mercury, played the Connecticut Sun on Thursday night. Before the game, the teams held a 42-second moment of silence as players linked arms. Near the end of the tribute, spectators started chanting, “Bring her home! Bring her home!” Griner, a six-time WNBA all-star, wears No. 42 for the Mercury.\n\nThe Mercury lost 77-64. Point guard Skylar Diggins-Smith, wearing a “We Are BG” T-shirt, said after the game the verdict was devastating.\n\n“Nobody wanted to even play today,” she told reporters. “How are you supposed to approach the game, approach the court and with a clear mind, and our whole group is crying before the game? Because you try to honor her and you try to come out and still play hard for her.”\n\nEarlier, the Mercury released a statement calling the verdict “a sobering milestone in the 168-day nightmare” of her detention.\n\n“We are inspired every day by BG’s strength and we are steadfastly committed to keeping her top-of-mind publicly until she is safely back on American soil. We will not allow her to be forgotten. We are BG,” the statement reads.\n\nHead coach Vanessa Nygaard told CNN the guilty verdict and Griner’s sentence is “unacceptable.”\n\n“It’s just heartbreaking,” the coach said. “To hear her words and her apologies. Just trying to send love, prayers and strength to her.”\n\nIn a joint statement, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver criticized the verdict and sentence as “unjustified and unfortunate, but not unexpected.”\n\n“The WNBA and NBA’s commitment to her safe return has not wavered and it is our hope that we are near the end of this process of finally bringing BG home to the United States,” they said.\n\nDefense asked for leniency in closing arguments\n\nThe court hearing Thursday began shortly after Griner arrived in handcuffs, escorted by Russian officers into the defendant’s cage. Once uncuffed, she spoke with her legal team and then held up a photo of the UMMC Ekaterinburg basketball team, the Russian squad she played for during the WNBA offseason.\n\nIn closing arguments, Blagovolina argued that Griner never used marijuana in Russia and that she never had the intention of doing so. She had no need to bring the vape cartridges to Russia, the lawyer added. All this confirms the complete absence of intent in her actions, Blagovolina argued.\n\nEven if Griner ever used medical marijuana, it was only at home back in Arizona, rare and only with a doctor’s prescription, she added. She couldn’t have known how strict the laws were in Russia, Blagovolina said.\n\nBoykov also argued Griner had no opportunity to properly examine the court documents. He said that the Russian constitution guarantees everyone the right to use their native language and the free choice of the language of communication.\n\nBoykov cited an instance when a language interpreter provided to Griner flipped through a lengthy document offered by an investigator for translation and then told Griner, “Basically, it means that you are guilty.”\n\nThroughout the trial, Griner’s attorneys have laid out arguments undermining the prosecution’s case and claiming her detention was not handled correctly after she was stopped February 17 by personnel at the Sheremetyevo International Airport.\n\nHer detention, search and arrest were “improper,” Boykov said last week, noting more details would be revealed during closing arguments.\n\nAfter she was stopped in the airport, Griner was made to sign documents that she did not fully understand, she testified. At first, she said, she was using Google translate on her phone but was later moved to another room where her phone was taken and she was made to sign more documents.\n\nNo lawyer was present, Griner testified, and her rights were not explained to her. Those rights would include access to an attorney once she was detained and the right to know what she was suspected of. Under Russian law, she should have been informed of her rights within three hours of her arrest.\n\nOn Tuesday, at the seventh hearing in her case, a defense expert testified that the examination of the substance contained in Griner’s vape cartridges did not comply with Russian law. Blagovolina also told CNN her team’s experts identified “a few defects” in the machines used to measure the substance.\n\nAt trial, Griner testified she has a doctor’s prescription for medical cannabis and had no intention of bringing the drug into Russia. Following her detention in February, she was tested for drugs and was clean, her lawyers previously said.\n\n“We continue to insist that, by indiscretion, in a hurry, she packed her suitcase and did not pay attention to the fact that substances allowed for use in the United States ended up in this suitcase and arrived in the Russian Federation,” Boykov, of Moscow Legal Center, has said.", "authors": ["Anna Chernova Zahra Ullah Masha Angelova Chris Liakos Eric Levenson", "Anna Chernova", "Zahra Ullah", "Masha Angelova", "Chris Liakos", "Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/europe/andrew-tate-detained-romania-human-trafficking-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Andrew Tate and his brother detained for a month in Romania | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nControversial internet personality Andrew Tate and his brother were ordered to be detained for a month on Friday as prosecutors pursued claims of human trafficking and rape.\n\nAuthorities in Romania said police served search warrants on Thursday at five homes and took four suspects into custody – two Britons and two Romanians – as part of the investigation.\n\nRomania’s Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) said the four suspects had been detained for an initial 24 hours. A Bucharest court accepted an application by DIICOT to hold Tate and his brother Tristan in custody for a further 30 days, their lawyer Eugen Vidineac said on Friday.\n\nSpeaking to journalists outside the court, Vidineac said the decision would be appealed. “From our perspective, there are no grounds for taking the most drastic preventive measures provided by the criminal procedure code,” he added, according to Reuters.\n\nDIICOT alleged that the four suspects formed an organized criminal group that stretched from Romania to Britain and the United States, for the purpose of committing the crime of human trafficking.\n\nThe authorities allege that two of the suspects misled the victims “into believing that they intended to enter into a marriage/cohabitation relationship” while transporting victims to Romania and later sexually exploiting them with physical violence and coercion.\n\nAuthorities also said one of the suspects raped a victim on two separate occasions in March 2022. At least six victims were allegedly “sexually exploited by the organized criminal group,” the DIICOT statement said.\n\nOn Thursday, DIICOT released an edited, grainy, sometimes out-of-focus video purportedly showing the raids. A man can be seen being patted down by police. It’s unclear who is being detained in the video.\n\nIn a separate video aired by CNN affiliate Antena 3, officers from the crime agency can be seen escorting Andrew and Tristan Tate into police vehicles.\n\nOn Friday, Andrew Tate tweeted from his verified account, “The Matrix sent their agents.”\n\nAndrew Tate, a former professional kickboxer, is known for his viral rants online about male dominance, female submission and wealth. He openly advocates violence against women, and had previously been banned from every major social media platform until Elon Musk reinstated his Twitter account after taking over the company.\n\nHe rose in prominence earlier this year, with many adults including school teachers voicing alarm about his misogynistic ideas taking root in the minds of countless young boys. Before it was taken down, his TikTok account racked up about 11.6 billion views.\n\nHe made headlines this week for a Twitter interaction with Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who told Tate to get a life after he tweeted about his numerous cars “and their respective enormous emissions.”\n\nThere was speculation online that authorities were alerted to Tate’s presence in Romania by the appearance of a particular pizza box in one of the photos he posted in his spat with Thunberg.\n\nBut, according to Reuters, a spokesperson for DIICOT said the pizza boxes did not play a role in the detentions.", "authors": ["Duarte Mendonca Philip Wang Jessie Yeung", "Duarte Mendonca", "Philip Wang", "Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/politics/trump-fbi-search-political-rallying-cry-analysis/index.html", "title": "Trump turns his legal battle after FBI search into political rallying cry ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDonald Trump’s new lawsuit over the FBI search of his Florida resort codifies his political fury into a legal strategy and implicitly spells out how the ex-President intends to exploit the drama as a springboard for his likely 2024 White House bid.\n\nTrump’s legal team on Monday asked a federal judge to appoint a “special master” to ensure the Justice Department returns any private documents taken from his residence, maintaining that his constitutional rights were violated.\n\nThe request for a special master – an independent legal official – is not a surprising one, and may well be granted in such a case. It is a move that can be used to ensure that legally privileged or other similar documents collected by investigators are not drawn unnecessarily or unfairly into an ongoing case.\n\nBut in many other ways, Trump’s filing – the most concrete and aggressive formal legal move in the case so far – is a classic of its genre. It fits squarely into the ex-President’s history of using the legal system to delay, distract, distort and politicize accusations against him, a strategy that has often worked well to spare or postpone serious accountability. And it is also a characteristic example of how the former President often mixes and matches political and legal strategies when he comes under investigation.\n\nWhile the motion is a formal legal document, it serves as a political roadmap that explains how Trump would style himself as a presidential candidate persecuted, as he sees it, for partisan reasons by the Biden administration. It’s also offers 27 pages of talking points for Trump’s GOP allies and serves to take the focus away from the core questions in the case: did he illegally and recklessly keep classified information and government secrets to which he was not entitled and which could put national security as risk? And did Trump or those around him try to obstruct the investigators from continuing their pursuit?\n\nThe gambit also once again underscores the extraordinarily sensitive stakes of the investigation and the political hornet’s nest disturbed by the Justice Department in going ahead with the search of Trump’s home. Such an operation at the home of any former president would be a deeply serious undertaking. The involvement of Trump – who’s nursing a false grievance over his exit from power, who knows how to turn attempts to hold him to account into fundraising ammunition and who has incited violence – means the current case is one of the most serious in the DOJ’s modern history. This reality appears to put even more of an onus on the department to explain and justify its actions and to provide the maximum amount of transparency possible to the public.\n\nBut it also underscores yet another truism of Trump’s career in politics – the simple act of investigating him inevitably exposes the institutions set up to constrain presidents and enforce the law to a backlash that leaves them politicized and often illegitimate in the eyes of his millions of supporters.\n\nTrump’s loyalists have likewise tried to discredit probes of the January 6, 2021, insurrection. There were new signs on Monday that the DOJ’s separate investigation into events surrounding that day are ramping up when CNN reported exclusively that the department issued a fresh subpoena to the National Archives – another development that could be troublesome for the former President and deepen his legal quagmire.\n\nNew legal clashes loom\n\nTrump’s move in the escalating showdown stirs the legal pot ahead of a Thursday deadline for the DOJ to provide the judge in the case with redactions in an underlying sealed affidavit that sets out detailed reasons for the search of Trump’s residence two weeks ago and the material that FBI agents expected to find there.\n\nJudge Bruce Reinhart, meanwhile, wrote in an order on Monday that he was satisfied that the facts in the affidavit are “reliable” and that while he understood calls for transparency, agreed that the Justice Department has genuine reasons, including the need to protect witnesses, for stopping the disclosure of information in the document.\n\nThe ostensible purpose of Trump’s filing is to secure the appointment of a special master in the case. CNN legal analyst Elie Honig said that the request appeared on its face to be fair under the circumstances.\n\n“I think Donald Trump has a fairly good chance of prevailing,” Honig said on “The Lead with Jake Tapper” on Monday. “It’s a reasonable request. It’s actually not unprecedented.”\n\nIf material is discovered that is subject to attorney-client privilege or executive privilege, the special master could ensure that it is not passed on to prosecutors.\n\nStill, the move could also be seen as a way to delay the case against Trump, and to push it further into campaign season – ahead of November’s midterm elections and the already stirring 2024 presidential race – and make it easier for the former President to cement the impression that he is being targeted for political reasons. On the other hand, the government has already had the documents for two weeks and the ex-President’s legal team has not previously made such a request.\n\nParts of the motion filed by Trump’s team on Monday bore all the hallmarks of a document either prepared for, or with, the ex-President’s predilections in mind. It was far more lively than a typically dry legal motion. It seemed at times an attempt to troll the legal system and even adopted a boastful tone in describing Mar-a-Lago, lauding it as a “historic landmark” with 58 bedrooms, 33 bathrooms, on 17 acres and bearing a name that means “sea to lake.”\n\nThe filing opened with a statement that “politics cannot be allowed to impact the administration of justice” – a claim that came with considerable chutzpah since Trump was often accused in office of politicizing the Department of Justice.\n\nIt went on to state that “President Donald J. Trump is the clear frontrunner in the 2024 Republican Presidential primary and in the 2024 General Election should he decide to run. Beyond that his endorsement in the 2022 mid-term primary elections has been decisive for Republican candidates.”\n\nTrump’s team then put his complaints about the search, previously delivered on social media, into a formal legal framework with the words: “Law enforcement is a shield that protects Americans. It cannot be used as a weapon for political purposes.”\n\nThere is a clear implication in the document that Trump, as a former president or as a potential 2024 presidential candidate, should not have been subjected to such a search. If this standard were adopted, it would offer potential impunity to anyone involved in politics. The Trump team’s implicit argument is also consistent with the belief, which he showed throughout his presidency, that he had special status that made him immune from the widely understood constraints of the law.\n\nTrump leverages legal case to seek political opportunity\n\nIn legal terms, the search of his residence could be disastrous for the former President if it emerges that he broke laws, especially on the handling of the most sensitive national security material. It is not possible to know from the limited material available publicly how any case against him might turn out. But Trump has left little doubt that he sees the search as a massive political opportunity. And he’s leveraged the moment to effectively force potential GOP presidential primary rivals to step in behind him and condemn it.\n\nAs Trump has throughout his time in politics, the legal filing from his team appeared to take considerable liberties with the facts of the FBI search and the process that led up to it. It blamed the bureau’s “shockingly aggressive move” that it said came with “with no understanding of the distress that it would cause most Americans.” That half-line is characteristic Trumpian exaggeration.\n\nThe document goes on to argue that the ex-President offered extraordinary and cordial cooperation with the National Archives and the FBI. But it also overlooks the fact that the search went ahead on the basis of a warrant approved by judge on the grounds that a probable crime had been committed.\n\nThe arguments in the filing also seem to conflict with other publicly known aspects about the government’s approach – including requests by the National Archives for the return of documents, the DOJ’s involvement, a subpoena that was served on Trump for the material and the fact that agents still did not get what they wanted when they visited the former President at the property before they sought a search warrant. Not to mention that, according to CNN and New York Times reports, a lawyer for Trump told investigators in writing that no classified records were left at Mar-a-Lago after June. The FBI said in an inventory list at the end of its search that there were additional classified documents retrieved.\n\nThe motion also contains yet another classic Trump flourish.\n\nIt reveals that on August 11, 2022, counsel for Trump spoke with one of the lead officials in the case, Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterintelligence section in the DOJ’s national security division. The message was intended for Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\n“President Trump wants the Attorney General to know that he has been hearing from people all over the country about the raid. If there was one word to describe their mood — it is ‘angry.’ The heat is building up. The pressure is building up. Whatever I can do to take the heat down, to bring the pressure down, just let us know.”\n\nThis statement is remarkable since it was Trump who announced the search of his resort. And he used his social media network to initiate a backlash among his followers and to deliver a political dividend.\n\nThe message comes across as an implicit threat – about the consequences of investigating the former President – that is chilling in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection. The approach also recalls previous Trump efforts to contact, and possibly influence, authorities who are investigating him. His attempt to co-opt former FBI Director James Comey during the Russia investigation, whom he later fired, comes to mind.\n\nTrump’s new lawsuit could succeed in advancing some of his legal goals – such as they are. But it’s a reminder of the legal and political ordeal that the country faces with an investigation into a combative and angry former president who is also showing every sign of weaponizing it to bolster his 2024 election bid.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/weather/buffalo-winter-storm-new-york-blizzard-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Winter storm in Buffalo: Crews work to clear snow-covered roads ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe winter storm death toll has risen to 37 in Erie County, New York, as crews continue to clear roads and first responders check on people they couldn’t reach days ago when the catastrophic weather system swept the nation, officials there said Wednesday.\n\nAt least 25 others across 11 US states also have been reported dead in the storm, which buried the city of Buffalo in nearly 52 inches of snow, trapping residents in western New York at home – many without heat as the Christmas weekend blizzard took out power lines.\n\n“It’s a horrible storm with too many deaths,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said at a news conference as he praised first responders, without whom “more people would have died.”\n\nNow, authorities are going door-to-door to conduct wellness checks, Poloncarz said: An EMS task force is checking locations of emergency calls that authorities could not reach during the storm, while the National Guard will spend the next couple days checking every house in neighborhoods that lost power.\n\n“We are fearful that there are individuals who may have perished living alone or people who were not doing well in an establishment, especially those that still don’t have power,” Poloncarz said.\n\nBuffalo police completed sifting through 911 calls going back to the early days of the storm, Commissioner Joseph A. Gramaglia said Wednesday. He told CNN’s Pamela Brown that it was a “tremendous” effort that also resulted in the recovery of a “substantial” number of bodies. The task included requests for welfare checks.\n\nGramaglia said he expects rising temperatures in the coming days will melt the snow and uncover more storm victims.\n\nAmid the frigid, whiteout conditions, “people … got stranded in their vehicles and passed away in their cars. We have people that were walking during blizzard conditions and passed away on the street, passed away in snowbanks,” Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said. “And we have people that were found that passed away in their homes.”\n\nNational Guard members check on Buffalo residents on Wednesday, December 28, 2022.

In one of those cases, emergency responders could not get to the person because of the snow, he told CNN a day earlier.\n\n“They were blocked, and by the time they got there it was too late,” Poloncarz said.\n\nOne Buffalo EMT told CNN she was stuck in her ambulance for hours Friday after trying to respond to an emergency call during the snowstorm.\n\n“The main reason we were getting stuck is because there were cars in the way,” said Joycelyn Benton, an advanced EMT at American Medical Response of Western New York.

Two-thirds of the equipment dispatched to help clear winter snow during the height of the storm also got stuck, he said.\n\nPoloncarz was asked Wednesday about the timing of the driving ban, which went into effect Friday at 9:30 a.m. as the storm hit, and whether there had been discussion among officials about issuing such a ban earlier.\n\nOfficials started discussing a potential ban last Thursday, Poloncarz said, but they initially believed the snow band wouldn’t reach the Erie County until 10 a.m. the next morning. They opted to wait, in part, because officials wanted workers to be able to get home before temperatures dropped below freezing, he said.\n\nOn Friday morning, temperatures “dropped dramatically,” going from rain to sleet to snow within five minutes around 8:40 a.m., he said. Whiteout conditions didn’t occur until about 10 a.m., he noted, after the ban was issued.\n\n“But we have to take a lot into consideration,” Poloncarz said. “If anyone is to be blamed, you can blame me. I’m the one who has to make the final call on behalf of the county.”\n\nCity faces criticism over cleanup; mayor says city working hard\n\nPoloncarz, the county executive, on Wednesday criticized how Buffalo’s mayor has handled storm cleanup efforts, saying Brown has not been on daily coordination calls with other municipalities and that the city has been slow to reopen.\n\n“I am a city resident myself, I live in the city of Buffalo, and it pains me to see the other 25 towns and two small cities opened in times when the city isn’t,” Poloncarz said, adding that the county should take over cleanup efforts so the city can fully reopen.\n\nWhen asked about those remarks, the mayor dismissed the criticism, telling CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday evening, “I’m not concerned about those comments, my concern is for the residents of the city of Buffalo.”\n\n“I’ve just completed hours of touring neighborhoods throughout the city, watching the plowing operations,” Brown said, adding there were agencies from the city, county and state working in recovery efforts who have been doing a “great job working together, working around the clock.”\n\n“We believe that by tonight, we’ll have 100% of streets opened up in the city of Buffalo and it’s my hope to be able to lift the … driving ban before the start of business tomorrow,” Brown added.\n\nOther local leaders have urged a review of how the storm was handled.\n\nA person clears snow along a Buffalo road on Wednesday, December 28. Jeffrey T. Barnes/AP\n\nDozens of people rescued by National Guard\n\nThere were 580 New York National Guard soldiers and airmen on the ground Wednesday in the Buffalo area, according to the force’s public affairs office.\n\nThey have two separate missions: Teams of four soldiers go door-to-door to see if residents have power, heat and food – and distributing ready-to-eat meals, or MREs, and water as needed; and teams of two soldiers and two medical providers conduct wellness checks, spokesperson Eric Durr told CNN.\n\nAs of Tuesday, they had rescued at least 86 people “from hazardous situations,” according to a news release, including a woman taken to a hospital just before giving birth.\n\nSeparately, a member of the 105th Military Police Company “learned from his mother that a pregnant woman he was close to had gone into labor,” the release said.\n\n“He went to her home,” it said, “helped deliver the baby, then reported for duty.”\n\nPreparations for flooding\n\nMeantime, Buffalo faces a small risk of flooding as rising temperatures begin to melt the massive amount of snow and 2 inches of rain is forecast through the weekend, the National Weather Service said.\n\nBut “it should take around an inch of rain from this system before flooding becomes a concern,” the weather service said.\n\nIn a news release on Wednesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced she directed state agencies to help support the affected communities with flood response resources.\n\nResources including generators, pumps and more than 700,000 sandbags were available for deployment from state stockpiles in Erie and Monroe counties, the release said.\n\nNationwide death toll rises\n\nIn Erie County, 29 who died were in the city of Buffalo, while seven were located in the suburbs, Poloncarz said Wednesday, adding he did not know where one person was found. Multiple bodies remain unidentified, Poloncarz added.\n\nHe has asked that anyone with a missing family member to call local police to help with the ID process.\n\nAmong the storm’s victims is Anndel Taylor, 22, whose family said she was found dead in Buffalo over the holiday weekend after getting trapped in her car by the blizzard.\n\nAfter losing contact with her, the family posted her location to a private Facebook page related to the storm to ask for help, and a man called to say he had found her without a pulse, her sister said.\n\nThe winter storm’s grim effects have been widespread, with at least 62 storm-related deaths reported across several states:\n\n• New York: In addition to the 37 deaths in Erie County, one fatal carbon monoxide poisoning was reported in Niagara County. The preliminary investigation indicates snow “covered the external furnace causing carbon monoxide to enter the residence,” the Niagara County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release Wednesday, identifying the victim as 27-year-old Timothy M. Murphy of Lockport.\n\n• Colorado: Police in Colorado Springs reported two deaths related to the cold since Thursday, with one man found near a building’s power transformer, possibly seeking warmth, and another in a camp in an alleyway.\n\n• Kansas: Three people died in weather-related traffic accidents, the Highway Patrol said Friday.\n\n• Kentucky: Three people died, officials have said, including one involved in a vehicle crash in Montgomery County.\n\n• Missouri: One person died after a van slid off an icy road and into a frozen creek, Kansas City police said.\n\n• New Hampshire: A hiker was found dead in Franconia on Christmas morning, said Lt. James Kneeland, a spokesperson for the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department.\n\n• Ohio: Nine people died as a result of weather-related auto crashes, including four in a Saturday morning crash on Interstate 75 when a tractor-trailer crossed the median and collided with an SUV and a pickup, authorities said.\n\n• South Carolina: Two men – including a 91-year-old who went outside on Christmas Day to fix a broken water pipe – died due to the storm in Anderson County, the coroner’s office there said. The other victim died on Christmas Eve after his home lost power.\n\n• Tennessee: The Department of Health on Friday confirmed one storm-related fatality.\n\n• Vermont: One woman in Castleton died after a tree fell on her home, according to the police chief.\n\n• Wisconsin: The State Patrol on Thursday reported one fatal crash due to winter weather.", "authors": ["Dakin Andone Nouran Salahieh Christina Maxouris", "Dakin Andone", "Nouran Salahieh", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/12/us/kremlin-kids-in-the-west-invs/index.html", "title": "Kremlin-connected children grew up in the very countries whose ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTheirs is a world of private jets, posh Parisian apartments, Austrian ski vacations and schooling at elite universities in London and New York.\n\nTheir parents own prime real estate on the most exclusive avenues of Europe’s capitals.

Or where they have their chateaus?”\n\nPutin himself blasted Russians who may “mentally” align with the West in a speech last month, accusing them of thinking they are part of a “higher race” and working with the “collective West” toward one goal: “the destruction of Russia.”\n\n“The Russian people will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and simply spit them out like a gnat that accidentally flew into their mouths,” Putin said.\n\nThe US recently sanctioned Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, his wife and two adult children, saying they live \"luxurious lifestyles that are incogruous with Peskov's civil service salary.\" Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP\n\nOne of the first families of alleged Russian corruption and hypocrisy is that of Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin’s deputy chief of staff and chief spokesman – a role that makes him Putin’s loudest megaphone, one who on a near daily basis dispenses the Russian President’s hardline vitriol against the West.\n\nThe United States recently sanctioned Peskov, his wife and two adult children (from two previous marriages), stating that the family lives “luxurious lifestyles that are incongruous with Peskov’s civil servant salary and are likely built on the ill-gotten wealth of Peskov’s connections to Putin.” At least two of his children were largely raised in Western Europe before returning to Moscow as adults.\n\nWhile the US Treasury didn’t spell out the questionable excesses, Peskov – who’s held his role for nearly a decade and reportedly made $173,000 in 2020 – has been seen wearing a $600,000 designer watch and went on a honeymoon that included a roughly $430,000-a-week yacht off the coast of Sardinia, according to an investigation by the Anti-Corruption Foundation founded by jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\nBased on property records, social media posts and traffic violation databases, the Anti-Corruption Foundation also revealed Peskov’s wife, ex-wife and children own luxury vehicles and multimillion-dollar homes all over the world – including Russia and France – a display of riches in stark contrast with the nearly 20 million Russians living in poverty.\n\nThe staggering, yet seemingly inexplicable, wealth of such families in Putin’s world, experts say, boils down to a single concept: kleptocracy.\n\n“A kleptocracy is merely a government that is ruled by thieves,” said Georgetown University professor Jodi Vittori, an expert on corruption and global policy, “where the policies and decisions made are on behalf of those thieves.”\n\nA complicated web of shell companies, offshore banks and hidden transactions often obscures their wealth, with accounts spirited away inside one another, making it complicated to trace where funds are coming from.\n\nThe wealth accumulated by Russian kleptocrats is frequently spent in Western economies.\n\n“They want to live in the West because the richest countries in the world are in the West. The amazing centers of culture are in the West,” said Treisman. “But in addition, Western countries have a much more secure rule of law than Russia. So, if they’re able to get a lot of their money into the West, they can feel more secure.”\n\nThe hypocrisy of Russian officials and their families enjoying the largesse of the West has been an open secret in Russia for years. In 2016, a bill was introduced to the State Duma banning the education of minor children of most of Russia’s officials in foreign universities, claiming domestic education would be key to becoming true patriots. The bill didn’t pass.\n\nPeskov’s 24-year-old daughter from his second marriage, Elizaveta Peskova – whose racy social media posts have often become the fodder of Russian and European tabloids – hasn’t shied away from limelight or controversy, like when she reportedly told a Russian TV outlet that she feels “better in the European environment” and called Russia’s education system a “true hell.”\n\nMore recently, she contradicted her father’s public statements by posting “no to war” to her Instagram stories, the slogan used by Russians opposing the war in Ukraine. The post was screenshotted and shared by the Russian outlet TV Rain, but was taken down quickly.\n\nAs a young child, Peskova reportedly attended the Ecole des Roches outside Paris – where the annual tuition is about a fourth of her father’s salary and extracurricular activities include aviation classes.\n\nPeskova continued her Parisian education with an internship at Louis Vuitton and a marketing degree from a French business school. She even interned for the European Parliament.\n\nPeskov's 24-year-old daughter, Elizaveta Peskova, grew up in Paris where she owns a multimillion-dollar apartment with her mother in one of the city's most expensive neighborhoods. Peskova, seen here at Paris' Tuileries Gardens in an Instagram post from 2019, describes her love for French cinema. from Instagram\n\nAccording to the Anti-Corruption Foundation, Peskova and her mother bought a nearly $2 million, 180-square-meter apartment in 2016 in one of Paris’ most expensive neighborhoods, on Avenue Victor Hugo, squeezed between the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe and the lush Bois de Boulogne. CNN has not confirmed the purchase.\n\nPeskova’s extravagance in France is paralleled by her half brother’s in Russia. A 2017 investigation by Navalny’s anti-corruption group found Nikolay Choles – Peskov’s eldest son who grew up in England – traveled the world in private jets, owned prime real estate in Moscow and raced his fleet of luxury vehicles through the city racking up as many as 116 traffic violations, while reportedly unemployed.\n\n“It certainly represents a high level of at least cynicism, if not outright hypocrisy,” said Vittori, the Georgetown professor.\n\nPeskova called the sanctions and the notion she is somehow enabling war “totally unfair and unfounded” and told Business Insider she’s “upset” because the restrictions keep her from traveling. In a statement on Telegram, Peskova wrote she is “proud” to be Russian and that sanctioning adult children and “especially a girl” is “crazy.” “There is hardly a fair trial,” she added, “during such a witch hunt and frenzied hatred of everything Russian.”\n\nPeskova – who, when reached by CNN, did not engage on the details of this story by the time of publication – isn’t the only Kremlin-connected child enjoying continental high society.\n\nForeign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who called for a \"post-West\" world order in 2017, sent his daughter to prestigious universities in London and New York.

In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, scientists mapped the glacier’s historical retreat, hoping to learn from its past what the glacier will likely do in the future.\n\nThey found that at some point in the past two centuries, the base of the glacier dislodged from the seabed and retreated at a rate of 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) per year. That’s twice the rate that scientists have observed in the past decade or so.\n\nThat swift disintegration possibly occurred “as recently as the mid-20th century,” Alastair Graham, the study’s lead author and a marine geophysicist at the University of South Florida, said in a news release.\n\nThe floating ice edge at Thwaites Glacier margin in 2019.

Alexandra Mazur/University of Gothenburg\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier, located in West Antarctica, is one of the widest on Earth and is larger than the state of Florida. But it’s just a faction of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which holds enough ice to raise sea level by up to 16 feet, according to NASA.\n\nAs the climate crisis has accelerated, this region has been closely monitored because of its rapid melting and its capacity for widespread coastal destruction.\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier itself has concerned scientists for decades. As early as 1973, researchers questioned whether it was at high risk of collapse. Nearly a decade later, they found that – because the glacier is grounded to a seabed, rather than to dry land – warm ocean currents could melt the glacier from underneath, causing it to destabilize from below.\n\nIt was because of that research that scientists began calling the region around the Thwaites the “weak underbelly of the West Antarctic ice sheet.”\n\nA workboat recovering the Rán autonomous vehicle in one of the fjords of the Antarctic Peninsula during the expedition to Thwaites Glacier in 2019. Alexandra Mazur/University of Gothenburg\n\nIn the 21st century, researchers began documenting the Thwaites’ rapid retreat in an alarming series of studies.\n\nIn 2001, satellite data showed the grounding line was receding by around 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) per year. In 2020, scientists found evidence that warm water was indeed flowing across the base of the glacier, melting it from underneath.\n\nAnd then in 2021, a study showed the Thwaites Ice Shelf, which helps to stabilize the glacier and hold the ice back from flowing freely into the ocean, could shatter within five years.\n\n“From the satellite data, we’re seeing these big fractures spreading across the ice shelf surface, essentially weakening the fabric of the ice; kind of a bit like a windscreen crack,” Peter Davis, an oceanographer with the British Antarctic Survey, told CNN in 2021. “It’s slowly spreading across the ice shelf and eventually it’s going to fracture into lots of different pieces.”\n\nMonday’s findings, which suggest the Thwaites is capable of receding at a much faster pace than recently thought, were documented on a 20-hour mission in extreme conditions that mapped an underwater area the size of Houston, according to a news release.\n\nSee Bill Nye's warning about 'doomsday' glacier 02:30 - Source: CNN\n\nGraham said that this research “was truly a once in a lifetime mission,” but that the team hopes to return soon to gather samples from the seabed so they can determine when the previous rapid retreats occurred. That could help scientists predict future changes to the “doomsday glacier,” which scientists had previously assumed would be slow to undergo change – something Graham said this study disproves.\n\n“Just a small kick to the Thwaites could lead to a big response,” Graham said.", "authors": ["Angela Fritz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/business/jeff-bezos-charity/index.html", "title": "Jeff Bezos for the first time says he will give most of his money to ...", "text": "Washington CNN Business —\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos plans to give away the majority of his $124 billion net worth during his lifetime, telling CNN in an exclusive interview he will devote the bulk of his wealth to fighting climate change and supporting people who can unify humanity in the face of deep social and political divisions.\n\nThough Bezos’ vow was light on specifics, this marks the first time he has announced that he plans to give away most of his money. Critics have chided Bezos for not signing the Giving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\nExclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now 01:50 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”\n\nAsked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”\n\nBezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.\n\nThe 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and a possible economic recession to Sánchez’s plan to visit outer space with an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nThat working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a $100 million grant to Parton as part of her Courage and Civility Award. It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate and CNN contributor Van Jones.\n\n“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right? She is just beaming with light. And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds. And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”\n\nThe throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.\n\n“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.\n\nUnity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.\n\nHow to give it away\n\nBut the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune. Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.\n\nDespite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.\n\nBezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs. Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.\n\nThough Bezos is now Amazon’s (AMZN) executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company. Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s (AMZN) footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom. Amazon’s (AMZN) reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.\n\nBezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.\n\n“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”\n\n“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added. “So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”\n\nBezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently gave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizations in the span of less than a year.\n\nThe economic downturn\n\nWhile Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.\n\nLast month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”\n\nThe advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.\n\n“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Keep some dry powder on hand…. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”\n\nMany may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.\n\nBezos and Sánchez’s partnership\n\nSánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said. Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”\n\nSánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot. She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.\n\nBezos has credited his own journey to space for helping to inspire his push to fight climate change. Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.\n\nSánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023. And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”\n\nWashington’s NFL team\n\nBezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume. CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potential joint bid on the Washington Commanders.\n\nIt is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.\n\nBut during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.\n\n“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.\n\nSánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football. I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”\n\nBezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”\n\n– CNN’s Chloe Melas contributed to this report", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/health/updated-boosters-omicron-imprint/index.html", "title": "Updated Covid-19 boosters offer protection, but new studies suggest ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe updated Covid-19 booster shots appear to work about as well against the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants as the original boosters they replaced, according to two new studies from research teams at Harvard and Columbia universities.\n\nThe research suggests that our bodies have been well-trained to fight the original virus, which emerged from Wuhan, China, and that boosters mostly reinforce that response. Getting boosted this fall is still an important way to renew protection, even among people who were previously infected or vaccinated.\n\nBut the hope was that by tweaking the vaccine recipe to include currently circulating strains of the Omicron variant, it would help broaden immunity against those variants and perhaps offer better and longer-lasting protection.\n\nWhen the researchers compared the immune responses of people who got a booster dose of the original shot to people who got the updated bivalent boosters, they looked about the same.\n\n“We see essentially no difference” between the old boosters and the new about a month after the shot, said Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia, whose team authored one of the studies.\n\nImmunologists say a vaccine against two strains may not be better than a single strain shot because of a phenomenon called immune imprinting. Scientists say imprinting may complicate efforts to stay ahead of new variants as the coronavirus continues to evolve, and it adds urgency to the development of new vaccine technologies to fight the virus.\n\nWhen the US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorizations for new bivalent Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna at the end of August, it did so on the basis of studies in mice and previous human trials with a different two-strain booster formulation. Little was known about the how protective the shots might be in people; full data from clinical trials testing the BA.4 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines in humans hasn’t yet been made public.\n\nBut modeling data suggested that getting the boosters out in September could save tens of thousands of lives if the country had another winter surge, so the FDA authorized the shots, ahead of results from clinical trials, in order to get them to the public more quickly.\n\nThe updated shots contain instructions that show cells how to make spike proteins from the original virus that caused Covid-19, as well as spikes from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. These spikes get assembled by our cells and displayed to our immune system so it can make antibodies to fight the real thing during an active infection.\n\nThe original strain of the virus, sometimes called the ancestral or wild-type strain, is no longer circulating, however. When we boost, we are mostly boosting antibodies against a virus that’s long gone.\n\nAs the virus has evolved, the vaccines have not kept pace. Each new variant has become more and more resistant to the antibodies we make against it, increasing the risk of breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nRight now, protection against infection begins to wane just a few months after each booster dose. Protection against severe outcomes – hospitalization or death from Covid-19 – lasts longer, but can also fade, especially for vulnerable groups such as people who are over 65, who have weakened immune systems or who have underlying medical conditions.\n\nSimilar immune responses\n\nThe studies have important limitations, and they aren’t the final word on the updated boosters.\n\nBoth studies were small. Ho’s study looked at the immune responses of 19 people who were boosted with a fourth dose of the original recipe vaccine and 21 people who got a fourth dose of the updated boosters. The other study, from Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor at Harvard and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, looked at 15 people who got the original booster and 18 people who got bivalent shots.\n\nBoth reports were posted as preprints, before scrutiny by independent experts.\n\nThe studies also measured immune responses over a short period of time – about three to five weeks after the fourth doses. Ho says these results could change with time, as immune cells mature.\n\n“We can’t say that a few months from now, there won’t be any difference,” he said. “We won’t know that until these individuals are followed for a longer period of time.”\n\nDespite these caveats, experts who were not involved in the research say that two studies from well-regarded labs arriving at roughly the same conclusions about the vaccines gives them confidence that the results are correct.\n\n“At least at this time point, there’s no discernible benefit” over the older boosters, Ho said.\n\nClinical trials being conducted by vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna involve hundreds of people who have had the updated boosters and are being followed for longer periods of time. Data from those studies are still coming.\n\nBoth companies declined to comment on Ho and Barouch’s studies, citing company policies not to weigh in on research they have not been involved in.\n\nIn comparing the immune responses of people who got the old boosters with those who got the newer ones, the researchers found that neutralizing antibodies spiked after both shots to about the same high levels, which was good news.\n\nIn Barouch’s study, antibody concentrations were 15 times higher after the original boosters, rising from 184 to 2,829. They were 17 times higher after the updated shots, jumping from 211 to 3,693. The difference in antibody levels between shots didn’t pass a statistical test, however, so the results may have been due to chance.\n\nMore importantly, that slight difference in antibody levels probably wouldn’t protect people any better in the real world.\n\n“We would not expect this to be clinically significant,” said Barouch, who worked on the development of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nBut the bulk of the antibodies generated after either shot were ones that would bind the original virus, with fewer directed specifically against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\nBarouch’s team also looked specifically at T cells, which help the body hold the memory of germs it has been exposed to. These cells are thought to play a key role in how long immune protection lasts. Antibody levels naturally drop off over time, but T cells stick around.\n\nThe numbers of T cells didn’t budge much after either vaccine.\n\n“Unfortunately, neither one increased T-cell responses very much, and we believe that T-cell responses in addition to antibody responses are important for protection against severe disease,” Barouch said.\n\n‘A booster is a booster’\n\nDr. Eric Topol, who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the study results “can be considered a disappointment,” especially because the US government raced to make them available and because there had been high hopes for an improved vaccine in time for a predicted winter Covid-19 surge.\n\nTopol also said it would be a mistake to skip these shots. They still work; they just may not be much of an improvement over the older ones.\n\n“A booster is a booster until proven otherwise and we are in great need of getting more of them in the US,” Topol, who was not involved in the new studies, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nFewer than 20 million people – less than 10% of the population ages 5 and up – have gotten the updated booster, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAfter waiting the recommended three months since his last Covid-19 infection, President Joe Biden got an updated booster Tuesday and urged eligible Americans to do the same.\n\n“Your old vaccine or your previous Covid infection will not give you maximum protection,” Biden said.\n\nPublic health officials had hoped that the rollout of the updated boosters would mark a turning point, where Americans might be able to get annual Covid-19 shots instead of boosters every few months.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, recently told Stat that he wasn’t sure whether the country had reached that point.\n\n“I would be lying to you if [I said] it doesn’t keep me up at night worrying that there is a certain chance that we may have to deploy another booster – at least for a portion of the population, perhaps older individuals – before next September, October,” he said.\n\n“I’m not saying that’s what’s going to happen, but it’s what keeps me up at night, because we see how fast this virus is evolving.”\n\nImprinting may complicate quest for better immunity\n\nThe studies probably didn’t find any difference between the new and old boosters because of immune imprinting, says Michael Worobey, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies the evolution of viruses and the origins and control of pandemics.\n\n“Your body is on a hair trigger to create more antibodies of what it has a good memory of,” said Worobey, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, our immune systems were blank slates when it came to the coronavirus. By now, most of us have been exposed to one version of the virus or another through the vaccine, an infection or both. That exposure programs cells called B cells to make specific kinds of antibodies, and more B cells get this programming during their first exposure to the virus than they do in subsequent brushes with it.\n\nThat’s the reason some strains of the flu may hit certain age groups harder than others, too. When viruses look more similar to the first infection or vaccine you had, your body tends to do a better job fighting them off.\n\nWorobey said that both new studies have limitations, “but I think when you put them together, they paint a pretty clear picture that that antigenic imprinting is causing issues here, for sure.”\n\nIt’s possible to break through immune imprinting, he said. Certain kinds of vaccine ingredients, or adjuvants – “things that just happen to really wake up the immune system” – can do it.\n\nBut it’s not easy to add the kind of adjuvants he’s thinking about to mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna’s. In this case, he says, judging by the study findings, it probably would have been better to update the vaccine by including only the components against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\n“For me, the take-home message is, if you want to boost and provide protection against Omicron, leave the original variant out of the vaccine.”\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, says the new studies bear out data that was presented to the FDA’s advisers in June.\n\nHe says it’s one of the reasons he voted against the FDA requiring companies to add an Omicron strain to the boosters used in the US.\n\n“Certainly, the hope that this would be significantly better in terms of protection against the circulating strains, I think, is unlikely to be realized,” said Offit, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWorobey says that when the strains are combined as they are in the updated boosters, they actually end up competing. The body’s response to the original strain is so strong, it will end up blocking the updated portion of the vaccine from stimulating those blank slate B cells against the newer variants and reshaping the immune response.\n\nThus, imprinting will complicate efforts to keep up with the virus, he says. We may need different kinds of vaccine technologies if the virus ever changes so much that it outcompetes our immunity altogether.\n\nThat’s something the FDA’s Marks has considered, too.\n\n“I would love to see us have a very ecumenical look over all of the available vaccines and all of the vaccines in development to try to see what’s best moving forward,” he told Stat. “Not to diss the current mRNA vaccines but because we owe it to the population to see what might provide the greatest breadth, depth and duration of immunity against Covid-19.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/health/step-dementia-risk-wellness/index.html", "title": "Walk this number of steps each day to cut your risk of dementia | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide up will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nWant to reduce your risk for dementia? Slap on a step counter and start tallying your steps – you’ll need between 3,800 and 9,800 each day to reduce your risk of mental decline, according to a new study.\n\nPeople between the ages of 40 and 79 who took 9,826 steps per day were 50% less likely to develop dementia within seven years, the study found. Furthermore, people who walked with “purpose” – at a pace over 40 steps a minute – were able to cut their risk of dementia by 57% with just 6,315 steps a day.\n\n“It is a brisk walking activity, like a power walk,” said study coauthor Borja del Pozo Cruz, an adjunct associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, Denmark, and senior researcher in health sciences for the University of Cadiz in Spain.\n\nEven people who walked approximately 3,800 steps a day at any speed cut their risk of dementia by 25%, the study found.\n\n“That would be enough, at first, for sedentary individuals,” said del Pozo Cruz in an email.\n\n“In fact, it is a message that doctors could use to motivate very sedentary older adults – 4k steps is very doable by many, even those that are less fit or do not feel very motivated,” he added. “Perhaps, more active and fitter individuals should aim for 10k, where we see maximum effects.”\n\nBut there was a even more interesting result buried in the study, according to an editorial entitled “Is 112 the New 10,000?” published Tuesday in JAMA Neurology.\n\nThe largest reduction in dementia risk – 62% – was achieved by people who walked at a very brisk pace of 112 steps per minute for 30 minutes a day, the study found. Prior research has labeled 100 steps a minute (2.7 miles per hour) as a “brisk” or moderate level of intensity.\n\nThe editorial argued that individuals looking to reduce their risk of dementia focus on their walking pace over their walked distance.\n\n“While 112 steps/min is a rather brisk cadence, ’112’ is conceivably a much more tractable and less intimidating number for most individuals than ‘10,000,’ especially if they have been physically inactive or underactive,” wrote Alzheimer’s researchers Ozioma Okonkwo and Elizabeth Planalp in the editorial. Okonkwo is an associate professor in the department of medicine at the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at the University of Wisconsin–Madison; Planalp is a research scientist in Okonkwo’s lab.\n\n“We do agree this is a very interesting finding,” said del Pozo Cruz via email. “Our take is that intensity of stepping matters! Over and above volume. Technology could be use to track not only number of steps but also pace and so these types of metrics can also be incorporated in commercial watches. More research is needed on this.”\n\nPeople who walked with \"purpose\" -- at a pace over 40 steps a minute -- were able to cut their risk of dementia by 57% with just 6,315 steps a day, a new study said.

You can count the number of steps you take in 10 seconds and then multiply it by six – or the number of steps you take in six seconds and multiply it by 10. Either way works. But remember, not everyone’s steps are the same length, nor are their fitness levels. What might be a brisk pace for a 40-year-old may not be sustainable for a 70-year-old.\n\nEditor’s Note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.\n\nInside the study\n\nThe study, also published Tuesday in JAMA Neurology, analyzed data from over 78,000 people between the ages of 40 and 79 who wore wrist accelerometers. Researchers counted each person’s total number of steps per day, and then placed them into two categories: Fewer than 40 steps per minute – which is more of an amble, like when you’re walking from room to room – and more than 40 steps per minute, or so-called “purposeful” walking. The researchers also analyzed peak performers – those who took the most steps within 30 minutes over the course of a day (although those 30 minutes did not have to occur on the same walk).\n\nResearchers then compared that person’s steps against their diagnosis of dementia of any type seven years later. After controlling for age, ethnicity, education, sex, socio-emotional status and how many days they wore an accelerometer, researchers also factored out such lifestyle variables as poor diet, smoking, alcohol use, medication use, sleep issues and a history of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe study did have some limitations, its authors point out – it was only observational, so it cannot establish a direct cause and effect between walking and a lower risk of dementia. In addition, “the age range of participants may have resulted in limited dementia cases, meaning our results may not be generalizable to older populations,” the study said.\n\n“Because there are often considerable delays in dementia diagnosis, and this study did not include formal clinical and cognitive assessments of dementia, it is possible that the prevalence of dementia in the community was much higher,” the authors added.\n\nWhile agreeing that the findings cannot be interpreted as a direct cause and effect, “the mounting evidence in support of the benefits of physical activity for maintaining optimal brain health can no longer be disregarded,” wrote Okonkwo and Planalp.\n\n“It is time for the management of physical inactivity to be considered an intrinsic part of routine primary care visits for older adults,” they added.\n\nResearch adds up\n\nIndeed, recent research published in July has found many leisure activities, such as household chores, exercise, adult education classes and visiting with family and friends, affected dementia risk in middle-aged people.\n\nAdults who were highly engaged in physical activity such as frequent exercise had a 35% lower risk of developing dementia compared with people who were the least engaged in these activities, researchers found.\n\nRegularly doing household chores lowered risk by 21% while daily visits with family and friends lowered the risk of dementia by 15%, when compared with people who were less engaged.\n\nEveryone in the study benefited from the protective effect of physical and mental activities, whether or not they had a family history of dementia, researchers found.\n\nAnother study published in January found that exercise may slow dementia in active older people whose brains already showed signs of plaques, tangles and other hallmarks of Alzheimer’s and other cognitive diseases.\n\nThat study found exercise boosts levels of a protein known to strengthen communication between brain cells via synapses, which may be a key factor in keeping dementia at bay.\n\n“Dementia is preventable to a great extent,” said del Pozo Cruz. “Physical activity as well as other lifestyle behaviors such lack of alcohol and smoking, maintaining a healthy diet and weight and sleep can put you on the right track to avoid dementia.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/12/politics/biden-trump-polling-2024-race-analysis/index.html", "title": "Americans may get the one presidential race the country doesn't ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThere’s one tiny sliver of hope for Joe Biden in a devastating new poll that flags rising concerns over the President’s age and performance and shows even most Democrats want another candidate in 2024. He could still beat Donald Trump.\n\nThis small consolation for the White House cannot disguise growing signs that Biden’s presidency is in deep trouble even before midterm elections in November, which threaten a devastating rebuke to his Democratic Party in the House. The New York Times/Siena College nationwide survey coincides with a flurry of unflattering stories about Biden’s age and political proficiency and growing speculation about his prospects for reelection. The question of whether any Democrats would dare challenge him in a primary is an increasingly hot topic despite dismissals by leading alternative potential candidates.\n\nAnd yet, Biden, saddled with an approval rating of just 33% in the survey, is still in the game against Trump. The survey showed no clear leader, with Biden earning 44% to Trump’s 41% among registered voters, within the poll’s margin of sampling error.\n\nThe poll also shows that Trump would not be the unanimous choice inside his own party. Nearly half of Republican primary voters preferred another candidate for the nomination. That’s especially the case for primary voters under 35 and those with at least a college degree, majorities of which indicated they’d oppose Trump, according to the Times. Of all the names tested, however, Trump remained the favorite for the GOP nod by a wide margin.\n\nA poll is just a snapshot in time, but it’s hardly encouraging news for the ex-President and suggests he has huge liabilities in the general electorate, despite expectations among his conservative media boosters that he would cruise to revenge over an elderly Biden in 2024.\n\nBut the closeness of the hypothetical Biden-Trump matchup also points to a more profound theme that is emerging as the US barrels toward 2024 and has implications beyond the identity of the person who sits in the Oval Office in 2025. A country mired in multiple crises, politically estranged within and facing risky international flashpoints may get a 2024 contest between two candidates whose answers haven’t worked over the previous eight years and whom millions of people would like to see retire from the stage to make room for younger, fresher faces.\n\nSuch a scenario would be an indictment of a party system that is already fused into dysfunction by hyper partisanship and Trump’s attack on the 2020 election. It would likely leave the victor in 2024 without a workable mandate at a time when Washington is failing to respond to the country’s longer-term needs. And it would further strain faith among voters about the political system.\n\nA defining feature of a 2024 campaign\n\nA country where the passing of a political torch has been a strident feature of presidential races for generations could be about to endure one last slugfest between 1940s babies trying to defy time.\n\nBut paradoxically, a President who most of his own party wants to retire and an ex-President who left office in deep disgrace, could be exceedingly difficult to dislodge. The prospect of a November 2024 contest between a man who would be just shy of 82 and a 78-year-old former insurrectionist-in-chief is very real.\n\nBiden is a proud man. He waited a lifetime to win the presidency, and resented being overlooked in favor of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for earlier Democratic nominations. His team is adamant he is running for reelection and he has the best talking point – he already beat Trump and deserves a chance to repeat it.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is itching to launch a revenge campaign, associates have told CNN, even before November’s midterms. He may want to leap in to freeze out potential GOP rivals, capitalize on Biden’s low approval ratings and portray any potential criminal referral from the House select committee investigating his coup attempt as a naked political ploy.\n\nAny attempt from inside the Democratic and Republican Parties to push either candidate out could backfire, and might require challengers to put their own political futures on the line to do so – diminishing the likelihood of truly contested primary races. The chances of either Biden or Trump giving up on a race for the good of their parties this far out seems slim, though events and health questions could still reshape the future of the two rivals.\n\nBiden’s diminished presidency\n\nBiden’s presidency has been in free-fall for nearly a year, since the messy and bloody US withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer and his overtaken vow last July Fourth that the coronavirus pandemic was all but over. Both undermined his self-assigned job description as America’s fixer.\n\nIt’s not just independent and cross-over Republicans who have lost in faith in Biden. His support in his own party is plummeting too, according to the Times poll, which shows more than 60% of Democrats preferring an alternative nominee in 2024. Those who want a change cite Biden’s age and job performance as the top two reasons why. This is a flashing warning sign for the President.\n\nIf Democrats do poorly in the midterms, where they are widely expected to lose the House but may cling to the Senate, the calls for a fresh face at the top of the ticket 2024 ticket will surely grow. CNN’s Edward-Isaac Dovere has spent recent days chronicling disquiet among Democrats about their President but he found a unified front from key party figures who warn an anti-Biden movement could let a Republican win in 2024. No one needs reminding how Sen. Edward Kennedy’s challenge in 1980 fatally weakened President Jimmy Carter – a one-term predecessor to whom Biden is increasingly compared – and heralded 12 years of Republicans in the Oval Office. But a cataclysmic midterm election will increase pressure on Biden exponentially.\n\nCNN report: This is why Democrats are frustrated with Biden 04:45 - Source: CNN\n\nWhile the White House dismisses questions about the next election as media speculation, chatter about Biden’s age and prospects is growing among Democratic voters and a wider swathe of Americans outside the presidential bubble. Given that Biden was the oldest ever President the second he was sworn in, the issue of his age was always going to come up. His political troubles have perhaps just advanced the conversation. Incidents like the one recently when Biden fell off his bike, which could happen to any President, get far more coverage given his age. And it’s undeniable that the President is not the sprightly, backslapping, quintessential politician of even his vice presidential years. He’s perceptibly aged in office. It’s his misfortune that despite regular workouts and a physician’s report that he’s fit to serve, he must endure incessant public scrutiny. But that does come with the job.\n\nThe White House must brace for constant questions about Biden’s future plans, Democratic strategist James Carville told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday. “It’s not going to go away. I suspect that they don’t much like this story, but they are going to have to deal with it,” said Carville, who masterminded Bill Clinton’s 1992 victory.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday insisted Biden was focused on the present not the future. “Polls are going to go up and they’re going to go down,” she said. “This is not the thing that we are solely focused on.”\n\nHow Biden could turn it around\n\nBiden’s problems among Democratic voters may reflect the divided nature of his party – and even his own success in 2020. His victory in the Democratic primary was forged as he ran as a statesmanlike voice for a quiet majority of moderates in a party with an increasingly youthful and progressive base.\n\nBut that electorally successful coalition has proven to be a governing liability in many cases. Despite early achievements like passing a big Covid-19 relief bill, cutting child poverty and signing a bipartisan infrastructure law, hopes for a Lyndon Johnson era of progressive reform have foundered to the frustration of House progressives furious that moderate senators like West Virginia’s Joe Manchin curtailed Biden’s agenda. An unlikely late push to enact some big wins, like social and climate spending, before the midterms could enthuse Democratic voters and improve Biden’s prospects. But there have been signs in recent weeks that raise fresh alarm – including the White House’s flat-footed initial response to the Supreme Court’s overturning of the constitutional right to an abortion, which followed a draft conservative majority opinion published by Politico weeks earlier.\n\nThe White House stumble over abortion also sparked questions about the dexterity of the Biden operation with a reelection campaign looming after the midterms. Running for president as President brings a whole new set of challenges unfamiliar from a first campaign. The commander-in-chief is torn between his duties in the United States and abroad and often exhausting cross-country campaigning. It’s hard for any president to keep up, let alone one who will be 81 during the election year. This is why some strategists still think that Biden will eventually look at his prospects for 2024 and decide against running again. It would be painfully ironic if he emulates Johnson, not with the scope of his domestic reform program but with a decision not to seek reelection after a full first term amidst cratering political prospects.\n\nYet Biden has one card to play with Democrats that could change everything. An early campaign launch by Trump would allow the President to yet again start drawing a sharper contrast with a potential alternative who is viewed with horror by almost all Democrats – and many more Americans.\n\nThe New York Times survey, for example, found that if the choice in 2024 was between Biden and Trump, 92% of Democrats would stick with the President.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/07/politics/democrats-nightmare-scenario-election-eve-analysis/index.html", "title": "Democrats confront their nightmare scenario on election eve as ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDemocrats close their midterm election campaign Monday facing the nightmare scenario they always feared – with Republicans staging a gleeful referendum on Joe Biden’s struggling presidency and failure to tame inflation.\n\nHopes that Democrats could use the Supreme Court’s overturning of the right to an abortion and a flurry of legislative wins to stave off the classic midterm election rout of a party in power are now a memory. Biden faces a dark political environment because of the 40-year-high in the cost of living – and his hopes of a swift rebound next year are clouded by growing fears of a recession.\n\nOn the eve of the election, Democrats risk losing control of the House of Representatives and Republicans are increasingly hopeful of a Senate majority that would leave Biden under siege as he begins his reelection bid and with ex-President Donald Trump apparently set to announce his own campaign for a White House return within days.\n\nIt’s too early for postmortems. Forty million Americans have already voted. And the uncertainty baked into modern polling means no one can be sure a red wave is coming. Democrats could still cling onto the Senate even if the House falls.\n\nBut the way each side is talking on election eve, and the swathe of blue territory – from New York to Washington state – that Democrats are defending offer a clear picture of GOP momentum.\n\nA nation split down the middle politically, which is united only by a sense of dissatisfaction with its trajectory, is getting into a habit of repeatedly using elections to punish the party with the most power.\n\nThat means Democrats are most exposed this time.\n\nIf the president’s party takes a drubbing, there will be much Democratic finger-pointing over Biden’s messaging strategy on inflation – a pernicious force that has punched holes in millions of family budgets.\n\nJust as in last year’s losing off-year gubernatorial race in Virginia, which the president won by 10 points in 2020, Democrats are closing the campaign warning about democracy and Trump’s influence while Republicans believe they are addressing the issue voters care about most.\n\n“Here’s where the Democrats are: they’re inflation deniers, they are crime deniers, they’re education deniers,” Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\nHilary Rosen, a longtime Democratic consultant, said on the same show that her party had misjudged the mood of the electorate.\n\n“I’m a loyal Democrat, but I am not happy. I just think that we are – we did not listen to voters in this election. And I think we’re going to have a bad night,” Rosen told CNN’s Dana Bash.\n\n“And this conversation is not going to have much impact on Tuesday, but I hope it has an impact going forward, because when voters tell you over and over and over again that they care mostly about the economy, listen to them. Stop talking about democracy being at stake.”\n\nRosen is not the only key figure on the left uneasy with the midterm strategy. Former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont, urged the White House to do more to stress economic concerns in recent weeks even while acknowledging the crisis of democracy and the importance of abortion rights. In retrospect, it appears Democrats were slow to recognize that a favorable period over the summer, spurred by falling gasoline prices and a hot streak for the president in passing legislation, wouldn’t last long enough to compensate for a ruinous political environment caused by the economy.\n\nBiden’s stark warnings about democracy\n\nIn effect, Biden’s stress on the threat to US political institutions posed by Trump essentially asks voters to prioritize the historic foundation of America’s political system over their own more immediate economic fears.\n\nBiden warns of 'path to chaos' ahead of midterms 02:19 - Source: CNN\n\n\n\nIt’s a message that resonates strongly in Washington, DC, where the scars of the US Capitol insurrection are keenly felt. And it is undeniably important because the survival of the world’s most important democracy is at stake. After all, Trump incited an insurrection that tried to thwart the unbroken tradition of peaceful transfers of power between presidents.\n\nBut outside the Beltway bubble of politicians and journalists, democracy feels like a far more distant, esoteric concept than the daily struggle to feed a family and to be able to afford to commute to work. From Pennsylvania to Arizona, the return to normality after the Covid-19 nightmare that Biden promised remains elusive to many as the economic after effects of the once-in-a century health emergency linger.\n\nThe impossibility of the political environment for Democrats was laid bare in a CNN/SSRS poll released last week. Some 51% of likely voters said the economy was the key issue in determining their vote. Only 15% named abortion – a finding that explains how the election battleground has tilted toward the GOP. Among voters for whom the economy is their top concern, 71% plan to vote Republican in their House district. And 75% of voters think the economy is already in a recession, meaning that Biden’s efforts to stress undeniably strong economic areas – including the strikingly low unemployment rate – are likely to fall on deaf ears.\n\nHow Biden spoke about the economy\n\nIt’s too simple to say that Biden has ignored the impact of inflation, or doesn’t understand the pain it’s bringing to the country.\n\nThe premise of his domestic presidency and his entire political career has been based on restoring the balance of the economy and restoring a measure of security to working and middle class Americans. His legislative successes could bring down the cost of health care for seniors and create a diversified green economy that shields Americans from future high energy prices amid global turmoil. But the benefits from such measures will take years to arrive. And millions of voters are hurting now and haven’t heard a viable plan from the president to quickly ease prices in the short-term.\n\nThere is no guarantee that plans by Republicans to extend Trump-era tax cuts and mandate new energy drilling would have much impact on the inflation crisis either. And divided government would likely mean a stalemate between two dueling economic visions. But the election has turned into a vehicle for voters to stress their frustration, with no imminent hope that things will get better soon.\n\nBiden has resorted to highlighting bright spots of the economy – claiming to have reignited manufacturing, high job creation and a robust effort to compete with China. He’s now warning that Republicans would gut Social Security and Medicare on which many Americans rely in retirement.\n\nAnd in practice, there is not much a president can do to quickly lower inflation on their own. The Federal Reserve is in the lead and the central bank’s strategy of rising interest rates could trigger a recession that could further haunt Biden’s presidency.\n\nInflation and high gas prices are also a global issue and have been worsened by factors beyond Biden’s control, including the war in Ukraine and supply chain issues brought on by the pandemic. At the same time, however, economists are debating the wisdom of Biden’s high-spending bills that sent billions of dollars into an overheating economy. And the White House’s repeated downplaying of the soaring cost of living as “transitory” badly misjudged the situation and was another thing that battered Biden’s credibility – on top of the confidence some voters lost in him during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan last year.\n\nThe Republican Party also got exactly what it wanted as Trump has delayed his expected campaign announcement until after the midterms, depriving Biden of the opportunity to shape this election as a direct clash with an insurrectionist predecessor whom he beat in 2020 and who remains broadly unpopular. Such a confrontation might have enabled the president to dampen the impact of his own low approval ratings and win over voters who still disdain the twice-impeached former president.\n\nIronically, Biden’s struggles in framing a believable economic message could bring about the very crisis of democracy that he is warning about.\n\nAny incoming GOP majority would be dominated by pro-Trump radicals. Prospective committee chairs have already signaled they will do their best to deflect from Trump’s culpability on the January 6, 2021, insurrection and go after the Justice Department as it presses on with several criminal investigations into the ex-President’s conduct. And Tuesday’s election could usher in scores of election deniers in state offices who could end up controlling the 2024 presidential election in some key battlegrounds. GOP dominance of state legislatures could further curtail voting rights.\n\nHigh inflation has also always been a toxic force that brews political extremism and tempts some voters to be drawn to demagogues and radicals whose political creed is based on stoking resentment and stigmatizing outsiders.\n\nIf Democrats do lose big on Tuesday night, Trump will be a beneficiary.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/22/2020-predictions-decades-ago-self-driving-cars-mars-voting/2594825001/", "title": "2020 predictions from decades ago: Self-driving cars, Mars, voting", "text": "Jetpacks, disintegrator rays, nuclear energy, Mars.\n\nDecades ago, academics, futurists and government agencies cast their predictions of what would happen by the year 2020. Would submarines reach historic depths? Who would lead nations, and which ones would be global superpowers? Would Planet Earth even exist as we knew it?\n\n\"I shall not be surprised if on my 92nd birthday I am able to go for a ride in an antigravity car,\" mathematician and scientist D.G. Brennan wrote in 1968.\n\nSome, like Brennan, were overly optimistic. Others were spot-on. Here's what happened, what didn't and what was just plain crazy.\n\n1. Life expectancy will rise past 100\n\nFuturist Ray Kurzweil predicted in 1999 that human life expectancy would rise to \"over one hundred\" by 2019.\n\n\"Computerized health monitors built into watches, jewelry, and clothing which diagnose both acute and chronic health conditions are widely used. In addition to diagnosis, these monitors provide a range of remedial recommendations and interventions,\" he wrote in \"The Age of Spiritual Machines.\"\n\nNope: While Kurzweil may have accurately predicted health-related gadgets (such as fitness watches, BioScarves and EKG apps for your smartphone), he jumped the gun on life expectancy.\n\nIn 2019, the average life expectancy of the global population was 72.6 years, according to the United Nations. That average is slightly higher in the USA, at 78.6 years in 2017, according to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThough life expectancy in many industrialized nations continues to inch up, it has been going in the opposite direction in America. The United Nation predicts the average global life expectancy to rise to 77.1 years by 2050.\n\nLife expectancy:What countries have the longest?\n\n2. Computers will be invisible\n\nKurzweil had several other prophecies for the year 2019, including invisible computers.\n\n\"Computers are now largely invisible. They are embedded everywhere – in walls, tables, chairs, desks, clothing jewelry and bodies. People routinely use three-dimensional displays built into their glasses or contact lenses. ... This display technology projects images directly into the human retina.\"\n\nKeyboards and cables would become rare, he said.\n\nIt's true: Computers are embedded everywhere these days. We have smart homes, smart tables, smart chairs, smart desks and more. Though we may not project images directly into our retinas, Google Glass comes pretty close.\n\n(Per Kurzweil's prediction, scientists are developing smart contact lenses capable of monitoring the physiological information of the eye and tear fluid that could provide \"real-time, noninvasive medical diagnostics.\" Several groups are testing smart lenses that would measure glucose levels in the tears of people with diabetes.)\n\n3. Books will be dead\n\n\"Paper books and documents are rarely used or accessed. Most twentieth-century paper documents of interest have been scanned and are available through the wireless network,\" Kurzweil predicted.\n\nWrong: Though the net revenue of the U.S. book publishing industry has decreased since 2014, the industry still sold 675 million print books and brought in nearly $26 billion in 2018, according to the Association of American Publishers' annual report.\n\n4. Your every move will be tracked\n\nKurzweil predicted that privacy would be a huge political and social issue and that \"each individual’s practically every move (will be) stored in a database somewhere.\"\n\nTrue, most say: Your TV watches you. Your smartphone follows you. Your web browser traces your digital trail. In an era when some populations worldwide live under 24/7 high-tech surveillance, most U.S. adults say they do not think it is possible to go through daily life without having data collected about them by companies or the government, according to a survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center.\n\nMore than 80% say the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits.\n\n5. World's population will reach 8 billion\n\nIn 1994, the International Food Policy Research Institute projected the world population would increase by 2.5 billion to reach 8 billion by 2020. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the continent of Africa would add 1.5 billion people, the institute predicted.\n\nClose, but no cigar: The world's population is 7.7 billion, according to a report in June from the United Nations. The report expects the population to grow by 2 billion in the next 30 years. Around 2027, India is projected to overtake China as the world’s most populous country, the report says.\n\n6. China will be the world's largest economy\n\nSpeaking of China... in a 1997 article titled \"The Long Boom,\" futurists Peter Schwartz and Peter Leyden said China would be on top.\n\n\"By 2020, the Chinese economy has grown to be the largest in the world. Though the U.S. economy is more technologically sophisticated, and its population more affluent, China and the United States are basically on a par,\" they said.\n\nClose: In 2019, China still trailed the United States as the world's second-largest economy, by nominal GDP. Recent reports predict that China and India will overtake the United States by 2030.\n\n7. We'll have self-driving cars\n\n\"Self driving cars are being experimented with in the late 1990s, with implementation on majors highways feasible during the first decade of the twenty-first century,\" Kurzweil wrote.\n\nKind of: Dozens of companies – including Tesla, Google spinoff Waymo and ride-sharing giants Uber and Lyft – are testing self-driving vehicles in select locations, such as Boston, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Columbus, Ohio.\n\nWidespread use of a truly autonomous vehicle is not yet here: Experts say it might still be decades before we see a car that can drive anywhere it pleases.\n\nSelf-driving shuttle:Why a Rhode Island police officer pulled it over\n\nIn April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company would have fully self-driving cars ready by the end of the year and a \"robotaxi\" version – one that could ferry passengers without anyone behind the wheel – ready for the streets next year. Tesla owners can \"summon\" their cars, which can drive themselves from parking spots to the curb, where the owner is standing.\n\nWhat about flying cars? Porsche and Boeing partnered to create \"premium urban air mobility vehicles,\" and Uber plans to launch a flying taxi service in 2023.\n\n(Planes are landing themselves.)\n\n8. It will be normal to retire at 70\n\nIn his 1994 book \"The World in 2020,\" British commentator and editor Hamish McRae foresaw retirement ages reaching 67 to 70.\n\n\"The main motive for this in Europe is cost to the state. Governments feel that if retirement ages are not raised, the burden of paying pensions will be so high that working people will not be prepared to pay the tax levels necessary to fund them,\" McRae wrote.\n\nNo: In the USA, the average retirement age in 2016 was 65 for men and 63 for women, according to the Center for Retirement Research. That number has stayed relatively steady for men over the past few decades but has increased for women. For full Social Security benefits, the age is slowly climbing and depends on the year that you were born.\n\nSome European countries set 67 as retirement age, the earliest age when citizens can start withdrawing pensions, and several plan to raise the age in the next few years, according to the Finnish Center for Pensions. For many Europeans, the topic is a matter of fierce debate.\n\n9. Americans will vote electronically from home\n\nAs the millennial generation comes of age, they'll be able to vote electronically from home, Schwartz and Leyden predicted – possibly as soon as the presidential election of 2008.\n\nNot yet: Amid fears of foreign interference in U.S. elections, lawmakers aren't about to let you vote in next year's presidential election on your iPhone. Proponents of online voting say it could improve turnout and prevent voter suppression at polling stations.\n\nStartups are developing solutions for online voting, such as the Voatz mobile voting platform, which has used biometric/facial recognition in at least four public election pilots in the USA. Last year, West Virginia began using Voatz for absentee voting for military personnel stationed overseas. In one Utah county, citizens with a disability were able to vote electronically on their smartphones in a 2019 municipal general election.\n\n10. China will be on a path to democracy\n\nSchwartz and Leyden predicted that, despite taking \"draconian measures\" to avoid an internal crisis in the first decade of the new century, China \"is generally acknowledged to be on a path toward more democratic politics – though not in the image of the West.\"\n\nNot really: China faces scrutiny over human rights abuses against pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong and against nearly 1 million Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim population, members of which have been arbitrarily detained and imprisoned in \"reeducation\" camps in China's Xinjiang region.\n\n11. We'll have 'personal companions'\n\nIn his 1999 book, \"Business @ the Speed of Thought,\" Bill Gates predicted personal devices that \"connect and sync all your devices in a smart way, whether they are at home or in the office, and allow them to exchange data.\"\n\n\"The device will check your email or notifications, and present the information that you need. When you go to the store, you can tell it what recipes you want to prepare, and it will generate a list of ingredients that you need to pick up. It will inform all the devices that you use of your purchases and schedule, allowing them to automatically adjust to what you're doing,\" Gates wrote.\n\nHey, Alexa: Add milk to my shopping list.\n\nThough Alexa isn't sorting through your emails (that we know of) and your smart thermostat isn't tracking your purchases, Gates isn't far off. Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa and an array of smart tech in the Internet of Things readily exchange data with your other devices and respond to commands.\n\n12. Cars will be able to go months without refueling\n\nSchwartz and Leyden predicted that by 2010, \"hydrogen would be processed in refinery-like plants and loaded onto cars that can go thousands of miles – and many months – before refueling.\"\n\nBy 2020, they said, almost all new cars would be hybrid vehicles, mostly using hydrogen power.\n\nWhat's the future of the auto industry? Hydrogen cars appear to give way to electric\n\nNot yet: Toyota and Honda lead the hydrogen-powered car market, but it's an uphill battle against competitors peddling battery-powered electric vehicles. In 2018, 2,300 hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles were sold in the USA – less than 1% of the number of electric cars sold, according to InsideEVs, which covers electric vehicle news.\n\nIn other green transportation news: Last year, European railway manufacturer Alstom launched the world’s first hydrogen fuel cell train, and next year, London is likely to roll out double-decker hydrogen-powered buses.\n\n13. Heart disease, depression will be world's top diseases\n\nIn 1996, the Harvard School of Public Health and the World Health Organization predicted that by 2020, the world's top two causes of the global burden of disease – a measurement of the number of healthy life years lost because of sickness, disability or early death – would be ischemic (coronary) heart disease and unipolar major (clinical) depression.\n\nAt the time, the leading causes were lower respiratory infections (such as pneumonia) and diarrheal diseases, the study said.\n\nClose: In 2017, the most recent year that the data set was published, the five leading causes of the global burden of disease were neonatal disorders, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, lower respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n14. Global surface temperature will increase\n\n(Climate predictions tend to have a longer range, but here's a snapshot of where 2020 stands.)\n\nA report in 1995 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted that the average global surface temperature could increase by about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.\n\nThe report predicted that sea level could increase by about 20 inches by the same year.\n\nOn track: With 80 years to go, both predictions appear possible. The global average temperature has risen a tad more than 1 degree Fahrenheit since the mid-90s, according to NOAA. Since 1992, the global sea level has risen a total of more than 3 inches, according to NOAA.\n\nMore:Were the predictions we made about climate change 20 years ago accurate? Here's a look\n\n15. Humans will set foot on Mars\n\nA report in 1996 by the Space Studies Board of the National Research Council said NASA would launch \"possible human exploratory missions to the moon and Mars within the next quarter century,\" predicting that humans would land on Mars by 2018.\n\nSchwartz and Leyden envisioned a similar scenario: \"In 2020, humans arrive on Mars. ... The four astronauts touch down and beam their images back to the 11 billion people sharing in the moment. The expedition is a joint effort supported by virtually all nations on the planet, the culmination of a decade and a half of intense focus on a common goal.\"\n\nNot quite: Though we haven't set foot on Mars, we've landed eight unmanned spacecraft on the planet's surface.\n\n16. Boris Johnson would lead Brexit\n\nIn 1997, British news organization The Independent forecast that in 2020, Boris Johnson would become a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, a decision-making body composed of the prime minister and a team of handpicked members of Parliament.\n\nAt the time, Johnson, 32, was an outspoken editor and columnist but had not held public office. \"Not shy in clashing with party lines, Boris would 'renegotiate EU membership so Britain stands to Europe as Canada, not Texas, stands to the USA,' \" the journalists wrote.\n\nPretty close: Have you heard of Brexit? Johnson became prime minister in July. He served in the Cabinet, starting in 2016 as foreign secretary under Theresa May. In December, Johnson led his Conservative Party to victory in a national election on the promise to \"get Brexit done.\"\n\n17. Antigravity belts will revolutionize warfare\n\nImagine a world where battles are fought a few feet above the ground, as soldiers hover in midair. In 1968, mathematician and scientist D.G. Brennan predicted that antigravity belts would \"revolutionize the tactics of land warfare,\" writing that \"even if the antigravity mechanism did not itself provide horizontal propulsion, relatively modest sources of thrust could easily be provided.\"\n\nHe suspected that by 2018, humans would have antigravity cars and jetpacks capable of operating for 30 minutes.\n\nNo: (Unless you're Luke Skywalker or Buzz Lightyear.)\n\n18. Nuclear will replace natural gas\n\nIn 1968, Stanford University professor Charles Scarlott predicted that nuclear breeder reactors would make up the majority of U.S. energy production by 2018 as natural gas faded.\n\n\"Energy from water power, solar radiation, the wind, tides, or earth heat will not figure large in the totals. Power from nuclear power plants should be available in large amounts at low cost,\" Scarlott wrote.\n\nWrong: In 2018, fossil fuels – petroleum, natural gas and coal – accounted for about 79% of total U.S. primary energy production in 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. About 12% was from renewable energy sources, and about 9% was from nuclear electric power.\n\nFor the electrical power sector, in particular, nuclear creates 19% of energy.\n\n19. Americans will work 26 hours a week\n\nIn 1968, physicist Herman Kahn and futurist Anthony J. Weiner said that by 2020, Americans would work 1,370 hours a year (or 26 hours a week), instead of the 1,940 hours (37 hours a week) that was average at the time.\n\nUnlikely: Though we work less than we did in 1968, the average American worked nearly 1,800 hours in 2018 (35 hours a week), according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\n20. Nationalism will wane\n\nIn 1968, Ithiel de Sola Pool, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, predicted that better communication, easier translation and greater understanding of the nature of human motivations would make it easier for people to connect across ethnic and national lines.\n\n\"By the year 2018 nationalism should be a waning force in the world,\" he wrote.\n\nThe opposite is true: Fueled by backlash against immigration, globalization and the political establishment, populist nationalism was a driving force behind Brexit, the election of Donald Trump and the rise of right-wing politicians in France, Austria, Italy, Hungary and Poland, among other countries, academics said.\n\n\"Everywhere one looks, in fact, one sees nationalism at work in today’s world,\" Stephen Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard University, wrote in Foreign Policy Magazine.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/politics/abortion-politics-analysis/index.html", "title": "Abortion rights: Supreme Court bombshell suggests a staggering ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA draft Supreme Court opinion suggesting the conservative majority may be about to outlaw the constitutional right to an abortion hit like a political lightning bolt Monday night.\n\nThe draft opinion, obtained and authenticated by Politico, heralds what would be a massive victory for the conservative movement decades in the making. It set off immediate condemnation and calls for action from leading liberal and medical groups and Democratic leaders, as well as protests outside the Supreme Court building.\n\nThe bombshell concerns a draft majority opinion, written by conservative Justice Samuel Alito, that slammed the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision enshrining the right to an abortion as wrongly decided. It was circulated in early February, according to Politico, but the final opinion isn’t expected to be published until late June. Votes and language can change before opinions are formally released.\n\nCNN has not independently confirmed the document’s authenticity. A Supreme Court spokesperson declined to comment to CNN.\n\nBut if the high court follows through on such a decision in the coming weeks, it would engineer a massive shift in American life and law – and provide a startling sign of just how fundamentally the conservative majority, solidified by former President Donald Trump, will change society in the decades to come. It would potentially cast into doubt all kinds of precedents and past court rulings that have been regarded as settled law for years.\n\nA staggering change in American life\n\nIf the final decision is issued along the lines of Alito’s draft, millions of American women could have a fundamental right, which many have known all of their lives, taken away. But millions of people who believe that life begins at conception would celebrate such a ruling.\n\nThere will be weeks of debate about the legal reasoning and implications behind Alito’s draft opinion.\n\nBut in practice, such a ruling would seem likely to send the issue back to the states. That might mean abortion would be quickly banned by state legislatures in Republican-run states but remain legal in Democratic-run states. Such a scenario would further drive a schism between two halves of the country, which has been exacerbated by increasingly polarized politics in recent years.\n\nThe emergence of the draft is also stunning in itself. It represents a major and likely unprecedented breach in court confidentiality that is almost certain to worsen the politicization of the court, which has been dragged deeper into partisanship since it decided the 2000 election in favor of George W. Bush over then-Vice President Al Gore and has only accelerated ever since.\n\nThe draft also opened an unexpected new dimension to the midterm election campaign. The drama could stoke turnout in November for both parties.\n\nFor now, it validates the decision of social conservatives to stick with Trump after he vowed to nominate justices that would overturn the constitutional right to abortion despite reservations about his moral conduct.\n\nAnd if the court issues such an opinion, it would mean the ex-President’s political legacy could endure potentially for decades.\n\nSuch a ruling would reignite Democratic fury at then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s refusal to confirm then-President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court pick, Merrick Garland, in 2016. Four years later, the GOP leader ignored his own rule prohibiting confirmations in an election year when he rushed through Trump’s pick, Amy Coney Barrett, days before the November contest.\n\nHow the final ruling could influence the midterms\n\nThere is a possibility, however, that a final ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade – rather than a slower process of outlawing abortion with a more incremental set of decisions over time – could galvanize Democratic turnout, especially from women, in an election in which the party was girding for heavy losses.\n\nA CNN poll conducted by SSRS in January showed, for instance, that 69% of Americans opposed overturning Roe while 30% supported such a move.\n\nCNN legal analyst and Supreme Court biographer Joan Biskupic reported late Monday that Chief Justice John Roberts did not want to completely overturn Roe, meaning he would have dissented from part of Alito’s draft opinion, likely with the top bench’s three liberals.\n\nThat would still give the conservatives a 5-4 majority on the issue.\n\nRoberts is willing, however, to uphold the Mississippi law that would ban abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy, CNN has learned. Under current law, government cannot interfere with a woman’s choice to terminate a pregnancy before about 23 weeks, when a fetus could live outside the womb.\n\nDemocrats demand action, conservatives celebrate\n\nDemocrats were quick to react to the Politico report, with many senators, or would-be senators, zeroing in on the filibuster.\n\nAs the reverberations from the story rocked Washington on Tuesday morning, President Joe Biden issued a written statement that began with the caveat that it was unknown whether the draft was genuine and represented the final decision of the court. But he recalled that his administration had argued before the justices that Roe v. Wade was based on a long line of precedent.\n\n“I believe that a woman’s right to choose is fundamental,” Biden wrote. “Roe has been the law of the land for almost fifty years, and basic fairness and the stability of our law demand that it not be overturned.”\n\nLate Monday, and in order to try to protect the right to an abortion legislatively, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders called on Democratic leaders to eliminate the requirement for major legislation to achieve a super majority of 60 votes to pass. “Congress must pass legislation that codifies Roe v. Wade as the law of the land in this country NOW,” Sanders wrote, calling for the ending of the filibuster if needed.\n\nBut the limitations of the 50-50 majority in the Senate mean that it is unlikely the party could pass such legislation on a simple majority. That’s because moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia opposes abortion rights. And Kyrsten Sinema, the Democratic senator from Arizona, who has been a roadblock on other administration priorities, opposes changing the filibuster rules.\n\nThe Politico report set off an immediate political firestorm. “This is a five alarm fire,” said Washington Sen. Patty Murray, who is part of the Democratic leadership.\n\n“In a matter of days or weeks, the horrifying reality is that we could live in a country without Roe. If this is true, women will be forced to remain pregnant no matter their personal circumstances. Extreme politicians will control patients’ most personal decisions. And extreme Republicans will have eliminated a fundamental right an entire generation of women have known their whole lives,” she continued.\n\nRep. Gregory Meeks, a Democrat from New York, told CNN’s Don Lemon that the ruling, if issued in line with the draft, would be a “game changer for America.”\n\n“It’s a game changer for women and women’s rights,” he said.\n\nThere was also swift reaction from the American Civil Liberties Union, whose executive director Anthony Romero warned that such a decision would “deprive half the nation of a fundamental, constitutional right that has been enjoyed by millions of women” for decades.\n\nAny decision by the court to send the issue of abortion back to the states would put immediate pressure on governors and legislatures on both sides of the aisle.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a statement Monday night calling the draft opinion an “appalling attack on the rights of women across this country and if it stands, it will destroy lives and put countless women in danger.”\n\nBut South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2024, pledged to spring into action immediately if the Supreme Court ruling eventually follows the draft’s reasoning.\n\n“If this report is true and Roe v. Wade is overturned, I will immediately call for a special session to save lives and guarantee that every unborn child has a right to life in South Dakota,” Noem tweeted.\n\nAnd there was already a sense of triumph evident in conservative circles about the Politico report.\n\nGOP Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan tweeted that she is praying that “the Supreme Court makes it official and formally overturns this attack on the unborn.”\n\nRep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina praised Trump’s role in building the unassailable conservative majority on the court.\n\n“Because of Donald J. Trump, Roe v. Wade will be overturned,” Cawthorn tweeted. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a hardline Trump backer, called the draft opinion “the most significant and glorious news of our lifetime.”\n\nOutside the Court itself, meanwhile, the chants underscored the division on the issue.\n\n“Hey, hey, ho, ho, Samuel Alito’s gotta go,” erupted from abortion rights advocates.\n\n“Hey hey, ho ho, Roe v. Wade has got to go,” others countered.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/economy/china-bank-runs-protests-intl-mic-hnk/index.html", "title": "Small banks in China are running into trouble. Savers could lose ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nPeter had put his life savings of about $6 million into accounts at three small banks in China’s central Henan province. He says he hasn’t been able to access them since April.\n\nThe 45-year-old entrepreneur asked us to call him Peter for security reasons. He’s from the eastern city of Wenzhou and is just one of thousands of depositors who have been fighting to recover their savings from at least six banks in rural provinces in central China.\n\n“I’m close to having a nervous breakdown. I can’t sleep,” Peter told CNN Business.\n\nWhen he tried to access his accounts online, a statement would pop up on the homepage informing him that the website was under maintenance and services would be unavailable for a while, Peter told CNN Business. Two months later, those services have not been restored.\n\nThe trouble began in April, when four banks in Henan suspended cash withdrawals.\n\nIn China, local banks are only permitted to obtain deposits from their home customer base, but authorities say that “third-party platforms” were used to acquire funds from depositors outside the region. In Peter’s case, for example, his hometown is over 700 miles away from the banks in Henan.\n\nThe national banking regulator has accused a major shareholder of the four banks of illegally attracting money from savers. “Henan New Fortune Group, a shareholder of the four village banks, has illegally absorbed the public’s funds through internal and external collusion, the use of third-party platforms, and fund brokers,” the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission told state-run Xinhua News Agency in May.\n\nDepositors protest in front of the Henan branch of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, demanding their money back after their funds were frozen. From Lan Nuo Nuo in February\n\n“The police have opened a case for investigation into the matter,” it added.\n\nRuns on small Chinese banks have become more frequent in recent years and some have been accused of financial improprieties or corruption. But experts worry that a much bigger financial problem could be looming, caused by fallout from a real estate crash and soaring bad debts related to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThere are no official estimates yet on the total amount of funds that bank depositors are unable to withdraw. CNN Business did not receive a comment from the local police or the national banking regulator.\n\nAs many as 400,000 banking customers across China were unable to access their savings, according to an estimate in April by Sanlian Lifeweek, a state-owned magazine.\n\nThat’s a drop in the ocean of China’s vast banking system, but about a quarter of the industry’s total assets are held by around 4,000 small lenders, which often have opaque ownership and governance structures and are more vulnerable to corruption, say experts, and the sharp economic slowdown.\n\n“The scope of the bank scandals where bank officials embezzle and steal funds from depositors is alarming, and what is exposed could only be the tip of the iceberg,” said Frank Xie, a professor at University of South Carolina Aiken who studies Chinese business and the economy.\n\n“As the Chinese economy slows down further, the fiscal shortage worsens, and the debt repayments become more widespread among Chinese companies, especially in the real estate sector, bank runs could become more often and on a larger scale,” he said.\n\nMany savers have had enough. Late last month, hundreds of depositors traveled to Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan, to protest outside the office of the banking regulator and to demand their money back, to no avail.\n\nAnother protest was planned in June. But as the depositors arrived in Zhengzhou, they were stunned to find that their health codes — which were green upon departure — had turned red, according to six people who spoke with CNN and social media posts. Anyone with a red code — usually assigned to people infected with Covid or deemed by authorities to be at high risk of infection — immediately becomes persona non grata.\n\nThey are banned from all public venues and transport and are often subject to weeks of government quarantine.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Zhengzhou government for comment. The Henan Provincial Health Commission told state-run news website thepaper.cn it was “investigating and verifying” the complaints from depositors who received red codes.\n\nWhat’s behind the problem in Henan\n\nIn Henan, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission has put the blame on the private investment firm that holds large stakes in all four lenders.\n\nLast week, the Henan police said that a criminal gang headed by the investment firm’s controller “has been suspected of using village banks to commit serious crimes.” Police say several suspects have been arrested.\n\nThe Henan New Fortune Group no longer has a website. CNN tried to reach the company for comment on the phone and by email without success. The company has made no public statements and it’s believed to have been annulled.\n\nLater on Monday, the four Henan banks said they would start collecting information from customers who have been affected by the shutdown of their online transaction systems. The move was required by financial regulators, the banks added in separate statements on their website, without elaborating further.\n\nThat’s of little comfort to the banks’ customers. Deposits up to 500,000 yuan (almost $75,000) are guaranteed in the event of bank failures, but that’s not enough for some — like Peter — and if the government’s investigation finds that their savings are “non-compliant” transactions, they could lose everything.\n\n“I’m quite worried about how they [authorities] are going to deal with our money,” said Ye, who asked CNN Business to only use his surname. Ye is a 30-year old tech worker from the city of Dongguan in Guangdong province — about 1500 km (900 miles) from the banks he used in Henan. He said he has a total of 160,000 yuan (about $24,000) worth of deposits with them.\n\n“We were told by the banks that the deposit products were legal, and that they were protected by the deposit insurance scheme,” he said. “We just want to get our money back.”\n\nThe four banks — Yuzhou Xinminsheng Village Bank, Shangcai Huimin County Bank, Zhecheng Huanghuai Community Bank, New Oriental Country Bank of Kaifeng — have not replied to requests for comment.\n\nRisky liabilities\n\nIn early 2021, Beijing banned banks from selling deposit products via third party online platforms, fearing that the rapid expansion of the fintech sector could increase risks in the wider financial system. The People’s Bank of China called such practices “illegal financial activities.”\n\nSo why were small local banks in Henan apparently ignoring the ban and raising deposits from savers — like Ye, who live on the other side of the country?\n\nChina’s national banking and insurance regulator says third party online platforms allowed them to bypass these geographical restrictions and grow their business nationwide.\n\nIn the Henan case, various state-run media are reporting that the deposit products were sold via platforms affiliated with, or owned by, giants of China’s tech scene such as Baidu (BIDU) and JD.com. (JD)\n\nThose platforms — Du Xiaoman Financial, which is the financial affiliate of Baidu, as well as JD Finance — have not responded to requests for comment.\n\n“The central government regulators seem to be incapable of enforcing those regulations aimed at preventing this kind of bank run from occurring,” said Frank Xie, the Chinese economy expert. He added that corruption was “rampant” at local levels of financial institutions.\n\n“Perpetrators such as the person stealing millions from the depositors often get shielded by accomplices in governments and in the upper-level management of the banks,” Xie said.\n\n“The core problem is that China’s financial system simply expanded far too fast relative to the size of the economy over the previous decade,” said Logan Wright, director of China markets research at Rhodium Group.\n\nChina’s banking sector has increased sixfold in size since 2008, with total assets reaching over $50 trillion, according to government statistics.\n\nThe funding structure of small lenders also makes them more risky, say experts.\n\nCompared with big banks, they are more reliant on deposits for funding. Many of them offer high interest rates to attract commercial and interbank deposits. But as the slowing economy means borrowers struggle to repay the banks, it becomes difficult for them to deliver the returns they offered savers.\n\n“The funding structure of liabilities in many of China’s mostly smaller and regional banks is most likely still vulnerable to deposit runs, lender caution, and deteriorating economic performance and rising unemployment,” said George Magnus, an associate at the China Centre at Oxford University and former chief economist at UBS.\n\nDeteriorating financial health\n\nThe Henan crisis arrived at a time when public confidence in China’s banking system was already waning.\n\nIn the past decade, Beijing has been clamping down on “shadow banking” activities — which means unregulated, off-the-book lending by financial institutions — on worries that most of the funds had been diverted to property developers and local government infrastructure projects, leading to a rapid run-up in debt and growing financial risks.\n\nIn 2019, China seized control of Baoshang Bank, based in Inner Mongolia, citing serious credit risks posed by the lender.\n\nIt was the first bank seizure in China in more than 20 years and the lender was declared bankrupt.\n\nThe following year, there were at least five bank runs at small lenders, mostly triggered by public fears following reports of financial distress at the banks or anti-graft investigations into bank executives.\n\n“Financial institutions are still grappling with some of the losses that have resulted, particularly in China’s northeast, central provinces, and western regions, where shadow banking activities had expanded the fastest over the past decade,” Wright said.\n\nMaking matters worse, “the ongoing slowdowns in the economy during the Covid-19 pandemic have further exposed financial institutions to new credit risks as well,” Wright added.\n\nSpillover effects\n\nInvestors are closely watching the government’s investigation into the Henan bank run. Analysts are gauging possible spillover effects to other banks.\n\n“The economy is a key reason why affected banks might be experiencing difficulties, and it is quite possible that other banks will be affected, perhaps even larger banks, given that the fate of the property market and real estate prices hang in the balance,” said Magnus from Oxford University.\n\nThe Chinese economy has been struggling with the country’s zero-Covid policy. Many cities have been placed under full or partial lockdowns since March, wreaking havoc on activity. Analysts are worried that the economy could contract in the second quarter.\n\n“This could have multiplier effects given that real estate as an asset class could be compromised now for a few years,” Magnus said.\n\nChina’s gigantic real estate sector, which accounts for as much as 30% of its GDP, is in a worsening downturn. Sales by the country’s top 100 developers collapsed 59% in May from a year ago, according to a recent survey by property research firm Cric China.\n\nEvergrande — one of the country’s biggest developers — is undergoing a huge restructuring after it defaulted on its debts late last year. Analysts have long feared Evergrande’s collapse could have ripple effects across the property industry and spill over to the financial system.\n\nProperty loans accounts for nearly 30% of outstanding loans with China’s financial institutions.\n\nAnalysts aren’t yet worrying about a financial crisis — because the PBOC is likely to ensure that larger and systemically more important banks are protected.\n\nBut the discontent triggered by the bank runs could be a major concern for the government.\n\nWhen Covid health codes of depositors turned red early last week, derailing a planned protest in Zhengzhou, it sparked a massive outcry on social media.\n\n“Now (the authorities) can stop you from petitioning by directly putting digital shackles on you, aka giving you red codes,” said one comment on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like platform.\n\nDozens of depositors were taken into a quarantine hotel guarded by police and local officials, before being sent away on trains bound for their hometowns the next day; others were “quarantined” at several other locations in the city, including a college campus, according to the witnesses and online posts.\n\n“Many people lost their lifetime savings because of this and [if] more incidences like this takes place, and [if] a bank run is met with a government crackdown, social unrest will be the only end result,” Xie said.\n\n— Nectar Gan, CNN’s Beijing bureau, and Wayne Chang contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/11/investing/bank-of-england-uk-financial-instability/index.html", "title": "Bank of England warns risks to UK financial stability haven't gone ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nFor the second time in two days, the Bank of England has been forced to offer extra support to UK markets still reeling from the government’s announcement last month that it would slash taxes and increase borrowing.\n\nThe central bank warned Tuesday that there was still a “material risk to UK financial stability” from a sharp-sell off in government bonds that has sent yields soaring, pushing up borrowing costs across the economy and forcing some pension funds to dump assets to raise cash.\n\nA slump in UK government bonds that promise to protect investors from inflation — known as index-linked gilts — was the latest source of risk, it said.\n\n“Dysfunction in this market, and the prospect of self-reinforcing ‘fire sale’ dynamics pose a material risk to UK financial stability,” it said in a statement.\n\nThe extent of the bond market strain was underscored Tuesday when the UK government sold £900 million ($994 million) of index-linked gilts due in 2051 at the highest yield since October 2008, according to Reuters.\n\nStarting Tuesday, the Bank of England will include index-linked gilts in its emergency £65 billion ($71.7 billion) bond-buying program announced on Sept. 28. “These additional operations will act as a further backstop to restore orderly market conditions,” it added.\n\nThe bank said the program would end as planned on Friday, despite calls for it to continue for another three weeks.\n\nOn Monday, it doubled the daily limit on its bond-buying to £10 billion through the end of the week. It also announced a new facility that will make it easier for banks to tap central bank cash by accepting a wider range of assets as collateral. That program will continue once the emergency bond-buying program ends.\n\nThe market meltdown began after Prime Minister Liz Truss’ government unveiled £45 billion in unfunded tax cuts on Sept. 23. Truss and her finance minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, also chose to present their “mini budget” without an independent analysis from the UK’s fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), of what the plan would mean for government borrowing and economic growth.\n\nThe pound and UK government bonds crashed, forcing some pension funds near default and pushing them to dump assets as a hedging strategy came unstuck. Mortgage rates shot higher.\n\nUnder pressure from markets, the International Monetary Fund, ratings agencies, poll ratings and restive members of their own Conservative Party, Truss and Kwarteng have already had to backpedal fast. They’ve ditched plans to slash the top rate of income tax for people earning more than £150,000 a year, but that shaves only about £2 billion off the cost of the tax-cutting package.\n\nKwarteng has also brought forward his full budget announcement by more than three weeks to Oct. 31, meaning it will now take place before the next meeting of the Bank of England on Nov. 3, when interest rates are likely to be raised significantly. The finance minister will also publish OBR forecasts at the same time.\n\nBut the government still faces an uphill struggle in persuading investors it can pay for its program and fulfill Kwarteng’s promise to “get debt falling in the medium term.”\n\nThe Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, which represents funds providing retirement incomes for 30 million people, said many of its members wanted to see the Bank of England continue to buy bonds until the end of the month, and possibly beyond.\n\nHuge uncertainty\n\nThe independent Institute for Fiscal Studies said Tuesday the government would need to announce spending cuts of more than £60 billion just to stabilize debt as a share of national income by 2026-2027.\n\nThose cuts may be politically impossible to achieve given the cost-of-living crisis and pressure on public services such as health and social care.\n\n‘It is just about possible to see how Mr. Kwarteng could get debt on a stable, or ever-so-slightly falling, path in the final year of his forecast,” IFS director Paul Johnson said in a statement. “But the specifics of the UK government’s fiscal strategy are under more scrutiny by financial markets than at any point in the recent past.”\n\nRelying on overly optimistic forecasts for growth or vague promises to reduce spending down the road could lack credibility.\n\nBenjamin Nabarro, chief UK economist at Citigroup, said that the United Kingdom has few easy answers to the difficult economic outlook.\n\n“In the near term, further demand stimulus merely risks aggravating the near-term challenges. And with monetary and fiscal policy now working in opposite directions, we think the broader risks around UK monetary [and] financial stability are growing,” he added.\n\n— Julia Horowitz and Hanna Ziady contributed to this article.", "authors": ["Mark Thompson"], "publish_date": "2022/10/11"}]}

Ron DeSantis will kick off 2024 presidential bid with Elon Musk on Twitter\n\nHow to listen:Elon Musk will host Ron DeSantis on Twitter Spaces\n\nThe event will be moderated by former PayPal executive David Sacks, a longtime associate of Musk and a major supporter of DeSantis who contributed more than $70,000 to the governor’s political committee in 2021.\n\nAt a time when Twitter is struggling to keep users engaged and advertisers from fleeing, Musk has a strong financial motive to bring aboard political personalities and major news events who drive engagement on the platform.\n\nThe DeSantis interview comes as the once central role Twitter played in politics on the national stage has diminished on Musk’s watch.\n\n“With a declining network that fewer and fewer people want to be on, there’s a clear upside to trying to recapture some of the energy of the glory days by having a big presidential aspirant on,” said David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University.\n\nOne of Twitter's main characters, Donald Trump, used Twitter to fuel his rise to power before being suspended from the platform after the violence on Jan. 6.\n\nEven though Musk lifted the ban and reinstated the account along with its blue check mark and 87 million followers after Trump announced his 2024 presidential bid in November, Trump has not returned, preferring Truth Social, the social media platform the former president set up.\n\nTrump’s super PAC mocked DeSantis for launching his campaign on Twitter. “The only thing less relatable than a niche campaign launch on Twitter, is DeSantis’ after party at the uber elite Four Seasons resort in Miami,” MAGA Inc. tweeted.\n\nFor decades media companies played kingmakers in election cycles but social media has assumed an increasingly prominent role in the political conversation in recent years, with the leaders of top social media companies hosting heads of state −like Mark Zuckerberg interviewing President Obama − and with presidential campaigns using tweets to court voters and social media pages to reel in donors.\n\nSocial media's growing role brought on accusations that the algorithms companies use to pump up engagement deepened political divides in an increasingly polarized country by recommending content rife with misinformation and extremism.\n\nKarpf says Musk is seizing on the DeSantis interview as an opportunity to return Twitter to the center of that conversation, much the way it was in the 2020 presidential cycle.\n\n“He gets to look important, support the candidate he has already publicly supported and make it seem like Twitter is still the center of the political conversation. That’s a triple win for Elon Musk,” Karpf said. “This is a good day for Elon. I also don’t know if it will matter much. Twitter isn’t what it was a year ago or five years ago.”\n\nMusk denied that he was taking political sides by hosting DeSantis. Rather, he said he plans to host interviews with politicians of different political persuasions and would like to see Twitter become a “public town square” where more organizations make announcements.\n\nOn Monday, Musk retweeted a video of another Republican hopeful launching his presidential campaign, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina.\n\nSince Musk bought Twitter last year, the social media platform has swiveled to the right. Earlier this month, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson announced that he planned to relaunch his popular show on Twitter after being fired from the cable network.\n\n'It's not how white men fight':Tucker Carlson text contributed to his firing, report says\n\nMusk, who has hired a new CEO, Linda Yaccarino, to run Twitter describes himself as a political moderate.\n\nHe has said he reluctantly voted for Joe Biden over Trump in 2020 but has been critical of Biden’s administration and has appeared in recent years to shift his support to Republicans in recent years. Last year, he urged his 140 million followers on Twitter to support Republican candidates.\n\nMusk has met with DeSantis and has said he would back the governor if he ran for president, but, despite embracing some of DeSantis’ attacks on “woke” capital and politics, he has not formally endorsed a candidate.\n\nHe said Tuesday that his preference was for a president “who is representative of the moderate views that most of the country holds.”\n\n\"Musk accomplishes two things with the DeSantis announcement: he brings a lot of attention to Twitter and re-positions the platform as a center for conservative discussion,\" said Dan Schnur, a professor at the UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies, Pepperdine University’s Graduate School of Public Policy and the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School of Communication. \"It’s risky to identify so closely with one party, but he can certainly host a similar program for a prominent Democrat if he decides it would be helpful.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-2024-presidential-bid/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump announces a White House bid for 2024 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\n“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign will be headquartered.\n\nSurrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four years in office. Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign.

Ron DeSantis’ bid for reelection, the former President and his home-state governor appear increasingly likely to collide in a heated 2024 presidential primary. While neither has formally announced a presidential campaign, both have taken steps in the closing days of the 2022 cycle to cement themselves as team players and kingmakers – locking horns in those pursuits.\n\n“We have a rift with Trump. Big shocker,” said a source close to the DeSantis campaign, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly. “It’s no secret that things are cool between [Trump and DeSantis] right now. They’re not punching each other, but we’re not helping them and they’re not helping us.”\n\nA rivalry that had mostly existed behind the scenes burst into public view this week after DeSantis recorded a robocall endorsing Republican businessman Joe O’Dea, an underdog in the Colorado Senate race who vowed earlier this month to “actively campaign” against Trump if he mounts a third presidential bid. While the Florida governor has supported other Republican midterm candidates, none of them have been as explicitly critical of Trump as O’Dea.\n\nThe move did not go unnoticed by the former President, who has spent months griping to aides about DeSantis and amplifying claims that he would handily beat the governor in a Republican primary.\n\n“A BIG MISTAKE!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform of DeSantis endorsing O’Dea. Three days later, Trump announced plans for a rally in South Florida with the state’s senior senator, Marco Rubio. DeSantis was not invited, a source told CNN.\n\nThe first signs of a strain in Trump’s relationship with DeSantis began last fall amid the Florida Republican’s soaring popularity and thinly veiled criticism of Trump’s Covid-19 policies as president.\n\nDespite efforts by allies of both men to defuse tensions, their strained relationship has persisted for months and now appears at a crescendo as Trump readies a post-midterm 2024 campaign announcement and DeSantis barrels toward reelection with potentially historic support from Florida Hispanics.\n\n“Trump has to be concerned because DeSantis has built an unprecedented base in the Hispanic community,” said one Florida-based Republican consultant.\n\nDeSantis has also spent the past year making inroads with deep-pocketed Republican donors and laying the groundwork for a potential 2024 campaign launch next year, according to allies, some of whom said he doesn’t want to rush his potential entry into what is likely to be a crowded primary. It’s those overt steps toward a White House bid that have most irritated the former President.\n\nDays after Trump slammed the Florida governor for endorsing in the Colorado Senate contest, DeSantis committed another cardinal sin in the eyes of the former President when he once again refused to rule out a presidential run if Trump is a candidate. During a Monday debate against his Democratic opponent, Charlie Crist, DeSantis declined to commit to serving a four-year term if reelected, standing in silence as his opponent repeatedly raised the subject. Privately, Trump allies gloated over the debate, questioning DeSantis’ ability to endure a debate against Trump.\n\n“DeSantis did fine for a race he’s crushing,” said one Republican operative who has worked with both men. “It’s a whole different ballgame when he’s on a stage next to Donald Trump. Trump has a way of very effectively getting under people’s skin, especially on the debate stage.”\n\nOther Republicans dismissed such takeaways as premature – even unfair – given DeSantis’ clear edge in his reelection race and Trump’s inimitable debate style.\n\n“I don’t think that debate mattered at all,” said Brian Ballard, a Florida-based Republican consultant who maintains close ties to both Trump and DeSantis.\n\n“Donald Trump on the debate stage is the most unique political animal in 100 years. Everybody got decimated by him [in 2016],” Ballard added. “I believe Ron DeSantis can hold his own against anybody, but Donald Trump is his own character.”\n\n‘They don’t think it’s his turn’\n\nFor months, Trump has worked to cast himself as the automatic front-runner in a contested 2024 primary while asking his own pollsters to identify whether DeSantis or others pose a serious threat.\n\nIn perhaps his most direct jab at DeSantis yet, the former President reposted a video to his Truth Social site this week in which former Fox News host Megyn Kelly confidently predicted that Trump would emerge on top in a contest against DeSantis. Kelly repeatedly sparred with Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign, both as a debate moderator and prime-time commentator, but in the video shared by Trump she suggested the former President’s base remains firmly behind him.\n\n“You really think the hardcore MAGA is going to abandon Trump for DeSantis? They’re not. They like DeSantis, but they don’t think it’s his turn,” Kelly says in the clip, adding that “the hardcore Trump faithful is unshakable [and] if forced to choose, they will choose Trump.”\n\nWhile some Republicans agree with Kelly, others are looking for new blood, exhausted by Trump’s unending legal battles and the media spectacle surrounding him.\n\nThose close to DeSantis say he is content, for now, to let his election performance do the talking for him. Through mid-October, two political committees behind his reelection effort had spent more than $80 million trying to engineer a lopsided victory that would further bolster his resume and deliver an overwhelming mandate for his agenda.\n\nBut in conversations with donors, DeSantis allies say he is far less dismissive these days when questioned about a White House bid than he was six months ago – something Trump allies have brought to his attention, further irritating him.\n\n“People are always talking about, wondering about presidential elections in the future and all this stuff,” DeSantis said at a rally Wednesday. “People are concerned about who’s running the country next because no one knows who the hell is running the government now.”\n\nOn the campaign trail, the Florida governor has been beta-testing messages that could set him apart in a presidential primary either with or without Trump as a competitor. He has touted his record on the economy, his management of the pandemic and his battles with businesses, Big Tech and school districts over “woke ideology.” Some say the more he can lean into his accomplishments as governor, the less likely he is to draw comparisons with Trump even as he mimics elements of the former President’s political style – from his hand gestures to his public war on the media.\n\n“If I were advising him, I would tell him to ignore that stuff. You’re Ron DeSantis 1.0, not anything 2.0,” said Adam Geller, a former Trump campaign pollster and Republican strategist.\n\nTrump’s preemptive rally in South Florida\n\nBut Trump rallying voters in DeSantis’ state on November 6, two nights before the election, serves as a reminder of how easily he still commands GOP voters. Among Florida Republican operatives, the timing and location of Trump’s event has raised eyebrows. There are Senate battlegrounds considerably more competitive than Florida, where Rubio is favored to defeat Democratic Rep. Val Demings, and neither party has committed significant resources to the state in the closing weeks of the race.\n\nMore on key Senate races Herschel Walker defends use of ‘honorary’ sheriff’s badge in Georgia Senate debate Democratic Senate nominees hold cash edge in fall home stretch but face GOP advertising onslaught Democratic senator in competitive Colorado race defends party on inflation Five takeaways from the Georgia Senate debate See Senate race ratings by Inside Elections\n\nIn announcing the visit, Trump once again claimed credit for DeSantis winning the governor’s mansion through “a historic red wave for Florida in the 2018 midterms” with the former President’s “slate of endorsed candidates up and down the ballot.” But Trump also preemptively took ownership of DeSantis’ reelection, saying he had “molded the Sunshine State into the MAGA stronghold it is today.”\n\nA person briefed on the matter said the prospect of a Florida rally was first raised during a phone call between Trump and Rubio following the Florida Senate debate earlier this month. Since the rally is being organized by Trump’s political operation, any effort to involve DeSantis would have likely come from the former President’s orbit. But that did not happen, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\n\n“The Senator and President Trump discussed holding a rally in Florida, like he’s doing for Senate races across the country,” said Elizabeth Gregory, a Rubio campaign spokesperson.\n\nMiami is also home to several vibrant Latino communities that shifted to the right under Trump and have continued to trend red in the two years since he left office. Trump will land in the city just before Republicans are poised to have their best electoral showing in Miami-Dade County since Jeb Bush won a second term in 2002.\n\nOne Florida-based Republican consultant said he doesn’t think that’s a coincidence.\n\n“We’re potentially going to see Florida Republicans win Miami-Dade County, and it’s pretty clear Trump’s trying to get down there to take credit,” the consultant said.\n\nDeSantis’ campaign didn’t ask to join the program for the Trump rally once it was announced, a source told CNN.\n\nLike Trump, DeSantis has also tried to ascribe greater meaning to Florida’s transformational shift from a purple battleground into a reliably red state. On Wednesday, he told supporters that a big win on Election Day “will send a loud message, I think, across the country to governors in our own party” to follow his example in their states.\n\nBut any tension over who deserves credit for engineering that success is unlikely to matter until after November 8, said Tim Williams, a former Florida GOP campaign strategist.\n\n“As far as the midterms go, that’s a train that’s approaching so quickly that this Trump-DeSantis feud isn’t going to get in the way of it,” Williams said.", "authors": ["Gaborr Steve Contorno Kristen Holmes", "Steve Contorno", "Kristen Holmes"], "publish_date": "2022/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/05/25/desantis-twitter-glitch-5-takeaways-presidential-launch/70256451007/", "title": "DeSantis Twitter glitch: What to know about the the 2024 ...", "text": "Well that was awkward.\n\nFlorida Gov.

Believing he will be the undisputed front-runner regardless of when he announces, some have said that if he launches another White House bid too early, he will run out of money around the time Republicans host their nominating convention, leaving him cash-strapped and vulnerable during the general election.\n\nBetter to address the legal fallout from the FBI search first, other advisers have told Trump and his team.\n\n“Everyone was operating under the assumption that shortly after Labor Day would be the best possible time to launch, but that has changed and he’s being told to deal with the FBI stuff first,” said a Trump adviser.\n\nOtherwise, advisers say, the former President is more likely to be blamed for potential losses in the midterms if he becomes a candidate for president before November and his legal troubles distract from the bread-and-butter issues most Republicans – but especially those running in competitive races – would prefer to focus on.\n\nAs Trump-backed Senate candidates in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Arizona struggle to eclipse their opponents in fundraising and recent polls, a growing number of Trump confidants have shared concerns with him that a pre-midterm announcement would be weaponized by Democrats, who remain eager to distract from inflation and rising crime and are well-versed already in using Trump as a campaign foil.\n\n“There is a direct tie if Trump becomes a campaign ad in November and Republicans lose the Senate, and the last thing he wants is to be blamed,” said a former Trump campaign aide.\n\nTrump himself has started complaining in private about Mehmet Oz’s performance in the Pennsylvania Senate contest and a spate of bad press that Georgia Senate hopeful Herschel Walker generated earlier this summer when it became public that he had fathered several children out of wedlock despite routinely criticizing absentee fathers, this aide said.\n\nIn the days after federal investigators searched his waterfront residence in early August, Trump was inundated with calls from allies urging him to announce his bid for president immediately.\n\n“It was so hot,” said one Trump ally, describing the surging support Trump encountered among both grassroots supporters and top Republicans after he revealed the FBI had searched his home.\n\nBut as the legal battle over records seized during the search continues to play out and new details emerge about the sheer volume of classified records Trump was apparently storing haphazardly at Mar-a-Lago, others in Trump’s orbit have urged him to put any campaign announcement on hold until he addresses his legal woes. The FBI warrant unsealed earlier this month revealed three possible federal crimes as reason for the search: violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and criminal handling of government records. In a late Tuesday court filing, the Justice Department said documents were “likely concealed and removed” from a storage room at Mar-a-Lago as part of an effort to “obstruct” the FBI’s investigation. Trump, who has not been charged with a crime, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing while boasting that the FBI search has buoyed his 2024 prospects and sent a jolt of energy through his political base.\n\nAnother Trump adviser who had previously pushed for a pre-November campaign announcement has since recanted, joining those who believe that waiting until after the midterms is a more prudent approach.\n\n“There’s no urgency because he’s not going to be outshined by someone else,” said former Trump campaign aide Bryan Lanza, pointing to the crowd of potential 2024 rivals who rushed to Trump’s defense – or lobbed sharp criticism at the Justice Department – after learning that federal investigators had executed a search warrant at his home.\n\n“I personally feel like it’s a sign of weakness if he announces before the midterm,” said Matt Schlapp, a top Trump ally who chairs the American Conservative Union. Trump had previously considered a pre-midterm announcement as one way to clear the field of prospective challengers, something that Schlapp and others now say he no longer needs to worry about.\n\nSome in Trump world still want him to announce now\n\nDespite Trump being counseled by a growing number of advisers to delay his campaign announcement until later this fall or winter, not everyone in his inner circle has been convinced that that’s the right move.\n\nOne source close to Trump dismissed the escalating political and legal concerns as “excuses,” arguing that the former President is already being blamed for the shifting midterm forecast and putting off a presidential campaign launch is unlikely to inoculate him from further criticism among Republicans if the party either fails to win the Senate or disappoints in its overall gains.\n\n“They are going to blame him no matter what, so he should just announce,” this person said.\n\nPeople familiar with Trump’s thinking said he has been more receptive to postponing his campaign announcement until after the midterms in part because of the way Republicans rallied behind him following the FBI search. The former President has recently told allies he doesn’t think he will face a formidable challenger in the 2024 GOP primary, according to three people familiar with his comments, one of whom said Trump has been quick to point out how Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis compared the FBI search to “Banana Republic” tactics. DeSantis is widely expected to be a top primary rival if he runs for the nomination against Trump.\n\n“He’s up to his eyeballs in legal troubles but that hasn’t stopped him from totally relishing this,” said a second person close to the former President, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nSo far, the consensus among Republican operatives two years out from the 2024 election is that Trump is unlikely to face a real primary threat even though he is widely expected to field challenges from a handful of GOP hopefuls. Former Vice President Mike Pence, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan are some of the likeliest rivals Trump could face if he does run again.\n\nSchlapp, who believes Trump will indeed attract primary competitors, said none would be “serious in terms of being able to win the nomination.” He added that Trump’s outrage over the FBI search will give him something to tap into if and when he does announce a third presidential campaign.\n\n“Sometimes I think he’s better the more acrimonious he gets,” Schlapp said, claiming that Trump’s early August appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas was a turning point for some Republicans who were previously on the fence about his desire to mount a comeback bid after losing to Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nTwo days before federal investigators conducted their search of Mar-a-Lago, Trump used the speech to complain that he is “always being persecuted.”\n\nOne of the Trump advisers took it a step further, suggesting that an indictment of Trump by the Biden administration “would be beneficial” to the former President at this juncture.\n\n“It would just appear too partisan at this point,” this adviser said.\n\nBiden, who has insisted he had no advance warning of the search, has stressed the independence of the Justice Department. But Trump has frequently taken to his social media platform to blast what he’s called a politically motivated “witch hunt” and railed against the FBI and Biden, including in a frenzy of posts on Truth Social on Tuesday alone.\n\nPrioritizing his legal fights\n\nWhile Trump hasn’t made a firm timing decision yet as he mulls a 2024 bid, his lack of planning for a campaign rollout has signaled to those around him that he wants to bide his time.\n\nUntil adding former Florida Solicitor General Chris Kise to his legal defense team on Tuesday, Trump had been struggling to navigate the legal jeopardy he finds himself in as federal investigators sift through the classified documents they seized from his residence – possibly building a criminal case in the process.\n\nThose around him say Trump appears to be putting his political ambitions on the backburner – if only temporarily – to give his legal team space to operate and strategize without the time constraints that a presidential campaign would demand. The former President has spent the three weeks since the FBI conducted its search at Mar-a-Lago trying to capitalize on the moment politically, while his attorneys have meanwhile struggled to develop a clear strategy. His legal team waited until weeks after the search, for example, to file a so-called special master request for an independent review of the materials taken from his home, which is the subject of a hearing this week.\n\n“Right now, it’s a question of whether he wants to turn everything political or gain some legal stability to make sure everything turns out OK before taking that next step,” said one of the Trump advisers.", "authors": ["Gaborr Kristen Holmes", "Kristen Holmes"], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/politics/ron-desantis-2024-president-trump-florida/index.html", "title": "Ron DeSantis: Momentum -- and planning -- for 2024 bid takes off ...", "text": "Tampa, Florida CNN —\n\nAmid growing chatter about his political future and in the face of recent outbursts directed his way from an increasingly agitated Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis rarely engaged in the speculation or mudslinging. He insisted a statement victory in his bid for a second term needed to precede any discussion of 2024.\n\nOn Tuesday night, that statement came in the form of a 19-point landslide win over Democrat Charlie Crist – the most lopsided victory by a Republican gubernatorial nominee in Florida history and a gap that dwarfed Trump’s own Sunshine State win in 2020. Within minutes of the polls closing, DeSantis’ Tampa election night party burst into euphoria as the totality and breadth of his resounding performance began to crystalize. DeSantis had turned once-solidly blue counties red, won over a majority of Latino voters and carried on his coattails Republican candidates up and down the ballot and in every corner of the state.\n\n“We not only won election, we have rewritten the political map,” DeSantis declared to his supporters before confetti rained down on him and his family. Some in the crowd urged him to consider a White House bid by chanting, “Two more years!”\n\nThe outcome in Florida was a bright spot for Republicans, who otherwise waited for a red wave that never arrived and watched Trump-backed candidates flounder in key battlegrounds. And the reaction within the GOP has only further fueled momentum for DeSantis to run for president and take on Trump head-on next year.\n\n“DeFuture,” read Wednesday’s front page of the New York Post, owned by conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch.\n\nRepublicans are particularly encouraged by the result in Latino-majority Miami-Dade County, where DeSantis won 55 percent of the vote, because of what it might suggest about the governor’s ability to engage with and message to Latino communities around the country. A GOP gubernatorial candidate hadn’t won the county in two decades. A CNN exit poll showed DeSantis with an 18-point lead over Crist among Florida Latino voters, a reversal from his first campaign for governor four years ago.\n\nWithin Florida, DeSantis allies are already huddling about what comes next. Even before Election Day, there was a strong sense among those in his orbit that DeSantis would likely launch a presidential campaign regardless of whether Trump did the same. Multiple sources told CNN that DeSantis in recent months has privately suggested to donors that Trump’s divisiveness is a hindrance to enacting conservative priorities, a marked shift in how the governor has discussed his former ally.\n\nAfter Tuesday, more Republicans have gone public in suggesting that the former president’s influence is dragging down the GOP. One source close to DeSantis’ political operation told CNN that he expected the governor to make a decision “soon after inauguration” in January, though he may not publicize it.\n\nDeSantis, the source added, “must take action” and capitalize on Trump’s midterms setback.\n\n“There’s no way to deny Donald Trump got fired Tuesday night,” Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a Republican who has been critical of Trump, told “CNN This Morning” on Thursday. “The search committee has brought a few names to the top of the list and Ron DeSantis is one of them. I think Ron DeSantis is being rewarded for a new thought process with Republicans and that solid leadership.”\n\nStill, the timing of a 2024 campaign launch, if it happens, remains up in the air. When reports first emerged that Trump intended to kickstart his presidential campaign in mid-November, those in DeSantis’ circle braced for the possibility of a quick turnaround from the midterm to a presidential primary showdown. Now, several consultants in Florida say DeSantis likely won’t formally jump into the presidential field until after state lawmakers meet for their annual legislative session. That would put DeSantis on a timeline of a May or June announcement.\n\n“Build anticipation,” one longtime Republican fundraiser with knowledge of DeSantis’ operation said. “I think DeSantis controls the time frame. As much as everyone anticipates things and you want to move quickly, he calls the shots now.”\n\nEven those with access to DeSantis caution that he has not come to a final decision about his future and they say he has maintained a tight circle as he weighs his options. The governor’s brain trust is notoriously small. It consists of himself and his wife, Casey. But sources said the DeSantises also are hyper aware that he has a window to make a 2024 move, and though it widened after Tuesday, it might not stay open forever.\n\n“You have a moment,” one GOP pollster told CNN before Election Day. “Something could come up in a second term that knocks him down.”\n\nThe intrigue surrounding a potential Trump-DeSantis showdown reached the White House on Wednesday. Asked which of the two Republican rivals would be the tougher 2024 competitor, President Joe Biden remarked, “It’d be fun watching them take on each other.”\n\nPlanning red meat for spring\n\nMultiple sources told CNN that DeSantis will orchestrate a legislative session full of conservative priorities that he can carry into a GOP presidential primary. Republicans won a super majority in both chambers of the Florida legislature Tuesday, allowing DeSantis to make good on promises to further restrict abortion and make it easier to carry a firearm in public.\n\nThe legislative session will be “as red meat as you can possibly imagine,” a GOP consultant said. “Whatever he proposes, they will pass it, and it will become law.”\n\nThe Republican fundraiser said that “anything ‘woke’ they can find to kill within their path, they’re going to do that” and predicted that financial institutions, in particular, would be a DeSantis target this spring.\n\nIn the meantime, DeSantis will continue to build out a political operation that has already proved it can raise money at an impressive clip. His reelection effort brought in more $200 million between his two political committees, according to state campaign finance reports, pulling money in from deep-pocketed donors and grassroots Republicans alike to shatter national fundraising records for a gubernatorial campaign. As of November 3, those committees had $66 million in unspent cash. CNN previously reported that DeSantis’ political team has explored how to transfer the unused money into a federal committee that could support a presidential campaign. That remains the plan, sources confirmed.\n\nHe is also expected to continue political travel outside the state to raise money and grow his brand. After avoiding public events outside Florida for most of his first term, DeSantis in August took the calculated gamble to hold rallies in support of Republican candidates in some of the country’s most contested races for governor and US Senate. He continued to travel up until 10 days before the election.\n\nHowever, DeSantis stuck largely to midterm battlegrounds and avoided early nominating states where appearances can set off presidential buzz. Stephen Stepanek, the chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, said DeSantis’ political operation turned down multiple requests to address voters there and the state GOP has had “virtually no contact with the governor.” Despite the hype around DeSantis, Stepanek predicted it will be difficult for the Florida governor to overcome Trump in the nation’s first primary in New Hampshire. Trump’s victory in the 2016 New Hampshire primary served as the launching point to him winning the GOP nomination.\n\n“People not only still have their 2020 signs out, but they have 2024 signs,” Stepanek said. “It’s still Trump country here in New Hampshire.”\n\n‘When people bring up DeSantis today, I bring up Scott Walker’\n\nDespite the tailwinds from Tuesday, DeSantis nevertheless faces an uphill climb to win over GOP primary voters whose loyalty to Trump has not wavered.\n\nAt home, Republicans are divided but seem to favor DeSantis. While 33% of Florida voters want to see Trump run again in 2024, 45% said DeSantis should take the plunge, according to the preliminary results of the Florida exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nJC Martin, the chairman of the Polk County Republican Party, said it would be a waste for DeSantis to go up against Trump because he “still has plenty of work to do in Florida and he’s a shoo-in for 2028.”\n\n“I’m not looking for an all-out party war in this next primary,” Martin said.\n\nBut Shawn Foster, a Republican state committeeman for Pasco County, said the GOP “needs a new face” and he hopes it is DeSantis.\n\n“I think the party needs it, and I think independents would look more for that,” Foster said.\n\nNationally, DeSantis must avoid the perception that he is peaking too soon, a pitfall for countless GOP stars who came before him.\n\n“When people bring up DeSantis today, I bring up Scott Walker,” Bob Vander Plaats, an influential conservative leader in the early nominating state of Iowa, told CNN earlier this year, drawing comparisons to the former Wisconsin governor who was an early favorite in 2016 before his campaign stalled.\n\nLike Walker, DeSantis’ agenda has won over conservative editorial boards and Beltway think tanks. He relishes confrontations with reporters, flaunting a brash style similar to the one that endeared New Jersey’s Chris Christie to many GOP voters. He has built a fundraising machine that rivals Florida’s Jeb Bush.\n\nThose past governors all acted on presidential ambitions; Trump crushed their dreams.\n\n“If in fact you go into a presidential primary with Donald Trump and think you’re going to kick his ass, you got another thing coming,” one Republican consultant in Florida told CNN.\n\nTrump publicly lashed out at DeSantis in the final days of the midterm cycle while privately stewing over the perceived disloyalty from a former political disciple. He nicknamed DeSantis “Ron DeSanctimonious” at an event Saturday in Pennsylvania and held a rally in Miami two days before the election without inviting the home-state governor.\n\nDeSantis declined to engage and instead held competing rallies on Florida’s opposite coast.\n\nIn an interview before Election Day, Trump warned against a challenge from DeSantis.\n\n“I don’t know if he is running. I think if he runs, he could hurt himself very badly,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News Digital. “I think he would be making a mistake. I think the base would not like it – I don’t think it would be good for the party…I would tell you things about him that won’t be very flattering.”\n\nTrump later downplayed Tuesday’s election results, noting he received “more votes” than DeSantis in Florida in 2020. Presidential races usually have much higher turnout than midterms and Trump’s margin of victory over Biden was about 3 points.\n\nIt will only grow more difficult for DeSantis to avoid talk of Trump and 2024 in the weeks ahead, though he may still try. On Wednesday morning, DeSantis, his voice hoarse from a demanding closing campaign schedule and election night celebrations, held a news conference to brief Floridians on Tropical Storm Nicole.\n\nDeSantis didn’t mention the election results. And he left without taking questions.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction.", "authors": ["Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/05/24/uvalde-amanda-gorman-desantis-florida-lgbtq/70250909007/", "title": "Uvalde, DeSantis 2024, abortion, Amanda Gorman, Vinicius Junior ...", "text": "Wednesday marks one year since the deadliest school shooting in Texas history.

Ron DeSantis hasn’t said much about his political future.\n\nHe hasn’t had to. Speculation is rampant that DeSantis is considering a presidential bid, using the momentum gained from his sweeping victory in Florida as a springboard for a national campaign.\n\nDonald Trump is paying attention, too.\n\n“I would tell you things about him that won’t be very flattering – I know more about him than anybody – other than, perhaps, his wife,” Trump said on Election Day.\n\nTrump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, echoed that sentiment on Monday. “I can tell you, those primaries get very messy and very raw,” she said. “So wouldn’t it be nicer for him, and I think he knows this, to wait until 2028?”\n\nWhile the Trump wing of the party wants DeSantis to wait until at least 2028 to launch a White House bid, there’s a simple reason why he shouldn’t – and it all comes down to timing.\n\nPolitics is all about timing. And history proves that.\n\nWhen Barack Obama announced that he would run for president less than two years after being elected to the Senate, skeptics were legion – insisting that he hadn’t put his time in to earn the right to run.\n\nThose skeptics didn’t go away. But Obama was entirely unhindered by the notion that he was too inexperienced for a national campaign and, in fact, it was something that appealed to some voters.\n\nObama understood that the timing was right, even though Hillary Clinton was the heavy favorite to win the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. Timing was everything.\n\nOn the flip side, think of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. He was heavily courted to run for president in 2012 as Republicans fretted that they didn’t have the right candidate who could beat Obama.\n\nChristie eventually decided against the race. “Now is not my time,” Christie said in October 2011. “I have a commitment to New Jersey that I simply will not abandon.”\n\nChristie did eventually run for president – in 2016. And it didn’t go well. He dropped out after a disastrous sixth-place finish in the New Hampshire primary. Then Christie endorsed Trump and spent the rest of the campaign subservient to him, tarnishing his image. Now Christie is trying to reinvent himself as someone willing to speak truth to Trump. But the damage is done.\n\nThe examples of Obama (on the positive end) and Christie (on the negative end) should guide DeSantis as he makes his decision. Four years is a very long time. Things change in politics. Who has momentum now may not have that same momentum in a year, much less four years.\n\nDeSantis is, at the moment, the hottest thing going in the Republican Party. To do anything other than run for president given that status – even if that means running against Trump – could well look like a massive mistake in two years’ time.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/politics/ron-desantis-campaign-finance-2024-election/index.html", "title": "Ron DeSantis and 2024: Could he use the more than $100 million ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFew people noticed when the Federal Election Commission deadlocked last month over whether US Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida in 2020 had broken a law intended to keep money raised for a state campaign out of federal elections.\n\nBut election lawyer Brett Kappel closely followed the case, and he immediately thought of one person who could benefit greatly from the outcome: Ron DeSantis.\n\nThe Florida governor is shattering national fundraising records as he seeks a second term, attracting gobs of money from Republican donors eyeing DeSantis as a potential presidential candidate in 2024. At the end of May, DeSantis was sitting on $111 million – more money than any candidate has ever needed to win an election in the Sunshine State. More donations come in almost every day.\n\nKappel believes that the FEC’s inaction against Donalds could give DeSantis a blueprint for how to raise money for a prospective presidential campaign while still running for governor.\n\n“Every time the FEC deadlocks on one of these innovative financial structures, it’s a big neon sign saying, ‘Do this! You can get away with it!’” Kappel said.\n\nPublicly, DeSantis has dismissed questions about his future political ambitions. “Nice try,” DeSantis recently told “Fox & Friends” when asked if he would mount a campaign against former President Donald Trump.\n\nBut the governor’s political team has already identified ways to turn the massive war chest DeSantis has raised for his reelection race into money that could be spent in a federal campaign, a source with knowledge of those conversations told CNN.\n\n“It can be done,” the source said.\n\nAs momentum builds for DeSantis to run for president as soon as next year, he is collecting donations from every corner of the Republican Party, from the wealthiest donors to everyday watchers of Fox News in each state. He has received millions in donations from Trump’s biggest financiers, such as Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus, powerhouse Republican backers Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein, and retired venture capitalist William Buckley, but also from megadonors who have never financially supported Trump, such as Ken Griffin, the billionaire who recently announced he was moving his investment firm Citadel from Chicago to Miami.\n\nAn individual involved in Republican fundraising in Florida said the expectation is DeSantis will raise about $200 million this cycle, and he will need less than half of it for his reelection campaign. That will leave DeSantis with at least $100 million in seed money for a super PAC to support a White House bid, giving him a financial head start that at the moment is only rivaled by Trump’s own fundraising machine. Trump’s Save America PAC had $106 million in its coffers as of May.\n\n“I think that’s totally the plan,” the individual said. “It would be ludicrous of anyone to try to dissuade you that it’s not what’s happening.”\n\nDeSantis’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n‘DeSantis will be able to do what he wants’\n\nUnlike donations to a candidate’s campaign, there are no caps on contributions to super PACs. As it is, super PACs have become a key cog in the election efforts of most serious presidential contenders. There are still some limitations on super PACs (for example, they can’t raise money from federal contractors or foreign nationals), but the laws are tested and stretched each election cycle.\n\nOn paper, the law discourages candidates from turning money raised for a state race from supporting a federal campaign. But the FEC, divided between three Republican commissioners and three Democrats, hasn’t demonstrated an appetite for pursuing complaints against super PACs that violate the spirit of that law, said Daniel Weiner, a former lawyer for an FEC commissioner and now at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\n“A lot of this falls into the gray area, and the rules are only as strong as the people enforcing them,” Weiner said. “For the last decade plus, enforcement has been pretty weak. … As long as he does not blatantly violate the law, DeSantis will be able to do what he wants.”\n\nThe particulars of Donalds’ case before the FEC are strikingly similar to the situation DeSantis could find himself in next year.\n\nIn Florida, candidates often choose to fundraise through state-registered political committees. Much like super PACs, there are no limits to how much a state political committee can receive from any single entity, be it a person, corporation or dark money group.\n\nIn 2019, Donalds formed a state political committee called Friends of Byron Donalds and started raising money. Early in 2020, Donalds resigned as chairman of the committee and three days later filed to run for an open US House seat in southwest Florida.\n\nAround that time, a super PAC called Trusted Conservatives registered with the FEC. When Friends of Byron Donalds closed its doors in June 2020, it sent its remaining reserves, about $107,000, to Trusted Conservatives. For the next three months, Trusted Conservatives spent most of that money on ads supporting Donalds or tearing into his Republican primary challengers. Donalds ultimately won the race by just 777 votes and was elected to Congress that November.\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center, an election watchdog, filed a complaint arguing federal committees could not spend money raised for state races. The arrangement also seemed to violate federal rules that prohibit coordination between a super PAC and a candidate, the organization said. The FEC’s general counsel agreed and recommended action. Donalds’ legal team argued that he had left the political committee months before it disbanded and that he was not involved in directing the money to Trusted Conservatives.\n\nThe FEC split 3-3, and the case was closed.\n\nLike Donalds, DeSantis operates a state-registered political committee called Friends of Ron DeSantis. It has raised $115 million this campaign cycle.\n\nSaurav Ghosh, who spent seven years in the FEC’s Office of General Counsel, previously thought it would have been “really brazen” for DeSantis to build a super PAC with money collected by his political committee.\n\n“But in view of the Donalds (case), I think certain FEC commissioners have left open a major loophole for that to happen,” said Ghosh, who is now a director at the Campaign Legal Center.\n\nThe Republican FEC commissioners did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDeSantis’ political team includes Phil Cox, a veteran political operative who ran the super PAC supporting former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s bid for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016. DeSantis’ campaign, his political committee and the Republican Party of Florida have also combined to spend $21,000 in the past eight months at Dickinson Wright, a Washington, DC, law firm that specializes in advising super PACs.\n\n“DeSantis has built a team that knows how to do this,” the individual involved in Republican fundraising in Florida said.\n\nA super PAC named Ready for Ron launched earlier this year to encourage DeSantis to run for president. The committee, formed by longtime Republican consultant Ed Rollins, is unaffiliated with DeSantis, but it is already airing ads on Fox News.\n\n“The most important thing for a presidential candidate is who is running your campaign, but the second-most important issue is who is going to run the super PAC in a legally competent manner,” said Scott Reed, the former top strategist for the US Chamber of Commerce. “DeSantis being up this cycle allows him to do a dry run on fundraising. And he’s been wildly successful.”\n\nMillions coming in, little out the door\n\nFueling speculation that Desantis is raising money for two campaigns at the same time is the reality on the ground in Florida: He is building an unprecedented cash advantage and so far hasn’t tapped into it much.\n\nDeSantis has brought in more money than any gubernatorial candidate in US history that wasn’t self-funded, CNN first reported earlier this year, a record that grows each month when fundraising totals are updated. Since the start of June, his political committee has collected hundreds of donations, ranging from $1 to six figures, including $400,000 from the facility management company Florida Care, Inc.; $200,000 from former Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner; and $100,000 from New Jersey investment company The Portopiccolo Group.\n\nThe $130 million his campaign has accumulated in the past four years far exceeds the $90 million that his predecessor, then-Gov. Rick Scott, spent to win reelection in 2014, a record at the time.\n\nScott, though, was one of the country’s least popular governors by the end of his first term and was a primary target of national Democrats, who still saw Florida as a tossup state. Scott needed every dollar he raised plus $18 million of his own money to narrowly win a second term against Charlie Crist, the Democratic nominee.\n\nDeSantis, meanwhile, is the heavy favorite in his bid for another four years in office. National Democrats so far have focused their energy and resources on governor’s races in other states such as Georgia, Pennsylvania and New Mexico. No Democratic entity has so far reserved space on Florida’s airwaves. DeSantis won’t know who is opponent is until after the Democratic primary in late August, and neither challenger, Crist or state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, have come close to matching DeSantis’ fundraising.\n\nAt this point in 2014, Scott had already racked up more than $18 million in expenses. DeSantis has spent $7 million this year between his campaign and political committee. He has purchased a modest $1.8 million of commercial time for the fall, but has mostly relied on the free exposure he receives from local and national news outlets and conservative media organizations that often promote his agenda and brand. “Fox & Friends” recently featured the “Top Gun”-inspired campaign merchandise the DeSantis campaign is selling on its website.\n\nIt remains possible that by November, DeSantis will have used more money than expected. The source close to his political team said DeSantis wants “a big, blowout election win,”which could be costly to achieve.\n\nThe source added that DeSantis has not committed to challenging Trump in a GOP presidential primary. CNN previously reported that the former President has considered announcing his intention to run again from Florida as soon as October, in part to preempt DeSantis and bigfoot his former protege.\n\n“We’ve heard all of that,” the source said. “It does not change our deliberations.”\n\nReed said many donors want to “turn the chapter on Trump” and are placing their early bets on DeSantis as the GOP’s best chance in 2024.\n\n“It’s clear that DeSantis is building a national finance organization, with great success,” Reed said. “Your two best friends in politics are money and message, and he’s positioning himself to be in pole position when the gun goes off.”", "authors": ["Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}]}

But engineers suspended the operation last week to assess why the building had sunk another inch during construction, NBC Bay Area News reported.\n\nThe tower, which opened in 2009, had been tilting slightly more than 17 inches at the top at the time work began and sinking had slowed. But by mid-August, the building's foundation had sunk another inch since the upgrade work had started and the tilting had increased 5 inches, NBC Bay Area News reported.\n\nWork is on hold for two to four weeks as builders and engineers attempt to understand the \"increased settlement rate and available means of mitigating this,\" Millennium Tower Association spokesman Doug Elmets said in a statement.\n\nThe work stoppage was done out of an \"abundance of caution,\" the association told residents, the TV station reported. “There has been no material harm to the building … and it remains fully safe,\" the station reported the association as saying.\n\nThe building is settling and tilting more because of the ongoing construction including some holes drilled slightly larger than planned, according to documents NBC Bay Area acquired.\n\nThe Millennium Tower quickly sold out its 419 apartments upon its opening, with big-name buyers including former San Francisco 49er Joe Montana, late venture capitalist Tom Perkins and Giants outfielder Hunter Pence.\n\nBut by 2016, the building had sunk 16 inches into the soft soil and landfill of San Francisco’s dense financial district.

That includes potentially providing the Ukrainian Army with additional ammunition, mortars, Javelin anti-tank missiles, and anti-aircraft missile systems, which would likely come from NATO allies, a senior US official told CNN.\n\nThe news comes ahead of a face to face meeting between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday. A senior State Department official said the scheduled meeting “suggests that perhaps diplomacy is not dead.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden has said that sending US combat troops to Ukraine to fight a war with Russia is off the table. But special operations forces already rotate in and out of the country to provide training to Ukrainian forces and a senior administration official said it is possible that other agencies could provide some support, likely the CIA. CIA Director Bill Burns traveled to Kyiv last week to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and discuss risks to Ukraine, a US official said.\n\n“We are looking at a range of options to help defend Ukraine,” a senior administration official told CNN. This may include additional defensive arms sales, “advice,” and “helping Ukraine be able to stay in the fight against a larger, conventional Russian military presence.”\n\nThe deliberations about supporting a resistance campaign reflect an increasingly pessimistic view inside the administration about Putin’s willingness to invade and occupy large swaths of Ukrainian territory. Russia has increased force levels since Friday, the senior administration official said.\n\n“Let’s be clear. Our view is this is an extremely dangerous situation. We’re now at a stage where Russia could at any point launch an attack in Ukraine,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday. “And what Secretary Blinken is going to go do is highlight very clearly there’s a diplomatic path forward. It is the choice of President Putin and the Russians to make whether they’re going to suffer severe economic consequences or not.”\n\nRight now, military sources familiar with the planning say there has been no official change in guidance from Washington, and officials emphasized that these are early considerations that have not yet been formally presented to the President for approval. Some members of the administration are wary of getting bogged down in an anti-occupation support effort and have argued that US forces should leave if a war erupts.\n\nIncreased pessimism\n\nUS officials left the meetings in Europe last week even more pessimistic about what Putin could be planning, and how limited the west’s leverage is to stop it—even with the punishing sanctions and increased NATO presence in eastern Europe currently on the table.\n\n“We can exact some pain, but there is a big difference between exacting pain and actually having leverage,” a senior US official said.\n\nAs recently as late last week, Biden administration officials were conducting table-top exercises gaming out all of the possible US and allied policy responses, sources familiar with the planning told CNN. Top US officials also spent much of the weekend in senior-level meetings to discuss the way forward, a senior State Department official said.\n\nThe US has continued to say that diplomacy is “crucial” and that talks will hopefully continue. But there have been no details on what the next diplomatic steps look like, and Russia has been drawing down its diplomatic presence in Kyiv in what a US official said was ominous and concerning to the US. Russia’s foreign ministry denied on Tuesday that it had begun evacuating diplomatic personnel, saying “The Russian embassy in Kyiv is operating in a standard way.”\n\nPentagon officials, meanwhile, have been drawing up options for how the US could help to fuel a sustained resistance campaign in Ukraine and inflict the highest possible costs on Russia in the wake of any invasion, according to sources familiar with the conversations.\n\nThe CIA continues to operate an intelligence collection training program in the US for Ukrainian special operators and intelligence officials, current and former officials familiar with the program tell CNN. The program was first reported by Yahoo News.\n\nA CIA spokesman pushed back on any suggestion that the program has helped to train a Ukrainian insurgency in waiting, but former intelligence officials familiar with it say that the program includes the kind of covert paramilitary training needed to collect intelligence in a warzone.\n\n“The purpose of the training, and the training that was delivered, was to assist in the collection of intelligence, not to assist in an insurgency,” a senior intelligence official said.\n\nPutin’s plans still unclear\n\nUS officials still don’t know what Putin’s plans are, or whether he has even made up his mind to invade. Some officials who have seen the intelligence say there is evidence Russia is planning to try to take Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and overthrow the government. The deployment of forces from Russia’s Eastern Military District into Belarus on Monday struck many US officials and Russian military analysts as particularly ominous, as have a spate of cyberattacks targeting Ukraine last week.\n\nBut others believe it is more likely that Russia will launch a more limited operation in eastern Ukraine aimed at securing a land bridge to Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. The US on Friday accused Russia of prepositioning a group of operatives in eastern Ukraine to conduct a false-flag operation, accusing Ukraine of provocations and using it to justify an invasion.\n\nLike within the Biden administration, Ukrainian officials have not concluded that Putin has made up his mind, a Ukrainian official said, adding that the talks in Europe had no perceptible impact on the crisis. Meanwhile, the buildup of Russian troops along Ukraine’s borders – and in neighboring Belarus – has continued to grow.\n\n“We see that it’s not de-escalating, it’s ongoing,” the official said. “Still not enough to do a full-scale invasion and sustain it but it’s still a lot.”\n\nAs part of the build-up, Russia has deployed more aircraft closer to the border, which has raised fears of a significant air component to an eventual invasion. Two to three dozen Sukhov-34 fighter jets have joined helicopters positioned near Ukraine, the official said.\n\nUkrainian defense officials are in daily contact with US counterparts at the Pentagon, the official said, preparing for a variety of different actions the Russians could take.\n\n“We prepared a response for each scenario,” the official said. “We are going to fight if something happens. Our people are ready to fight. Every window will shoot if [Russians] go [in].”\n\n“Everyone who is willing to fight will do so and will receive a weapon for this, like in 2014,” the official continued, adding that individual “reservists” who have received some training will simply have to sign up at a recruiting office. Asked where the weapons for those reservists will come from, the official said they would come from the NATO-supported Ukrainian stockpiles. “Material support from partners will go to them as well,” he said.", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand Jim Sciutto Katie Bo Williams Barbara Starr Alex Marquardt", "Natasha Bertrand", "Jim Sciutto", "Katie Bo Williams", "Barbara Starr", "Alex Marquardt"], "publish_date": "2022/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/us/961011/daniel-penny-subway-killing-of-jordan-neely-opens-new-front-in-culture", "title": "Daniel Penny and Jordan Neely: a new front in US culture war | The ...", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

Free Press\n\nTo some, the results of a study that concludes the District of Columbia is sinking is a physical manifestation of the political environment in the nation's capital.\n\nBut new research from the U.S. Geological Survey and the University of Vermont shows that the land in the district — where the Lincoln Memorial was built on silt dredged from the Potomac River — is expected to fall 6 inches or more during the next 100 years, raising flood fears and adding to worries about the effect of rising sea levels on low-lying cities across the USA.\n\n\"It's ironic that the nation's capital, the place least responsive to the dangers of climate change, is sitting in one of the worst spots it could be,\" Paul Bierman, a geologist at the University of Vermont in Burlington and senior author of a new paper about Washington's descent, said in a statement. \"Will the Congress just sit there with their feet getting ever wetter?\"\n\nThe scientists made no attempt to predict that.\n\n\"This falling land will exacerbate the flooding that the nation's capital faces from rising ocean waters due to a warming climate and melting ice sheets — accelerating the threat to the region's monuments, roads, wildlife refuges and military installations,\" University of Vermont researchers said in releasing the findings Tuesday. The paper was published online this week in the journal GSA Today.\n\nWashington was founded July 16, 1790, near the confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia rivers. Although long-told tales of the region say the city named after George Washington was built on a swamp, the story is little more than urban legend, according to a 2014 essay by city historian Don Hawkins in The Washington Post.\n\nBut the study indicates that Washington is likely to become a lot wetter by 2100.\n\nStudy results confirm a long-held hypothesis, said Ben DeJong, the report's lead author. He researched land and sea around the Chesapeake Bay while a doctoral student at the University of Vermont with support from the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nTide gauges in the Chesapeake Bay have shown for 60 years that sea level \"is rising at twice the global average rate and faster than elsewhere on the East Coast.\" The hypothesis: Land in the Chesapeake region that had been pushed up by the weight of a prehistoric ice sheet has been settling down again since the ice sheet melted some 20,000 years ago.\n\nTo prove the theory, scientists drilled extensively in Maryland's coastal plain — 70 boreholes, some as deep as 100 feet, in and around the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge on the Chesapeake Bay's eastern shore.\n\nThen DeJong and the research team \"examined layers of sediment in these deep cores, using a suite of techniques to calculate the age of the sand, other rocks, and organic matter in each layer,\" the University of Vermont said.\n\nFinally, geologists combined the data with maps to create detailed, three-dimensional portraits of the Chesapeake Bay region during periods that stretched back several million years. The data overall convinced the scientists their model is bullet proof.\n\nThe sinking, known as subsidence, is just beginning geologically speaking and \"will last for millennia,\" the university said.\n\nA sinking capital on a river that is influenced by the tides could be problematic enough, but climate change adds to the concerns. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts a rise in global sea level of 1 to 3 feet by 2100 because of global warming, the University of Vermont noted.\n\nSoutheastern Virginia, especially around Norfolk and Hampton where the federal government has naval and Air Force bases, has one of the highest rates of relative sea-level rise on the Atlantic Coast precisely because of the combination of subsidence and sea-level rise, U.S. Geological Survey scientists said have said previously.\n\n\"Right now is the time to start making preparations,\" DeJong said. \"Six extra inches of water really matters in this part of the world.\"\n\nParticipating in the study were scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, the University of Vermont, Utah State University, Berkeley Geochronology Center in California and Imperial College in London.\n\nCities most at risk\n\nA 2013 World Bank study says five of the top 10 cities worldwide at greatest monetary risk of storm damage from rising sea levels and subsidence are on the East Coast and don't include Washington.\n\n1.

Last week, that “nightmare” played out in horrifying fashion when a gunman set off smoke bombs and opened fire on a rush-hour train in Brooklyn, injuring 23 people and “sending a shudder of terror into the hearts of millions of New Yorkers”. Frank James, a 62-year-old with a history of crime, mental illness and interest in racial conspiracy theories, was later arrested.\n\nThe city’s mayor, Eric Adams, promised to introduce “new technology” to help make subways safer. What the new tech would be, he didn’t say; but it’s hard to have much faith when officials admitted that even the basic CCTV cameras in the station had failed to work properly. “The truth is that in a country increasingly saturated by guns”, there’s practically “nothing we can do to stop this sort of attack”.\n\nThe attack shocked New Yorkers partly because it symbolised a “steep decline in law and order” in the city, said The Wall Street Journal. There seems to be “a lack of political will” to keep criminals and the mentally ill off the streets. It was just the latest high-profile crime on the subway, said David A. Graham in The Atlantic. In January, a woman died after being pushed in front of a train, and a man was killed when he jumped on to the tracks to help the victim of a gang assault. Last year there was “a spate of stabbings”.\n\nIn absolute terms, the crime rate is “still very low”, but it’s rising, as is violent crime across the US. It revives memories of the 1980s, when subways were viewed as “hellscapes”. The danger is that they go into “a death spiral, where fear of crime begets low rider­ship, which in turn begets more crime”.\n\nThis is the last thing New York needs as it struggles to recover from Covid, said Michael Goodwin in the New York Post. The growth of remote working is already taking a toll. A recent study found that the average office worker would spend $6,730 near the office this year, compared to $13,700 pre-pandemic. New York’s unemployment rate is 6.5%, nearly double the national rate of 3.6%. Mayor Adams, a former cop, won office this year on a promise to get tough on crime. Can he and the NYPD “work together to save Gotham”? With summer – the worst time for crime – approaching, “we’re about to find out”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2022/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/asia-pacific/957290/shinzo-abe-shooting-how-common-is-gun-crime-in-japan", "title": "Shinzo Abe shooting: how common is gun crime in Japan? | The ...", "text": "Japan’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe has died after being shot while campaigning in the southern city of Nara. He was airlifted to hospital in a critical condition but died soon afterwards from his injuries.\n\nPrime minister Fumio Kishida described the attack on the 67-year-old Abe – who was Japan’s longest-serving PM – as “barbaric and malicious”, a sentiment that has been echoed by world leaders who have expressed their shock at the incident. Abe’s brother, the current defence minister Nobuo Kishi, described the shooting as a sacrilege against democracy.\n\nA 41-year-old male suspect was arrested at the scene and is now in police custody. He is thought to be Tetsuya Yamagami and a resident of the city, with no known occupation. Images from the scene suggest that the assailant used an improvised or homemade weapon.\n\nExtremely low gun crime rate\n\nThe murder of “one of Japan’s most influential modern leaders” – as the Financial Times described Abe – has sent shockwaves across the country, which has one of the lowest rates of gun crime in the world.\n\nLast year, there were just ten instances of shooting in the island nation of more than 125.5 million people, according to the National Police Agency.\n\nA major factor behind this is the country’s extremely strict gun control laws. Handguns are outlawed and the only guns permitted for sale are shotguns and air rifles that require “strenuous effort – and lots of patience” to get hold of, said CNN.\n\nTo buy a gun in Japan, “potential buyers must attend an all-day class, pass a written test and a shooting-range test with an accuracy of at least 95%”, added the US news site. On top of this, they must undergo extensive mental health, drug and background checks, the latter “including a review of their criminal record, personal debt, involvement in organised crime and relationships with family and friends”.\n\nFew gun-owning civilians\n\nThe result is that the level of gun ownership among Japanese civilians is one of the world’s lowest. According to Bloomberg and GunPolicy.org, the estimated total number of guns held by civilians in Japan was 310,400 in 2019, or 0.25 per 100 people – “the lowest level among the G-7 countries”.", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson"], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/09/08/gander-newfoundland-september-11-terror-attacks-kindess-come-from-away/631329001/", "title": "On 9/11, how Gander, Newfoundland, welcomed 6,700 strangers", "text": "GANDER, Newfoundland — They still don't know what all the fuss is about.\n\nSixteen years ago, this small Canadian town on an island in the North Atlantic Ocean took in nearly 6,700 people – almost doubling its population – when the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in New York and Washington forced 38 planes to land here.\n\nTheir simple hospitality to the unexpected house guests drew worldwide accolades and even inspired a Broadway musical.\n\n“Everyone looks at us and says that’s an amazing thing that you did, and the bottom line is I don’t think it was an amazing thing, I think it was the right thing you do,” says Diane Davis, 53, a now-retired teacher who helped 750 people housed at the town's elementary school.\n\nIn a world today seemingly fraught with division, terrorism and hate, they’d do it all over again. Kindness is woven into the very fabric of their nature — they don’t know any other way to live.\n\n“What we consider the most simple thing in life is to help people,” says Mayor Claude Elliott, who retires this month after serving as the town’s leader for 21 years. “You’re not supposed to look at people’s color, their religion, their sexual orientation — you look at them as people.”\n\nTo give you a glimpse of life here, start with this: Many Ganderites don’t lock the doors to their homes or cars. Everyone says hello to everyone. People know their neighbors. “My love” or “my dear” adorn every other sentence — except the Newfie accent makes the “my” sound like “me.”\n\nStill, there’s a wariness here: Not for the town itself, nor its future, nor the anchor of civility it represents. Instead, there’s a concern for the rest of the world, especially the U.S., as it faces terrorism, rogue nations and violent protests in the streets.\n\n“I'm scared at the way we're going and what the world will look like in 10 years,” says Elliott, 67. “If we keep on going, we’re going to set our world back 100 years.”\n\nA sinking feeling\n\nWhen Garry Tuff, then acting manager of safety and security for emergency response services at Gander International Airport, saw the second plane hit the World Trade Center, he knew his town of 10,000 people would be impacted. The airport here marks the closest point between Europe and the U.S. and is a preferred emergency landing spot for medical and other emergencies.\n\nThe 38 planes came “fast and furious” into the airport a short while later.\n\nAfter figuring out how to park all the planes, some of which later started sinking into the pavement because of their weight and the warm temperatures, officials spent the next 24 hours unloading luggage and people. Passengers faced intense scrutiny as they passed through customs. “Everybody was a suspect,” says Des Dillon, 75, then the manager of the Canadian Red Cross in Gander.\n\nBut everyone was a guest, too. Beyond the basics of food and water, some passengers on board needed medicine. Many left prescriptions in checked, inaccessible luggage. Pharmacists in town worked around the clock, calling dozens of countries to fill prescriptions.\n\nThen, there were the smokers on board, unable to get a fix for hours. “We bought every bit of nicotine gum that was in town,” Tuff says.\n\nWelcome to Gander, casserole city\n\nTo say this town of 10,000 people and its surrounding communities welcomed the passengers and crew from nearly 100 countries with open arms is an understatement. The town all but shut down for the “plane people,” inspiring the Tony-award winning Broadway musical Come From Away.\n\n“We did not know how we would be affected, if these people were staying, if the people who were coming were good people or not so good people,” says Linda Sweetapple, 54, business manager and partner at Sweetapple Accounting Group. “We just knew that we had to make room for them and take care of them. They were here, and they needed our help.”\n\nAs the planes, still packed with passengers, sat for hours at the airport, the town bustled with activity. Volunteers readied makeshift shelters — every school, gym, community center, church and camp, any place that could fit a planeload of people. Gander’s 500 hotel rooms were reserved for pilots and flight crews.\n\nBus drivers in the middle of a nasty strike laid down picket signs. Donations of toiletries, clothes, toys, towels, toothbrushes, pillows, blankets and bedding piled up. For security reasons, passengers weren’t allowed to take checked bags.\n\nGander residents began cooking — a lot. Grocery store shelves went bare. The Walmart ran out of nearly everything — underwear was a particularly hot commodity — and the local hockey rink transformed into the world’s largest refrigerator.\n\n“It was like casserole city,” says Reg Wright, 43, president and CEO of Gander International Airport.\n\n‘Poster child for hospitality’\n\nStuck on planes for up to 31 hours since taking off from Europe and in the age before smartphones and social media, many passengers didn’t know exactly what caused their diversion to this tiny Canadian province. Those who did still couldn’t fathom the terror attacks in the U.S. without seeing them.\n\nWhen passengers finally saw the destruction, Gander Police Constable Oz Fudge, 62, remembers the gasps.\n\n“You hear this ‘huh’ when the plane hit the towers,” says Fudge, the town’s police constable. “That sound I hear all the time, of the shock that’s on their faces as they’re standing there looking at this TV and the look of loss on their faces.\n\n\"I’ll live with that for the rest of my life.\"\n\nThe outpouring of kindness in the town only multiplied over the next five days. Gander residents took passengers sightseeing, moose hunting, berry picking and barbecuing. They entertained with music, stopped anyone walking down the street in case they wanted a ride and brought strangers into their homes for showers or even as guests for a few nights. They refused to accept money, though passengers later donated thousands to the town.\n\n“They couldn’t comprehend what we were doing,” says Dave Blundon, 67, who took in one of the families. “The way they looked at you — they almost wanted to touch you to make sure you’re real.”\n\nRobert Steuber, 55, stranded with his wife and elderly father-in-law after their Paris to St. Louis jet diverted, never felt like an outsider.\n\n“That whole community is the poster child for how hospitality and just a sheer act of humanity should be because they had such a high level of open arms, and come in and welcome and here’s my house,” says Steuber, whose St. Louis family eventually ended up with the Blundons. “It just absolutely floored me.”\n\nThe 'come from aways'\n\nIsrael, Austria, Spain, Poland, France, the Philippines, Iran, Italy, England, Germany, Thailand, Belgium, Ukraine, Africa, Hungary, Uganda, Senegal, Russia, United Arab Emirates and just about every state in the USA. The “come from aways,” as Newfoundlanders call anyone not from the island, were from all over the world, and despite the intense situation, no one in Gander batted an eye — prejudice against anyone is an entirely foreign concept here.\n\nToday, the crosswalk in front of Gander’s town hall is painted as a rainbow, and churches raised thousands of Canadian dollars to welcome four Syrian refugee families into the community, with a fifth scheduled to arrive next year. Many here don’t understand the division and hate in other parts of the world.\n\n“One thing this world is lacking today is common sense, that’s going out the door. We have to set more of an example and show the world we can all live in harmony regardless of what we are,” Elliott, the mayor, says.\n\nThat lesson wove its way into and changed Kevin Tuerff’s life. Sixteen years after his Air France flight from Paris to New York diverted to Gander, Tuerff, 51, is a character in the musical, author of the book Channel of Peace: Stranded in Gander on 9/11 and the force behind a Pay It Forward 9/11 movement that urges everyone to perform acts of kindness each year.\n\nGander is like a second home to him. “They are a shining beacon for how America once was kind to strangers, immigrants and refugees, and we need to get back that way,” he says.\n\nYet, over and over again, residents here say what happened in Gander isn’t unique, that anyone would lend a hand in a crisis, even pointing to residents in Texas and around the U.S. who helped during Hurricane Harvey.\n\n“No matter where you go people are good. I truly believe that in my heart. There’s 1% arseholes everywhere and if this happened where you live, you would help,” says Karen Mills, 54, manager of the Comfort Inn in Gander. “But Newfoundlanders, we’re a different breed in a lot of ways.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/08"}]}

Sign up here.\n\nBoston CNN —\n\nThis week’s newsletter is coming out a little later than normal – but for a good reason. We wanted to bring readers along to the grand finale of the Prince and Princess of Wales’ US visit – the Earthshot Prize Award ceremony.\n\nThe star-studded ceremony concluded on Friday evening in Boston, capping a challenging couple days for Prince William and Catherine.\n\nTheir first overseas visit in their new roles should have been an opportunity to showcase the modern monarchy and highlight the work the family does. But no sooner had they landed in America, than controversy blew up at home.\n\nThe timing couldn’t have been worse as allegations of racism emerged from within palace walls; a royal aide resigned and apologized over complaints that she had repeatedly asked a Black charity executive where she was “really from” during a reception hosted by the Queen Consort.\n\nBuckingham Palace was quick to act as the scandal erupted and a spokesman for the Prince of Wales was forthright in condemning the incident during a press briefing around the visit in Boston.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales arrive for the second annual Earthshot Prize Awards Ceremony at the MGM Music Hall at Fenway, in Boston, Massachusetts. Kirsty O'Connor/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nStill, the first major controversy to grip the newly reorganized institution immediately overshadowed a visit that has been months in the making and dragged the royal family back into a debate from which it had sought to distance itself.\n\nMany still vividly remember the comments the Duchess of Sussex made last year to Oprah Winfrey of her own experience of racism within the household.\n\nBehind closed doors, the royals will be devastated that the issue of institutionalized racism has reared again. In recent years, the family has been trying to show how they are evolving the monarchy to reflect a more modern Britain and bolster diversity and inclusivity.\n\nWhatever the senior royals may have been feeling privately, William and Kate embodied the British spirit of keeping calm and carrying on – even in the face of disastrously wet weather and traffic congestion – as they kicked off their trip with a special welcome and lighting ceremony for the climate prize on Wednesday. That first event saw further setbacks after two of the attendees – US Ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy and US climate envoy John Kerry – were unable to join at the last minute.\n\nRefusing to be distracted from their goal of bringing the Earthshot Prize to the hometown of the man whose words inspired William to launch it – President John F. Kennedy – the second day of the trip saw the couple visit environmental tech entrepreneurs and a non-profit supporting disadvantaged young people at risk of urban violence.\n\nWoman at center of Buckingham Palace controversy speaks out 05:10 - Source: CNN\n\nBut then, another unexpected development: a trailer for the Duke and Duchess of Sussexes’ Netflix docu-series dropped online out of the blue. No one had expected it and, once more, conversation was sidetracked from the tour.\n\nThere would have been a huge amount of frustration among William’s team that attention was once again being diverted elsewhere. It’s an unwritten rule that working royals don’t distract from one another’s trips. Prince Harry isn’t a working royal any longer and doesn’t need to abide by those rules, though we don’t know if he had any say over the streaming giant’s PR push.\n\nFriday saw some semblance of royal trip normality return as the pair embarked on solo engagements: Kate visiting the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University while William headed to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. It was there he also met US President Biden, who was in Massachusetts Friday for a fundraising event.\n\nDuring their half-hour catch-up, which Kensington Palace described as “friendly and substantive,” the two men shared “warm memories” of the late Queen Elizabeth II. The president was said to be interested in learning about some of the Earthshot Prize finalists and William “shared his global, long-term ambition for the prize.” The prince also used the moment to thank Biden for traveling to the United Kingdom in September for the late Queen’s funeral service.\n\nThen the main event was upon us – the Earthshot Prize awards. As has been the case all trip, excited royal well-wishers turned out en masse. For the last three days, substantial crowds have gathered at engagements to warmly welcome the couple, several holding hand-made posters and bouquets of flowers for the pair. Many told us seeing the new Princess of Wales was a particular draw in deciding to brave the brisk temperatures.\n\nWilliam and Kate greet well-wishers after visiting Roca Inc, an organization working to reduce urban violence through community engagement efforts, in Chelsea, Massachusetts. Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnd they didn’t seem disappointed – ear-splitting screams erupted at the sight of William and Kate on the recycled green carpet at the MGM Music Hall at Fenway. Eagle-eyed fans noticed quickly that the princess was wearing a necklace owned by the predecessor of her new title, Diana.\n\nIt was a star-studded occasion with the likes of Oscar winner Rami Malek, actress Shailene Woodley and Catherine O’Hara of “Schitt’s Creek” fame on hand to present some of the awards. The show also featured musical performances from Annie Lennox, siblings Chloe x Halle and Ellie Goulding.\n\nChatting with CNN on the carpet before the event, Malek commended William for carving out his role as the new royal champion of the environment.\n\n“It’s extraordinarily inspiring. He is finding answers and the £1 million that are given to these five people, these five organizations, is something that keeps us from looking at the gloom and doom and the pessimism of it all, and looking toward the future of what we can come to do because when we put our ideas together, we can do extraordinary things,” said the 41-year-old “Bohemian Rhapsody” star.\n\nHe said he loved that William was inspired by former President John F. Kennedy and his challenge in the early 1960s to push Americans to accomplish greatness. “I think that’s exactly what’s happening here. We can push ourselves collectively to come up with extraordinary ideas, to do extraordinary things so we get to make sure that we enjoy this extraordinary world,” he continued, adding that he was “proud” to have been called upon to help.\n\nThe royal couple chat with actor Rami Malek at The Earthshot Prize Awards on Friday. David L. Ryan/Pool/The Boston Globe/AP\n\nMeanwhile, Lennox said she was keen to lend her support to William’s initiative for future generations. “It looks like a very almost glamorous event, but the situation is deadly serious and it needs to be taken far more seriously,” she told CNN. “It encourages me to see that the prince and princess have taken action on this.”\n\nShe shared that she had met with the couple the evening before, and described all the “distractions” of the week as “put aside” as they focused on their climate work.\n\nShe continued: “I think it’s very important that they actually play a significant role. A role that people can identify with truly, not just in a symbolic sense.”\n\nRoyal visits tend to come with their own challenges – and this trip perhaps a few more than anticipated. But the attention also meant everyone was watching the couple’s every move, asking why they were in America in the first place, and learning about Earthshot along the way.\n\nHERE ARE THE WINNERS OF THE 2022 EARTHSHOT PRIZE\n\nThe Earthshot Prize was created to try to find solutions to help us, in William’s words, “overcome our planet’s greatest challenges.” The competition is based around five “Earthshots” or environmental goals: “Protect and Restore Nature,” “Clean Our Air,” “Revive Our Oceans,” “Build a Waste Free World,” and “Fix Our Climate.” After a rigorous selection process, the five 2022 winners have finally been announced. Let’s meet the chosen few:\n\nClean Our Air: Mukuru Clean Stoves, Kenya.\n\nSometimes the best solutions are the most quotidian. This start-up provides cleaner-burning stoves to women in Kenya, aiming to prevent them having to cook on open fires and cookstoves, which can fill homes with toxic chemicals and endanger families’ health. This company was founded by women aiming to put a stop to these avoidable deaths.\n\nProtest and Restore Nature: Khetyi, India.\n\nWith each year, India is being forced to adapt to life on the front line of climate change, as severe heat waves and pests devastate certain crops. But there may be a solution: the “Greenhouse-in-a-Box.” Rather than leaving crops exposed to the increasingly harsh elements, this initiative helps some of India’s 100 million small-hold farmers to shelter what they grow in compact greenhouses, which requires less water and increases yields. The scheme has been so successful that Khetyi’s farmers have reported doubling their incomes – and the start-up is hoping to scale up its initiative in the coming years.\n\nRevive our Oceans: Indigenous Women of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia.\n\nWhat do you get when you combine 60,000 years of indigenous knowledge with digital technologies to protect the land and sea? A worthy recipient of this year’s Earthshot Prize. This program is run by indigenous women sharing their wisdom with the next generation of women rangers, as they develop new conservation approaches by telling stories and collating new data. The insights gained from this collaboration are used to continue to protect one of the most important ecosystems on the planet – the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nBuild a Waste-free World: Notpla, United Kingdom.\n\nAlso on the list was a start-up closer to home for William. Notpla, a London-based start-up, aims to wean the planet off its unhealthy addiction to plastic by wrapping produce in seaweed – a natural and biodegradable material. This year alone, Notpla has made over 1 million takeaway food boxes, and aims to replace more than 100 million plastic containers in Europe in the future.\n\nFix our Climate: 44.01, Oman.\n\nRather than allowing CO2 to clog up our atmosphere and warm our planet, two childhood friends from Oman have developed a technique to turn CO2 into rock, so it can be permanently stored underground. That’s right: CO2 doesn’t have to end up as a greenhouse gas, but can be turned into peridotite – a rock commonly found in Oman and elsewhere across the globe. Their start-up is aiming to turn 1 billion tons of CO2 into rock by 2040.\n\nPHOTOS OF THE WEEK\n\nIt’s been a whirlwind three days for William and Kate. While the stateside trip is not an official royal tour, the pair made time for a jam-packed three-day programme so that they could also learn about Boston, put their spotlight onto initiatives in some of its most hard-pressed communities and meet with local indigenous leaders.

Carolyn Sung/CNN\n\nRoyal fans gush over William and Kate.\n\nThey’ve turned out in droves, from near and far, for the chance to witness a real-life royal sighting. Despite some pretty relentless weather conditions this week, crowds have stood by cordons, patiently waiting in layer upon layer for the moment the senior royals emerged. The sun was finally shining on the final day of the visit as eager royal-watchers took up their positions outside the MGM Music Hall at Fenway on Friday afternoon.\n\nOn this cold but beautiful day, college student Lily Christopher was one of the first here, having traveled to the city for the day from Syracuse, New York. “It’s so inspiring how [William and Kate] do this project and these amazing things. I think that it’s important for the environment that they’re getting this incredible awareness,” she told CNN. “It’s important that the environment is shaped and changed so people of our generation are able to enjoy the earth just like previous ones.”\n\nAs the clock ticked closer to the ceremony, the upbeat crowd – which would sporadically break out into song – continued to grow. Jen and Katie Resmini told CNN they took a vacation day to head down from New Hampshire to be here. “I’ve been following William since I was in high school and I’ve always just loved seeing what they do. Kate’s been a great addition to the family. This is like a once-in-a-lifetime thing – when are we ever going to see a future king and queen again?” Katie added.\n\nDON’T MISS\n\nAn artist's impression of the proposed new Chinese Embassy in London. CBRE\n\nChina is planning an embassy in London on land with a royal past. Residents want King Charles to intervene.\n\nResidents of an apartment complex that sits on a historic parcel of land opposite the Tower of London want Britain’s King Charles to buy it back, claiming that its current owner, China, will turn it into a hub for shadowy diplomatic activity.\n\nThe British monarchy sold Royal Mint Court, a 5.4-acre plot that was once home to the facility that manufactured Britain’s coinage, to a property company in 2010. Beijing bought the site in 2018, and now plans to invest several hundreds of millions of dollars transforming it into its new embassy in the UK.\n\nThe Royal Mint Court Residents’ Association, which represents around 300 people living in the buildings, say they are fearful of how China would interpret and implement such rules once its embassy is built next door. China has been accused of using its diplomatic outposts, loosely affiliated community associations, in effect, as overseas police stations to monitor Chinese citizens abroad and coerce them to return home. British lawmakers have expressed concerns over reports of three such premises in the UK.\n\n“I fear a diplomatic incident will occur because the powers available to the Chinese government are far reaching and excessive,” wrote David Lake, chairman of the residents’ group, in a letter to King Charles, seen by CNN.\n\nThe residents want China and the UK to agree a deal to transfer ownership of the part of the freehold that relates to their buildings. “We feel it is wrong for the Chinese government, as a global superpower, to have the same rights over us as Queen Elizabeth had when she agreed our leases,” wrote Lake in his letter to the monarch.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?\n\nSussexes faced ‘disgusting and very real’ threats, ex-counterterror chief reveals.\n\nMeghan and Prince Harry faced “disgusting and very real” threats from right-wing extremists, a former counterterrorism police chief has said. In an interview with Britain’s Channel 4 News on Tuesday, Neil Basu said the threats against Meghan were serious and credible enough that authorities had assigned teams to investigate them. “If you’d seen the stuff that was written, and you were receiving it … you would feel under threat all of the time,” said Basu, who was in charge of royal protection during his time at the Metropolitan Police. “People have been prosecuted for those threats,” said the former Met assistant commissioner.

Raducanu was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire following her historic exploits on the court, rising from relative obscurity to win the US Open in 2021 without dropping a set in the entire tournament. Her record-breaking run saw her become the first qualifier in history to win a Grand Slam – all before she had even graduated high school. Following the ceremony, she called it a “great honor” in a post on Twitter. The young star sported a chic all-black dress from Dior, for whom she has served as an ambassador since last year.\n\nTennis player Emma Raducanu after she was made a MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) by King Charles III at Windsor Castle on November 29.

Hugo Burnand/Royal Household 2023/AP In pictures: Britain's King Charles III Prev Next\n\nThe moment Elizabeth II died, her eldest child, Charles, automatically became monarch. As sovereign, he has chosen to take the name King Charles III.\n\nAll rights and responsibilities of the Crown now rest with King Charles III.\n\nHe becomes head of state not just in the UK but in 14 other Commonwealth realms including Australia and Canada. He will become head of the 56-member Commonwealth, although that is not a hereditary position, after his succession to the role was agreed by Commonwealth leaders at a meeting in London in 2018.\n\nHe has become head of the British Armed Forces, the judiciary and the civil service, and he is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. He is the Fount of Honour, which means all honors, such as knighthoods, will now be given in his name.\n\nThe United Kingdom does not have a codified constitution, so the role of monarchy is defined by convention rather than law. He has a duty to remain politically impartial, which means he will come under greater scrutiny if he continues to express the views he is known for.\n\nHe has championed alternative medicines and organic farming techniques. In 1984, he hit out at the “glass stumps and concrete towers” of modern architecture. He has spent decades warning of the dangers of climate change. In the so-called “black spider” memos, he raised the issues he was concerned about directly with ministers.\n\nIn a BBC documentary to mark his 70th birthday, Charles acknowledged having ruffled feathers with his past interventions. But he promised not to meddle in controversial affairs once sovereign, saying he would operate within “the constitutional parameters.”\n\nElizabeth stayed “above politics” and never expressed herself in any way on any issue and as a result she rarely divided opinion. She managed to retain popular support and cross-party support in parliament, which was the one body with the power to dethrone her.\n\nWe will never know what she discussed in her regular audiences with her prime ministers, beginning with Churchill, but Charles is a more outspoken character. Will he go quiet on policy matters in public but continue to lobby in private? Will the prime minister act on it?\n\nThe prime ministerial audiences are one of several constitutional duties to which King Charles III will be expected to step up and they will bring him in regular contact with policymakers. He appoints the prime minister, opens parliamentary sessions, approves legislation and official appointments, receives the credentials of foreign ambassadors and hosts world leaders on state visits.\n\nCharles has also adopted the symbolic position as Head of Nation, meaning he becomes the symbol of national identity, unity, and pride. He represents continuity and celebrates excellence on behalf of the country. That’s why we see the monarch opening national events and leading commemorations.\n\nPeople would look to Elizabeth in times of crisis, but will they rally around King Charles III in the same way? He is more divisive not just because of his honest views but also because of the bad taste still left from his acrimonious divorce from his immensely popular first wife, Diana.\n\nAll the official royal residences including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle will now be under his control. There are also other residences such as Balmoral in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk which the Queen owned privately – and the nation will have to see to whom she leaves them in her will.\n\nEither way, Charles’ wealth has ballooned. By far the biggest slice of the family’s fortune, the £16.5 billion ($19 billion) Crown Estate, now belongs to him as reigning monarch. But under an arrangement dating back to 1760, the monarch hands over all profits from the estate to the government in return for a slice, called the Sovereign Grant.\n\nThe estate includes vast swathes of central London property and the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It has the status of a corporation and is managed by a chief executive and commissioners — or non-executive directors — appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the prime minister.\n\nThe grant, which covers the cost of his official duties and amounted to £86.3 million ($99.2 million) for the 2021/2022 financial year. He will take charge of the Royal Collection, which includes one of the most valuable art collections in the world. He also picks up the Duchy of Lancaster, a private estate dating back to 1265, which was valued at about £653 million ($764 million) according to its most recent accounts. Income from its investments cover official costs not met by the Sovereign Grant, and helps support other Royal family members.\n\nKing Charles III has become one of the richest men in England overnight.\n\nCamilla\n\nCharles and Camilla attend the Order of the Garter Service at St George's Chapel on June 13, 2022 in Windsor, England. Toby Melville/Getty Images\n\nFor years, the big question around Charles’ wife surrounded her title. At the time their wedding was announced in February 2005, the official statement said: “It is intended that Mrs Parker Bowles should use the title HRH The Princess Consort when The Prince of Wales accedes to The Throne.” That was a very clear signal that Camilla would not use the title of Queen. Her office at Clarence House distanced itself from that statement in the intervening years, however, saying it was a matter for the reigning monarch.\n\nThen, in February 2022, the Queen expressed her desire for her daughter-in-law to be known as Queen Consort when Charles became King in a message marking the start of her platinum jubilee year – a statement that appeared to resolve the issue for good.\n\nThe Queen’s wishes were welcomed by the couple themselves. That same weekend, a statement released by a spokesperson said they had been “touched and honoured by Her Majesty’s words.”\n\nWhere will the couple live? Well, traditionally the new monarch would move into Buckingham Palace but in 2011, the BBC reported that Charles was considering moving his entire court to Windsor and turning Buckingham Palace into an events center. That would be a dramatic and controversial shift but might also assert King Charles III as the new boss.\n\nWilliam and Catherine\n\nWilliam and Catherine are pictured with their children, George, Charlotte and Louis, and the Queen, Charles and Camilla at Buckingham Palace during platinum jubilee celebrations on June 5, 2022. Toby Hancock/CNN\n\nUp until now, Charles has been responsible for covering the costs of his heir, Prince William.\n\nWilliam has now inherited his father’s titles of The Duke of Cornwall, which comes with an estate which last year delivered an income of £23 million ($26 million). That money now goes straight to William and he becomes independently wealthy.\n\nHis new title is HRH The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge and tradition dictates that, as first in line to the throne, he also becomes Prince of Wales. And Catherine becomes Her Royal Highness, The Princess of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge.\n\nWilliam and Catherine will be able to solidify their own independent court, which is currently based at Kensington Palace in west London, in an apartment that was refurbished shortly after their marriage. It seems unlikely that William would want to move, so the King’s former residences, including Clarence House and Birkhall in the Scottish Highlands, will likely remain vacant until Charles offers them to other members of the family, or finds an alternative use. The family resides at Adelaide Cottage in Windsor during school term time.\n\nPrince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis will follow their parents’ titling. They are now Their Royal Highnesses Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis of Cornwall and Cambridge. Colloquially they are likely to be known as George, Charlotte and Louis Wales.\n\nHarry and Meghan\n\nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry react as they attend the annual One Young World Summit in Manchester, north-west England on September 5, 2022. Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt’s unlikely that Charles’ second son, Harry, will be offered a royal office unless he and wife Meghan return to their royal duties, and the King would also need to confirm that they can continue to use Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate, which is part of the royal estate. They currently live with son Archie and daughter Lilibet in California but were allowed to continue using Frogmore as their official residence during the Queen’s reign.\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan announced in early 2020 that they were stepping back from royal duties, they said they would “work to become financially independent.” The terms of the split stipulated that while the pair would always remain part of the family, they would no longer use their HRH titles.\n\nAs grandchildren of the monarch, Archie now automatically becomes Prince Archie of Sussex while Lilibet will be Princess Lilibet of Sussex. Whether they use those titles will only become known the first time their parents refer to them publicly.\n\nPrince Andrew and other family members\n\nKing Charles III also becomes responsible for distributing roles, responsibilities and resources to other members of the royal family.\n\nCharles has never been close to his brother Andrew, who stepped back from royal duties over his links to the late disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In January 2022 he was stripped of his HRH title, as well as others associated with the military and charity roles. That raises the question of whether the new King continues to allow Andrew to use his Buckingham Palace apartment and offers financial support.\n\nThen there are his other siblings, Princess Anne and Prince Edward, and more distant relatives such as the Gloucesters and Kents who retain royal residences at Kensington.\n\nPrincess Anne attends a service at St Giles' Cathedral on June 30, 2022 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nCharles will need to decide how much family support he needs to carry out his duties and who he wants to offer it. Then he can reveal what support he offers in return. Many of these decisions would already have been taken and the first telling signs of where his loyalties lie will be seen in who gets to keep which residences and especially who gets an upgrade.\n\nAnne and Edward, and his wife Sophie, The Countess of Wessex, are expected to continue with their public duties following decades of dedicated service but the new King needs to balance that against pressure for a slimmed down monarchy in austere times.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/uk/what-happens-after-queen-dies-intl/index.html", "title": "What happens after the Queen dies: The funeral and other ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nWith the death of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II, every detail of the next fortnight has been planned and rehearsed to the finest detail – and was even signed off by the monarch herself.\n\nThere have been regular meetings for decades between the many agencies involved, from central and local government departments to military and religious authorities and representatives of the other 14 countries where she was also head of state.\n\nThe Union Flag will be lowered on public buildings across the United Kingdom.

Whitby/Getty Images In pictures: Britain's King Charles III Prev Next\n\nGun salutes and title changes\n\nOne of the first formalities to take place will be a meeting of the Accession Council in an ancient ceremony at the 500-year-old St James’s Palace in London. It comes in two parts. In the first part, the sovereign’s death is formally announced, and the new sovereign is proclaimed. This is a closed meeting but attended by hundreds of dignitaries and members of the Privy Council, which is a panel of royal advisors.\n\nThe Garter King of Arms will read the Proclamation from the palace balcony and gun salutes will echo across the capital. There will be follow-up proclamations at the Royal Exchange in the financial district and in the capitals of the nations – Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. Flags will return to full staff whilst the proclamations are made.\n\nThe second part of the Accession Council is attended by the King and other senior royals. For the first time in history, we will get to see this centuries-old ritual because it will be broadcast live.\n\nPrince William is now first in line to the throne and has inherited the title of Duke of Cornwall from his father and the income that comes from it. He’s now independently wealthy and his wife, Kate, has taken the title of Duchess of Cornwall, replacing Camilla who technically becomes Queen. The world will then watch as King Charles III takes a series of oaths and swears allegiance to the Church of Scotland.\n\nBooks of condolence will then open at St James’s Palace and at other venues. Following the Accession Council, he will return to Buckingham Palace for meetings with senior politicians and church leaders before retiring.\n\nIn the 24 hours after the Queen’s death is announced, there will be gun salutes across London – one round for every year of Elizabeth’s life – and a broadcast by the new King will be played out. A service will be held at St Paul’s Cathedral in the coming days, which won’t be attended by the royal family. It’s a moment for the public to remember their Queen. Expect local services to pop up across the country. The Queen was Supreme Governor of the Church of England.\n\nOver the coming days, the bells of Westminster Abbey, St Pauls and Windsor Castle will toll.\n\nFuneral arrangements\n\nAs monarch, Queen Elizabeth is automatically granted a publicly funded state funeral, and details will be released in the coming days. The Queen died at Balmoral Castle, her residence in Scotland, so over the coming days arrangements will be made for her to be transported back to England.\n\nElizabeth may have approved her own funeral plans, but they can only be signed off by the sitting monarch. King Charles III will perform that duty in a meeting with the Earl Marshal who overseas ceremonial events. We can assume he will give his go-ahead as he has already seen the plans and may have made adjustments as part of the planning process.\n\nThe last order of business on the day of death was expected to be a meeting of the Lord Chamberlain’s Committee, which is responsible for the running of the Royal Household, to make sure everything is in place for the next two weeks, including the state funeral in Westminster and interment in Windsor.\n\nPast monarchs have lain in state in Westminster Hall, the oldest part of the Palace of Westminster, which houses the UK parliament. Their coffin resting on a raised platform in the middle of the hall and guarded around the clock by units from the Sovereign’s Bodyguard, Foot Guards or the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment.\n\nBritish royal family members who hold high military rank, the consort of the sovereign, and the heir to the throne are normally granted ceremonial royal funerals instead.\n\nPrince Philip, the Queen’s husband of more than 70 years and the longest-serving British consort in history, was given a royal ceremonial funeral at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, west of London, in April 2021. Coronavirus pandemic restrictions meant the congregation was limited to 30 close family members and friends.\n\nPhilip was also intimately involved in planning his own funeral service, making sure the ceremony reflected his military affiliations and personal interests. Millions of people watched the televised funeral procession and service from home but crowds were discouraged from gathering at Windsor or other royal residences.\n\nAll other members of the royal family, their children and their spouses are usually granted a private royal ceremony.", "authors": ["Max Foster Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Max Foster", "Lauren Said-Moorhouse"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/956846/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-24-may-2022", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 24 May 2022 | The Week UK", "text": "WFH ‘preserve of the wealthy’\n\nWorking from home is the “preserve of the middle-aged and wealthy”, said The Telegraph, after the Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that “high earners are more likely to hybrid work” and that “hybrid and homeworking increased by income bracket”.

The Prime Minister of Jamaica told the couple in public that his country would be “moving on.” Prince William later conceded that foreign tours were an “opportunity to reflect.”\n\nA follow-up visit to the region by the Earl and Countess of Wessex then had to be rearranged to avoid Grenada, where there have been calls for the UK to pay reparations for slavery. There were concerns in the government that the issue could overshadow the visit.\n\nA visit to Canada by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall last month was less contentious – while there is a republican movement there, it isn’t rooted to the same extent in issues of slavery and race.\n\nThe heir to the throne may be under more scrutiny in Africa next week, when he attends the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in the Rwandan capital, Kigali. While the Queen is the head of the Commonwealth, the role is purely ceremonial and the UK has no more power within the grouping than any other country.\n\nCharles will represent her, which will help prepare everyone for the time when he takes over as head. The question that inevitably surfaces is whether he will be as effective as his mother, but he’s no doubt used to that. The more profound question that comes up is whether, with its origins in the British Empire, the Commonwealth is still relevant.\n\nThe Queen and Prince Charles at the last Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London in 2018. Yui Mok/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe location of the 2022 meeting may provide one argument in favor of the organization. The host, Rwanda, only joined the group in 2009 and has no historical ties to the UK. In fact, this will be the first time a member of the royal family has set foot in the country.\n\n“My wife and I much look forward to meeting Commonwealth leaders and, for the first time, being able to visit Rwanda,” Charles said ahead of the visit. “Over the years, I have learned a great deal from the ideas, concerns and aspirations which people across the Commonwealth have so generously shared.”\n\nThere will be other engagements built around the main event. Charles will visit a college and a wildlife sanctuary, and attend summits on sustainable business and tropical disease. Camilla will go to a library and later give a speech on violence against women and girls. Together they will lay a wreath at the Genocide Memorial and meet both survivors and perpetrators of the 1994 massacre of Tutsis.\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will also be attending “CHOGM,” as the meeting is known. He won’t be able to avoid questions on his asylum policy, following a storm back home. He has tried and failed – so far – to get legal clearance to fly people seeking asylum in Britain to Rwanda for processing, with successful applicants granted asylum there instead. Charles reportedly described the plan as “appalling.” Photographers will be looking for any signs of tension between the two, though the prince will be keen to avoid any accusations of political interference.\n\nFor the inside track on the Rwanda tour, look no further than this newsletter. We will be traveling with Charles and Camilla to and from Kigali. See you back here next week…\n\nWHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING?\n\nThe Queen hits another milestone!\n\nThere were no bells and whistles this time round but Queen Elizabeth II quietly broke yet another record in the past week. On Sunday, she officially became the second longest-serving monarch in world history. The Queen overtook Thailand’s King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died aged 88, having achieved 70 years and 126 days on the throne between 1946 and 2016. In case you’re wondering, the record for longest-ever reign belongs to Louis XIV of France. He ruled for 72 years, 110 days, from 14 May 1643 to 1 September 1715.\n\nThe Queen smiles during a Platinum Jubilee appearance in early June. Chris Jackson/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWilliam and Kate attend Grenfell memorial service.\n\nThe Cambridges paid their respects to bereaved relatives and survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire on Tuesday – exactly five years to the day after the tragedy. The pair chatted with attendees before taking a seat for the multi-faith service at the foot of the building. They joined the congregation in a 72-second silence in memory of the 72 victims who perished in the fire that tore through the west London high-rise. Following the memorial service, the couple laid a wreath in honor of the victims. Back in 2017, William accompanied his grandmother to the site to meet members of the community affected by the blaze.\n\nThe Cambridges mark the fifth anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire on June 14 in London, England. Peter Nicholls/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nDON’T MISS\n\nAhead of Prince Charles’ visit to Rwanda, two daughters have written a plea to the heir to the British throne for CNN. Carine and Anaïse Kanimba are the adopted daughters of Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager who inspired the film “Hotel Rwanda.” He was convicted of terrorism-related charges and sentenced to 25 years in prison last September, in what his supporters said was a politically motivated show trial. The US State Department said last month that Rusesabagina had been “wrongfully detained.” In an op-ed for CNN, his daughters are asking the visiting royal “not to remain silent” and “to not shake the hand of the tyrant who is holding our father as a political prisoner.”\n\nRead their message for Prince Charles here.\n\nROYAL TEA BREAK\n\nMost of us have read the tales of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. At the very least you’ve probably seen the 1963 Disney classic “The Sword in the Stone.” Well, it turns out the Arthurian legend has even had a few blue-blooded fans over the centuries. In fact, King Edward III was so taken with it that nearly 700 years ago he created his own group of chivalrous knights – the Order of the Garter.\n\nNow, this elite institution still exists, and every June it gathers for the annual Garter Day procession at Windsor, after which new members are welcomed into the fold, a lunch is put on and then it’s over to St. George’s Chapel for a service. The event is pretty spectacular, as traditionally the Queen and the knights – who are now both male and female – don fabulously grand velvet robes with plumed hats for the parade. Members of the order – 24 in total, as well as certain royal family members – are personally chosen by the sovereign, in recognition of an individual’s service to the nation through public office or to the monarch personally.\n\nThe Duchess of Cornwall was installed in the Order of the Garter this year. Matt Dunham/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nThis year’s event caused a bit of a stir as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair was invested as a member of the Order of the Garter, becoming “Sir Tony.” Beyond the castle’s walls, Stop the War activists and members of the Free Assange movement protested the former leader’s appointment to the country’s most senior order of chivalry, chanting “war criminal” and holding placards. Separately, there was some royal drama after it was revealed Prince Andrew had been blocked from attending parts of the day. A royal source told CNN Monday that the embattled royal would only be going to the private events and would not be seen in public, in what was understood to be a “family decision.”\n\nMax went deeper into Britain’s oldest and most senior order of chivalry over on TikTok:\n\nPHOTO OF THE WEEK\n\nChris Jackson/Chris Jackson\n\nPrince Charles peeks at the ponies as he and Camilla – along with several other members of the royal family – enjoyed a day at the races for Royal Ascot 2022. Sadly, the Queen wasn’t in attendance, due to her mobility problems, and was probably watching from the comfort of her Windsor home down the road, especially as she had a couple of horses running on Gold Cup day. Both ended up coming second in their races but the events would have still delighted the monarch, according to her racing manager, John Warren.\n\nHe told Britain’s PA Media news agency that he was “disappointed for Her Majesty” but “she gets it.” He explained that horses are “her passion, and the Queen would have absorbed everything that was there to be seen. She is so engaged in it that it is nice to know that she is probably seeing more than we do!”\n\n“If we come together to raise the importance of early childhood development, we’ll soon see that healthy, happy individuals make for a healthier, happier world. Which is why every second we spend with a child, is an investment in our collective future.” The Duchess of Cambridge\n\nKate, who founded the Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood last year, made the remarks as the organization unveiled new research into public perceptions of early childhood development on Thursday. One of the findings revealed that while nine in 10 agree on the importance of early years in shaping a person’s future, less than a fifth recognize the “unique” importance of the period between 0 and 5. Alongside the new research, the duchess hosted a roundtable discussion with representatives from the early years sector, including the UK Secretary of State for Health Sajid Javid and Minister for Families Will Quince.\n\nONE LAST THING…\n\nHeads up, Royal News squad: As we mentioned up top, we’re traveling with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall to Kigali next week, which is jam-packed with events all the way through to Friday evening local time. As a result, it’s possible the newsletter may go out a little later next week, to ensure we haven’t missed anything.

In 2008, the British Ministry of Defense announced that Harry had secretly been serving in Afghanistan with his Army unit on a four-month mission since December 2007.\n\nHe was quickly withdrawn for security reasons, but later returned as an Apache helicopter pilot in 2012. In 2015, after nearly a decade of service, he announced he was leaving the armed forces.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex is also the founder of the Invictus Games, an international sporting competition for injured servicemen and women. The first games were held in London in 2014.\n\nMore key relatives: Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, whom he married in 2018.

Baby Lili’s middle name, Diana, “was chosen to honor her beloved late grandmother, The Princess of Wales,” the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced in a statement.\n\nSeventh in line to the throne, the Queen’s 11th great-grandchild is the most senior royal in the line of succession to have been born overseas.\n\nPrince Andrew, Duke of York\n\nPrince Andrew is seen in August 2017.

Queen Elizabeth II's many descendants just can't help but make news.\n\nThis year, 2019, was no different, with highs and lows in the fortunes of the Windsors occupying the news feeds of fans around the globe.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising royal story of the year was the saga of the Sussexes: How did a royal marriage that started out on a super-high in 2018 come to tears in 2019?\n\nA year nearly to the day after Prince Harry married Meghan Markle –outspoken, biracial, American-born, divorced, a former actress – in a blaze of royal splendor and joy, she gave birth to Archie, the first baby of part African descent in the family.\n\nHow is the royal family adjusting to Meghan? How is she adjusting to them? As we learned this year, it's complicated.\n\nHere, in chronological order, are the top royal stories of 2019:\n\nJan. 17: Prince Philip's royal car wreck\n\nPhilip, the queen's retired husband, was driving alone onto a highway near the royal Sandringham estate in Norfolk when he collided with another car in a violent wreck. He said he couldn't see because the sun was in his eyes.\n\nThe then-97-year-old Duke of Edinburgh escaped injury, although his Land Rover was totaled. A passenger in the other car was treated for a broken wrist, and a 9-month-old baby in the car was uninjured.\n\nAside from relief that he was pulled unscathed from such a mangled vehicle, there was widespread shock that the nonagenarian was still driving himself – and sometimes without security.\n\nBut maybe it shouldn't have been a surprise: Since his youth, Philip, now 98, collected race cars and loved to drive them – very fast, according to the often alarmed queen. A man who prizes his few opportunities for independence from royal restraints, he would not be happy giving up his car keys.\n\nNevertheless, Philip voluntarily surrendered his driving license a few weeks after the wreck.\n\nApril 23: Prince Louis of Cambridge turns 1\n\nThe baby of the Cambridge family, Prince Louis, turned 1 on April 23. He is just as cute as big brother Prince George, 6, and sister Princess Charlotte, 4.\n\nHe also seems to be a very happy baby, judging from the few photos we've seen. A recent favorite: Louis, toddling down a garden path at the Chelsea Flower Show, dressed in red-striped short pants, blue sweater, blue socks and blue leather baby shoes and carrying a big stick.\n\nHis parents, Prince William and Duchess Kate of Cambridge, released three new pictures for his birthday, as has been their custom, and all show him with huge smiles.\n\nMaybe it's because it's his amateur photographer mum behind the camera.\n\nMay 6: Royal baby Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor is born\n\nPrince Harry and Duchess Meghan of Sussex's much anticipated royal baby was born amid confusion and mystery: The privacy-seeking couple did not release his place of birth or the circumstances, and palace plans to inform the media of timing went awry.\n\nLater, we learned he was born at 5:26 a.m. local time in an American-owned London hospital to which she was rushed from Windsor in the middle of the night.\n\nHours after the birth, Harry went before cameras at the Windsor Castle stables to declare his over-the-moon joy at being a dad. Two days later, the trio appeared together at the castle to announce his nontraditional name (no title but with his great-grandfather's surname added to Windsor).\n\nThey also released a picture on their @SussexRoyal Instagram page with the queen, Prince Philip and Meghan's mom, Doria Ragland, looking delighted with the baby.\n\nJune 3: The Trumps' state visit to Britain\n\nPresident Donald Trump got his heart's desire – a three-day \"state visit\" featuring most of the royal bells and whistles and hosted by Queen Elizabeth II. He and first lady Melania Trump (plus a clutch of other Trumps) arrived at Buckingham Palace on June 3 to be treated to the kind of royal pomp-and-ceremony the British are so good at staging.\n\nThey met top royals like Prince William and Duchess Kate of Cambridge and Prince Harry (but not Harry's American wife, new mom Meghan, or the queen's husband, Prince Philip).\n\nThere was a lavish white-tie state banquet at the palace and a reciprocal dinner for the royals at the U.S. ambassador's residence. The Trumps visited Westminster Abbey, had tea with Charles and his wife, Duchess Camilla, at Clarence House, met with Britain's political leaders and took part in ceremonies commemorating the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nExcept for social media sneering at Trump's \"ill-fitting\" white-tie ensemble, there were no major protocol faux pas.\n\nJuly-November: The woes of Prince Andrew, Duke of York\n\nThe queen's beloved second son's friendship with American financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein embarrassed the royal family and damaged Andrew's reputation starting in 2011.\n\nIn 2015, one of Epstein's self-described \"teen sex slaves,\" Virginia Roberts Giuffre, alleged in court documents that she was forced by Epstein to have sex with Andrew and others among his powerful friends, allegations Andrew and the palace emphatically denied.\n\nIt all came rushing back into headlines in July when Epstein was arrested and charged with new sex crimes and pictures of Andrew with Epstein and with Giuffre surfaced again on social media. In August, Epstein was found dead in his cell in federal custody.\n\nWith federal authorities promising to pursue Epstein's associates and Giuffre continuing to publicly denounce Andrew, saying he should \"go to jail,\" Andrew decided to sit for a BBC interview, hoping to contain the damage to his image and that of the royal family.\n\nThe sit-down was poorly received, and on Nov. 20, four days after the BBC interview aired, he announced his withdrawal from royal duties and the end of his royal patronages and charity work \"for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nAugust-November: The media troubles of Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan\n\nThe tabloid backlash against Harry and Meghan began building earlier in the year: She was said to be too bossy, too American, too mean to sister-in-law Kate, with whom she was said to be \"feuding.\" Then the story shifted: The \"feud\" was actually between Harry and brother Will.\n\nAfter the birth of Archie the carping grew louder: In August, Harry and Meghan were branded \"eco-hypocrites\" for using private jets for getaways while lecturing about climate change. Their friends, including celebrities such as Elton John, rushed to defend them; tabloid columnists rushed to mock them.\n\nThen, in October, at the end of their 10-day tour of southern Africa, the couple announced they were suing three tabloids for copyright infringement, invasion of privacy and phone hacking.\n\nTheir declaration of war on the tabloids, relatively rare for royals, stunned the media and distracted from the overall success of the tour, during which Archie adorably made his public debut.\n\nAfter their return, interviews they did with ITV aired in a documentary film in which they lamented their \"struggle\" living with \"relentless\" and \"malicious\" media scrutiny, some of which they believe are anti-American and verging on racist.\n\nMeghan appeared to be holding back tears as she talked about the effect of the pressure on her mental and physical health as a new mother. \"Not many people have asked if I'm OK, but it's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes,\" she said.\n\nOn Nov. 13, the couple announced they would spend Christmas with her mother, Doria Ragland, and not at Sandringham for the traditional royal family holiday. Their plans are part of their desire to take a six-week family-time break from royal duties, possibly spending at least part of it in the U.S.\n\nThe news was greeted with incredulity by many tabloid columnists – a \"snub\" to the queen, they brayed – even though the palace insisted the queen approved of their Christmas plans. Besides, Will and Kate spent at least two Christmas holidays with Kate's family away from Sandringham in the early years of their marriage.\n\nSo if Harry and Meghan just want to get away from all the negativity during the holidays, who can blame them?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/06"}]}
